5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rate</b> (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years {{there has been}} a surge of {{interest}} in paleolimnology and as a result a large accumulation of lake sedimentation records. This emerging archive has allowed us to develop empirical models to describe which variables explain significant variation in <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> over the past ∼ 150 years across large spatial scales. We hypothesized that latitude would be a significant explanatory variable of profundal zone lake <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> across a temperate to polar gradient. We further hypothesized that along a more longitudinally-constrained dataset (i. e. east coast of North America), latitude would explain a greater proportion of the variance. To test these hypotheses, we collated data from 125 natural, average-sized lakes (with surface area 3 ̆c 500 km 2) by recording authors’ estimates of <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> (measured as mm/year) or by digitizing recent sediment profiles and calculating <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> over the past ∼ 150 years. We found that, at both scales, latitude was the strongest predictor of lake <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> (full dataset: r 2 = 0. 28, P = 0. 001, n = 125; east coast dataset: r 2 = 0. 58, P 3 ̆c 0. 001, n = 43).

5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rate,</b> anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated creatinine and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rate</b> (ESR) results; none are specific for Henoch–Schönlein purpura. The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the purpura, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} time taken for the {{extinction}} to occur is a controversial issue, because some theories about the extinction's causes require a rapid extinction over {{a relatively short period}} (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others require longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the Signor–Lipps effect; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found. Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before the K–Pg extinction to a few million years after it. The <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rate</b> and thickness of K-Pg clay from three sites suggest short duration of event, perhaps less than ten thousand years.|$|E
40|$|Sedimentation near mid-ocean ridges {{may differ}} from pelagic {{sedimentation}} due {{to the influence of}} the ridges' rough topography on sediment deposition and transport. This study explores whether the near-ridge environment responds to glacial-interglacial changes in climate and oceanography. New benthic d 18 O, radiocarbon, multi-sensor track, and physical property (<b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates,</b> density, magnetic susceptibility) data for seven cores on the Juan de Fuca Ridge provide multiple records covering the past 700, 000 years of oceanographic history of the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Systematic variations in sediment density and coarse fraction correspond to glacial-interglacial cycles identified in benthic d 18 O, and these observations may provide a framework for mapping the d 18 O chronostratigraphy via sediment density to other locations on the Juan de Fuca Ridge and beyond. <b>Sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> generally range from 0. 5 to 3 cm/kyr, with background pelagic <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> close to 1 cm/kyr. Variability in <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> close to the ridge likely reflects remobilization of sediment caused by the high relief of the ridge bathymetry.

5|$|Bacteria do {{not have}} a membrane-bound nucleus, and their genetic {{material}} is typically a single circular bacterial chromosome of DNA located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid. The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes, often grouped in chains called polyribosomes, for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea. Bacterial ribosomes have a <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rate</b> of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S. Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host.|$|E

25|$|The above {{approach}} can be performed at many sections containing the PETM. This {{has led to an}} intriguing result.

The first, between ca. 10, 000 and 6500 Cal BP, still in the transgressive phase, yields values of <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> of 5 mm/yr. The second phase extends after the maximum transgressive (ca. 6500 Cal BP) until the present, with <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> of 1. 5 – 2 mm/yr.

40|$|New biostratigraphic, isotopic, {{and well}} log data from {{exploration}} wells {{on the outer}} continental shelf and uppermost Amazon deep-sea fan, Brazil, reveal that the Amazon River was initiated as a transcontinental river between 11. 8 and 11. 3 Ma ago (middle to late Miocene), and reached its present shape and size during the late Pliocene. Prior to the late Miocene the continental shelf was a carbonate platform that received moderate siliciclastic sediment supply from the Proterozoic basement in eastern Amazonia. Average <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> on the Amazon Fan show three stages of development: (1) 11. 8 - 6. 8 Ma ago, low <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> (0. 05 m/ka) prevailed on the fan, because the Amazon River was not yet entrenched and some sediments were partially trapped in continental basins; (2) 6. 8 - 2. 4 Ma ago, <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> (0. 3 m/ka) increased, the river entrenched, and deposition fully migrated onto the Amazon Fan; (3) 2. 4 Ma ago to the present, very high <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> (1. 22 m/ka, with peaks of 11 m/ka) prevailed on the fan and the modern Amazon River developed.

40|$|Sedimentation of {{engineered}} nanoparticles (ENPs) {{has been}} studied mainly in artificial media and stagnant systems mimicking natural waters. This neglects the role of turbulence and heteroaggregation with sediment. We studied the apparent <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> of selected ENPs (CeO 2, PVP-Ag and SiO 2 -Ag) in agitated sediment-water systems resembling fresh, estuarine and marine waters. Experiments were designed to mimic low energy and periodically resuspended sediment water systems (14 days), followed by a long term aging, resuspension and settling phase (6 months), as would occur in receiving shallow lakes. ENPs in systems with periodical resuspension of sediment were removed with <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> between 0. 14 and 0. 50 ¿m/d. The <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> did not vary much among ENP type, salinity and aging time, which is attributed to the capture of ENPs in sediment flocks. The <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those reported for aggregation-sedimentation in stagnant systems without suspended sediment. Heteroaggregation rates were estimated and ranged between 0. 151 and 0. 547 L/mg/d, which is up to 29 times higher than those reported for natural colloids under quiescent settling conditions.

40|$|Studies about {{natural and}} {{artificial}} radionuclides {{in areas such}} as the Antarctic are key to understand natural and dynamic processes in marine environments. These studies are important to determine levels of radioactive elements and local <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates.</b> Five marine sediment cores were collected in different points of Admiralty Bay, in the Antarctic Peninsula. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine 137 Cs, 226 Ra and 210 Pb and <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> at each site. 137 Cs, 210 Pb and 226 Ra were assayed by gamma-counting through direct measurement of the peak at 661 keV, 47 keV and 609 keV, respectively. <b>Sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> were obtained by 137 Cs and 210 Pb (CIC and CRS). The activities for 137 Cs ranged from 0. 84 to 7. 09 Bq kg- 1; to 226 Ra from 6. 77 to 31. 07 Bq kg- 1 and for 210 Pb ranged from 1. 10 to 36. 90 Bq kg- 1. The <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> obtained by the three models ranged from 0. 11 ± 0. 01 cm y- 1 to 0. 46 ± 0. 05 cm y- 1.
