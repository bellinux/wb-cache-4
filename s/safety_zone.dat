5|$|On {{the night}} of August 8, 2009, the US Coast Guard {{maintained}} a two-mile <b>safety</b> <b>zone</b> from the Holland Tunnel to the Lincoln Tunnel, requiring vessels to move slowly and stay within 400yards of the Manhattan side while passing through the area. The <b>safety</b> <b>zone</b> was maintained by the Coast Guard cutter Penobscot Bay.|$|E
5|$|Most of the three-mile (5km) {{stretch of}} river that had {{previously}} been closed was reopened without restriction, although a patrol remained in place to enforce a <b>safety</b> <b>zone.</b> The river restrictions delayed one outgoing vessel and two incoming ones. There was also a minor oil spill originating from equipment at the refinery's unoccupied and rarely used dock.|$|E
5|$|But {{during this}} period Japan's Navy Air Service was {{launching}} frequent air raids on the city, eventually totaling 50 raids according to the Navy's own records. The Navy Air Service had struck Nanking {{for the first time}} on August 15, and after winning air supremacy over the city on September 19 it began bombing the city night and day with impunity, hitting both military and civilian targets. In the face of Japanese bombs and the ongoing advance of the Japanese Army, the large majority of Nanking's citizens fled the city. By early December Nanking's population had dropped from its former total of more than one million to less than 500,000, a figure which included Chinese refugees from rural villages burned down by their own government's scorched earth policies. Most of those still in the city were very poor and had nowhere else to go. Foreign residents of Nanking were also repeatedly asked to leave the city which was becoming more and more chaotic under the strain of bombings, fires, looting by criminals, and electrical outages, but those few foreigners brave enough to stay behind strived to find a way to help the Chinese civilians who had been unable to leave. In late-November a group of them led by German citizen John Rabe established the Nanking <b>Safety</b> <b>Zone</b> in the center of the city, a self-proclaimed demilitarized zone where civilian refugees could congregate in order to hopefully escape the fighting. The <b>safety</b> <b>zone</b> was recognized by the Chinese government, and on December 8 Tang Shengzhi demanded that all civilians evacuate there.|$|E

5|$|The season {{chosen for}} leaving Pannonia was unusually early; the Germanic peoples {{generally}} waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves {{time to do}} the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a <b>safety</b> <b>zone</b> between the Lombards and the Avars.|$|E

25|$|Around this time, the Committee {{became aware}} that the Perth City Council was {{considering}} the erection of a <b>safety</b> <b>zone</b> for pedestrians {{in the middle of}} Kings Park Circus. This was to be a raised circular platform surrounded by pylons. A number of suggestions had been made for a centrepiece for the <b>safety</b> <b>zone,</b> including relocating the Perth Observatory clock there, or using the site for the Lord Forrest Memorial or the State War Memorial. In December 1932, the Edith Cowan Memorial Committee requested the Council's permission to locate a monument there, and this was approved. Prominent Perth architect Harold Boas and City Engineer Henry Atwell then began work on a design for the monument. Their design was approved by the Edith Cowan Memorial Committee in February 1933, and a sketch of the design was published in The West Australian.|$|E

50|$|Protection {{of human}} life is first {{priority}} for firefighters. Since 1995, when arriving on a scene, a fire crew will establish <b>safety</b> <b>zones</b> and escape routes, verify communication is in place, and designate lookouts (known in the U.S. by the acronym LCES, for lookouts, communications, escape routes, <b>safety</b> <b>zones).</b> This allows the firefighters to engage a fire with options for a retreat should their current situation become unsafe. Although other <b>safety</b> <b>zones</b> should be designated, areas already burned generally provide a safe refuge from fire provided they have cooled sufficiently, are accessible, and have burned enough fuels so as to not reignite. Briefings may be done to inform new fire resources of hazards and other pertinent information.|$|R
25|$|The common revisionist viewpoint, made by denialists such as Higashinakano Shudo is {{that the}} {{geographical}} area of the incident {{should be limited to}} the few square kilometers of the city known as the Nanjing <b>Safety</b> <b>Zone,</b> typically estimated to be about 200,000-250,000. However, this geographic definition is almost universally unheard of outside of revisionist circles.|$|E
25|$|The {{proximity}} {{of the church to}} the end of the runway of London Southend Airport historically created difficulties for the airport operation and plans to expand the capacity of the airport, causing the airport operator to put forward several proposals, including complete demolition of the church or moving it to a new location away from the airport's <b>safety</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{duration}} of the incident is naturally defined by its geography: the earlier the Japanese entered the area, the longer the duration. The Battle of Nanking ended on December 13, when the divisions of the Japanese Army entered the walled city of Nanking. The Tokyo War Crime Tribunal defined {{the period of the}} massacre to the ensuing six weeks. More conservative estimates say the massacre started on December 14, when the troops entered the <b>Safety</b> <b>Zone,</b> and that it lasted for six weeks.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} month, a group calling itself the National Liberation Army (NLA) claimed {{responsibility}} for the attacks against the police. Initial reports gave conflicting information about the NLA. Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski claimed that the rebels were primarily Kosovo Liberation Army (UÇK) members who had infiltrated the country from Kosovo. Macedonian officials accused NATO of not doing enough to disarm the Albanian insurgents, discouraging their encampment in the buffer zone (Ground <b>Safety</b> <b>Zone)</b> area between Kosovo and Serbia, or preventing their entry into Macedonia.|$|E
25|$|As {{recently}} as 1992, several alternate sites for Wellington Airport were considered – Te Horo, Paraparaumu, Mana Island, Ohariu Valley, Horokiwi, Wairarapa and Pencarrow. – but {{a decision was}} made to upgrade the existing site at Rongotai. A major new terminal was completed in 1999 and integrated with the international terminal, which had been built as an abortive first stage of a whole new terminal in 1977. A 90 m <b>safety</b> <b>zone</b> {{at the south end of}} the runway was constructed in order to comply with ICAO safety regulations, while a similar zone has been put in place at the runway's north end.|$|E
40|$|White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are overabundant in many areas, {{particularly}} in more developed landscapes where refuges may provide additional challenges for deer managers. Refuges {{have been widely}} used to sustain breeding stock in harvested populations and to mitigate other sources of mortality. As the landscape becomes more urbanized, local municipalities and states have implemented <b>safety</b> <b>zones</b> to reduce the probability of a hunter’s projectile from accidentally striking a building or its inhabitants. I evaluated if mandated <b>safety</b> <b>zones</b> in Delaware may constitute unintentional refuges. I used Delaware’s land-cover data to created buffers (i. e., 46, 91, and 183 m) around each building to mimic current state regulations (i. e., 46 and 91 m) and those in northern New Castle County (i. e., 183 m). I overlaid these buffers on deer habitat coverage to determine the amount of deer habitat not available for harvest, which I assumed would act as a refuge because hunting was prohibited in these areas. The amount of deer habitat available for harvest was 39, 71, and 92 % for the 183 -, 91 -, and 46 -m <b>safety</b> <b>zones,</b> respectively. For land in public ownership, the amount of deer habitat available for harvest was 55, 81, and 96 % for the 183 -, 91 -, and 46 -m <b>safety</b> <b>zones,</b> respectively. The amount of deer habitat available for harvest on private land was 34, 67, and 91 % for the 183 -, 91 -, and 46 -m <b>safety</b> <b>zones,</b> respectively. My results suggest that allowing archery and carefully evaluating actual safety concerns will reduce the influence of inadvertent refuges on deer management...|$|R

25|$|Atlantic Airways Flight 670 was a crash {{following}} a runway overrun of a British Aerospace 146-200A at 07:32 on 10 October 2006. The aircraft's spoilers failed to deploy, causing inefficient braking. The Atlantic Airways aircraft {{fell over the}} edge past the runway at slow speed and burst into flames, killing four of sixteen people on board. The investigation {{was not able to}} find the underlying cause of the spoilers malfunction. However, it found that disemployment of the anti-lock braking system caused hydroplaning and subsequent reduced braking ability. The damage was aggravated through a minimal <b>safety</b> <b>zone</b> surrounding the runway.|$|E
25|$|During the {{transfer}} window, the club acquired Les Ferdinand and Rufus Brevett, {{and more importantly}} got Di Canio and Kanouté both back on the pitch and off the treatment table. The club's form improved {{and they began to}} claw their way up the table towards safety. In April, Roeder collapsed in his office and was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He was immediately given a leave of absence and 1980 FA Cup final hero Trevor Brooking took over for the final three games of the Premiership season. However, despite an upturn in the team's form (winning two and drawing one), they were unable to overhaul Bolton and finished 18th in the final table, two points short of the relegation <b>safety</b> <b>zone.</b> West Ham drew early in the season and then lost against Bolton during the run in; a draw against Bolton in their second match would have been sufficient to see West Ham survive.

Vanderburgh which was floundering in breaking surf and in danger of grounding on a coral reef six miles southwest of Fowey Rocks Light near Miami, Florida. Point Glass successfully navigated 34 miles through 810 foot seas to the distressed vessel and determined that she had crossed over the outer reef line {{and was about to}} damage the environmentally sensitive coral reef at Biscayne National Park. After passing a line to G.H. Vanderburgh, she towed her to safety, thereby saving the coral reef from damage and preventing harm to the seven man crew of the vessel. For these actions, the Point Glass and her crew were awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation with Operational Distinguishing Device. In 1998, Point Glass and her crew were awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Team Commendation with the Operational Distinguishing Device for participating in the Shell Air/Sea show at Fort Lauderdale by being part of the task force enforcing a 3 square mile <b>safety</b> <b>zone</b> near the event and showing the audience a search and rescue demonstration as well as a high speed patrol boat pass.|$|E
