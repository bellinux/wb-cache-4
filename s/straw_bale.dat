2500|$|Although {{grasses and}} straw {{have been in}} use {{in a range of}} ways in {{building}} since pre-history around the world, their incorporation in machine-manufactured modular bales seems to date back to the early 20th century in the midwestern United States, particularly the sand-hills of Nebraska, where grass was plentiful and other building materials (even quality sods) were not. <b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> building typically consists of stacking a series of rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or foundation, with a moisture barrier between. Bale walls are often tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then stuccoed or plastered either lime-based formulations or earth/clay renders.

40|$|International audienceStraw bales {{are seen}} as {{increasingly}} viable for building insulation and even {{for the construction of}} small load-bearing straw houses in the last decades, especially in view of the need to seek low environmental footprints. <b>Straw</b> <b>bales</b> can be used as load-bearing structures but they are currently mainly used as a filler insulation material associated with a timber structure. Up to present, very few studies are available concerning the mechanical behaviour of <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> in buildings. This study aims at investigating the behaviour of <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> and leads to recommendations for required bales densities. This allows to derive compression models which describe their behaviour in a wall. Therefore, the results show that, in the density range 90 - 110 kg/m(3), the elastic and strength characteristics are similar whatever the position of the bales (laid flat or on their edge). The behaviour of the <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> is found to be in correlation to the straw wisp density and to the initial wisp packing into the bales. The bale should therefore be considered has a system consisting out of the straw and the polymer links: when laid flat, it exhibits a particular type of deformation under single compression leading to a constant perimeter. In this position, the mechanical properties are controlled by two factors: (1) the packing density induced by the machine during the baling process, and by the elasticity and creep of the links; (2) the solid volume fraction of straw wisps, conditioned by the agronomic parameters and the pressure level in the baler...|$|R
