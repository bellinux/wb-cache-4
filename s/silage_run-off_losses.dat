In this paper, a detailed review and synthesis is reported that was conducted to identify the impacts of soil and water conservation practices on crop yield, surface <b>run-off,</b> soil <b>loss,</b> nutrient loss, and the economic viability, as well as to discuss the implications for an integrated approach and ecosystem services. The review and synthesis showed that most physical soil and water conservation practices such as soil bunds and stone bunds were very effective in reducing run-off, soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Despite these positive impacts on these services, {{the impact of}} physical soil and water conservation practices on crop yield was negative mainly due to the reduction of effective cultivable area by soil/stone bunds. In contrast, most agronomic soil and water conservation practices increase crop yield and reduce <b>run-off</b> and soil <b>losses.</b> This implies that integrating physical soil and water conservation practices with agronomic soil and water conservation practices are essential to increase both provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Additionally, effective use of unutilized land (the area occupied by bunds) by planting multipurpose grasses and trees on the bunds may offset the yield lost due to a reduction in planting area. If high value grasses and trees can be grown on this land, farmers can harvest fodder for animals or fuel wood, both in scarce supply in Ethiopia. Growing of these grasses and trees can also help the stability of the bunds and reduce maintenance cost. Economic feasibility analysis also showed that, soil and water conservation practices became economically more viable if physical and agronomic soil and water conservation practices are integrated...|$|R
40|$|Many soils of {{agricultural}} land in affluent {{countries have been}} enriched with phosphorus (P), because P application via fertilisers and manures was larger than P withdrawal via harvested biomass. This practice threatens the long-term availability of P fertilisers derived from finite rock phosphates, as well as surface water quality because of P leaching and <b>run-off</b> <b>losses.</b> In response, restrictions on P fertilisation have been implemented in some countries. The objective {{of this study is}} to examine the effects of balanced P fertilisation in comparison to a surplus P fertilisation on dry matter (DM) grass yield, grass quality, and soil P status. A 15 years’ lasting field experiment was conducted on four permanent grassland sites, on sand (two sites), peat and young marine clay in the Netherlands. Fertilisation levels, including cattle slurry, were aimed to implement P surpluses of 0, 9, and 18 kg P ha − 1 year − 1, and N surpluses of 180 and 300 kg ha − 1 year − 1. Grasslands were alternately grazed and mown, and grass yields and soil P levels were measured. Annual DM yield, P content, and P yield of grazed grassland were lower at balanced P fertilisation than at a surplus of 9 or 18 kg P ha − 1 year − 1 on sand and peat. Differences between P treatments remained constant over time. On the recently reclaimed marine clay, DM yield did not differ between P treatments, but P content and P yield did respond to different P surpluses. Differences between sites in the response to P surpluses were related to differences in soil P status, according to P-AL (capacity indicator) and P-CaCl 2 (intensity indicator). At balanced P fertilisation, P-AL tended to decrease, while P-CaCl 2 tended to remain constant. At surplus P, P-AL tended to increase and P-CaCl 2 tended to remain constant. Herbage yield and P uptake also strongly responded to N treatments. In conclusion, there is a risk that balanced P fertilisation reduces herbage yield and P content relative to surplus P fertilisation, even at relatively high soil P status. The risk of yield reduction seems to be related to the ratio between the P intensity indicator and P capacity indicator. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of aggregate stability on run-off and erosion {{has often been}} reported from experiments on microplots (about 1 m 2) under simulated rain. Our objective was to compare the aggregate stability of topsoil (0 - 10 cm) with run-off and erosion from experiments on run-off plots (about 100 - 1000 m 2) under natural rain. <b>Run-off</b> and soil <b>losses</b> were measured over three years on 14 plots in Benin, Cameroon and Mexico. All plots were under herbaceous vegetation and had moderate slope length and slope declivity, but differed in climate (400 - 1600 mm annual rainfall), soil type (sandly clay loam Nitosol, loamy sand Ferralsol, loamy Regosol), and management (from savanna to long-duration mouldboard ploughing). The stability of aggregates was determined by immersing and wet-sieving 2 -mm sieved air-dried samples into water. Mean annual run-off rate and soil losses generally increased, {{and the proportion of}} stable macroaggregates (greater than 0. 2 mm) decreased, with increasing duration and intensity of tillage, and with decreasing cover on the soil surface. For all 14 plots, <b>run-off</b> and soil <b>losses</b> were closely correlated with aggregate stability; correlations were improved when slope gradient and climate aggressivity were considered in addition to aggregation. Slaking, the main mechanism of aggregate breakdown wich occurs when dry soil is immersed, accounted well for run-off and erosion.

40|$|A {{series of}} apple tree {{spraying}} experiments {{was conducted to}} identify factors affecting agrichemical deposits from airblast sprayers and to relate deposit observations to biological responses in selected pest, disease and physiological systems. Factors addressed included tree canopy form, application volume, travel speed and sprayer type. Several tracers were evaluated and deposits quantified by wash-off removal from bulked leaf or fruit samples drawn from 10 - 15 spatially consistent 1. 5 m 3 zones per tree. Deposit data were expressed on a tissue area basis and/or {{as a proportion of}} the spray emitted (retention). Spray deposits were compared across 11 canopy forms to identify interactions with tree size, leaf area and canopy density and volume. A two-fold difference in deposits between canopies occurred when sprays were applied at a constant chemical rate per hectare. This variability was approximately halved when chemical rates per hectare were adjusted {{on the basis of the}} canopy Tree-Row-Volume (TRV). The best TRV measurement system identified used across-row canopy spread measurements at half metre height intervals, rather than just a single measurement of canopy spread. Deposits were better correlated with TRV data than with any of the other canopy descriptors used. Canopy density was identified as an important covariate, but light penetration proved an unsuitable indicator of canopy density as it was strongly correlated with TRV. Deposit variations between zones within trees were consistent between all but the smallest canopy sprayed. Increasing the distance from the sprayer and/or increasing canopy penetration requirements reduced spray deposits. Spray retention across these canopies in full leaf ranged from 25 - 90 %, but tended to increase with decreased application volume. There was a ca. 10 - 15 % increase in deposits when spray volumes were reduced 4 - 5 times below those used in typical dilute spray volumes (ca. 2, 000 1 ha- 1). At high volumes with significant run-off, retention could ca. 50 % of that at lower volumes. <b>Run-off</b> <b>losses</b> could be related to TRV, with significant run-off occurring once application volumes exceeded one litre per 7. 5 - 11 m 3 of TRV. Surprisingly, average deposits on 5 m tail slender pyramid trees increased with increased travel speed over the range 1. 9 - 8. 8 km h- 1. Within-tree spray deposit distributions were not markedly affected by the travel speeds tested with air assistance volumes of ca. 30, 000 or 44, 000 m 3 h- 1. High, but relatively consistent within-tree deposit variability was a feature of deposits from axial fan, airblast sprayers, especially when used in intensive 4 - 6 m tall, single leader tree plantings. Within-tree deposit variability decreased with increased application volumes. Tower sprayers provided a more even vertical distribution of spray emission points and achieved different, but not necessarily more even, within-tree deposit distributions than airblast machines. Experiments on chemical thinning, mealybug (Pseudococcus viburni) and black spot (Venturia inaequalis) control, showed the biological responses could not have been predicted from the spray deposit measurements. However, combined assessment of spray deposits and biological effects greatly facilitated interpretation of both sets of data. ...|$|R

The region is totally dependent on groundwater to meet its agricultural, industrial and domestic needs, since other sources of water are seasonal.

Frequently the wastes generated at IAI are conveniently, favourably, and cost-effectively applied to the nearby agricultural fields to recycle manure nutrients. However, excessive application of wastes in the nearby fields without due consideration of site-specific factors (eg. slope, soil, and watercourses) has resulted in the <b>run-off</b> and leaching <b>losses</b> of manure nutrients causing agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution (He and Shi, 1998).

40|$|The present paper {{provides}} a unifying survey {{of some of}} the most important methods of loss reserving based on run-off triangles and proposes the use of a family of such methods instead of a single one. The starting point is the thesis that the use of <b>run-off</b> triangles in <b>loss</b> reserving can be justified only under the assumption that the de-velopment of the losses of every accident year follows a development pattern which is common to all accident years. The notion of a development pattern turns out to be a unifying force in the comparison of various methods of loss reserving, in-cluding the chain-ladder method, the loss-development method, the Cape Cod method, and the additive method. For each of these meth-ods, the predictors of the ultimate losses can be given the shape of Bornhuetter-Ferguson predictors. The process of arranging known methods of loss reserving under the umbrella of the extended Bornhuetter-Ferguson method requires the identification of prior estimators of the development pattern and the expected ultimate losses. This process can be reversed by com-bining components of different methods to obtain new versions of the extended Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{loss from}} {{agricultural}} watersheds {{has long been}} a critical water quality problem, the control of which {{has been the focus of}} considerable research and investment. Preventing P loss depends on accurately representing the hydrological and chemical processes governing P mobilization and transport. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a watershed model commonly used to predict run-off and non-point source pollution transport. SWAT simulates run-off employing either the curve number (CN) or the Green and Ampt methods, both assume infiltration-excess run-off, although shallow soils underlain by a restricting layer commonly generate saturation-excess run-off from variable source areas (VSA). In this study, we compared traditional SWAT with a re-conceptualized version, SWAT-VSA, that represents VSA hydrology, in a complex agricultural watershed in east central Pennsylvania. The objectives of this research were to provide further evidence of SWAT-VSA’s integrated and distributed predictive capabilities against measured surface run-off and stream P loads and to highlight the model’s ability to drive sub-field management of P. Thus, we relied on a detailed field management database to parameterize the models. SWAT and SWAT-VSA predicted discharge similarly well (daily Nash–Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0. 61 and 0. 66, respectively), but SWAT-VSA outperformed SWAT in predicting P export from the watershed. SWAT estimated lower P loss (0. 0 – 0. 25 kg ha^- 1) from agricultural fields than SWAT-VSA (0. 0 – 1. 0 + kg ha^- 1), which also identified critical source areas – those areas generating large <b>run-off</b> and P <b>losses</b> at the sub-field level.

Majority of non-agriculture and structural pest management focuses on pesticide applications for right of way, turf and landscape, rangelands and indoors. Pesticides are initially distributed in the environment at application, {{with the intent of}} maximizing efficacy while minimizing off-site movement and adverse impacts on human and environmental health. A better understanding of initial distribution and redistribution via processes such as airborne <b>loss,</b> <b>run-off</b> and leaching is necessary to characterize both human occupational and non-occupational exposure, and assess risks to biota in surrounding ecosystems. Understanding the initial distribution in the environment at the landscape scale requires information on pesticide use practices. Timely spatial data such as the identity of pesticide, amount, target pest and site GIS can be enormously useful both in the protection of human and environmental health. Accurate information can help provide better risk assessments and illuminate pest management practices that are particularly problematic so they can be targeted for development of alternatives. In situations where more toxic chemicals must be used, the data will help managers to employ training and technologies specifically designed to protect applicators, workers, and the environment.

The vegetation covers, at both soil and canopy level, provides essential protection to the soil against the rainfall erosivity and reduces considerably the water erosion rate. Consequently vegetation management may affect soil erosion. We focused our attention on old coppice beech forest growing on a steep slope (28 - 32 °) and subjected to conversion to high stand. With the aim of obtaining information on surface water flow and the mineral soil loss, three runoff-erosion plots (10 m long  3 m wide) were installed in catchments in Lombardy Alps (Intelvi Valley, Como) at three stands: a coppice 40 years old (CpS 1968) and two conversions from coppice to high forest respectively cut in 1994 (CvS 1994) and 2004 (CvS 2004). Water <b>run-off</b> and sediment <b>losses</b> were collected from June to October 2008 and from May to October 2009 together with stand characteristics, LAI, soil surface cover, canopy cover and fine-root traits. Our results showed that the conversion practices significantly affect the water runoff and soil erosion with the younger conversion CvS 2004 showing the highest erosivity. This was due to the lower values of tree density, canopy cover, soil surface cover and fine-root biomass and length. The old coppice stand (CpS 1968) together with the older conversion stand (CvS 1994) showed comparable values of soil erosion. Therefore, the major role in protecting soil from erosion played by old coppice stand is recovered by the conversion stand after a number of years since harvesting.

A range of contrasting microbial community phenotypes were established in microcosms by manipulating the wavelength of light reaching the soil surface, with the microcosms being incubated {{in the field for}} approximately 6 months. Phenotypes were characterized by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), ergosterol and chlorophyll analysis. The microcosms were then subjected to simulated rainfall at an intensity of 60 mm hour- 1 for 20 minutes at a slope gradient of 9 ¿. Water infiltration rates, <b>run-off</b> generation, soil <b>loss</b> (including a particle-size analysis of the sediment) and soil-surface shear strength were quantified. Distinct microbial phenotypes developed on the soil surfaces with UV-A and restricted-UV treatments when compared with subsurface layers. There was significantly greater fungal biomass in the no-light treatment when compared with all other treatments, with approximately 4. 5 times more ergosterol being extracted from the subsurface layer of the no-light treatment when compared with other treatments. The no-light treatment produced the greatest amount of run-off, which was approximately 15 % greater than the restricted photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR) treatment. Significant differences between treatments were also found in shear strengths, with increasing strength being correlated with increasing ergosterol concentration. Water infiltration, erosion and the sediment concentrations in run-off were not significantly different between treatments. This work demonstrates that the quality of light reaching the soil surface affects the microbial phenotype, in turn producing functional consequences with regard to the physical and hydrological properties of arable soil surfaces.

40|$|China’s {{south-western}} {{province of}} Yunnan is a mountainous area of high biological {{and cultural diversity}} that was annexed into China relatively late in Chinese history. The province has lost over two thirds of its original forest cover and lost half of what remained in the last fifty years. Ethnic minorities make up {{about a third of}} the population of the province but predominate in forested areas. Chinese policy towards ‘minority nationalities’ at first recognized their right to self-determination but since liberation has oscillated between assimilationist and integrationist approaches. Despite strong central government control, the law grants them an important measure of cultural and institutional autonomy at the local level. Nationally, forest policy has been highly centralized and geared towards timber production. Quota driven overharvesting has depleted forests and led to serious soil erosion, local impoverishment, flooding and massive loss of life in the lowlands. While mass afforestation efforts have disappointed. Since 1998, the government has banned logging in Yunnan, allowing only a very restricted cut for domestic use. Imprudent natural resource use is linked to the doctrine of State ownership of all lands and forests and the imposed structure of village collectives. Since the late 1970 s, the government has progressively devolved land and then forests to local farmers to manage and enjoy use rights to. Massive increases in agricultural production have resulted, but the lesser degree of autonomy granted farmers with respect to forest land, combined with the top-down quota system, inadequate supervision capacity, poor delineation of forests and the slower rate of return on investment have frustrated social forestry initiatives. Farmers’ skepticism that devolved tenure would really give them rights over timber has been confirmed by the logging ban. At the same time, in Yunnan, many upland farmers are being obliged to plant trees on their higher fields, with the aim of limiting <b>run-off.</b> The simultaneous <b>loss</b> of grain for subsistence and income from timber has hit farmers hard. The losses have not been made up with subsidies and grain handouts. Local activists distinguish between the government’s ‘social forestry’ and the ‘community forestry’ that has been promoted, since the late 1980 s, by the Ford Foundation, international development assistance projects and the international networks, notably RECOFTC. Despite major advances in awareness raising, training, the development of forestry school courses and curricula, and despite numerous educational pilot projects, community forestry has not yet ‘taken off’ in the province. This can only come when the central government’s policy changes. Laws restricting civil society organizations are quite strict in China, yet despite these limitations an incipient provincial level network has evolved promoting participatory approaches to development. Efforts to promote a national level community forestry network have been less successful. Although Yunnan has had a relatively limited experience with international community forestry networks, local actors provide highly insightful lessons and suggestions about how such networking should be improved. International networking is valued as a source of information and inspiration but should be made more interactive, locally driven and strategic. The main challenges now facing community forestry in Yunnan are achieving national policy reform, and building local capacity and awareness in both communities and forestry bureaux. Recent government moves to allow village level democracy and slim down the administration offer opportunities to give farmers greater initiative. Perhaps minority areas, where indigenous forest related knowledge is retained, and where more autonomy is, notionally, allowed, offer hopeful beginnings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: The {{disposal}} of animal waste {{has become a}} problem {{in many parts of}} the world due to the rapid growth in the number and the size of intensive animal industries. Safe waste disposal sites are rarely available and the relocation and/or treatment of animal waste is seldom economically viable. The reuse of animal waste for energy recovery and re-feeding is also not popular. Animal waste is a valuable source of plant nutrients and a very good soil conditioner, and has been commonly applied as fertiliser to agricultural fields. However, due to the increasing oversupply of animal waste in recent years, it has often been applied in excess to the agricultural fields. Excessive application of animal waste, without due consideration of its implications, is a serious concern. The <b>run-off</b> and leaching <b>losses</b> of nutrients from the fields fertilised with animal waste have contributed significantly to the eutrophication and toxic blue-green algae blooms in surface water systems and nitrification of ground water systems. It has also led to nutrient imbalances in the soils and odour pollution to the surrounding communities. The animal waste, which is a valuable source of plant nutrients, has thus become both an economic and environmental burden, and there is a need to develop a strategy for its sensible use as a fertiliser in agricultural fields. Sensible use of animal waste involves the consideration of all the agricultural, environmental, social, and economical limitations. A rational method of achieving this is to restrict the use of animal waste to sites suitable for such uses, identify areas where it can be relocated and applied economically, limit the application rates to a safe level, and observe appropriate manure management practices. This study addressed each of these components by developing a comprehensive manure application plan (MAP) for the site-specific use of animal waste as fertiliser in agricultural fields. Various geographic information systems (GIS) based techniques, including a weighted linear combination model and map algebra based cartographic modelling, were employed to achieve the goal. The appropriateness of the existing techniques and procedures were evaluated and modified to meet the current input requirements. New methods of analysis were devised as necessary. The Westbrook sub-catchment of the Condamine River catchment in south-east Queensland was selected as the study area. The sub-catchment covers 24, 903 hectares and contains 39 intensive animal industries. The catchment is also a part of the Murray-Darling Basin, which has been suffering from toxic blue green algae blooms recurrently since 1991. This study identified that only about one-fifth of the sub-catchment area is suitable for animal waste application. Depending on the method of site suitability analysis and the number of input factors used the suitable area ranged between 16 and 22 percent. This comparatively small area is mainly due to the presence of a large proportion of non-agricultural areas in the sub-catchment. The suitable areas were also found to have various degrees of suitability for waste application. However, the degree of site suitability was affected by the number of input factors used in the analysis, the weighting of the factors, and the method of factor attribute standardisation. Conventional methods of weighting input factors were found to be cumbersome and not particularly suitable. Hence, this study developed a new ‘objective oriented comparison’ method of factor weighting. Standardisation of input factors using a continuous, rather than discrete, classification (ie fuzzy set) method was found to be more consistent in degree of suitability determination. The discrete classification of factor attributes into classes of different numbers and sizes, and the weighting of classes to a sum of one, were identified as a limitation in using this standardisation method. A new ‘weight adjustment’ method was devised and demonstrated to reduce factor-weighting biases. The suitable sites, degree of site suitability, and other relevant spatial and non-spatial information were processed within a GIS framework to develop a comprehensive manure application plan. The inherently high presence of available phosphorus in the soils of the study area was recognised and the P 2 O 5 content in the manure was used as the basis for determining manure application rates. A complimentary nitrogen supply map was also generated. Manure management practices applicable to the areas with a lower degree of suitability were also suggested...|$|R
