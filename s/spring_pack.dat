5000|$|As the {{required}} machining speeds become higher, {{the need for}} machines to be built with smaller diameter spindle components increases. When the <b>spring</b> <b>pack,</b> bearings, and hydraulic units become smaller, the stresses placed upon them become greater. As a result, the clamping system will remain in good shape for fewer and fewer [...] "cycles", or [...] "clamp/unclamp" [...] procedures.

5000|$|A more {{accepted}} way {{to build}} up the leaf springs is by using an add-a-leaf. This is done by inserting an extra leaf into the vehicle's leaf pack. Using the add-a-leaf will increase the height, but sometimes makes the suspension ride rough because of the added spring rate. A complete description of how this is done is shown at this link; http://www.jedi.com/obiwan/jeep/addaleaf.html. With an adequate budget, the best way to lift with leaf springs is to buy a new set with the lift built in. When using an add-a-leaf you are relying on the integrity of the old springs. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.

This paper describes the unique fail-safe mounted on the ADM, especially {{the use of a}} low-temperature-melting alloy as a coupler device. The final form of the design is a low-melting-point metal pellet coupler, made from Cerrobend, in parallel with a Negator <b>spring</b> <b>pack.</b> In its solid state, the metal rigidly connects the driver (the actuator) and the driven part (the mechanism). When commanded, a strip heater wrapped around the coupler melts the metal pellet (at 60 (deg) C), allowing the driven part to turn independent of the driver. The Negator spring retracts the mechanism to its fully stowed position. This concept meets all the design criteria, and provides an added benefit. When the metal hardens the coupler once again rigidly connects the actuator and the mechanism. The concept presented here can easily be applied to other applications. Anywhere release devices are needed, low-melting-point couplers can be considered. The issues to be concerned with are thermal isolation, proper setting of the parts before actuation, and possible outgassing concerns. However, when these issues are overcome, the resulting release mechanism can promise to be the most light, simple, power conserving alternative available...|$|E

40|$|The Oil-Free Turbomachinery {{team at the}} NASA Glenn Research Center has {{unlocked}} one of {{the mysteries}} surrounding foil air bearing performance. Foil air bearings are self-acting hydrodynamic bearings that use ambient air, or any fluid, as their lubricant. In operation, {{the motion of the}} shaft's surface drags fluid into the bearing by viscous action, creating a pressurized lubricant film. This lubricating film separates the stationary foil bearing surface from the moving shaft and supports load. Foil bearings have been around for decades and are widely employed in the air cycle machines used for cabin pressurization and cooling aboard commercial jetliners. The Oil-Free Turbomachinery team is fostering the maturation of this technology for integration into advanced Oil-Free aircraft engines. Elimination of the engine oil system can significantly reduce weight and cost and could enable revolutionary new engine designs. Foil bearings, however, have complex elastic support structures (<b>spring</b> <b>packs)</b> that make the prediction of bearing performance, such as load capacity, difficult if not impossible. Researchers at Glenn recently found a link between foil bearing design and load capacity performance. The results have led to a simple rule-of-thumb that relates a bearing's size, speed, and design to its load capacity. Early simple designs (Generation I) had simple elastic (spring) support elements, and performance was limited. More advanced bearings (Generation III) with elastic supports, in which the stiffness is varied locally to optimize gas film pressures, exhibit load capacities that are more than double those of the best previous designs. This is shown graphically in the figure. These more advanced bearings have enabled industry to introduce commercial Oil-Free gas-turbine-based electrical generators and are allowing the aeropropulsion industry to incorporate the technology into aircraft engines. The rule-of-thumb enables engine and bearing designers to easily size and select bearing technology for a new application and determine the level of complexity required in the bearings. This new understanding enables industry to assess the feasibility of new engine designs and provides critical guidance toward the future development of Oil-Free turbomachinery propulsion systems...|$|R

Pacific Northwest will cause reduced <b>spring</b> snow <b>pack,</b> earlier melt, earlier spring peak flow and lower summer flow in transient rain-snow and snowmelt dominant river basins. In the context of managed flood control, these systematic changes are likely to disrupt the balance between flood control and reservoir refill in existing reservoir systems. To adapt to these hydrologic changes, refill timing and evacuation requirements for flood control need to be modified. This work poses a significant systems engineering problem, especially for large, multiobjective water systems. An existing optimization/ simulation procedure is refined for rebalancing flood control and refill objectives for the Columbia River Basin for anticipated global warming. To calibrate the optimization model for the 20 th century flow, the objective function is tuned to reproduce the current reliability of reservoir refill, while providing comparable levels of flood control to those produced by current flood control practices. After the optimization model is calibrated using the 20 th century flow the same objective function is used to develop flood control curves for a global warming scenario which assumes an approximately 2 °C increase in air temperature. Robust decreases in system storage deficits are simulated for the climate change scenario when optimized flood rule curves replace the current flood control curves, without increasing monthly flood risks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Currently {{available}} {{snow pack}} monitoring methods are limited due to spatial resolution or to adequate weather and secure avalanche conditions. Snow pack monitoring is impossible if {{the method is}} destructive as snow probing and thereby the use for avalanche forecasts limited. Ultrasonic snow height sensors are not feasible for an application in snow deposition areas along ridges or in avalanche paths. For the validation and improvement of snow pack simulation models, it is of high importance to measure snow pack conditions with a high spatial resolution in real-time. We have developed a measuring concept {{for the application of}} Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) -systems from below the snow pack. With a vertically moving GPR-antenna it is possible to record reflections, which can be related to snow height and internal layering with adequate density steps and layer thickness. Field data sets from three winters in the Austrian Alps resulted in an average value for the velocity of propagation of pulsed radar waves in dry snow with a coefficient of variation (CV) of about 6 %. Additionally we conducted some preliminary measurements in a wet <b>spring</b> snow <b>pack</b> to analyze the feasibility of the system. In contrast to Frequency Modulated Continuous Waves (FMCW) radar, the snow-air-interface was detectable and thereby the snow height could be estimated.

This work aims {{to investigate the}} use of Si isotopes to quantify the activity of sea-ice diatoms in the different brine structures {{and the influence of}} sea-ice diatoms on the spring ice edge blooms. From three cores with contrasted physico-chemical characteristics, we report significant isotopic fractionations linked to diatom activity with distinct silicon biogeochemical dynamics between different brine structures. The diatoms in snow ice and in brine pockets of frazil or congelation ice have the heavier silicon-isotopic composition (+ 0. 53 to + 0. 86 ‰), indicating that they grow in a closed system and use a significant fraction of the small dissolved silicon pool available. In the brine channels and skeletal layer, diatoms display a relatively lower silicon-isotopic composition (+ 0. 41 to + 0. 70 ‰), although it is still relatively positive compared to expected equilibrium fractionation. This suggests that the diatoms have grown in a semi-closed system where the dissolved silicon pool (i. e., brine) is partially replenished. The silicon-isotopic composition (+ 0. 63 ‰) of the sea-ice diatoms is much heavier than the one of biogenic silica in the seasonal ice zone mixed layer (+ 0. 09 ‰).

The interpretation of fossil pollen assemblages was aided by comparisons with 308 modern assemblages from the Olympic Peninsula and western North America. Both pollen records show a cold/dry period following deglaciation (# 10000 radiocarbon years BP) with sparse tundra and little similarity to any modern pollen assemblage. In the early Holocene, when summer temperatures {{are thought to}} have been higher than present, high percentages of Alnus sinuata-type pollen at both lakes suggest increased avalanche activity. At Martins Lake warmer summers were not accompanied by forest establishment, possibly because persistent <b>spring</b> snow <b>pack,</b> snow avalanches, and/or edaphic constraints limited tree establishment at this site. The Martins Lake record shows a steplike shift in vegetation to modern Tsuga mertensiana/Abies amabilis parkland across the Mazama tephra (6730 BP). In contrast to Martins Lake, Abies lasiocarpa forest quickly established at Moose Lake in the early Holocene, though forests were probably initially open and fires may have been frequent.

40|$|Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) subalpine {{forests are}} an {{important}} regional carbon sink dependent on winter precipitation. Understanding how climate variability and disturbance impact the carbon cycle and biogeochemical pools is critical for predicting future carbon sequestration. In this thesis, I investigated the impacts of mountain pine beetle (MPB) induced tree mortality and changes in spring snow depth on forest carbon balance and soil biogeochemical pools. Using parallel disturbance chronosequences of natural and simulated beetle-kill, as well as 8 -year records of gross primary productivity (GPP) and respiration fluxes, I found that soil respiration sharply declines with GPP after tree mortality, reflecting the loss of autotrophic respiration and rhizodeposition. During this time, the forest soil also lost a significant fraction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Five to six years after tree mortality, soil respiration rates, DOC, and DON recovered before declining again, co-incident {{with an increase in}} decomposing needle litter. Generally, tree mortality caused an increase in soil moisture and a decrease in soil temperature, although these effects were confounded by stand density and time since disturbance. MPB disturbance lead to an increase in extractable soil ammonium, but not nitrate concentrations, and this accumulation was correlated with increased soil moisture availability and decreases in microbial biomass C:N. Ultimately, consideration of the dynamics of labile C supply suggest that beetle-killed forests lose less carbon to the atmosphere than previously estimated. Finally, I investigated the effects of <b>spring</b> snow <b>pack</b> depth on the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of subalpine forest soil respiration over two summer growing seasons. I found that snow additions can transiently increase growing season soil respiration rates likely through enhanced rhizodeposition, and that the autotrophic component of soil respiration may be sensitive to the effect of snow moisture availability on the photosynthetic water-use efficiency of trees. These results collectively demonstrate the significant effects of climate variability and disturbance on the mechanistic linkages between gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration...|$|R
40|$|The radiobrightness of a snowpack is {{strongly}} {{linked to the}} snow moisture content profile, {{to the point that}} the only operational inversion algorithms require dry snow. Forward dynamic models do not include the effects of freezing and thawing of the soil beneath the snowpack and the effect of vegetation within the snow or above the snow. To get a more realistic description of the evolution of the snowpack, we reported an addition to the Snow-Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere- Transfer (SSVAT) model, wherein we coupled soil processes of the Land Surface Process (LSP) model with the snow model SNTHERM. In the near future we will be adding a radiobrightness prediction based on the modeled moisture, temperature and snow grain size profiles. The initial investigations with this SSVAT for a late winter and early <b>spring</b> snow <b>pack</b> indicate that soil processes warm the snowpack and the soil. Vapor diffusion needs to be considered whenever the ground is thawed. In the early spring, heat flow from the ground into a snow and a strong temperature gradient across the snow lead to thermal convection. The buried vegetation can be ignored for a late winter snow pack. The warmer surface snow temperature will affect radiobrightness since it is most sensitive to snow surface characteristics. Comparison to data shows that SSVAT provides a more realistic representation of the temperature and moisture profiles in the snowpack and its underlying soil than SNTHERM. The radiobrightness module will be optimized for the prediction of brightness when the snow is moist. The liquid water content of snow causes considerable absorption compared to dry snow, and so longer wavelengths are likely to be most revealing as to the state of a moist snowpack. For volumetric moisture contents below about 7 % (the pendular regime), the water forms rings around the contact points between snow grains. Electrostatic modeling of these pendular rings shows that the absorption of these rings is significantly higher than a sphere of the same volume. The first implementation of the radiobrightness module will therefore be a simple radiative transfer model without scattering...|$|R
