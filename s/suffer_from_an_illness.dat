50|$|According to the 2011 census in {{the village}} there are 226 {{residents}} who are aged between 16 and 64 and 146 {{of these people are}} economically active whether it is part-time work, full-time work or self-employed. Of these 226 only one of them is unemployed and seven of them are full-time students. This is another factor that shows that it is unlikely for members of the village to be on job seekers allowance or on a relatively low income. The total amount of economically inactive people stands at a total of 80 however 56 are retired and the remaining are either students or <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>illness.</b> This could reinforce the suggestion that some members of the village are retirees who chose to live in the parish for a relaxing retirement with peaceful surroundings.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Neuman - Stanley's cynical {{psychiatrist}} and a recurring character. Stanley typically goes {{to see him}} to talk about his problems and The Mask. Dr. Neumann doesn't believe in The Mask, which he thinks is Stanley's [...] "imaginary friend". This is a running gag of the show. However, he later gains the mask from Stanley, who {{wanted to get rid of}} it. Neumann tries the mask on and with it on, becomes crazy and psychotic. He also wears a yellow coat and blue pants with sneakers as well as a huge bow tie with the same color scheme as the Mask's tie. While wearing The Mask, Neumann puts Stanley and other people in straitjackets (using their underwear), believing they <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>illness</b> called Ipkissia maskosis. He also teams with Pretorius, but is ultimately defeated and separated from the mask after trying to kill Stanley. Even after this, and the fact that the Mask has appeared in the news and even on television, Neumann is still not convinced. Neumann wore the mask in Shrink Rap.|$|E
