40|$|Changes in spatial {{distribution}} in several fish {{species have been}} related to recent increase in global temperature. In the North Sea, both a poleward shift and a shift to deeper water have been observed. Here, we study the underlying mechanism of these shifts in a comparative study {{of the changes in}} distribution of two boreal flatfish <b>species</b> (<b>plaice</b> Pleuronectes platessa and dab Limanda limanda) and three Lusitanian flatfish species (sole Solea solea, solenette Buglossidium luteum, and scaldfish Arnoglossus laterna) as recorded in annual bottom trawl surveys carried out in the North Sea in late summer since 1985. The distribution is analysed in relation to the bottom temperature {{at the time of the}} survey as well as to the seasonal maximum bottom temperature earlier in the year. It is shown that the boreal <b>species</b> <b>plaice</b> and dab moved to deeper water and maintained the seasonal maximum temperature that they experienced in earlier periods, while the Lusitanian species sole, solenette, and scaldfish experienced an increase in the seasonal maximum temperature that they experienced while maintaining their depth distribution. This overall response varied between length classes, reflecting a preference for higher temperature of the smaller length classes. The results lend support to the hypothesis that the fish displayed a direct response to the maximum temperature that occurred during the growth season before the time of sampling...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{aspects of}} growth and reproduction in four flatfish <b>species</b> (<b>plaice,</b> flounder, dab, sole) in terms of energy flow are described {{on the basis of}} a dynamic energy budget (DEB theory). This theory consists of general assumptions about energy uptake, storage and utilisation and describes an individual by two state variables: structure and reserve, whereby body size exerts its influence through the ratio between surface area and volume. Comparison between model estimates and field data shows that the DEB model successfully describes the energetics {{of growth and}} reproduction in a number of flatfish species. Differences between species could be captured in the same model using different parameter values. Intraspecific differences in growth between males and females are mainly caused by differences in maximum surface area-specific ingestion rates. Differences between species are reflected in the surface area-specific maximum ingestion rate, the energy partitioning over growth and reproduction, and in egg volume. According to these parameters at 283 K (10 °C), the species could be ranked as follows: surface area-specific maximum ingestion rate (W...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} use of marine protected areas (MPAs) as tools to achieve the goal of ecosystem management. MPAs could counteract these effects by limiting the impact on areas important for feeding, shelter, spawning and migration. Thus MPAs should include features that enable fish to reach maturity and thus contribute to the spawning stock. But how do we find the most suitable habitats for fish species in large marine areas? Ecological theory (ideal free distribution) suggests that fish will be most abundant in areas that have the most favourable habitat characteristics for that species. Fish stock assessment data could be used to assess where fish species consistently tend to aggregate. In this study we examined stock assessment data collected for three flatfish <b>species</b> (<b>plaice,</b> sole and lemon sole) from 134 stations in the English Channel over nine years. Juvenile fish were excluded from the analysis. The fish abundance data for each year was ranked and the mean rank calculated. The coefficient of variation of the mean rank score had the least variability at stations with the highest mean rank scores and also at those with the lowest rank scores. Stations that had a mid-range mean rank had the greatest inter-annual variation. It would appear that stations with the highest mean rank abundance consistently attract fish. Such areas may be the prime focus for potential MPA...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} bottom {{trawling}} on benthic invertebrates include reductions of biomass, diversity and body size. These changes may negatively affect prey availability for demersal fishes, potentially leading to reduced food intake, body condition and yield of fishes in chronically trawled areas. Here, {{the effect of}} trawling on the prey availability and diet of two commercially important flatfish <b>species,</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa) and dab (Limanda limanda), was investigated over a trawling intensity gradient in the Irish Sea. Previous {{work in this area}} has shown that trawling negatively affects the condition of plaice but not of dab. This study showed that reductions in local prey availability did not result in reduced feeding of fish. As trawling frequency increased, both fish and prey biomass declined, such that the ratio of fish to prey remained unchanged. Consequently, even at frequently trawled sites with low prey biomass, both plaice and dab maintained constant levels of stomach fullness and gut energy contents. However, dietary shifts in plaice towards energy-poor prey items were evident when prey species were analysed individually. This, together with a potential decrease in foraging efficiency due to low prey densities, was seen as the most plausible cause for the reduced body condition observed. Understanding the relationship between trawling, benthic impacts, fish foraging and resultant body condition is an important step in designing successful mitigation measures for future management strategies in bottom trawl fisheries...|$|E
40|$|Patterns in the {{abundance}} of commercially important and non-target demersal fish species collected by beam trawl survey from the coastal waters of the northeast Atlantic are described. Catches were dominated by {{a small number of}} species, which occurred in large numbers and at high biomass. The most abundant <b>species</b> (<b>plaice</b> and dab) were typical of shallow, uniform sandy and muddy seabed which occurred extensively throughout the southern North Sea, and to a limited extent in UK western waters. Renyi's diversity index family was used to rank the diversity of coastal sectors throughout the region. The less species-rich North Sea fauna, partly a result of the uniform nature of the seabed was largely responsible for lower diversity of North Sea coastal faunas compared to those in the Channel and west of the UK West of the Dover Strait, the more heterogeneous substrate supported a more diverse fauna of smaller sized fish, with the occurrence of southern species such as red gurnard and thickback sole and an increasing abundance of elasmobranchs. In the Irish Sea, fish biomass was dominated by plaice and dab, but to a lesser extent than on the continental coast of the North Sea. Sole, lesser spotted dogfish and cod were also important in this assemblage. Patterns in community structure over such a wide spatial scale, and without historical perspective, can be explained by biogeographic factors, seabed structure and the influence of regional hydrography. Inferring from these patterns an impact of anthropogenic factors (such as towed fishing gears) is unlikely to be achieved. Identifying vulnerable species, and use of fi 5 hing effort distribution data of high resolution, may be a more fruitful approach...|$|E
40|$|Human {{activity}} in the North Sea is increasing, involving more motorised cargo shipping, and rapidly expanding construction and operation of oil platforms and wind farms. Furthermore, the North Sea is used {{on a large scale}} for fisheries, military purposes and the extraction and suppletion of sand. Sand suppletion is used in the Netherlands to protect the beaches along the coast. In recent years, underwater sand levees or sand suppletion near shore has been performed for coastal protection. It has been suggested that new areas created as the result of sand suppletion offshore can create new opportunities for fish, because of an increase of the suitable habitat. In near future, major sand nourishments are planned at the Dutch coast of the Delfland area (‘zandmotor’). In order to study the effect on (mostly juvenile) fish and epifauna, a sampling strategy was designed to monitor the potentially affected species. The aim of this project is: to monitor the reference situation concerning fish and epifauna in the shallow coastal waters (2 - 7 m water depth); to monitor the reference situation concerning potential habitat for fish and epifauna in the shallow coastal waters (i. e. depth, grain size, water temperature, salinity, water visibility); and to link fish abundance to habitat characteristics. This report only gives a description of the field sampling during July 2011. The monitoring took place at four locations along the Dutch coast during three weeks in July. The first location, IJmuiden, was used to test the equipment. Fishing was planned for Vlugtenburg, Texel and Ameland.

40|$|Nematodes from 361 {{fish from}} 15 species were {{collected}} between August 2010 and March 2012 at Langøya and at Torbjørnskjær {{in the outer}} Oslofjord. The study focused on the infection levels of the three most abundant nematode species, Hysterothylacium aduncum, Anisakis simplex and Contracaecum osculatum, in the three flatfish <b>species</b> American <b>plaice</b> (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and common dab (Limanda limanda). When all nematode and fish species were pooled the percentage of infected fish (i. e prevalence), {{the average number of}} nematodes per fish (i. e. abundance) and the average number of nematodes per infected fish (i. e. the intensity) were significantly higher at Langøya than at Torbjørnskjær. While H. aduncum and C. osculatum had higher abundances at the western site, A. simplex was more abundant at the eastern site. Among the three flatfish <b>species,</b> American <b>plaice</b> had a relatively high prevalence both at Langøya and at Torbjørnskjær (55 and 53 % respectively). Witch flounder was only infected at Langøya (59 %) and mainly with H. aduncum (53 %). Common dab had a high prevalence at Langøya (80 %) and rather low at Torbjørnskjær (15 %). However, since the sample size was small for witch flounder at Torbjørnskjær (n = 4) and for common dab at Langøya (n = 5), these results are likely to be biased. This study also supports the general view that there is a large fluctuation in the nematode populations in the outer Oslofjord. The previously observed decrease of A. simplex seems to continue. C. osculatum and H. aduncum are getting more widespread in the Oslofjord. In addition, my data contain the first recording of the flatfish nematode Cucullanus heterochrous at Langøya, suggesting that also this species is expanding in the Oslofjord. The lengths of the nematodes were used to investigate whether the three flatfishes are suitable hosts for the three nematode <b>species.</b> American <b>plaice</b> and witch flounder are good transport and final hosts for H. aduncum. American plaice seemed to be suitable transport host for C. osculatum as well. Despite the fact that A. simplex is known to have a pelagic life-cycle with Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) as the main transport host, my observations show that it can also use the benthic common dab as transport host in the outer Oslofjord. The number of nematodes per witch flounder and common dab had a random distribution (Poisson distribution). However, the number of Pseudoterranova decipiens per American plaice was highly over-dispersed. It is likely that a combination of different factors, especially the feeding ecology and habitat preferences of the fish, is the cause for the observed infestation patterns. In addition, American plaice and witch flounder harboured a more diverse parasite fauna than common dab. Finally, the length measurements indicate that there may be some interspecific interaction between the nematodes...|$|R

40|$|The bivalve Macoma balthica migrates {{twice during}} the benthic {{part of its}} life cycle. During the spring {{migration}} (May-June), the newly settled spat (0 -group) migrates to the nurseries in the high intertidal. Seven to nine months later, the bivalves migrate back to the low tidal flats and the subtidal (winter migration, 1 -group). Both 0 - and 1 -group M. balthica use byssus threads for active pelagic migrations. As many M. balthica disappear during these migrations, we examined experimentally the importance of predation on 0 - and 1 -group M. balthica. Laboratory experiments using a circular aquarium determined predation rates on buried (no current) and drifting (current) 0 - and 1 -group M. balthica by several fish <b>species</b> (<b>plaice,</b> flounder, goby and whiting) and the shore crab. Under illuminated conditions, more M. balthica were consumed when migrating than when buried, whereas {{there was no difference}} between experiments in conditions of darkness. For the 0 -group, predation rates on migrating and buried M. balthica in the dark were lower than in the light. The stomachs of pelagic fish in the Wadden Sea and Oosterschelde estuary did not contain M. balthica during winter migration. In the Wadden Sea, 1 -group M. balthica primarily migrated at night. In conclusion, enhanced predation on drifting, as compared to buried, M. balthica may be the mechanism that explains enhanced mortality during migration in light, and may explain why M. balthica mainly migrates at night in the field. As we found no M. balthica in stomachs of pelagic fish, we do not know whether predation on byssus drifting M. balthica exists in the field. There are, however, some indications for fish predation on infaunal polychaetes during pelagic migrations...|$|E
40|$|Flatfishes {{have been}} the subject of {{scientific}} research since the beginning of the 19 th century but information on the specific habitat requirement of the adult life stages is largely anecdotal. Detailed knowledge of flatfish habitats however is a precondition for a more ecosystem orientated approach to fisheries management. Here the association between benthic habitat and the adult life stage of three flatfish <b>species</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa), sole (Solea solea) and lemon sole (Microstomus kitt) was investigated in the English Channel. Data from groundfish surveys spanning a period of 9 years was used to identify three distinct site groups: sites where a species occurred in consistently high abundances, sites of variable or low abundance and sites at which none were caught. Following the supposition of habitat selection theories such as the ideal free distribution theory these three sites groups should represent a gradient in habitat suitability from highly suitable to less suitable and unsuitable respectively. Habitat parameters and features for the three site groups and species were described and analysed. In particular sediment type and the importance of structuring epifauna for adult flatfish was investigated. Overall plaice and sole showed very similar trends for abiotic environmental parameters such as depth, temperature, salinity and tidal currents. Lemon sole was found over distinctly different habitats which may indicate a stronger niche partitioning of this species. Sediment associations differed between the three species with plaice predominantly occurring over sandy substrates with little mud and gravel content, while sole was found over a wider range of muddy to sandy substrates. Lemon sole was predominantly found over sand however containing a higher percentage of gravel than plaice. Structuring emergent epifauna was related positively to plaice and lemon sole abundances. These structures might be important as they tend to harbour larger numbers of epibenthic species upon which adult plaice and lemon sole prey. No such trend was found for the tactile feeding sole which mainly forages on infaunal polychaetes and molluscs...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, {{thousands}} of otoliths, bivalve shells, and scales have been collected {{for the purposes of}} age determination and remain archived in European and North American fisheries laboratories. Advances in digital imaging and computer software combined with techniques developed by tree-ring scientists provide a means by which to extract additional levels of information in these calcified structures and generate annually resolved (one value per year), multidecadal time-series of population-level growth anomalies. Chemical and isotopic properties may also be extracted to provide additional information regarding the environmental conditions these organisms experienced. Given that they are exactly placed in time, chronologies can be directly compared to instrumental climate records, chronologies from other regions or species, or time-seriesof other biological phenomena. In this way, chronologies may be used to reconstruct historical ranges of environmental variability, identify climatic drivers of growth, establish linkages within and among species, and generate ecosystem-level indicators. Following the first workshop in Hamburg, Germany, in December 2014, the second workshop on Growth increment Chronologies in Marine Fish: climate-ecosystem interactions in the North Atlantic (WKGIC 2) met at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies headquarters in Esporles, Spain, on 18 – 22 April 2016, chaired by Bryan Black (USA) and Christoph Stransky (Germany). Thirty-six participants from fifteen different countries attended. Objectives were to i) review the applications of chronologies developed from growth-increment widths in the hard parts (otoliths, shells, scales) of marine fish and bivalve species ii) review the fundamentals of crossdating and chronology development, iii) discuss assumptions and limitations of these approaches, iv) measure otolith growth-increment widths in image analysis software, v) learn software to statistically check increment dating accuracy, vi) generate a growth increment chronology and relate it to climate indices, and vii) initiate cooperative projects or training exercises to commence after the workshop. The workshop began with an overview of tree-ring techniques of chronology development, including a hands-on exercise in cross dating. Next, we discussed the applications of fish and bivalve biochronologies and the range of issues that could be addressed. We then reviewed key assumptions and limitations, especially those associated with short-lived species for which there are numerous and extensive otolith archives in European fisheries labs. Next, participants were provided with images of European plaice otoliths from the North Sea and taught to measure increment widths in image analysis software. Upon completion of measurements, techniques of chronology development were discussed and contrasted to those that have been applied for long-lived <b>species.</b> <b>Plaice</b> growth time-series were then related to environmental variability using the KNMI Climate Explorer. Finally, potential future collaborations and funding opportunities were discussed, and there was a clear desire to meet again to compare various statistical techniques for chronology development using a range existing fish, bivalve, and tree growth-increment datasets. Overall, we hope to increase the use of these techniques, and over the long term, develop networks of biochronologies for integrative analyses of ecosystem functioning and relationships to long-term climate variability and fishing pressure...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on influences of physical factors on plaice and sole stresses the prominent role of water temperature in all life stages of the <b>species.</b> For <b>plaice,</b> e. g., water temperatures on the spawning grounds are inversely correlated with year-class strength, and growth depends primarily on temperatures. In many instances, however, direct and indirect effects are hard to disentangle and to quantify for use in models, e. g. for stock assessment and prediction (SAP). Hydrodynamic circulation influences the egg and larvae distributions. Existing models reveal the drift variability to be of the same magnitude as year to year variations of larval abundance just before immigration. An improved modelling of the processes could combine recent circulation and transport models incorporating physical/biological properties of the eggs and larvae. It is suggested that future research focuses on this approach. The course of irradiation during spring and its influence on mortality of the 0 -groups of both species in the nursery deserves further studies {{if it is to be}} useful for SAP...|$|R

Studies were performed on two types of infection of teleost fish where viruses have been observed by electron microscopy: erythrocytic infections in the Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) and the Common Blenny (Blennius hpo lis) and lymphcystis disease., Searches were made for new, isolations of these infections Ja British coastal waters and on shores chiefly in the vicinity of Plymouth and Aberystwyth. In the absence of disease symptoms, the blood of fish was, screened for the presence of viral inclusion bodies by standard haematological methods. PEN in cod was found in the North Sea-. and in the Celtic Sea off southern Eire, thus extending the previous distribution data from the Atlantic-coastal waters. of North America. The blenny infection was also found in new sites on shores in the vicinity of Plymouth. Moreover, the cytology of these infectionswas as had been previously described. Collection data for the PEN infections showed an inverses; - relationship of infection incidence-with age for cod sample populations but no correlation was found for blenny sample populations. In addition, no external disease symptoms were observed in either type of infection. Concerning the recognition of the blenny infection, observations from maintaining blennies suggested the length of the natural infection might be inversely related to temperature; non-experimental longevities are quoted in this connection. The degree of infection in individual fish was estimated by light microscopy and the estimates for both erythrocytic infections cover the range 1 - 60 % infection. Attempts were made to propagate the viruses in vitro using fish cell and organ cultures. Primary cell cultures were originated from tissues of the Blenny, Flounder, Plaice and Dab using the protocol in the literature for marine fish cell culture. Vigorous cell outgrowth was observed in the flounder cultures and in these the time to confluence was only 3 - 5 days. However, established secondary cultures could not be derived from tissues of either <b>species.</b> <b>Plaice</b> and dab cultures were used for virus inoculation but the virus from the blenny infection and lymphocystis virus could not be propagated., Organ cultures were set up using skin blocks from the Flounder. With tris-buffered maintenance medium such cultures maintained histological integrity for 15 days. However, one - trial inoculation with lymphocystis virus showed no-integration or multiplication of the virus in the tissue. In connection with attempts to induce the blenny infection, the. effect of high temperature-in the Blenny was investigated. The infection was not induced over a 9 day holding period but lytic effects on the erythrocyte nuclei were observed. The effect of the drug acetylphenylhydrazine (APH) in the Blenny was also investigated with the aim of reproducing its reported action of anaemia induction and ensuing erythropoiesis. Marked anaemia was produced but not erythropoiesis. However, this result could not nesessarily be interpreted as the effect of APH alone. The viruses were identified and characterized with emphasis on their mophology, using ultrathin sectioning, negative staining and shadowing methods. It was concluded that the virus from the Blenny and lymphocystis virus conform to the structural measurements in the literature but negative staining indicated that both viruses display unique core structures. These are discussed {{in the light of the}} knowledge of other DNA virus cores. The position of these viruses is further considered with respect to their classification in the virus family Iridoviridae. University College of Wales, Aberystwyt...|$|E

Owing to their high mobility, consumers could act as integrators by connecting food webs. But do fish {{species in the}} North Sea link food webs of benthic communities or do they feed habitat dependent on a local scale? We examined the diet of the dominant benthic fish <b>species</b> (dab, <b>plaice,</b> whiting and grey gurnard) at the North Frisian sublitoral in the German Bight. The study area comprises various habitats with their typical benthic associations. Sediments from fine to coarse sands, gravel and even rocky habitats are present. The diet of fish from two different habitats (fine and coarse sands) was compared by two methods: (a) stomach content analyses to identify distinct prey items {{as a kind of}} snapshot and (b) stable isotopes (&# 948; 15 N) to investigate long-term differences of habitat-dependent diet, i. e. differences in trophic positions. Both methods enable us to estimate inter-specific differences in feeding, i. e. to determine trophic niches of species and to compare intra-specific differences of habitat-dependent diet. Knowledge on trophic interactions of fish based on habitat dependency might therefore provide a key to determine habitats essential for fish feeding, useful for the development of ecological management and strategies for conservation...|$|R

40|$|As a {{contribution}} to the ecosystem approach to fisheries management, we estimated the effects of spawning closures on stock status, ecosystem impacts and economic performance. We focused on the flatfish fishery in the North Sea and explored how spawning closures for plaice and sole contribute to sustainable management of 4 target <b>species</b> (sole, <b>plaice,</b> turbot and brill). Seasonal patterns in fishing effort and catchability by age group and area were estimated to quantify the effect of different spawning closure scenarios on the selection pattern. The scenario performance was evaluated using indicators of stock status (spawning stock biomass), economic performance of the fishery (yield, revenue) and ecosystem impact (discards, bycatch of cod and rays, seabed integrity, fisheries-induced evolution). In a single-species context, spawning closures may be beneficial for the target species, while in a mixed fisheries and ecosystem context, negative effects may occur. A spawning closure for plaice combines positive effects on the plaice stock and the revenue with reductions of the negative impact for several ecosystem indicators and only a small negative effect on sea bed integrity. The effects did not differ when evaluated at current levels of effort or at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) effort. Tailor-made solutions are required that need to be developed in stakeholder consultation to trade-off the ecological and economic objectives.

The latest survey results of cruise no. 152 conducted by FRV 'Walther Herwig III' do not indicate any improvements in state of the stocks, although no fishing effort was recently directed towards groundfish. The cod stock showed again a record low and is presently dominated by recruits of the year classes 1991 and 1993.

40|$|Tc 1 -like transposons {{are very}} widely {{distributed}} within the genomes of animal species. They consist of an {{inverted repeat sequence}} flanking a transposase gene with homology to the mobile DNA element, Tc 1 of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. These elements seem particularly to infest the genomes of fish and amphibian species where they can account for 1 % of the total genome. However, all vertebrate Tc 1 -like elements isolated so far are non-functional in that they contain multiple frameshifts within their transposase coding regions. Here I describe a Tc 1 -like transposon (PPTN) from the genome of a marine flatfish species (Pleuronectes platessa) which bears conserved inverted repeats flanking an apparently intact transposase gene. Closely related, although degenerate, Tc 1 -like transposons were also isolated from the genomes of Atlantic salmon (SSTN, Salmo salar) and frog (RTTN, Rana temporaria). Consensual nucleic acid sequences were derived by comparing several individual isolates from each species and conceptual amino acid sequences were thence derived for their transposases. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences with previously isolated Tc 1 -like transposases shows that the elements from plaice, salmon and frog comprise a new subfamily of Tc 1 -like transposons. Each member is distinct {{in that it is}} not found in the genomes of the other <b>species</b> tested. <b>Plaice</b> genomes contain about 300 copies of PPTN, salmon 1200 copies of SSTN and frog genomes about 500 copies of RTTN. The presence of these closely related elements in the genomes of fish and frog species, representing evolutionary lines, which diverged more than 400 million years ago, is not consistent with a vertical transmission model for their distributions...|$|R

40|$|In this microichthyological {{study the}} teeth and bony cores of gill rakers of three pleuronectiform <b>species</b> [European <b>plaice</b> Pleuronectes platessa Linnaeus, 1758 and European {{flounder}} Platichthys flesus trachurus (Duncer, 1892), {{both in the}} Pleuronectidae, and turbot Scophthalmus maximus (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Scophthalmidae] of the Baltic Sea are SEM imaged, described and compared for the first time. The shape and number of teeth in jaws and on pharyngeal tooth plates {{as well as the}} shape, size and number of the bony cores of gill rakers in these taxa differ. The European plaice and European flounder carry incisiform teeth anteriorly in their jaws and smoothly rounded, molariform teeth on pharyngeal tooth plates; the teeth of the plaice are more robust. The gill rakers have similar gross morphology, occurring as separate conical thornlets on gill arches. The bony cores of these thornlets (rakers) consist of vertical ribs with connective segments between them. The cores of gill rakers of the plaice and flounder reveal some differences in details. The plaice has cores with one peak, simple vertical ribs, and nodules on their lower thicker parts, while the flounder has cores with a side-branch and fine vertical ribs, which have parallel ribbing and tend to twist around the lower part of cores. The teeth of the jaws and pharyngeal tooth plates and the raker cores of the turbot are completely {{different from those of the}} plaice and flounder. In the turbot two main types of complex gill rakers are attached to the gill arches: one type has ‘sail’-shaped, high elements with one to two rows of fine conical teeth set in sockets; the other type has low tubercles with the same type of teeth. The differences among the species can be useful for studies of taxonomy and phylogeny, as well as for understanding their feeding habits...|$|R
40|$|Climate change, {{specifically}} temperature, {{affects the}} distribution and densities of species in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Here, {{we looked at the}} effect of temperature during winter and spawning period on latitudinal range shifts and changes in abundance of two non-commercial North Sea fish species, solenette (Buglossidium luteum) and scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna). Both species have increased in abundance and moved to the north since the late 1980 s, coinciding with a series of mild winters. In 1996, following a very cold winter, the abundance of both species temporarily decreased as they retracted to the south. The shift in temperature affected adult habitat conditions, allowing them to immigrate into new areas where they subsequently reproduced successfully. We can conclude this because recruitment improved following the increase in abundance. The recruitment relates significantly to the higher adult stock and higher temperatures. The predictions of higher average temperatures and milder winters in the North Sea make it likely that these species will increase further in abundance and move northward. The observed increase in abundance of these small flatfish species will affect the North Sea food web and therefore commercial <b>species,</b> e. g. <b>plaice,</b> by predation on juveniles and competition for benthic food resource...|$|R
40|$|We used Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) of mtDNA {{control region}} {{to assess the}} {{population}} structure of the flatfish Pleuronectes platessa (plaice), to compare these data with a previous study based on microsatellite loci, and to test for possible sex-biased dispersal. From 461 individuals, 163 haplotypes were identified across 11 locations. Diversity was higher with mtDNA (h = 0. 776 to 0. 981; = 0. 0178 to 0. 0298) as compared to microsatellite loci using the same samples (He = 0. 721 to 0. 77). Genetic diversity was lower in samples from Iceland and Faroe, {{as compared to the}} continental shelf samples. Although both classes of markers revealed a relatively strong differentiation between shelf and off-shelf populations (= 0. 1015 and = 0. 0351, respectively), only the mtDNA data were able to detect differentiation within the continental shelf, i. e., a North Sea-Irish Sea group which was weakly distinguishable from Norway (= 0. 0046), the Baltic (= 0. 0136) and the Bay of Biscay (= 0. 0162). No evidence was obtained for isolation by distance, nor for sex-biased dispersal.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse at fine scale the annual, seasonal and spatial distributions of several species in the Eastern English Channel (EEC). On the one hand, data obtained from scientific surveys are not available all year through, but are considered to provide consistent yearly and spatially resolved abundance indices. On the other hand, on-board commercial data do cover the whole year, but generally provide a biased perception of stock abundance. The combination of scientific and commercial catches per unit of effort (CPUEs), standardized using a delta-generalized linear model, allowed to infer spatial and monthly dynamics of fish distributions in the EEC, which could be compared with previous knowledge on their life cycles. Considering the scientific survey as a repository, the degree of reliability of commercial CPUEs was assessed with survey-based distribution using the Local Index of Collocation. Large scale information was in agreement with literature, especially for cuttlefish. Fine scale consistency between survey and commercial data was significant for half of the 19 tested species (e. g. whiting, cod). For the other <b>species</b> (e. g. <b>plaice,</b> thornback ray), the results were inconclusive, mainly owing to poor commercial data coverage and/or to particular aspects of the species biology...|$|R
40|$|In many {{fisheries}} multiple {{species are}} simultaneously caught while stock assessments and fishing quota are defined at species level. Yet species caught together often share habitat and resources, resulting in interspecific resource competition. The consequences of resource competition on population dynamics and revenue of simultaneously harvested species has received little attention {{due to the}} historical single stock approach in fisheries management. Here we present {{the results of a}} modelling study on the interaction between resource competition of sole (Solea solea) and slaice (Pleuronectus platessa) and simultaneous harvesting of these species, using a stage-structured population model. Three resources were included of which one is shared with a varied competition intensity. We find that plaice is the better competitor of the two <b>species</b> and adult <b>plaice</b> are more abundant than adult sole. When competition is high sole population biomass increases with increasing fishing effort prior to plaice extinction. As a result of this increase in the sole population, the revenue of the stocks combined as function of effort becomes bimodal with increasing resource competition. When considering a single stock quota for sole, its recovery with increasing effort may result in even more fishing effort that would drive the plaice population to extinction. When sole and plaice compete for resources the highest revenue is obtained at effort levels at which plaice is extinct. Ignoring resource competition promotes overfishing due to increasing stock of one species prior to extinction of the other species. Consequently, efforts to mitigate the decline in one species will not be effective if increase...|$|R
40|$|Plaice Pleuronectes platessa (Linnaeus, 1758) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} commercial flatfish in the European continent, whose captures have reduced considerably in recent decades due to the high pressure of fisheries. Despite the wide distribution of this species, most studies have focused on the North Sea, its central area of occurrence, and very little information is available concerning the populations living at the northern limit of its distribution. Age determination is essential to study population dynamics of commercially important <b>species</b> such as <b>plaice,</b> and can be inferred through otolith microstructure analysis. The aim of this work was to investigate the timing of early life events (spawning, larval, metamorphosis and settlement stage duration) and growth of juvenile plaice in two cold-water nursery areas in northern Norway (Valosen estuary and Storfjord). A latitudinal cline was observed in the main life-history events, such as spawning, and the onset of larval and metamorphosis stages. Settlement to benthic habitats (which coincides with metamorphosis) was estimated to have occurred between mid-May and early-September (peak from the end May and mid July) in the Valosen, and between the end of May and early July (peak in June) in the Storfjord. In the Storfjord area, larval and metamorphosis stage duration seemed to be shorter, probably due to a reduced window of opportunity for growth and survival at the northernmost extremes. Size at settlement was negatively related with hatch day, implying that the older larvae were larger at settlement, a consequence of higher fecundity of females earlier in the spawning season. A significant relationship between size at settlement and total length reinforced this evidence. The results demonstrate the influence of latitude in the early life stages of plaice, mainly by the regulatory effect of temperature in the growth and survival of larvae and juveniles...|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} dynamics of juvenile flatfish were investigated {{on the west}} coast of Ireland. Firstly, beach seining was carried out to assess spatial and temporal variations in flatfish assemblages, on sandy beach nursery grounds, in two regions, {{on the west coast}} of Ireland, Galway Bay (2002 to 2003) and Dingle Co. Kerry (2000 to 2003). In both locations 0 + plaice generally were numerically dominant in the catches. This is consistent with flatfish assemblages in European waters. There was a significant difference between beaches in the <b>species</b> composition and <b>plaice</b> densities in Galway Bay, while no annual differences could be discerned. Secondly, a push-net survey was carried out in Galway Bay from 2002 to 2003, to determine the settlement, seasonal occurrence, growth and mortality of 0 + plaice. Settlement occurred in late April in 2002, and in late March of 2003. Higher peak densities were recorded in 2003. Growth rates were similar to a predicted growth model obtained at optimal feeding conditions. Daily mortality rates were within that recorded elsewhere in European waters. Experimental push-netting showed that depth does not influence the catches of 0 + plaice in shallow water. Sampling at night produced significantly higher densities of 0 + plaice. Thirdly, otolith microstructure was used to determine hatching dates, larval period, settlement dates and growth of 0 + plaice in Galway Bay in 2003. Hatching time ranged from late January to late March. The larval period for fish ranged from 28 to 43 d, the lowest recorded in Europe. This was consistent with sea temperature, where higher temperatures have lower larval periods. Settlement period was longer than that determined by sampling, ranging from early to mid March to late April. Three cohorts of settlement were noted, which corresponded to pulses in hatching. Observed growth was similar to predicted growth and a strong inverse relationship was noted between growth and density...|$|R
40|$|In {{the food}} industry, {{hypochlorite}} {{is used to}} reduce the microbiological load of foodstuffs. Its use may result {{in the formation of}} toxic disinfection byproducts. However it is currently generally accepted that below particular intensities its use does not represent a safety concern even in direct contact with foods. In addition however, the use of hypochlorite in contact with foods should also be considered in the framework of consumer acceptance. The formation of 3 -chlorotyrosine seems a potential analytical target to assess the use of hypochlorite in foods. Firstly, the potency of 3 -chlorotyrosine was evaluated as an indicator for the use of hypochlorite in contact with foods in comparison with the other molecular changes in proteins using casein and whey proteins as a model at various oxidant/protein ratios and at different pHs. Secondly, 3 -chlorotyrosine formation was evaluated in four fish <b>species</b> (whiting, European <b>plaice,</b> gilthead seabream and Atlantic salmon) as a result of hypochlorite dipping. The last set of experiments studied the formation and occurrence of 3 -chlorotyrosine in ready-to-eat (RTE) vegetables on the Belgian market. In addition, the dietary exposure via RTE vegetable consumption for Belgian and Spanish populations, exemplifying Northern European lower RTE vegetable consumption and Mediterranean higher consumption patterns, was estimated. This study has demonstrated, for the first time, that 3 -chlorotyrosine is a potential marker to detect the use of hypochlorite disinfectants in fish fillets and vegetables. The levels of 3 -chlorotyrosine not only depend on the level of hypochlorite used, but also on the pH, the type of protein and its tyrosine content. This study is the very first to assess the dietary exposure of populations to 3 -chlorotyrosine through the consumption of RTE vegetables. Overall, the results indicated that even a small amount of hypochlorite in the washing water can generate relevant concentrations of 3 -chlorotyrosine in the treated vegetable. On the basis of this study, concerns with respect to the impact of the use of hypochlorite on chemical food safety are identified...|$|R
