25|$|Scott {{entered the}} room {{that had been set}} aside for Crabbe, wet and hurried, and embraced Crabbe with brotherly affection. The royal gift was forgotten— the ample skirt of the coat within which it had been packed, and which he had {{hitherto}} held cautiously in front of his person, slipped back to its more usual position— he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> Crabbe, and the glass was crushed to atoms. His scream and gesture made his wife conclude that he had sat down on a pair of scissors, or the like: but very little harm had been done except the breaking of the glass.|$|E

2500|$|Annett {{followed}} him to the station, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> him, and offered some cigarettes. Von Janowski lit the cigarette using the same Belgian matches he had at the hotel. Annett grew even more suspicious and alerted a Quebec Provincial Police constable, who quickly boarded the train as it pulled away from the station and began searching for the stranger. The policeman located von Janowski, who said he was a radio salesman from Toronto. He stuck with this story until the policeman asked to search his bags; the stranger then confessed: [...] "That will not be necessary. I am a German officer who serves his country as you do yourself." [...] Inspection of von Janowski's personal effects upon his arrest revealed that he was carrying a powerful radio transmitter, among other things.|$|E

60|$|The red man {{paused a}} moment, with a {{slightly}} troubled look, but the shadow passed like a fleeting cloud as he dropped his arm, and, {{with an air of}} simple humility, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>beside</b> his friend.|$|R
60|$|Emboldened by her silence, and by {{the softer}} {{expression}} of her face, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> close <b>beside</b> her, and anon placed his hand on hers. She withdrew it quietly and serenely as was her wont, but quite without anger.|$|R
60|$|After long palaver, Ghibba came {{shuffling}} over to him, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> him.|$|E

60|$|He recoiled {{from the}} door, {{like a man}} walking in his sleep, awakened from a frightful dream; and put the gun aside. Clasping his hands before his face, he then <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>beside</b> the fire, and found relief in tears.|$|R
60|$|Ethelberta came indoors one {{day from}} the University boat-race, and <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> without speaking, <b>beside</b> Picotee, as if lost in thought.|$|R
60|$|He {{presently}} {{stood by}} the side of John. The latter had coiled up the rope, and laid it by him; and had then thrown himself down, and was sobbing bitterly. Jonas <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> quietly <b>beside</b> him, till he had recovered his composure.|$|R

60|$|The two servant-girls, with Jean and {{her cousin}} Aggie Wilson, ran at once into an inner room {{and shut the}} door. Ramblin' Peter <b>sat</b> stolidly <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> the fire and calmly stirred the porridge-pot, which was nearly full of the {{substantial}} Scottish fare.|$|R
60|$|Of the strangers, he took no heed whatever. He {{had seen}} them, but {{appeared}} quite incapable of interest or curiosity. The younger brother stood apart.

60|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> rather <b>beside</b> Betty, {{and turned}} her face away. She still held the young woman's hand which she {{squeezed}} so tightly as to make its owner wince. Betty stole a look at her, and saw the rich red blood mantling her cheeks, and her full bosom heave.|$|R

60|$|Four or five {{stations}} {{farther on}} the train halted at a lonely-looking place consisting of the station house and a barn, surrounded by scrub woods and blueberry barrens.

60|$|He must {{suddenly}} have remembered, and recalled {{also that}} he and his ally Worthington had been on opposite sides in the Woodchuck Session, for he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> abruptly <b>beside</b> the door, and remained there for a while.
