50|$|The roller-locked bolt {{assembly}} {{consists of a}} bolt head, two rollers, a striker <b>sleeve,</b> <b>bolt</b> body, and a large return spring, {{which is responsible for}} pushing the {{bolt assembly}} into battery (the locked position) and returning it there when it is unlocked and pushed backwards by the recoil of firing or by the charging handle. As the striker sleeve is movable back and forth within the bolt assembly, the return spring is also responsible for pushing the striker sleeve forward during locking (described below). The bolt assembly locks with the barrel's breech (the end the cartridge is loaded into) via a prong type barrel extension behind the breech. As it is recoil-operated and fired from an open bolt, the weapon must be manually charged with the side-mounted charging handle.|$|E
50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} a roller locked bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} the bolt head, a pair of rollers, the striker <b>sleeve,</b> <b>bolt</b> body and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed cams, unlocking the bolt head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the rear together guided by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the impact of the rollers against the camming surfaces on the breech carry the rollers from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker sleeve, force the rollers outward, locking the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the buffer head, sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the ejector pin. This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|E

50|$|Weatherby's {{requirements}} {{included a}} bolt face which was countersunk into the bolt which would enclose the cartridge's casehead while the bolt head was enclosed in a counterbored barrel breach, {{which in turn}} would prevent the casehead from rupturing. If a rupture should occur, the bolt would have holes through which hot gases could be vented safely towards the side {{and away from the}} shooter's face. Further as an extra safety measure he required an enclosed or shrouded <b>bolt</b> <b>sleeve</b> that would prevent the hot gases from making their way through the bolt mechanism to the shooter's face. To Weatherby, the safety and strength of the design were paramount.|$|R
50|$|The M98 action {{features}} {{two large}} oval shaped gas relief holes {{on the bottom}} of the bolt, which when catastrophic failures like a primer, cartridge rupture or detonation occur relieve high pressure gases into the magazine, and a gas shield on the <b>bolt</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Military M98 systems feature a secondary gas relieve where gas is routed down the locking lug raceway to a thumb hole cutout exit on left side of receiver. Civilian M98 systems often lack the thumb hole cut out, as the ammunition feeding is generally simplified to single round feeding only. These safety features are designed to route escaping gas out of the bolt and eventual debris away from the operator's face.|$|R
50|$|The rifle's {{safety is}} similar to that of the Mauser 1898; however, instead of being threaded, the <b>bolt</b> <b>sleeve</b> is fixed to the bolt by way of lugs. The rifle has a pistol grip stock, but with no {{grasping}} grooves. Its upper handguard runs from the receiver ring to the lower band. The upper and lower bands are both thinner than on a Mauser, and there is a parade hook for the upper band. The nose cap of the rifle has a short H bayonet lug, so a only a bayonet with a muzzle ring can be fitted to it. The lower barrel band has a swivel, and there is a quick-release sling fitting behind the stock's pistol grip.|$|R
50|$|The A-Bolt rifle is a bolt-action rifle. It uses a {{non-rotating}} <b>bolt</b> <b>sleeve</b> (partial sleeve {{on first}} generation A-bolt rifles). When the bolt is unlocked, smoothness is achieved with three guide ribs aligned with three locking lugs, enabling precise movement (only {{on the second}} and third generation A-bolt rifles). These three locking lugs also greatly increase bolt strength. The bolt's smoothness is also increased with a unique cartridge depressor; the cartridge depressor stays in place independent of the bolt's position. Near the end of the reloading cycle, when the bolt is re-inserted, the bolt moves gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The barrel is free-floating and the recoil lug is glass bedded.|$|R
50|$|In 1916, the Canadian Expeditionary Force {{was desperately}} short of light machine guns. Since the Ross rifle had finally {{been taken out}} of service, there were large numbers of surplus rifles.That year, Joseph Huot, an {{engineer}} from Richmond, Quebec, adapted the Ross' straight-pull bolt action. His sample model, which shared 33 parts with the Ross Mark III, had a gas piston parallel to the barrel, which moved a <b>sleeve</b> on the <b>bolt</b> backward, operating the action. To absorb excess energy, the bolt was buffered. The entire mechanism was sheathed in sheet metal. Huot copied the cooling system from the Lewis Gun, then standard in British Army service. It fed from a 25-round drum magazine. He filed Canadian patents; #193724 on 8 March 1917 (granted 4 November 1919) and #193725 on 13 November 1917.|$|R
50|$|The cocking piece {{doubles as}} a safety and is {{attached}} {{at the rear of}} the <b>bolt</b> <b>sleeve</b> assembly and secures the firing pin. When the cocking piece ending in a cocking ring is pulled rearward and turned horizontal, the cocking piece sear can be placed in a recessed safety slot in the bolt plug. This slot is shorter than the firing slot so the firing pin cannot protrude past the face of the bolt cylinder. Any contact with the cartridge primer is thus prevented. The safe mode also prevents the action from being cycled hence preventing the bolt from accidental opening. The operating ring is quite large, making it easy to operate with gloves. When the operating ring is in the vertical position and pulled back by cycling the action or cocking it by hand the action is ready to fire.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of space latticed shell structure using fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) tubular members is a promising practice wherein {{the key issue}} is to join different components together. In this study, a <b>bolted</b> <b>sleeve</b> joint in a staggered pattern was designed for joining square tubular pultruded FRP members into the proposed system inspired by Unistrut&# 0174;. The current study focuses on the joint performance under tensile loading {{and a total of}} four groups of specimen were prepared. Key parameters including bolt type (normal bolt or blind bolt), element dimensions (e. g. tube and bolt dimensions) and bolt group layouts were chosen and studied. During experiments, the failure modes, load-displacement and load-strain relationships were recorded to assess the joint performance. The test results demonstrate that a desirable ultimate load carrying capacity can be achieved by optimising element dimensions and bolt group layout when using normal bolt. Besides, when blind bolts are used, the compromise between easier fixing and joint performance must be considered...|$|R
50|$|The SIG MG 710-3 is an automatic, {{air-cooled}} belt-fed weapon {{operated by}} roller-delayed blowback and fires {{from an open}} bolt. The machine gun's bolt differs from other contemporary designs employing the short recoil method of operation (such as CETME and Heckler & Koch designed weapons), being a 3-piece design that consists of a bolt head with two locking rollers, a striker <b>sleeve</b> and the <b>bolt</b> carrier which is connected telescopically with the bolt head. When a round is chambered pressure from the return spring drives the bolt and carrier assembly forward; simultaneously both rollers engage camming surfaces which drive the rollers outward from their compressed travel position into recesses in the barrel extension. Upon firing, the bolt carrier and striker assembly recoil to the rear and the geometry of the fixed camming surfaces drives the rollers inward unlocking the bolt breech and increasing {{the speed at which}} the striker sleeve withdraws relative to the bolt. As the slower bolt continues rearward it impacts the returning striker sleeve (this impact decelerates the bolt).|$|R
40|$|Strengthening of {{reinforced}} concrete columns by jacketing {{is one of}} the most common structural rehabilitation techniques in Brazil. For adequate performance, it is necessary, among others, to avoid detachment of the new concrete layer (strengthening material) from the old concrete substrate when the strengthened member is again in service conditions. This paper describes the test results of eight {{reinforced concrete}} rectangular columns subjected to combined compression and one-axis bending to evaluate the efficiency of using <b>sleeve</b> wedge <b>bolts</b> across the new concrete/old concrete interface to avoid detachment. The strengthening technique, in this case, consists of adding a layer of self-compacting concrete to one face of the column. Two columns tested were monolithic and named PO (original column) e PR (reference column). The other six columns were strengthened using a new 35 mm thick self-compacting concrete layer attached to the column face subjected to highest compressive stresses. Column PO had a 120 mm by 250 mm rectangular cross section and its results gave information about column behavior without the use of strengthening. Column PR had a 155 mm by 250 mm rectangular cross section and its cross section dimensions matched the strengthened columns but it was cast monolithically. To improve bond conditions between the existing concrete and the new concrete, the concrete surface was roughened and the outermost aggregate was exposed using hydro jetting. Holes along the concrete surface were made to insert the wedge bolts responsible for increasing the bond between the two concrete surfaces. The difference among the six strengthened columns was the position and amount of bolts used. Results indicate that the position and amount of the bolts alters significantly the strength capacity of the columns, since premature rupture by concrete detachment was delayed...|$|R
40|$|Pultruded {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} polymers (GFRP) profile is a promising structural member for space latticed shell structures {{because of the}} advantageous properties such as high strength-to-weight ratio (in pultrusion direction), corrosion resistance and lower maintenance. In particular, when tubular profiles are used, a better resistance against local buckling, global buckling and lateral torsional buckling can be achieved compared with open sections. Despite the advantageous characteristics, the design and fabrication of tubular connections {{has been identified as}} a critical issue for the proposed applications due primarily to the geometric constraints of the closed shape, the distinct material properties of FRP, and the threedimensional nature of space latticed shell structures. Until recently, {{only a limited number of}} connection systems have been proposed for FRP space latticed shell structures and there is still a need to develop a simple, economic and versatile joining method. This thesis proposed a <b>bolted</b> <b>sleeve</b> joint (BSJ) for assembling GFRP tubular profiles into space latticed shell structures. In the proposed BSJ, the FRP profile and steel connector are telescoped and clamped using mechanical bolts. The end of the steel connector can be incorporated with compatible end fittings for connection to a nodal joint for space latticed shell structure. The proposed BSJ allows the flexibility in adjusting design parameters such as the bolt group configuration, memb 9 er size and type of fastener, depending on the design requirements. In addition, all connecting elements are commercially available and no advanced techniques are required for the fabrication. The joint performances were investigated at three level, namely joint level, component level and structural level. Stage one Goint level) focused on the joint design and performance under static axial loadings. Four batches of specimens were prepared and tested under static axial tension and compression. Design parameters, including the type of fastener (ordinary bolt or blind bolt), member size, and bolt group layout, were selected and examined. A simple analytical design model was proposed to estimate the joint capacity, showing good agreement with experiment. Design recommendations based on the current investigation were also made for the further improvement of joint performance. Stage two (component level) was an experimental and numerical study on the member capacity of pultruded GFRP square tubular profile with BSJ end conditions. Three batches of specimens assembled with FRP profiles in different lengths and BSJs at both ends were prepared and tested under static axial compression. A detailed 3 D FE model considering bolt geometry, contact behaviour, bolt pretension, initial geometric imperfection and FRP failure criterion, was developed and validated with experimental results, showing good agreement. The relationship between effective length factor and member slenderness was derived based on FEA, and then used in conjunction with existing pultruded GFRP box tubular column design equations to predict the member capacity of structural members with BSJ end conditions. The final stage (structural level) investigated the performance of BSJ at a structural level. An experimental investigation was first conducted to obtain the M- () behaviour of BSJ. It was followed by a structural analysis and design of an FRP domed roof with BSJ modelled by spring elements using FEA. The inputs of the joint rotational stiffness and axial stiffness for the springs were determined from the linear portions of the orresponding experimental curves. The ULS and SLS performance of the FRP domed roof were evaluated on a LRFD basis under ASCE- 07 design loads. Parametric studies were also performed to identify the effects of joint rotational stiffness, axial stiffness and the materials (steel or pultruded GFRP) used for structural members on the structural performance. Design recommendations were also developed based on the structural analysis and the parametric studies. Awards: Vice-Chancellor’s Commendation for Masters Thesis Excellence in 2015...|$|R
