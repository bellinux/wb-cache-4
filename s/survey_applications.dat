50|$|Passive {{and active}} surveys are {{performed}} using software and typically require only a compatible off-the-shelf Wi-Fi adapter; no additional specialized hardware is required. Predictive surveys require no hardware at all, as no wireless data collection is needed. Currently, professional-level site <b>survey</b> <b>applications</b> exist primarily for Microsoft Windows. Some site <b>survey</b> <b>applications</b> for other platforms, including iOS and Android, also exist, however they {{are limited in}} functionality due to {{the limitations of the}} underlying platform API.

50|$|Boomer sound {{sources are}} used for shallow water seismic surveys, mostly for {{engineering}} <b>survey</b> <b>applications.</b> Boomers are towed in a floating sled behind a survey vessel. Similar to the plasma source, a boomer source stores energy in capacitors, but it discharges through a flat spiral coil instead of generating a spark. A copper plate adjacent to the coil flexes away from the coil as the capacitors are discharged. This flexing is transmitted into the water as the seismic pulse.|$|E

40|$|Strap-down {{inertial}} navigation system (SDINS) is considered as a highly sophisticated dead reckoning system. The SDINS consists mainly of two triads {{the first is the}} three gyros triad, and the second is the three accelerometers triad. Modeling the SDINS has achieved a lot of importance in the literature, especially for <b>surveying</b> <b>applications.</b> However, using the SDINS for spacecraft applications imply some modifications to the SDINS deterministic models used for <b>surveying</b> <b>applications.</b> Traditional models of the SDINS include the effect of the earth rotational rate on the SDINS instruments (gyros, and accelerometers). This effect must be removed from the instrument model if the SDINS is to be used onboard of a spacecraft simply because the spacecraft doesn’t rest on the earth, and thus doesn’t sense the earth’s rotational rate. Necessary modifications of the accompanying algorithms are derived analytically in the research at hand...|$|R
