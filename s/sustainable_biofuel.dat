5|$|In January 2009, Continental Airlines used a <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuel</b> {{to power}} a {{commercial}} aircraft {{for the first}} time in North America. This demonstration flight marks the first <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuel</b> demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a twin-engined aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, powered by CFM International CFM56-7B engines. The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants. The algae oil was provided by Sapphire Energy, and the jatropha oil by Terasol Energy.|$|E
25|$|There {{is clearly}} a demand for <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuel</b> production, but whether a {{particular}} biofuel will be used ultimately depends not on sustainability but cost efficiency. Therefore, research is focusing on cutting the cost of algal biofuel production {{to the point where}} it can compete with conventional petroleum. The production of several products from algae has been mentioned as the most important factor for making algae production economically viable. Other factors are the improving of the solar energy to biomass conversion efficiency (currently 3%, but 5 to 7% is theoretically attainable)and making the oil extraction from the algae easier.|$|E

The International Resource Panel, which provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice {{on a variety of}} resource-related themes, assessed the issues relating to biofuel use in its first report Towards sustainable production and use of resources: Assessing Biofuels. [...] "Assessing Biofuels" [...] outlined the wider and interrelated factors that need to be considered when deciding on the relative merits of pursuing one biofuel over another. It concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their impact on climate, energy security and ecosystems, and suggested that environmental and social impacts need to be assessed throughout the entire life-cycle.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, Continental {{announced}} that it would commence providing seasonal non-stop service between Houston and Rio de Janeiro. The new non-stop flight was timed to provide roundtrip flight connections at Continental's Houston hub to more than 160 cities throughout the U.S., Canada, Central America, Europe, and Asia. Continental renewed its lease for around [...] in Continental Center I. Continental {{announced that}} its 4th quarter 2008 net loss widened to $266million on costs for pilot retirement and reducing the value of its fuel hedges. In January 2009, Continental became the first commercial carrier to successfully demonstrate the use of <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuel</b> to power an aircraft in North America. During the demonstration flight, Continental's test pilots successfully conducted a number of flight maneuvers, and the biofuel met all performance requirements as compared with traditional jet fuel. The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants, both sustainable, second-generation sources that do not impact food crops or water resources or contribute to deforestation. In March 2009, Continental became the first U.S. carrier to inaugurate scheduled service between New York and Shanghai, China, with daily non-stop flights from the airline's hub at Newark Liberty International Airport.|$|E
50|$|Many {{different}} standards exist for certification of <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuels.</b> One such standard often cited by airlines {{is the one}} developed by the The Roundtable For <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Biofuels.</b> Nearly all such standards include a minimum amount of greenhouse gas reduction and consideration that biofuels do not compete with food.|$|R
5|$|The Roundtable on <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Biofuels</b> is an {{international}} initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists {{who are interested in}} the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution.

While there is consensus {{on the need for}} a <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuels</b> industry, there is little consensus on how to proceed to avoid environmental and social degradation with global biofuel production. A literature review of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) data, and the generic Strategic Life-Cycle Management (SLCM) and Template for Sustainable Product Development (TSPD) approaches, helped to inform the creation of a specific tool for <b>sustainable</b> industrial <b>biofuels</b> development, called the TSPD for biofuels. Other data collection involved expert and industry dialogue, as well as stakeholder feedback, on the content of the TSPD. Results showed a variety of sustainability challenges and opportunities, the most significant of which concerns agricultural production. Compelling measures for a <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuels</b> industry include: cooperation among all stakeholders using a systems approach based on strategic <b>sustainable</b> development, <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuels</b> certification; and government policies to stimulate research into new technologies and feedstocks, as well as to reduce consumption and increase efficiency...|$|R

30|$|Within the EU {{framework}} for transport biofuels, the following {{groups of the}} involved actors can be required to make reports at the national level: biofuel producers, importers, deliverers, distributors, and users. Distributors {{seem to be the}} most appropriate group [42]. There are guidelines at the national level from the Swedish Energy Authority about what groups of actors are obliged to submit information about the use of <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuels</b> to the national official energy statistics (see Swedish national documents STEMFS 2006 : 1 and STEMFS 2007 : 1). The list includes producers, importers, and distributors, though this list should be analyzed further. Information about to what extent the sustainability criteria are fulfilled is better collected {{at the beginning of the}} production chain. Information about the amount of <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuels</b> delivered and used is better collected at the end of the production chain [42]. Reporting of the latter type will support calculations of the amount <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuels</b> used by the EU member states [43].|$|R

5000|$|Continental Airlines, was {{the first}} {{commercial}} airline to test a 50:50 blend of bio-derived “green jet” fuel and traditional jet fuel in the first demonstration {{of the use of}} <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuel</b> to power a commercial aircraft in North America.( [...] January 2009). The demonstration flight, conducted in partnership with Boeing, GE Aviation/CFM International, and Honeywell’s UOP, marked the first <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuel</b> demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a two-engine aircraft: a Boeing 737-800 equipped with CFM International CFM56-7B engines. Continental ran the blend in Engine No. 2. During the two-hour test flight, Continental pilots engaged the aircraft in a number of normal and non-normal flight maneuvers, such as mid-flight engine shutdown and restart, and power accelerations and decelerations. A Continental engineer recorded flight data on board. KLM, the Royal Dutch Airline, {{was the first}} airline to operate a passenger-carrying flight using biofuel. On 23 November 2009, a Boeing 747 flew, carrying a limited number of passengers, with one of its four engines running on a 50/50 mix of biofuel and kerosene.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the same}} {{problems}} that affect biofuels also affect bioliquids and there are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals.

50|$|Unfortunately, the {{production}} of palm oil has {{detrimental effects on the}} environment and is not considered to be a <b>sustainable</b> <b>biofuel.</b> The deforestation occurring throughout Malaysia and Indonesia {{as a result of the}} growing demand for this plant has made scarce natural habitats for orangutans and other rainforest dwellers. More carbon is released during the life cycle of a palm oil plant to its use as a biofuel than is emitted by the same volume of fossil fuels.|$|E
