5000|$|A solar powered Stirling {{engine is}} a heat engine {{powered by a}} {{temperature}} gradient generated by the sun. It was patented by Roelf J. Meijer in 1987.His invention relates a heat engine, such as a Stirling cycle engine, with a <b>solar</b> <b>dish</b> collector {{in order to produce}} electricity. This apparatus consists of a large dish aimed at the sun to reflect the rays into the focus point, which is located {{at the center of the}} dish. Solar energy is then collected in the form of heat to fuel a Stirling cycle engine, [...] which operates by letting heat flow from a hot source to a cold sink in order to do work. The work output of the Stirling cycle is then used to drive a generator and create electric power. Moreover, in Meijer’s solar-powered engine, it is important that the dish always be pointed directly at the sun so that no shadows would be present in the <b>solar</b> <b>dish</b> collector, hence optimizing heat collection. This is where he ran into some issues because, in order for the apparatus to have a complete range of motion, lubrication and rotational systems would be necessary and may compromise structural stability.|$|E

30|$|The two-axis {{tracking}} {{system could be}} an azimuth-elevation tracking or polar tracking. In azimuth-elevation tracking, {{which is the most}} common method used in large <b>solar</b> <b>dish</b> systems, the dish rotates in a plane parallel to the earth (azimuth) and in another plane perpendicular to it (elevation), which gives the collector left–right and up–down rotation. Rotational rates can be easily calculated during all day. In polar tracking, which is the most common method in small <b>solar</b> <b>dish</b> systems, the collector rotates about an axis parallel to the earth’s axis of rotation. The collector rotates at a constant rate of 15 ° per hour to match the rotational speed of the earth. The other axis of rotation, the declination axis, is perpendicular to the polar axis. Movement about this axis occurs slowly and varies by ± 23.5 ° over a year [13].|$|E

Furthermore we propose a quick process to optimize the system to provide the maximum solar energy to net heat efficiency for different optical error under typical condition.
