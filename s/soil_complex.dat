The most appropriate indicators for early diagnosis of the condition and sustainability assessment of soils were the contents of microbial biomass, {{the intensity of the}} basal respiration and microbial metabolic quotient. Recorded time quantitative and structural-taxonomic restructuring of ecological trophic groups of microorganisms exhibited orientation of the elementary soil-biological processes and allowed detail to assess the state of soils of disturbed forest ecosystems. Successions of soil microorganisms reflected stages of plant succession after cutting. Structural and functional changes in the microbial <b>soil</b> <b>complexes</b> marked by only one-two years after cutting of coniferous forests. For the grassy stage in deciduous young stands, there was an increase in soil microbial activity that accompanied the development of the sod process. Microbiological processes were balanced and comparable to the control at the stage of closed 30 -year-old stands. Post-fire recovery of the microbial <b>soil</b> <b>complexes</b> was determined by fire severity and by the properties of soils and vegetation succession. Functional activity of microbial <b>soil</b> <b>complexes</b> were recovered in one or two years after a low-intensity fires, whereas after high-intensity fires – was not recovered in eight years. Indicative responses of soil microorganisms in the sustainable impact of aggressive pollutants tundra zone of the Norilsk industrial region were registered at the functional and at the structural level. In areas of moderate and weak disturbances of vegetation, there were quantitative changes, whereas strong disturbances and constant exposure to pollutants marked structural and taxonomic adjustment of microbial <b>soil</b> <b>complexes,</b> disturbed dynamic processes of synthesis-mineralization and reduced adaptive capacity saprophytic microorganisms as to the existence of low temperatures, and to the effects of pollutants.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the feasibility of monitoring chromium contaminated field using complex dielectric constant method, {{we designed an experiment}} to compare the <b>soil</b> <b>complex</b> dielectric constants in conditions of different chromium pollution concentration, soil water content and void ratio. The result shows that, the complex dielectric constant of contaminated soil decreases obviously with the increasing frequency. And, when the frequency is lower than 50 MHz, a significant change of the real and imaginary parts of <b>soil</b> <b>complex</b> dielectric constant can be observed. Moreover, with the increasing chromium pollutants concentration, water content and void ratio, both of the real and imaginary parts of <b>soil</b> <b>complex</b> dielectric constant increase as well. With the analysis of the relationship among soil dielectric constant, moisture content, and chromium pollution concentration, we built two soil dielectric constant models on the real quantity and imaginary quantity.

The real part of dielectric permittivity was assessed from the 380 – 440 MHz, while the bulk electrical conductivity was calculated from the 165 – 325 MHz range. The FDR technique allows determination of bulk electrical conductivity from the imaginary part of the complex dielectric permittivity, without disregarding the dielectric losses. The soil salinity status was determined using the salinity index, defined as a partial derivative of the soil bulk electrical conductivity with respect to the real part of the <b>soil</b> <b>complex</b> dielectric permittivity. The salinity index method enables determining the soil water electrical conductivity value. For the five sandy mineral soils that have been tested, the relationship between bulk electrical conductivity and the real part of dielectric permittivity is essentially linear.

40|$|A palaeomagnetic {{investigation}} of a late Quatemary loess-palaeosol sequence in central China has revealed two episodes of anomalous geomagnetic field behaviour in the lower and upper parts of <b>soil</b> <b>complex</b> Sl, which spans the last interglacial interval. Comparison of the magnetic susceptibility record with the deep-sea oxygen isotope stratigraphy provides a chronology which {{has been used to}} estimate the age and duration of these episodes. The age of the younger episode has been estimated at 89 - 75 ka, comparable with the age of a geomagnetic event recognised from sediments in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea and Arctic Ocean. The older episode is associated with a broad low in relative palaeointensity which has been assigned to the time interval 130 - 110 ka. This is consistent with existing age estimates of the so-called Blake Event. In contrast o a published record of the Blake Event from the loess at Xining, which shows three short episodes of almost full reversed polarity, in the current record the Blake Event is represented by a loop in the VGP path which passes through shallow southern latitudes. Although both episodes occur within the same part of <b>soil</b> <b>complex</b> Sl, {{the difference between the two}} records implies a greater degree of smoothing of the geomagnetic signal in the Huanxian record. This is probably a reflection of the lower accumulation rate at Huanxian and may also indicate a greater time constant for the remanence aquisition at this site. 1...|$|E

40|$|International audienceHigh-resolution {{multidisciplinary}} {{investigation of}} key European loess-palaeosols profiles {{have demonstrated that}} loess sequences result from rapid and cyclic aeolian sedimentation which is reflected in variations of loess grain size indexes and correlated with Greenland ice-core dust records. This correlation suggests a global connection between North Atlantic and west-European air masses. Herein, we present a revised stratigraphy and a continuous high-resolution record of grain-size, magnetic susceptibility and organic carbon d 13 C of the famous of Dolní Vestonice (DV) loess sequence in the Moravian region of the Czech Republic. A new set of quartz OSL ages provides a reliable and accurate chronology of the sequence's main pedosedimentary events. The grain size record shows strongly contrasting variations with numerous abrupt coarse-grained events, especially in {{the upper part of}} the sequence between ca 20 - 30 ka. This time period is also characterised by a progressive coarsening of the loess deposits as already observed in other western European sequences. The base of the DV sequence exhibits an exceptionally well-preserved <b>soil</b> <b>complex</b> composed of three chernozem soil horizons and 5 aeolian silt layers (marker silts).
