The results of research have shown close relationship between structural, textural and mineralogical characteristics on the one hand, and its strength and resistance to point loads on the other hand. Its weakened zones are the result of anisotropy. They develop mainly due to dynamo-metamorphosis of the primary mudstone, resulting {{in the formation of the}} secondary slaty cleavage, with a pronounced preferred orientation of the hyllosilicates. Low strength is the consequence of the weak Van der Waals chemical bond between individual packets of the internal crystal structure of the <b>sheet</b> <b>minerals,</b> particularly sericite. Bedding and microfolds with a crenulated structure and partial preferred orientation of <b>sheet</b> <b>minerals,</b> as well as directions that are weakened with sigmoidal shear deformations as the predecessors of microfaults, also result in significant but less problematicanisotropy.

40|$|Analysis of {{compressibility}} data of diatom {{earth and}} Ariake clay of similar water holding capacities {{has been made}} in this paper. Analysis suggests {{that in the case of}} clays with <b>sheet</b> <b>minerals</b> such as in Ariake clays, due to compression, cluster growth takes place, whereas with diatom earth the breakdown of cluster accounts for bilinear compression characteristics. It has been hypothesized that the interactive void ratio in the case of diatom earth is likely to be far smaller than that in the case of Ariake clay where most of the pore water is herd by micropores enclosed by clay particle clusters. In a way diatom earth reflects the behaviour of clay of very law physico-chemical potential with far reduced collapse potential. Even the compressibility at higher stress range both in undisturbed and remolded states are likely to be due to breakdown of clusters with little contribution from the physico - chemical potential. Diatom earth is not a collapsible material at stress levels of engineering interest despite the in -situ water content is at par or even higher than soft sensitive Ariake clay with comparatively low cementation consequently with pronounced collapsible potential...|$|R

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with its ability to gather imaging information and collect elemental data at high spatial resolution is the ideal technique to analyse such interfaces. Further to this, a dual beam scanning electron and focused ion beam (FIB) microscope is an ideal instrument to prepare specimens for TEM because of its ability to simultaneously cut through hard and soft materials from specific sites of interest.
