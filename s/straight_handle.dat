6000|$|Our spirits {{rose with}} the instant {{resiliency}} of youth, {{but what a}} task that reaping proved to be! The grain, tangled and flattened close to the ground, had to {{be caught up in}} one hand and cut with the old-fashioned reaping-hook, the kind they used in Egypt five thousand years ago--a thin crescent of steel with a <b>straight</b> <b>handle,</b> and as we bowed ourselves to the ground to clutch and clip the grain, we nearly broke in two pieces. It was hot at mid-day and the sun fell upon our bended shoulders with amazing power, but we toiled on, glad of the opportunity to earn a dollar. [...] "Every cent means escape from this sad country," [...] I repeated.|$|E
60|$|I {{wonder that}} no painter {{has given us}} {{familiar}} views of the East: not processions, grand sultans, or magnificent landscapes; but faithful transcripts of everyday Oriental life, such as each street will supply to him. The camels afford endless motives, couched in the market-places, lying by thousands in the camel-square, snorting and bubbling after their manner, the sun blazing down on their backs, their slaves and keepers lying behind them in the shade: and the Caravan Bridge, above all, would afford a painter subjects for a dozen of pictures. Over this Roman arch, which crosses the Meles river, all the caravans pass on their entrance to the town. On one side, as we sat and looked at it, was a great row of plane- trees; on the opposite bank, a deep wood of tall cypresses--in the midst of which rose up innumerable grey tombs, surmounted with the turbans of the defunct believers. Beside the stream, the view was less gloomy. There was under the plane-trees a little coffee- house, shaded by a trellis-work, covered over with a vine, and ornamented with many rows of shining pots and water-pipes, for {{which there was no}} use at noon-day now, in the time of Ramazan. Hard by the coffee-house was a garden and a bubbling marble fountain, and over the stream was a broken summer-house, to which amateurs may ascend for the purpose of examining the river; and all round the plane-trees plenty of stools for those who were inclined to sit and drink sweet thick coffee, or cool lemonade made of fresh green citrons. The master of the house, dressed in a white turban and light blue pelisse, lolled under the coffee-house awning; the slave in white with a crimson striped jacket, his face as black as ebony, brought us pipes and lemonade again, and returned to his station at the coffee-house, where he curled his black legs together, and began singing out of his flat nose to the thrumming of a long guitar with wire strings. The instrument was not bigger than a soup-ladle, with a long <b>straight</b> <b>handle,</b> but its music pleased the performer; for his eyes rolled shining about, and his head wagged, and he grinned with an innocent intensity of enjoyment that did one good to look at. And there was a friend to share his pleasure: a Turk dressed in scarlet, and covered all over with daggers and pistols, sat leaning forward on his little stool, rocking about, and grinning quite as eagerly as the black minstrel. As he sang and we listened, figures of women bearing pitchers went passing over the Roman bridge, which we saw between the large trunks of the planes; or grey forms of camels were seen stalking across it, the string preceded by the little donkey, who is always here their long-eared conductor.|$|E
50|$|Keyhole saws, {{also called}} padsaws or jab saws, feature shorter, finer blades and (often) <b>straight</b> <b>handles,</b> and are {{suitable}} for cutting extremely tight curves.|$|R
5000|$|A Sierra cup (originally {{called a}} Sierra Club Cup) is a cup used for camping or Backpacking. Sierra cups are wider {{at the top}} than bottom, {{allowing}} for stacking. They typically have a fixed wire handle that is formed into a hook for attaching the cup to a belt. Some products, which use the name [...] "sierra cup," [...] have <b>straight</b> <b>handles</b> or handles that can fold away or be removed to save storage space. The cup is normally made of stainless steel, although other materials such as aluminum, titanium, and plastic have also been used.|$|R
50|$|<b>Handles</b> may be <b>straight</b> or bent. <b>Straight</b> <b>handles</b> {{make the}} pushing angle easier to adjust and snow {{throwing}} easier {{compared to a}} bent handle. Long handles enable the user to leverage their weight for pushing snow, but shorter handles make tossing snow easier. Plastic and fiberglass handles are lightweight, while wood handles are heavy. Metal handles conduct heat away from the hands more readily than other kinds of handles, so they feel colder.|$|R
50|$|Peshkaj: Persian pesh-kabz, {{a pointed}} one-edged dagger {{generally}} {{with a thick}} straight back to the blade and a <b>straight</b> <b>handle,</b> though at times the blade was curved, or even double-curved.|$|E
50|$|Peshkaj - A pointed Persian dagger {{generally}} {{with a thick}} {{straight back}} to the blade and a <b>straight</b> <b>handle</b> without a guard, though at times the blade was curved, or even double-curved. Some of the hilts had guards.|$|E
50|$|The United States Army folding spade, or entrenching tool, {{has evolved}} from a single fold spade with a <b>straight</b> <b>handle,</b> to a tri-fold design with a {{modified}} “D” handle design with all steel construction, to a similar light weight plastic and steel tri-fold design adopted by NATO as the standard issue entrenching tool. Other folding variants have also been issued. The latest light weight plastic tri-fold design is thirty percent lighter than the all-steel tri-fold was: 1.5 lb instead of 2.25 lb.|$|E
30|$|To reduce {{crowding}} instruments, {{the profile}} {{should be as}} slim as possible. If one camera and two instruments occupy the multichannel port, varying lengths prevent the bulkiest portion of each instrument (the external handle) from overlapping extracorporeally. A <b>straight</b> rotating <b>handle</b> is preferable.|$|R
50|$|The vz.24 {{became the}} primary rifle of the Czechoslovak armed forces before World War II. It resembled the German Karabiner 98k, which it predated {{by more than}} a decade. Unlike the K98k, the vz. 24 has a longer top handguard, and it retains a <b>straight</b> bolt <b>handle.</b>|$|R
50|$|During World War I entrenching tools became {{extremely}} important {{with the introduction}} of trench warfare. Entrenching tools designed for the individual infantryman soon appeared with short <b>straight</b> <b>handles,</b> T-handles, D-handles, and other designs. The British entrenching tool of this period was a two part design, with a metal head and a wooden handle, the metal head consisted of an adze/spade blade and a pick spike, used alone the head {{could be used as a}} spade with the pick spike serving as a handle. Between the blade and the spike was a ring into which the handle could be inserted at right angles to the head, with the handle inserted the tool could be used as a pick mattock. Besides being used for digging defensive fighting positions, entrenching tools were used for digging latrines and graves.|$|R
50|$|Most bâton percé {{examples}} are curved to some degree, {{either from the}} natural curve of the antler from which they are made, or {{as the result of}} deliberate alteration. Straight or curved handles both produce similar gains in range, but the experimenters found that curved handles provided better ergonomics than a <b>straight</b> <b>handle,</b> with left-handed throwers preferring one direction of curve, and right-handed throwers preferring the other. Straight handles had the advantage of being usable by both left and right-handed throwers.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{material}} culture of classical antiquity, a phiale or patera (...) is a shallow ceramic or metal libation bowl. It often has a bulbous indentation (omphalos, [...] "bellybutton") {{in the center}} underside to facilitate holding it, in which case it is sometimes called a mesomphalic phiale. It typically has no handles, and no feet. (A drinking cup with handles is a kylix. A circular platter {{with a pair of}} C-handles is not a patera, but a few paterae have a single long <b>straight</b> <b>handle.)</b> Although the two terms may be used interchangeably, particularly in the context of Etruscan culture, phiale is more common in reference to Greek forms, and patera in a Roman setting.|$|E
5000|$|Skolskjutningskarbin, (literally [...] "school {{shooting}} carbine"): This carbine was manufactured for Swedish civilian {{schools for}} student training. All of these school carbines carry the receiver date of 1901. This model deviates {{from the standard}} m/1894 carbine in several ways. The serial number is prefixed with S and runs S.1 to S.1161 and possibly a few more. The serial number appears as S.500 on the left side-rail of the receiver. The bolt handle is the same <b>straight</b> <b>handle</b> of the m/1896 rifle. The sling swivels are {{on the bottom of}} the stock just as on the m/1896 rifle. There is no bayonet attachment. Many of these carbines have been found rebuilt as standard m/1894-14 carbines and in one case as a Carl Gustaf m/63 target rifle (CG63).|$|E
50|$|The M24 {{series is}} a line of Mauser pattern bolt-action battle rifles {{produced}} {{for use by the}} Yugoslavian military. They are similar to the Czech vz. 24 rifle, featuring open sights, 8×57mm IS chambering, carbine-length barrels, hardwood stocks, and <b>straight</b> bolt <b>handles.</b> All M24 series weapons are designed to accept the M-24/48 pattern bayonet.|$|R
5000|$|The Spanish M43, {{produced}} in A Coruña until 1957, was {{a variant of}} the 98k with a <b>straight</b> bolt <b>handle,</b> a front sight guard and a handle groove in the front stock much like the earlier [...] It was chambered in 7.92×57mm Mauser calibre. When Spain began switching to the CETME automatic rifle, many M43 were converted to FR8 rifles for military training purposes and Guardia Civil service.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} m/1938 rifles (Type I) {{were converted}} m/1896 rifles with barrels cut down by 5.5" [...] (139mm) {{and almost always}} with the original <b>straight</b> bolt <b>handles.</b> These rifles are often referred to by collectors as [...] "m/96-38" [...] rifles, {{but there was never}} an official designation for this conversion. [...] The majority of purpose-built m/1938s (Type II) had turned-down bolt handles and were manufactured by Husqvarna Vapenfabriks AB, with production ending in 1944. However, the Swedish military made no distinction in service between the two types.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian grip, {{evolving}} {{from the}} handle of the rapier (Renaissance) and its later progeny, the smallsword (Baroque period), is rarely used today in sport fencing today, but is common among classical fencers. In the 1940s and 50s, it was very popular with sport fencers in America and many other countries, until being supplanted by the pistol grip. Its advocates say that it has most of the French grip's agility with a much greater degree of power and stability. The Italian grip consists of a <b>straight</b> <b>handle,</b> usually wood or aluminium covered in grip tape, as well as a crossbar (the quillions), and two rings. The fencer's fingers actually rest upon the ricasso, {{which is part of the}} blade. This not only gives great security, but great sensitivity. Because of the smaller length of the handle, and particulars of the Italian style of bladework, the Italian grip is used with a [...] "martingale" [...] which is either a leather strap around the wrist into which the pommel is tucked, or an elastic bandage which is wrapped completely around the hand.|$|E
50|$|A broadaxe is a large-(broad) headed axe. There are two {{categories}} of cutting edge on broadaxes, both are used for shaping logs by hewing. On one type, one side is flat {{and the other side}} beveled, a basilled edge, also called a side axe, single bevel, or chisle-edged axe. On the other type, both sides are beveled, sometimes called a double bevel axe, which produces a scalloped cut.On the basilled broadaxe the handle may curve away from the flat side to allow an optimal stance by the hewer in relation to the hewn surface. The flat blade is to make the flat surface but can only be worked from one direction and are right-handed or left-handed. The double bevel axe has a <b>straight</b> <b>handle</b> can be swung with either side against the wood. A double beveled broad axe can be used for chopping or notching and hewing. When used for hewing, a notch is chopped {{in the side of the}} log down to a marked line, called scoring. The pieces of wood between these notches are removed with an axe called joggling and then the remaining wood is chopped away to the line.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990 a plywood cutout of a {{stick with}} {{multiple}} kinks in the shaft {{was presented to}} the FIH for comment, the intention was to produce it as a goalkeeper's stick. Having limited the toe upturn only two years previously the FIH saw this as mockery and issued a press release, in April 1990, proposing a ban on all hockey sticks with [...] "non-straight" [...] handles to take effect after the Barcelona Olympics of that year. There was protest from those who had been marketing sticks with set-back heads and or kinked shafts and it was in any case not a sensible proposal because {{there is no such thing}} as a hockey stick with a perfectly <b>straight</b> <b>handle.</b> The result was the withdrawal of the proposed ban and the imposition of [...] "limits of deviation", which permitted one bend to either side of the handle to a maximum of 20 mm on each side. In 2000 a diagram explaining the permitted deviation was included in the Rules of Hockey. Previously the only restraint on the configuration of a hockey stick was that it had to pass through a ring of 2" [...] diameter (later adjusted to 51 mm—2 in rounded up to the nearest millimeter).|$|E

5000|$|Rifle M/89 (Gevær M/89), stocked {{almost to}} the muzzle, no hand guard, <b>straight</b> bolt <b>handle</b> and an outer steel liner for the barrel. This weapon {{is typical of the}} period in having a long barrel and stock without pistol grip. Was {{originally}} issued without a safety catch; instead, a half-cock notch on the cocking piece/firing pin assembly served this purpose. In 1910, this weapon was modified by the addition of a manual safety, which was placed {{on the left side of}} the receiver just behind the closed bolt handle.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} Mauser M98 actions were represented. Although {{there was a large}} number of Kar98ks and some WW1 Gewehr 98s, many of the ex-German rifles were the Czechoslovakian vz. 24, known in German service as the G24(t). Of superb quality, the Czech-made actions were almost identical to German-manufactured Kar98k actions, with the exception of markings and the use of a <b>straight</b> bolt <b>handle</b> projecting at right angles from the action. The German Kar98k bolt handle was turned down to bring it closer to the stock and the firer's hand, with a corresponding recess in the stock.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A wok with a <b>straight</b> <b>handle</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common cooking {{utensils}} in the Asian kitchen. This common cooking instrument has seldom been examined by ergonomists. This research used a two-factor randomized complete block design to investigate the effects of wok size (with three diameters – 36 cm, 39 cm and 42 cm) and handle angle (25 °, 10 °, – 5 °, – 20 °, and – 35 °) on the task of flipping. The measurement criteria included the maximum acceptable weight of wok flipping (MAWF), the subjective rating and the subjective ranking. Twelve experienced males volunteered to take part in this study. The results showed that both the wok size and handle angle had a significant effect on the MAWF, the subjective rating and the subjective ranking. Additionally, there is a size-weight illusion associated with flipping tasks. In general, a small wok (36 cm diameter) with an ergonomically bent handle (– 20 ° ± 15 °) is the optimal design, for male cooks, for the purposes of flipping...|$|E
40|$|Many {{different}} factors {{play a role}} in {{the development}} of an infant’s ability to use tools. A previous version of the current study examined active versus observational learning on an infant’s ability to be trained to use a novel tool to succeed in a test task. The results showed that both types of learning appeared to be equally effective. This follow-up study added a second factor to examine the effects of training when there is a characteristic about the tool that cannot be determined through visual observation. This time the novel tool had an unexpected weight distribution making the <b>straight</b> <b>handle</b> of the tool much heavier than the round handle. This study showed that the uneven weight distribution of the tool actually resulted in infants having a higher overall success rates during test than in the previous version of the study. This suggests that the uneven weight distribution may have focused infant’s attention on how they were holding the tool therefore increasing their ability to success on the test task.

50|$|The Karabiner 98k is a controlled-feed {{bolt-action rifle}} {{based on the}} Mauser M 98 system. Its {{internal}} magazine can be loaded with five 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridges from a stripper clip or one-by-one. The <b>straight</b> bolt <b>handle</b> found on the Gewehr 98 bolt {{was replaced by a}} turned-down bolt handle on the Karabiner 98k. This change made it easier to rapidly operate the bolt, reduced the amount the handle projected beyond the receiver, and enabled mounting of aiming optics directly above the receiver. Each rifle was furnished with a short length of cleaning rod, fitted through the bayonet stud. The joined rods from 3 rifles provided one full-length cleaning rod.|$|R
60|$|What rank or command James MacGregor had, is uncertain. He {{calls himself}} Major; and Chevalier Johnstone calls him Captain. He must have held rank under Ghlune Dhu, his kinsman, but his active and audacious {{character}} placed him {{above the rest}} of his brethren. Many of his followers were unarmed; he supplied the want of guns and swords with scythe-blades set <b>straight</b> upon their <b>handles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Trimmers {{that have}} nylon or metal blades usually require <b>straight</b> driveshafts to <b>handle</b> the higher torque {{required}} {{to turn the}} heavier disk, {{and because of the}} shock loads that are passed back from the blade to the drive shaft and its gearbox(es). Smaller line trimmers have curved driveshafts to make holding the cutting-head at ground level much easier and with less strain on the operator.|$|R
5000|$|The blade {{is usually}} {{made from a}} medium-carbon steel in varying weights and lengths, but {{typically}} 20 to 25 cm long. Blades are <b>straight</b> near the <b>handle</b> but have an increasingly strong curve towards the end. The blade is generally sharpened only {{on the inside of}} the curve, but double-edged billhooks, or [...] "broom hooks", also have a straight secondary edge on the back.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the name}} K98k, the first [...] "K" [...] stands for karabiner (carbine) {{and the second}} [...] "k" [...] for kurz (short). The [...] "98" [...] {{is derived from the}} earlier rifle's year of {{adoption}} (1898), although the carbine itself was adopted in 1935. The K98k is often confused as being the earlier Model 98 design; however, there are notable differences between them. The easiest to spot are its shorter length, and bent, rather than <b>straight</b> bolt <b>handle.</b> Less obvious are that it has different, simpler sights. It was intended to be a [...] "universal rifle" [...] for all parts of the Heer rather than having both Carbine and full length versions.|$|R
50|$|While Firth was insistent {{that the}} V8 XU-1 handled {{better than the}} 6cyl version, HDT driver Peter Brock who also raced the car in Sports Sedans, later claimed that while the V8 was a lot faster in a <b>straight</b> line, its <b>handling</b> was terrible and he {{reported}} that in testing, the first time both he and Colin Bond gave the car full acceleration it broke the windscreen due to the V8's much greater torque.|$|R
5000|$|Gent's saw or Gentleman's saw (rare) [...] - [...] a small {{dovetail}} saw with a <b>straight</b> turned <b>handle,</b> {{rather than an}} open one typical of most saws. The name seems to have arisen from its use by the nineteenth century dilettante who would now be called a hobbyist {{but it is hard}} to find a nineteenth century reference to it. For example, in the section on tools in Every Man his own Mechanic (1881) (816pp), tenon, dovetail and sash saws are listed as a group but there is no mention of a gent's saw. It is adapted for use in making joints in very small woodwork such as that in some musical instruments, dolls' furniture or other model-making. Its distinguishing features are its small size and turned handle.|$|R

2500|$|In road vehicles, {{the parking}} brake, also called hand brake, {{emergency}} brake, [...] or e-brake, {{is used to}} keep the vehicle stationary {{and in many cases}} also perform an emergency stop. Parking brakes on older vehicles often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes at one end and the other end to a pulling mechanism which is operated with the driver's hand or foot. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, at floor level beside the driver, or a <b>straight</b> pull <b>handle</b> located near the steering column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located beside the drivers leg. In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking. Some automobiles have the parking brake operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|R
30|$|Linear {{interpolation}} can {{be defined}} as the simplest approach [7] for label propagation. This method has two main drawbacks. On the one hand, linear interpolation can only <b>handle</b> <b>straight</b> trajectories, since interpolation between adjacent segments are computed independently. On the other hand, it can not accurately capture scale transformations due to perspective effects. A recent update can be found in [13], which allows semiautomatic video annotation. Nevertheless, the system is based on a foreground/background motion detection, which limits its use to videos recorded with static cameras.|$|R
