Crystallographic analyses confirm that phosphate and hypophosphite anions react with native RhdA, removing the persulfide sulfue atom from the active site pocket. Considering that RhdA and the catalytic subunit of Cdc 25 phosphatases share a common three-dimensional fold as well as active site Cys (catalytic) and Arg residues, two RhdA mutants carrying a single amino acid insertion at the active site loop were designed and their phosphatase activity tested.

The xylose consumption rate and ethanol productivity increased with increasing xylose concentrations in F 106 KR strain. In particular, F 106 KR produced 77. 6 g/L ethanol from 220 g/L xylose and converted 100 g/L glucose and 100 g/L xylose into 89. 0 g/L ethanol in 72 h, but the corresponding values of F 106 X strain are 7. 5 and 65. 8 g/L.

Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays demonstrated that the P 5 - 2 fragment (- 1793 to - 1744) interacted with at least two nuclear factors, i. e. HNF- 4 and Sp 1 /Sp 3. Co-transfection experiments using Drosophila SL 2 cells revealed that HNF- 4 and Sp 1 /Sp 3 synergistically stimulated the enhancer activity of the P 5 - 2 fragment.

However, before using ESCs for therapeutic purposes, such as transplantation and tissue regeneration, it will be essential to improve our ability to modulate and control ESC differentiation into lineage-specific derivatives. In this context, our main aim is to identify and characterize molecules able to control embryonic stem cell differentiation. To achieve this goal we have developed an in vitro system based on the RNA interference technology. By using this approach we have identified many factors strictly required for proper neuronal differentiation. Among them we have found a membrane protein that we have named Dies 1. Dies 1 suppression blocks ESC differentiation by maintaining the cells in an undifferentiated state. We have demonstrated that this protein is required to allow neuronal differentiation by participating to the signaling pathway of BMP 4 that plays {{a crucial role in the}} balance between ESC stemness and differentiation. Indeed, Dies 1 suppression induces an impairment of BMP 4 signalling and on the other hand it induces an up-regulation of Nodal/Activin targets. Thus, Dies 1 seems to be responsible for the balance between BMP 4 and Nodal pathways in the decision of ESC fate.

In the present study, we have isolated and characterized the human KIAA 1199 promoter in terms of regulation of KIAA 1199 gene expression. A 3. 3 kb fragment of human genomic DNA containing the 5 '-flanking sequence of the KIAA 1199 gene possesses both suppressive and activating elements. Employing a deletion mutagenesis approach, a 1. 4 kb proximal region {{was defined as the}} basic KIAA 1199 promoter containing a TATA-box close to the transcription start site. A combination of 5 '-primer extension study with 5 'RACE DNA sequencing analysis revealed one major transcription start site that is utilized in the human KIAA 1199 gene. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the 1. 4 kb KIAA 1199 promoter contains putative activating regulatory elements, including activator protein- 1 (AP- 1), Twist- 1, and NF-κB sites. Sequential deletion and <b>site-direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> analysis demonstrated that the AP- 1 and distal NF-κB sites are required for KIAA 1199 gene expression.

Based on the {{different}} folding strategy, most thioesterases are classified into two superfamiles: the hotdog-fold enzyme superfamily or alpha/beta-fold hydrolase enzyme superfamily. Hotdog-fold thioesterases share high degree similarity in structure which resembles a “hotdog”. YigI {{is one of the}} last two uncharacterized hotdog-fold thioesterases from E. coli. To study the function of YigI, substrate specificity profile was determined by thioesterase activity assay. YigI possesses a preference for long chain acyl-CoA over shorter chain acyl-CoA. The highest activity was found in catalysis of myristoyl-CoA. By alignment with the closest homolog, the uncharacterized tetrameric type AB thioesterase from Shewanella oneidensis, the important catalytic residues of YigI were predicted as following: Asp 69, Gln 56 and His 60. Enzyme activity decreased after the <b>site-direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> of those residues. Cytoplasmic acetyl-coenzyme A hydrolase (CACH), also known as acyl-CoA thioesterase 12 (Acot 12), plays important cellular roles in mammalian fatty acid metabolism through the hydrolysis of acyl-CoA thioesters. Unlike YigI, besides two hotdog domains, CACH contains a steroidogenic acute regulatory (START) domain. The START domain is known as a lipid transporter. Thus, the function and regulation of CACH is f special interest. Chapter three of this thesis focuses on the function of the tandem hotdog-fold domains of CACH. The double hotdog-fold unit of CACH was expressed in E. coli and purified. Surprisingly, it was shown to display highest activity towards isobutyryl-CoA rather than acetyl-CoA.
