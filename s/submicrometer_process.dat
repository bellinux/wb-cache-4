40|$|With the {{emergence}} of voltage scaling {{as one of the}} most powerful power reduction techniques, it has been important to support voltage scalable statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) in deep <b>submicrometer</b> <b>process</b> nodes. In this paper, we propose a single delay model of logic gate using neural network which comprehensively captures process, voltage, and temperature variation along with input slew and output load. The number of simulation programs with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) required to create this model over a large voltage and temperature range is found to be modest and 4 x less than that required for a conventional table-based approach with comparable accuracy. We show how the model can be used to derive sensitivities required for linear SSTA for an arbitrary voltage and temperature. Our experimentation on ISCAS 85 benchmarks across a voltage range of 0. 9 - 1. 1 V shows that the average error in mean delay is less than 1. 08 % and average error in standard deviation is less than 2. 85 %. The errors in predicting the 99 % and 1 % probability point are 1. 31 % and 1 %, respectively, with respect to SPICE. The two potential applications of voltage-aware SSTA have been presented, i. e., one for improving the accuracy of timing analysis by considering instance-specific voltage drops in power grids and the other for determining optimum supply voltage for target yield for dynamic voltage scaling applications...|$|E

Epson has reported 70% lower {{power consumption}} compared to synchronous design. Also, clock drivers can be removed which can significantly reduce power consumption. However, when using certain encodings, asynchronous circuits may require more area, which can result in increased power consumption if the underlying process has poor leakage properties (for example, deep <b>submicrometer</b> <b>processes</b> used prior {{to the introduction of}} High-k dielectrics).|$|R
40|$|In this letter, {{a compact}} {{reconfigurable}} counter memory (RCM) is proposed for spiking pixels. In contrast to conventional in-pixel counter circuitry, the proposed RCM does {{not rely on}} a flip-flop-based circuit but instead uses a very novel circuit structure that combines a combinational incrementer together with static and dynamic memory cells. The proposed RCM provides counting as well as in-pixel storage functionalities allowing for intermediate readout of digital pixel values. Reported experimental results validate the novel concept of RCM-based spiking pixel in AMIS 0. 35 -mu m CMOS technology. The propose pixel architecture is inherently insensitive to power supply voltage scaling and is thus well suited to <b>submicrometer</b> CMOS <b>processes...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an efficient technique for the selective {{chemical and biological}} manipulation {{of the contents of}} individual cells. This technique is based on the electric-field-induced permeabilization (electroporation) in biological membranes using a low-voltage pulse generator and microelectrodes. A spatially highly focused electric field allows introduction of polar cell-impermeant solutes such as fluorescent dyes, fluorogenic reagents, and DNA into single cells. The high spatial resolution of the technique allows for design of, for example, cellular network constructions in which cells in close contact with each other can be made to possess different biochemical, biophysical, and morphological properties. Fluorescein, and fluo- 3 (a calcium-sensitive fluorophore), are electroporated into the soma of cultured single progenitor cells derived from adult rat hippocampus. Fluo- 3 also is introduced into individual <b>submicrometer</b> diameter <b>processes</b> of thapsigargin-treated progenitor cells, and a plasmid vector cDNA construct (pRAY 1), expressing the green fluorescent protein, is electroporated into cultured single COS 7 cells. At high electric field strengths, observations of dye-transfer into organelles are proposed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We measure {{near-field}} {{radiative cooling}} of a thermally isolated nanostructure up {{to a few}} degrees and show that in principle this process can efficiently cool down localized hotspots by tens of degrees at <b>submicrometer</b> gaps. This <b>process</b> of cooling is achieved without any physical contact, in contrast to heat transfer through conduction, thus enabling novel cooling capabilities. We show that the measured trend of radiative cooling agrees well theoretical predictions and is limited mainly by the geometry of the probe used here {{as well as the}} minimum separation that could be achieved in our setup. These results also pave the way for realizing other new effects based on resonant heat transfer, like thermal rectification and negative thermal conductance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Single-cell {{analysis}} {{is a very}} important field of research and is currently at the frontier of physical and biological sciences. Understanding how the phenotype of a single-cell arises from its genotype is a complex topic. Currently, the prevailing paradigm to analyze cellular functions is the study of biochemical interactions using fluorescence based imaging systems. However, the elimination of the labelling process is highly desirable to improve the accuracy of the analysis. Living cells are electromagnetic units; in as much they use electric mechanisms to control and regulate dynamic processes involved in inter alia signal transduction, metabolism, proliferation and differentiation. Recent developments in micro- and nanofabrication technologies are offering great opportunities for the analysis of single cells; the combination of micro fluidic environments, nano electrodes/wires and ultra wide band electromagnetic engineering will soon make possible the investigation of local (<b>submicrometer</b> scale) dynamic <b>processes</b> integrating several events at different time scales. In the paper, we present recent approaches which aim at investigating singlecells with the help of MEMS and NEMS (Micro and Nano Electro Mechanical Systems) and ultra wide band (DC-THz) electromagnetic characterization techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidative}} evolution (“aging”) {{of organic}} {{species in the}} atmosphere {{is thought to have}} a major influence on the composition and properties of organic particulate matter but remains poorly understood, particularly for the most oxidized fraction of the aerosol. Here we measure the kinetics and products of the heterogeneous oxidation of highly oxidized organic aerosol, with an aim of better constraining such atmospheric aging <b>processes.</b> <b>Submicrometer</b> particles composed of model oxidized organics— 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetracarboxylic acid (C[subscript 8]H[subscript 10]O[subscript 8]), citric acid (C[subscript 6]H[subscript 8]O[subscript 7]), tartaric acid (C[subscript 4]H[subscript 6]O[subscript 6]), and Suwannee River fulvic acid—were oxidized by gas-phase OH in a flow reactor, and the masses and elemental composition of the particles were monitored as a function of OH exposure. In contrast to our previous studies of less-oxidized model systems (squalane, erythritol, and levoglucosan), particle mass did not decrease significantly with heterogeneous oxidation. Carbon content of the aerosol always decreased somewhat, but this mass loss was approximately balanced by an increase in oxygen content. The estimated reactive uptake coefficients of the reactions range from 0. 37 to 0. 51 and indicate that such transformations occur at rates corresponding to 1 – 2 weeks in the atmosphere, suggesting their importance in the atmospheric lifecycle of organic particulate matter.
