40|$|Europe has large {{geographical}} {{differences in}} terms of economic and social development. Differences emerge both between and within Member States and regions, but also between urban and rural areas within regions. This has relevance for the Europe 2020 Strategy with regard to its objectives of inclusive growth and social cohesion (European Commission, 2010). The <b>Social</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Package</b> (SIP) promotes efficient and effective social policies that respond to and support people’s needs throughout their lives, recognising the spatial dimension as an important element of good governance. To this end, the European Commission’s country-specific recommendations take into account spatial aspects (European Commission, 2012). This policy brief explores differences in quality of life in urban and rural Europe drawing on Eurofound’s third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS). Previous research has found important differences in material deprivation and living standards between urban and rural areas especially in poorer Member States, while other aspects of quality of life also differ between urban and rural areas in richer countries (Eurofound, 2006).

30|$|Having {{said that}} Canada, Australia, Japan and South Korea have all adopted the <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> idea, however, {{does not mean}} that they are {{implementing}} these policies in lock step with each other.

Broadly <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> policy reforms in Canada, Australia, Japan and South Korea can be grouped into types: 1) the “invest in the future” approach more commonly taken by Canada and Australia; and 2) the “human capital activation and mobilization” approach more widely used in Japan and South Korea. The differences in these <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approaches stems from the differences in how the two groups of countries define <b>social</b> <b>investment,</b> and thus the choice of their policy instruments.

40|$|The European Union has {{gradually}} developed a consistent and integrated policy framework {{to respond to}} common challenges {{in the field of}} health that combines legislation, cooperation and financing: the EU Health Strategy “Together for Health”. The economic crisis compounded the existing challenges stemming from changes in demographics and patterns of disease, technological change, as well as major threats to health. It put an additional strain on the sustainability of health systems and raised the urgency to channel EU efforts towards economic recovery and growth as outlined in the Europe 2020 strategy. Acknowledging this new environment, on 20 February 2013 the European Commission adopted a policy framework more closely linking EU social and health policies to Europe 2020 : the <b>Social</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Package</b> (SIP) including a document dedicated to ”Investing in Health”. This paper extends the EU Health Strategy by reinforcing its key objectives, firmly anchors health in the Europe 2020 policy framework and reaffirms that health is a value in itself and health spending is a growth friendly expenditure. A healthy population and sustainable health systems are decisive for economic growth. Investing in sustainable health systems means that cost-effective spending, structural reforms and sound innovation can bring efficiency gains and secure better health outcomes. Investing in people’s health also boosts economic growth by enabling individuals to remain active longer and in better health. Finally, investing in health requires reducing health inequalities to break the vicious spiral of poor health contributing to, and resulting from, poverty and exclusion...|$|E
40|$|The “World Politics of Social Investment” (WoPSI) project aims at {{explaining}} {{variance in}} <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> agendas and <b>social</b> in-vestment reforms across democratic countries in {{different regions of}} the World. Virtually all capitalist economies grapple with challenges of demographic change, slow economic growth, poor employment performance and increasing poverty rates. In dealing with these pro-blems, a <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> strategy appeals to a wide audience, both political and academic. However, <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> reforms and per-formances in democratic countries around the globe are highly une-qual and remain fragmentary: different countries have implemented different types of policy instruments, with different functions, at diffe-rent points in time, and to different degrees. Despite a growing number of scientific contributions on social in-vestment reforms and their effects, a systematic mapping of the de-sign of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> agendas and policies in different democra-tic countries around the globe is still lacking. Moreover, we lack an explanation for the variance in the development of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> policy reforms. This is where we locate the research interest of the project presented in this paper. In order to understand why <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> agendas and policies have developed differently across countries, we need to study the politics of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> reforms. Thus, we ask: How do <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> agendas and <b>social</b> in-vestment policy reforms vary across democratic countries around the globe? Under what political conditions do <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> agendas and/or reforms develop? In this paper, we situate these questions in the existing state of the literature, and we outline a way to answer these research questions in the context of social policy reforms in Latin America, East Asia, as well as Western and Eastern Europe.

30|$|The role {{of ideas}} such as {{nationalism}} in Quebec or discourses on <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> {{have been found}} to be important in pushing more generous ECEC policies in Canada (White [2001], [2002 a], [2004], [2011 a], [2011 b]; Béland and Lecours [2006], [2008]; Mahon [2011]). In this case study, ideas emerged as particularly important. Ideas of <b>social</b> <b>investment,</b> linking ECEC to the government's economic growth agenda, and learning from the ‘best practices’ of other jurisdictions were influential in pushing towards an inclusive liberal model. However, it is imprudent to subscribe too much explanatory power to the presence of ideas around <b>social</b> <b>investment.</b> Similar to White's recent finding ([2012]) that the adoption of a <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> paradigm does not necessarily mean movement away from neo-liberal models of ECEC, this study found that <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> ideas were prevalent in all provinces examined, including those with more neo-liberal elements in their models. By 2011, <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> had become a common language and accepted paradigm among ECEC policy actors in Atlantic Canada. In and of themselves, <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> ideas were not able to secure inclusive liberal reforms. Rather, ideas of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> had to combine with other factors such as the presence of bureaucratic champions, a unified childcare sector, and appropriate opportunities for systematic change to push inclusive liberal reform.|$|R
30|$|The {{challenge}} {{to transform the}} expenditure paradigm to that of innovation and investment was illuminated in a recent wave of literature offering new concepts such as the ‘new welfare state’ [55, 56], the social investment state [57] and the active welfare state [58, 59]. The concept of the social investment state gained greater political prominence after the EU Commission adopted the <b>Social</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Package</b> (SIP) in 2013, calling on member states to prioritise social investment and to modernise their welfare states. However, it is still an emerging concept and several aspects need further academic and political investigation. First, the process of shifting from spending to investment is unevenly applied across European welfare states [60] and across the life course [61]. Second, {{the ability of the}} investment approach to deal with core welfare issues such as social justice and poverty is currently unclear [62 – 64]. And last but not least, the global economic crisis and the drive to turn from spending to investment have overshadowed the growing impact of some other global concerns such as climate change and the environmental impact of the welfare state. Relatively few of the following issues are currently addressed in research literature, such as how resources needed to mitigate climate change will affect conventional welfare state policies [65] and how traditional models of redistribution can cope with the end of continuous economic growth [66] and de-growth challenge [67, 68]. Environmental problems are echoed in the concept of the eco-state [69] and in a revised perception of well being [70]. Although climate change affects all countries, it has not been analysed with regard to welfare models and thus it is not known whether some models are more efficient in coping with ecological challenges; and the study of the relationship between ICT and welfare models [24, 69] fares only slightly better.|$|E
40|$|Expert pour l'étude de cas française. Case study on: {{challenges}} to solidarity policies in France, overview of relevant cash benefits; assement of the initiatives to improve take-up. This study will investigate how Member States are introducing reforms {{to ensure that}} monetary social benefits reach those most in need, and, {{in the face of}} restricted budgets, how effective the implementation of these reforms is. The first part of the study will identify and describe gaps between eligibility and take-up of various monetary social benefits, the groups most effected by non-take-up, and the main barriers to accessing benefits. The second part will explore how welfare systems and initiatives by governments and NGOs have promoted effective take-up of benefits and describes the experiences of providers and beneficiaries. The importance of the topic is highlighted by the European Commission’s <b>Social</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Package</b> (SIP), which calls for each MS to invest more in the proper design, implementation and assessment of social policies. Measures can be compensatory or preventative and may seek to improve take-up through changing the system and delivery, or by improving beneficiaries’ individual capabilities in accessing benefits. The study will document the efficiency as well as the effectiveness of four recent measures to improve the take-up of monetary benefits for vulnerable groups. In particular, it will describe at least one recent initiative that aimed to remove inefficiencies by simplifying claim procedures and at least one other measure that effectively improved access to benefits and the actual take-up of benefits (where the focus may be less on efficiency).

The impact of the welfare system on poverty (measured as the percentage reduction in the poverty rate when comparing poverty before and after transfers) shows considerable variation across these countries (Table 1).

It provides an enriched picture of the existing knowledge base and evidence of how ICT-enabled social innovation initiatives that promote social investment through integrated approaches to social services delivery can contribute to the policy objectives of the EU <b>Social</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Package</b> (SIP) to support the achievement of the goals of the EU 2020 strategy in terms of inclusive growth and employment. After having introduced the policy and research background outlining the overall objectives and scope of the IESI research and the aim of the mapping 2015, the report provides an overview of the methodology followed for enriching the IESI inventory of ICT-enabled social innovation initiatives through a structured dynamic database and by conducting the mapping and analysis of a selected sample of 210 initiatives. The report then updates the review of the literature and practice in domains related to the role and impact of ICT-enabled social innovation promoting social investment, with a specific focus on the area of active and healthy ageing and long-term care for older people, particularly the theme: prevention, health promotion and rehabilitation. In reviewing {{the state of the art}} the report discusses the degree of deployment of ICT-enabled social innovations that promote social investment through integrated approaches to social services provision in terms of geographical spread and different areas of social services covered, providing insight into the levels and types of deployment achieved. Further, the IESI conceptual framework which underpins the research and which has been used to guide the mapping and analysis of initiatives is discussed, proposing additional dimensions in order to enrich the framework of analysis itself. Evolving theoretical approaches are taken into account, the aim being to better explain the implications ICT-enabled social innovation initiatives have or may have for social policy reforms. This is followed by an overview of the consolidated results of {{the analysis of the}} initiatives collected as part of the IESI mapping exercise in 2014 and 2015. The analysis {{presents the}} IESI Knowledge Map 2015, which aims to provide a better understanding of the main characteristics and patterns of the initiatives identified, according to the IESI conceptual framework. Reference is also made to the different welfare systems and social services delivery models which characterise various EU countries in order to contextualise the potential role played by ICT-enabled social innovation to promote social investment through integrated approaches to social services delivery. The findings of specific thematic analyses conducted on a set of selected topics: 1) the role of social enterprise-driven ICT-enabled social innovation initiatives in support of social services delivery; and the implications of ICT-enabled social innovation that promote social investment through integrated approaches to social services delivery in support of: 2) active inclusion of young people; and 3) active and healthy ageing and long-term care for older people, particularly as regards prevention, health promotion and rehabilitation are then presented. Finally, the main conclusions deriving from the analysis of the mapping in terms of the contribution made by ICT-enabled social innovation promoting social investment through integrated approaches to social services delivery to the implementation of the SIP are outlined. This is complemented by an analysis of the gaps identified; the limitations of the current mapping exercise and recommendations for future research, as well as implications and possible directions for policy.

This paper aims to address this important gap in social entrepreneurship research with new empirical and theoretical work. Theoretically, the paper takes an interpretive approach drawing on institutional theory and other work on the sociology of markets to conceptualize <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> as a socially constructed space within which different investment logics and investor rationalities are currently in play. Using a Weberian analytic lens this paper identifies two ideal type investor rationalities (zweckrational; wertrational) that drive different institutional forms of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> but also suggests that a third – systemic – rationality can be discerned that combines aspects of both in practice. This analysis suggests a three-part typology of <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> organized according to investor rationality that, in turn, generates a <b>Social</b> <b>Investment</b> Matrix consisting of nine distinct models. Empirically, this paper presents – for the first time – an attempt to quantify the flows of capital within the inchoate <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> landscape. The paper concludes by setting out three possible future scenarios for <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> each representing the ultimate dominance of a singular investor rationality...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{compares the}} <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> policy reforms {{that have been}} {{introduced}} by the two Anglo-Saxon liberal welfare regimes of Canada and Australia and the two East Asian welfare regimes of Japan and South Korea since the 1990 s. The paper examines the causes of these social policy changes, and asks why these seemingly different contexts produce such similar policy idea. While all four countries share similar broad ideational template and language of <b>social</b> <b>investment,</b> they differ {{in terms of their}} target groups and policy instruments. Whereas Canada and Australia have focused their <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> policies on children through ECEC (what I call an “invest in the future” model); Japan and South Korea have approached <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> from a more general human capital and economic activation perspective (what I call a “human capital activation” model). As a result, <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> policies in these countries have targeted more broadly on children, women, and the elderly. I argue that these differences in <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> approaches stem from the differences in their social, political and economic contexts, and the political economic legacies.|$|R
40|$|A three-year {{longitudinal}} study of actively employed individuals (N = 391) {{was used to test}} the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> at work, which is the act of cognitively and emotionally committing to one???s job or career, and both cross-sectional and longitudinal patterns of personality trait development. Participants provided ratings of personality and <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> at work at two time-points, separated by approximately three years. Data were analyzed using two-wave latent change models. Results showed that conscientiousness and other personality traits were related to <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> at work. Additionally, evidence was found for a positive association between longitudinal change in <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> in work and change in personality traits???especially conscientiousness. Finally, the concurrent longitudinal changes in <b>social</b> <b>investment</b> and personality traits were invariant across age groups, suggesting that personality traits remain plastic across the lifespan. Implications for personality development and future research directions are discussed...|$|R
