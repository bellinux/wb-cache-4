5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} {{that does}} not cause <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> A range of studies demonstrate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants, but can actually help to alleviate <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> According to a survey of psychiatrists, it is the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} SSRI-induced <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> although this is not an indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There have also been a few studies suggesting that bupropion can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, if they have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} psychoanalytic {{approach to}} <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> deemphasizes societal factors {{as contributing to}} <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> The new approach to sex therapy, which has developed since 1970, emphasizes a diversity of factors, including societal factors. Sex education—following sex therapy—has now begun to recognize the area of <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> as a valid topic. Knowledge {{and understanding of the}} societal factors which directly or indirectly contribute to <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> can help people to change or better react to these factors. The clinical sociologist as a sex educator can and should make a major contribution to the prevention and correction of <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although the MMPI is well-researched in {{many aspects}} of {{clinical}} assessment, there is surprisingly little literature as to {{its role in the}} assessment of the <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions.</b> Most of the literature on the MMPI in the assessment of <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> pertains to determining the etiology (biogenic vs. psychogenic) of male <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions.</b> Results from these studies are equivocal at best, which has led many to conclude that the MMPI is of no utility on the assessment of <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions.</b> However, several studies have found significant associations between MMPI profiles and types of sexual problems. Most of these studies remain to be replicated, but do suggest that {{further research is needed to}} determine the role of the MMPI in the assessment of <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions.</b> This review summarizes relevant studies, as well as provides the clinician with guidelines for interpreting MMPI profiles as related to sexual functioning...|$|R

5|$|COPD often occurs {{along with}} a number of other {{conditions}}, due in part to shared risk factors. These conditions include ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, lung cancer, anxiety disorder, <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> and depression. In those with severe disease, a feeling of always being tired is common. Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} SCI have {{problems}} with the body's physical sexual arousal response. Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called primary <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> The function of the genitals is almost always affected by SCI, by alteration, reduction, or complete loss of sensation. Neuropathic pain, in which damaged nerve pathways signal pain {{in the absence of}} any noxious stimulus, is common after SCI and interferes with sex.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>dysfunction</b> is a {{stressor}} in relationships. People {{are often}} as concerned about failing {{to keep a}} partner satisfied as they are about meeting their own sexual needs. In fact, two of the top reasons people with SCI cite for wanting to have sex are for intimacy and to keep a partner. The frequency of sex correlates with {{the desire of the}} uninjured partner.|$|E

The text emphasizes methods of body cleansing, sexual health promoting conduct, behavior and diet. Certain herb and mineral combinations are part of its regimen. The text asserts that obesity and a life style lacking exercise is linked to <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions,</b> dedicating many verses on it.|$|R
5|$|Sold as Cialis and {{initially}} codenamed IC351, tadalafil {{is a drug}} prescribed for erectile dysfunction (ED) and approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It is a phosphodiesterase type5 (PDE5) inhibitor, similar in function to sildenafil. In addition to ED and PAH, tadalafil has undergone clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia and for female <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction</b> include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body.

5|$|The most {{important}} side effect {{is an increase}} in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced. In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as much weight gain, <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> or sleepiness. Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an atypical antidepressant, different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{researched}} its use {{for treatment}} of female sexual arousal disorder and chronic anorgasmiaa <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction</b> {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasm. The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Magic Wand to be the best method to achieve orgasm. In 2008, The Scientific World Journal published research finding over 93% of a group of 500 chronic anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in many applications, including articles published in Dermatology Online Journal, Journal of Applied Physiology, Experimental Brain Research, Neuroscience Letters, and Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing.|$|E
40|$|Female <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> are {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} and often-underestimated health problem and include disorders of sexual desire, arousal, orgasm and sexual pain, associated with self-distress. Pathophysiology of female <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> {{is complex and}} still poorly understood, {{although it has been}} related to several biological, medical and psychological factors. Amongst women, urogynecological disorders such as urinary incontinence, overactive bladder syndrome, bladder pain syndrome and pelvic organ prolapse, {{have been found to be}} associated with <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions,</b> although the biological and psychological bases of these associations are poorly investigated. Data on sexual function impact of these conditions come from several cross-sectional or community-based, epidemiological studies based on self-administered validated psychometric tools. This review focuses on the most relevant available evidence on the impact of urogynecological disorders and related surgical treatments on female sexual function...|$|R
40|$|The {{most recent}} {{empirical}} and qualitative {{studies indicate that}} at least one-half of adult heterosexual women survivors of childhood sexual abuse experience <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> due to their abuse histories. As few as 42 % {{to as many as}} 88 % of these <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> are in {{the first phase of the}} sexual response cycle (Le., sexual desire and arousal). All of these studies are mostly atheoretical and utilize a traditional performance model to analyze and interpret this data. It is proposed that this traditional framework may be too narrow a perspective of the <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> and the underlying psychosexual adjustment problems of the adult heterosexual woman survivor. A more integrative model of female sexuality is proposed that includes not only sexual functioning but sexual self-image, psychosexual functioning, and influential external stimuli. Directions for future research and practice guidelines are suggested...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> are {{a common}} problem. 152 million men in the world, over 35 million men in Europeand 1. 5 million men in Poland suffer from this problem. Statistics on women suggest that every other womanhas this problem. The {{majority}} of examinations done on men illustrate that risk factors of erectile dysfunctionand cardiovascular diseases are the same {{and first of all}} they are: high cholesterol level, high triglycerides level,hypertension, diabetes, obesity and smoking. In the case of women, according to previous reports the results aresimilar. Moreover, the more risk factors the higher the probability that <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> will occur. Therefore,changing the lifestyle and diet is the main method for preventing and treating <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> as in thecase of cardiovascular diseases. The Mediterranean diet is an antiatherosclerotic diet as it is rich in vegetables,fruit, seeds, nuts, whole grain products, fish and olive oil. Patients with the metabolic syndrome, which wasa tangible cause of <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions,</b> after using a diet typical of Mediterranean countries have improved inthis sphere of life. At the same time an improvement of their lipid profile (decrease in total cholesterol, LDL andtriglycerides and increase in HDL cholesterol) and blood glucose level and reduction of blood pressure and bodyweight were observed...|$|R
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, PDE5 inhibitors, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials have been done in women with SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out. There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
40|$|Forty early menopausal women seeking {{relief from}} sexual {{symptoms}} within a long-term marital relationship and 40 matched women seeking relief of climacteric complaints completed questionnaires concerning three subject: vasomotor and psychosocial symptoms, <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions,</b> and female identity. Results showed {{that women with}} <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> {{were more likely to}} suffer from vasomotor and psychosocial complaints and their feminine identity was based mainly on ideals of motherhood and beauty. In addition, sexual desire disorders were present significantly in those women with higher psychosocial symptoms, while sexual arousal disorders were particularly evident in women suffering more vasomotor symptoms...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} is reviewed and preliminary results of new studies are presented showing that treatment with classical antipsychotics, {{as well as}} risperidone, induces <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> in 30 - 60 % of the patients. These antipsychotics also frequently induce amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea. Although comparative studies are rare, {{it is likely that}} prolactin-sparing antipsychotics, as recently shown in a randomized trial of olanzapine versus risperidone, induce less sexual side effects. From these studies, it becomes apparent that prolactin elevation induced by classical antipsychotics and risperidone is probably a factor in inducing <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions,</b> amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea. The role of other factors inducing <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> like sedation, alpha-blockade, testosterone, dopamine, and serotonin is discussed. Finally, it is concluded that sexual and hormonal effects of antipsychotics, although clearly important, are often neglected in research as in clinical practice. Lowering the dosage or switching to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic often reduces sexual side effects, amenorrhoea, and galactorrhoea. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and type of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> in healthy and sexually active Roman Catholic church-goers was compared with non-church-goers. All the women had had a steady psychosexual relationship with only one partner {{for at least one}} year. The <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> investigated were related only to vaginal intercourse. Although there is {{no significant difference in the}} {{frequency and}} type of <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunctions,</b> the Roman Catholic church-goers more frequently complained of unsatisfying sexual relationships (P< 0. 05) or were requested by their partner on a change in their own sexual behaviour (P< 0. 05). The possible correlations between religiosity and sexual health are discussed. Several investigators have stressed the possibility of the influence of religious background on the sexuality of various population samples.

5|$|Many {{academics}} {{have discussed}} {{use of the}} Magic Wand to treat chronic anorgasmiaa type of <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction</b> {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasmand other sexual problems including female sexual arousal disorder. A study published in 1979 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology analyzed the training of women in self-masturbation techniques in a sample of individuals who previously had difficulty experiencing orgasm. The researchers gave women the Magic Wand to help excite the clitoris and increase the likelihood they would experience an orgasm. They found self-administered treatment using the Magic Wand to be the most efficient option to address prior problems achieving orgasm.|$|E
5|$|Tertiary <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction</b> {{results from}} {{psychological}} and social factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience <b>sexual</b> <b>dysfunction</b> after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
