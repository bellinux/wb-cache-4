5|$|The initial {{mission to}} move a {{metallic}} disc {{from one side of}} an arena to another with a completely autonomous flying robot was seen by many as almost impossible. The college teams continued to improve their entries {{over the next two years}} when the competition saw its first autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing by a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Three years later in 1995 a team from Stanford University was able to acquire a <b>single</b> <b>disk</b> and move it from one side of the arena to the other in a fully autonomous flight—half a decade earlier than some pundits had predicted.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the video game Final Fantasy X was {{composed}} by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu, along with Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. It was the first title in the main Final Fantasy series in which Uematsu was not the sole composer. The Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack was released on four Compact Discs in 2001 by DigiCube, and was re-released in 2004 by Square Enix. Prior to the album's North American release, a reduced version entitled Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack was released on a <b>single</b> <b>disk</b> by Tokyopop in 2002. An EP entitled feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus containing additional singles not present in the game was released by DigiCube in 2001. Piano Collections Final Fantasy X, a collection of piano arrangements of the original soundtracks by Masashi Hamauzu and performed by Aki Kuroda, was released by DigiCube in 2002 and re-released by Square EA in 2004. A collection of vocal arrangements of pieces from the game arranged by Katsumi Suyama along with radio drama tracks was released as Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection in 2002 by DigiCube.|$|E
25|$|IOPS {{performance}} of a ZFS storage pool can suffer if the ZFS raid is not appropriately configured. This applies to all types of RAID, {{in one way or}} another. If the zpool consists of only one group of disks configured as, say, eight disks in RAIDZ2, then the IOPS performance will be that of a <b>single</b> <b>disk</b> (write speed will be equivalent to 6 disks, but random read speed will be similar to a <b>single</b> <b>disk).</b> However, there are ways to mitigate this IOPS performance problem, for instance add SSDs as L2ARC cache— which can boost IOPS into 100.000s. In short, a zpool should consist of several groups of vdevs, each vdev consisting of 8–12 disks, if using RAIDZ. It is not recommended to create a zpool with a single large vdev, say 20 disks, because IOPS performance will be that of a <b>single</b> <b>disk,</b> which also means that resilver time will be very long (possibly weeks with future large drives).|$|E

25|$|Vdevs can be {{manipulated}} while in active use. A <b>single</b> <b>disk</b> can have additional devices added to create a mirrored vdev, and a mirrored vdev can have physical devices added or removed to leave a larger or smaller number of mirrored devices, or a single device. A RaidZ vdev cannot be converted to or from a mirror, although additional vdevs can always be added to expand storage capacity (which can be any kind including RaidZ). A device in any vdev can be marked for removal, and ZFS will de-allocate data from it {{to allow it to}} be removed or replaced.|$|E
25|$|Baird {{performed}} one of {{the earliest}} public demonstrations of color television system on 3 July 1928 using an all-mechanical system with three Nipkow disk scanners synchronized with a <b>single</b> <b>disk</b> on the receiving end and three colored lights that were turned on and off in synchronicity with the broadcaster. The same basic system was used on 4 February 1938 to create the first color broadcast transmissions from The Crystal Palace to the Dominion Theatre in London. Baird {{was not the only one}} to experiment with mechanical color television, and a number of similar devices were demonstrated throughout this period, but Baird is recorded as the first to show a real over-the-air transmission in a public demonstration.|$|E

25|$|If {{the disks}} are {{connected}} to a RAID controller, it is most efficient to configure it as a HBA in JBOD mode (i.e. turn off RAID function). If a hardware RAID card is used, ZFS always detects all data corruption but cannot always repair data corruption because the hardware RAID card will interfere. Therefore, the recommendation is to not use a hardware RAID card, or to flash a hardware RAID card into JBOD/IT mode. For ZFS {{to be able to}} guarantee data integrity, it needs to either have access to a RAID set (so all data is copied to at least two disks), or if one <b>single</b> <b>disk</b> is used, ZFS needs to enable redundancy (copies) which duplicates the data on the same logical drive. Using ZFS copies is a good feature to use on notebooks and desktop computers, since the disks are large and it at least provides some limited redundancy with just a single drive.|$|E

500|$|Numerous Forgotten Realms {{video games}} were {{released}} Between 1990 and 2000. The Eye of the Beholder PC game {{was released in}} 1990. This game was later followed by two sequels, the first in 1991, and the second in 1992. All three games were re-released for DOS on a <b>single</b> <b>disk</b> in 1995. Another 1991 release was Neverwinter Nights on America Online, the first graphical Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG). In 1998, Baldur's Gate was released, {{the first in a}} line of popular role-playing video games developed by BioWare and [...] "considered by most pundits as the hands-down best PC roleplaying game ever". The game was followed by a sequel, [...] in 2000 as well as Icewind Dale, a separate game that utilized the same game engine as Baldur's Gate. [...] was released in 2001. Several popular Forgotten Realms characters such as Drizzt Do'Urden and Elminster made minor appearances in these games.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple disk {{machines}} and [...] "triplex" [...] electrostatic machines (generators with three disks) were also developed extensively {{around the turn}} of the 20th century. In 1900, F. Tudsbury discovered that enclosing a generator in a metallic chamber containing compressed air, or better, carbon dioxide, the insulating properties of compressed gases enabled a greatly improved effect to be obtained owing to the increase in the breakdown voltage of the compressed gas, and reduction of the leakage across the plates and insulating supports. In 1903, Alfred Wehrsen patented an ebonite rotating disk possessing embedded sectors with button contacts at the disk surface. In 1907, Heinrich Wommelsdorf reported a variation of the Holtz machine using this disk and inductors embedded in celluloid plates (DE154175; [...] "Wehrsen machine"). [...] Wommelsdorf also developed several high-performance electrostatic generators, of which the best known were his [...] "Condenser machines" [...] (1920). These were <b>single</b> <b>disk</b> machines, using disks with embedded sectors that were accessed at the edges.|$|E
2500|$|Resilver (repair) of a crashed disk in a ZFS RAID {{can take}} a long time (this is not unique to ZFS, it applies to all types of RAID, in one way or another). This means that very large volumes can take several days to repair or to being back to full {{redundancy}} after severe data corruption or failure, and during this time a second disk failure may occur, especially as the repair puts additional stress on the system as a whole. In turn this means that configurations that only allow for recovery of a <b>single</b> <b>disk</b> failure, such as RAIDZ1 (similar to RAID5) should be avoided. Therefore, with large disks, one should use RAIDZ2 (allow two disks to crash) or RAIDZ3 (allow three disks to crash). [...] It should be noted however, that ZFS RAID differs from conventional RAID by only reconstructing live data and metadata when replacing a disk, not the entirety of the disk including blank and garbage blocks, which means that replacing a member disk on a ZFS pool that is only partially full will take considerably less time compared to conventional RAID.|$|E

2500|$|Erik Sandberg-Diment of The New York Times in January 1984 {{stated that}} Macintosh [...] "presages a {{revolution}} in personal computing". Although preferring larger screens and calling the lack of color a [...] "mistake", he praised that the [...] "refreshingly crisp and clear" [...] display and lack of fan noise. While unsure whether it would become [...] "a second standard to Big Blue", Ronald Rosenberg of The Boston Globe wrote in February of [...] "a euphoria that Macintosh will change how America computes. Anyone that tries the pint-size machine gets hooked by its features". Gregg Williams of BYTE that month found the hardware and software design (which it predicted would be [...] "imitated but not copied") impressive, but criticized {{the lack of a}} standard second disk drive. He predicted that the computer would popularize the 3½-inch floppy disk drive standard, that the Macintosh would improve Apple's reputation, and that it [...] "will delay IBM's domination of the personal computer market." [...] Williams concluded that the Macintosh was [...] "the most important development in computers in the last five years. [...] brings us one step closer to the ideal of computer as appliance." [...] In a follow-up article in the May 1984 issue of BYTE, Williams added, [...] "Initial reaction to the Macintosh has been strongly, but not overpoweringly, favorable. A few traditional computer users see the mouse, the windows, and the desktop metaphor as silly, useless frills, and others are outraged at the lack of color graphics, but most users are impressed by the machine and its capabilities. Still, some people have expressed concern about the relatively small 128K-byte RAM (randomaccess read/write memory) size, the lack of any computer language sent as part of the basic unit, and the inconvenience of the <b>single</b> <b>disk</b> drive." ...|$|E
