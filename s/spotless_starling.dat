5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common starling may {{be confused with}} the closely related <b>spotless</b> <b>starling,</b> the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour.

500|$|The common {{starling}} is [...] long, with a wingspan of [...] and {{a weight}} of [...] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is [...] and the tarsus is [...] The plumage is iridescent black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted {{than those of}} adult females {{at a given time}} of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in summer, females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. Moulting occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers), which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering, especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always-dark pupil is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered. The common starling is mid-sized by both starling standards and passerine standards. It is readily distinguished from other mid-sized passerines, such as thrushes, icterids or small corvids, by its relatively short tail, sharp, blade-like bill, round-bellied shape and strong, sizeable (and rufous-coloured) legs. In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat waddling gait is also characteristic. The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings, although the closely related <b>spotless</b> <b>starling</b> may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage.|$|E
50|$|Infestations by Carnus hemapterus {{appear to}} be rather {{harmless}} for the host chicks. In spite of that, barn owl females advertise their resistance genes by the dark spots on their breast and belly; nestlings of heavily spotted females {{tend to be more}} resistant. In this study, potential environmental confounding effects were controlled for by cross-fostering chicks. The spots on the eggs of <b>spotless</b> <b>starlings</b> also predict nestling resistance against Carnus infestations, although the adaptive value of this phenomenon is not clear.|$|R
500|$|The global {{population}} of the common starling {{is estimated to be}} more than 310million individuals and its numbers are not thought to be declining significantly, so the bird is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. It had shown a marked increase in numbers throughout Europe from the 19th century to around the 1950s and 60s. In about 1830, S. v. vulgaris expanded its range in the British Isles, spreading into Ireland and areas of Scotland where it had formerly been absent, although S. v. zetlandicus was already present in Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. The common starling has bred in northern Sweden from 1850 and in Iceland from 1935. The breeding range spread through southern France to northeastern Spain, and there were other range expansions particularly in Italy, Austria and Finland. It started breeding in Iberia in 1960, while the <b>spotless</b> <b>starling's</b> range had been expanding northward since the 1950s. The low rate of advance, about [...] per year for both species, is due to the suboptimal mountain and woodland terrain. Expansion has since slowed even further due to direct competition between the two similar species where they overlap in southwestern France and northwestern Spain.|$|R
40|$|Adjustment of {{offspring}} sex ratios {{should be}} favoured {{by natural selection}} when parents are capable of facultatively altering brood sex ratios and of recognizing the circumstances that predict the probable fitness benefit of producing sons and daughters. Although experimental {{studies have shown that}} female birds may adjust offspring sex ratios in response to changes in their own condition and in the external appearance of their mate, and male attributes other than his external morphology are also thought to act as signals of male quality, it is not known whether females will respond to changes in such signals, {{in the absence of any}} change in the appearance of the male himself. Here, we experimentally manipulated a male courtship display, the green plants carried to the nest by male <b>spotless</b> <b>starlings</b> (Sturnus unicolor), without changing any physical attributes of the male himself, and examined whether this influenced female decisions on offspring sex ratio. We found that in an environment in which female starlings were producing more daughters than sons, experimental enhancement of the green nesting material caused females to significantly increase the number of male eggs produced and thereby removed the female bias. This effect was consistent in 2 years and at two localities. This demonstrates that the green material, whose function has long puzzled biologists, conveys important information to the female and that she facultatively adjusts offspring production accordingly...|$|R

40|$|Intraspecific brood {{parasitism}} {{is widespread}} among birds and provides clues for elucidating the evolutionary origin of interspecific brood parasitism. Studies suggest that brood parasitism {{does not occur}} at random, but that parasitic females select nests with advantages such as higher physical stability, reduced predation risk, or lower ectoparasite infestations. However, this evidence is sparse and mainly correlative. By experimentally increasing the abundance of Carnus hemapterus (a common, generalist and widespread ectoparasitic nest fly of a multitude of bird species) in half of the nests, we show that parasitic <b>Spotless</b> <b>Starlings</b> (Sturnus unicolor) avoid conspecific nests infested by ectoparasites. Since Carnus ectoparasites impinge costs on their avian nestling hosts, this avoidance response would be adaptive for parasitic Starlings. Further, we suggest a mechanism by which parasitic females may assess the level of ectoparasite infestation to select host nests accordingly: by using parasite cues such as faeces and blood remains. Additionally, these cues may be used by parasitic females for synchronization with the reproductive cycle of host females because ectoparasite cues also indicate that incubation has already commenced. Whatever the functionality, the mechanism suggested here may be employed by intra- and interspecific brood parasites, so it might represent a widespread strategy in nature.

Although several {{hypotheses}} have been proposed to explain the function of fresh green plants in nests of many avian species, the consequences of this behavior on fitness remain poorly understood. In accordance with the nest protection and drug hypotheses, adding greenery to nests should be naturally selected to facilitate positive fitness effects on offspring. Alternatively, the courtship hypothesis postulates that green plants function as a sexually selected signal of male attractiveness that might promote female competition for preferred males. We conducted a long-term study by experimentally increasing the amount of green plants in nests of a wild population of <b>spotless</b> <b>starlings</b> (Sturnus unicolor). We experimentally decoupled the natural carrying behavior of males in half of the population and explored the consequences of this manipulation on offspring condition and their rate of local recruitment. Treatment did not affect the number of fledglings, but it did affect body mass and tarsus in a sexually antagonistic way: a positive effect on female tarsus length and negative on male body mass. The addition of greenery reduced the probability of local recruitment of both males and females. Our results suggest that the addition of green plants induces maternal response with complex short- and long-term consequences on the offspring body condition and recruitment success.

40|$|Nest {{materials}} used by animals can have profound effects on developing offspring. They can modify the bacterial and parasitic {{environment of the}} nest, and can influence parental investment through sexual signalling processes. In <b>spotless</b> <b>starlings,</b> Sturnus unicolor, green plants and feathers are known nest materials with such functions. The aim of our study was to experimentally assess their influence on nestlings' telomere length and attrition, which are good predictors of their survival prospects. In a full-factorial experiment, we explored these effects in two different populations, together with the potential effects of hatching date, ectoparasitism, bacterial environment and nestling growth. Telomere length and attrition largely depended on population identity and hatching date. After correcting for these effects, the addition of feathers resulted in higher rates of telomere attrition. The addition of plants did not affect nestling telomeres in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of green plants resulted in longer telomeres. Feather pigmentation also did not affect telomere length or attrition in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of unpigmented feathers resulted in nestlings with longer telomeres and lower attrition rates. Moreover, prevalence of staphylococci on the skin of 8 -day-old nestlings was negatively related to telomere lengths of fledglings. Taken together, these results suggest a direct link between nest material composition and nestling telomere length and dynamics. This relationship could be partially mediated by the antimicrobial and/or antiparasitic properties of nest materials or by sexual signalling processes. We discuss possible roles of maternal effects, parasites, immunity and nestling growth in explaining these experimental effects.

50|$|A {{chemical}} communication in vertebrates {{is not as}} important as visual and auditory communication and is widely understudied for many species such as birds. For the <b>spotless</b> <b>starling</b> Sturnus unicolor, a study has shown that the starling is able to discriminate the sex within their species using olfactory cues. The hormones secreted by the uropygial gland convey information on sex, age and reproductive status. The uropygial gland is an opening located on most avian species towards the base of the tail. The gland secretes an oily fluid associated with preening, or cleaning of the feathers. The uropygial gland itself is said {{to be associated with the}} secretion of specific chemical cues enabling the functioning of the gland as a chemical signal used in mate choice.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spotless</b> <b>starling</b> uses a {{wide range}} of habitats, and can be found in any {{reasonable}} open environment from farmland and olive groves to human habitation. The highest population densities are in open grazed holm oak woods, and in urban habitats such as Gibraltar, where it is common. The population has grown in recent decades with a northward expansion in range, spreading to the whole of Spain (previously absent from the northeast) between 1950-1980, and colonising locally along the south coast of mainland France since 1983. Like its commoner relative, it is an omnivore, taking a wide variety of invertebrates, berries, and human-provided scraps. It is gregarious, forming sizeable flocks, often mixed with common starlings, of up to 100,000 in winter.|$|E
5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} starlings, {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the <b>spotless</b> and white-cheeked <b>starlings),</b> where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer {{down the length of}} the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|R
40|$|Selective {{pressures}} {{imposed by}} pathogenic microorganisms to embryos have selected in hosts for {{a battery of}} antimicrobial lines of defenses that includes physical and chemical barriers. Due to the antimicrobial properties of volatile compounds of green plants and of chemicals of feather degrading bacteria, the use of aromatic plants and feathers for nest building has been suggested as one of these barriers. However, experimental evidence suggesting such effects is scarce in the literature. During two consecutive years, we explored experimentally {{the effects of these}} nest materials on loads of different groups of bacteria (mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus) of eggshells in nests of <b>spotless</b> <b>starlings</b> (Sturnus unicolor) at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the incubation period. This was also explored in artificial nests without incubation activity. We also experimentally increased bacterial density of eggs in natural and artificial nests and explored the effects of nest lining treatments on eggshell bacterial load. Support for the hypothetical antimicrobial function of nest materials was mainly detected for the year and location with larger average values of eggshell bacterial density. The beneficial effects of feathers and plants were more easily detected in artificial nests with no incubation activity, suggesting an active role of incubation against bacterial colonization of eggshells. Pigmented and unpigmented feathers reduced eggshell bacterial load in starling nests and artificial nest boxes. Results from artificial nests allowed us to discuss and discard alternative scenarios explaining the detected association, particularly those related to the possible sexual role of feathers and aromatic plants in starling nests. All these results considered together confirm the antimicrobial functionality mainly of feathers but also of plants used as nest materials, and highlight the importance of temporally and geographically environmental variation associated with risk of bacterial proliferation determining the strength of such effects. Because of costs associated to nest building, birds should adjust nest building effort to expected bacterial environments during incubation, a prediction that should be further explored.

Confusion with the common starling is particularly easy during the winter when common starlings are abundant throughout the spotless starling's range, but also in summer where their breeding ranges overlap in northeastern Spain and the far south of France.

40|$|Although the {{presence}} of feathers in the nest is widespread among birds, {{it has not been}} previously suggested that feathers can be used as sexual signals.

Feathers of the wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) and the <b>spotless</b> <b>starling,</b> which exhibit higher ultraviolet and visible reflectance on their reverse side, were predominantly placed with this side upwards. On the contrary, feathers of the jay (Garrulus glandarius) were predominantly found exhibiting the obverse side, which possesses higher reflectance in this species.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} {{proposed that the}} blue-green coloration in eggs of many avian species may constitute a sexually selected female signal.

In this study, we use three different experimental approaches to explore the importance of sexual selection on blue-green egg coloration of <b>spotless</b> <b>starling</b> (Sturnus unicolor) eggs. First, experimental deterioration of female body condition (by means of wing feather removal) negatively affected the intensity of blue-green egg coloration. Second, blue-green color intensity of artificial model eggs had a significant positive influence on paternal feeding effort. Finally, we found a negative relationship between the effect of experimental food supply on nestling immunocompetence {{and the intensity of}} blue-green coloration of eggs, suggesting that egg color predicts nutritional conditions that nestlings will experience during development.

Among un-fed chicks, absence calls were more frequent in smaller nestlings. We found a positive relationship between nestling reaction time to parental arrival and food acquisition: chicks that reacted first received more feedings that slower chicks.

40|$|Owing to the {{conspicuousness}} of ultraviolet (UV) colour in dark environments, {{natural selection}} might have selected UV egg coloration {{because it would}} enhance egg detectability by parents in murky nests. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using comparative and experimental approaches. First, we studied variation in egg coloration of 98 species of European passerines measured using UV–visible reflectance spectrometry (300 – 700  nm) in relation to nesting habits. Analyses based on raw data and controlling for phylogenetic distances both at the species and the family levels revealed that hole-nester species produced eggs with higher UV reflectance than those nesting in open habitats. The experimental approach consisted of the manipulation of UV reflectance of the experimental eggs introduced outside the nest-cup of the hole-nester <b>spotless</b> <b>starling</b> Sturnus unicolor {{and the study of}} the retrieval of these eggs. Ultraviolet-reflecting eggs (controls) were more frequently retrieved to the nest-cup than non-reflecting (–UV) eggs. These results were not due to ‘–UV’ eggs being recognized by starlings as parasitic because when a parasitic egg is detected, starlings removed it from the nest-box. Therefore, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that UV egg colours are designed to provide highly detectable targets for parent birds in dark nest environments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Hematocrit, the {{proportion}} of blood volume occupied by packed red blood cells, is frequently used as an estimate of phenotypic condition. Some studies in birds, however, suggest that hematocrit might not always be a good estimate of condition. We tested the reliability of hematocrit as an estimate of condition by investigating the relationship between hematocrit and two other estimates of phenotypic condition (body mass controlled for body size and T-cell-mediated immune response) in nestlings of the <b>Spotless</b> <b>Starling</b> (Sturnus unicolor) under different envi-ronmental conditions. Half of each brood received an experimental food supplement while the other half was kept as a control. Hematocrit {{was positively related to}} relative body mass only in control nestlings whereas the relationship between hematocrit and cellular immune response was far from significant in both groups of nes-tlings. As expected, experimental food supply weakened the relationship between hematocrit and relative body mass, but this effect was not mediated by a decrease in the variation of phenotypic condition among nestlings. Instead, the effect of food supplementation was condition-depen-dent, reducing hematocrit in heavier than average nestlings, and increasing hematocrit in lighter than average nestlings. These results suggest that hematocrit might not be a reliable estimate of phenotypic condition under certain nutritional circumstances...|$|E
40|$|Sibling {{competition}} {{has been shown}} to affect overall growth rates in birds. However, growth consists on the coordinated development of a multitude of structures, and there is ample scope for developmental plasticity and trade-offs among these structures. We would expect that the growth of structures that are used in sibling competition, such as the gape of altricial nestlings, should be prioritized under intense competition. We conducted an experiment in the <b>spotless</b> <b>starling</b> (Sturnus unicolor), cross-fostering nestlings to nests with different levels of sibling competition. We predicted that nestlings subjected to higher levels of sibling competition should develop larger gapes than control birds. We found that, halfway through the nestling period, overall size (a composite index of mass, wing, tarsus and bill) was reduced in nests with intense sibling competition, whereas gape width remained unaffected. At the end of the nestling period, experimental nestlings had wider gapes than controls. Additionally, a correlative study showed that nestling gape width increased when feeding conditions worsened and overall size decreased. These patterns could either be due to increased growth of gape flanges or to delayed reabsorption of this structure. Our results show that birds can invest differentially in the development of organs during growth, and that the growth of organs used in sibling competition is prioritized over structural growth...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} growing {{evidence}} that birds may have individual chemical profiles that can function in several social contexts, offspring recognition based on olfactory cues has never been explored. This ability should be more likely evolved in colonial birds and/or species suffering brood parasitism, in which {{the risk of being}} engaged in costly misdirected parental care is high. We performed a choice experiment to examine whether females of the <b>spotless</b> <b>starling,</b> Sturnus unicolor, a species that is colonial, and where a fraction of the population is exposed to intraspecific brood parasitism, can discriminate between the scent of their offspring and that of unrelated nestlings. We also explored whether the development of the uropygial gland secretion {{may play a role in}} such olfactory discrimination by performing the choice experiments to females rearing nestlings of two different ages, that is, without and with developed uropygial glands. Results showed that female starlings did not preferentially choose the scent of their offspring, independently of whether the gland of nestlings was developed or not. Our results suggest that female starlings do not have or do not show the ability to distinguish their offspring based on olfaction, at least up to 12 - 14 days of nestling age. Further research is needed to examine whether odour-based discrimination may function when fledgling starlings leave the nest and the risk of costly misidentification is likely to increase...|$|E
40|$|Begging in avian nestlings is {{a highly}} {{conspicuous}} behavior with important implications {{for the study of}} parent [...] offspring conflict. In some species, nestlings also call for long bouts in the absence of parents, and it has been proposed that this behavior is used by nestlings as a means of negotiating access to food. We studied this phenomenon in the <b>spotless</b> <b>starling</b> (Sturnus unicolor). We found that parent-absent calls were acoustically distinct from parent-present calls. Observations showed that the probability of parent-absent begging increased with nestling age and brood size, whereas it decreased with increasing body condition. This result was confirmed by an experiment that showed that nestlings produced higher parent-absent begging rates when food deprived than when satiated. Finally, we carried out a playback experiment to test the reaction of nestlings to parent-absent begging by fellow nestlings. Principle components analyses yielded 2 independent components of begging: 1) a general begging component and 2) a second factor that measures the relative contribution of communicative begging over competitive begging. Nestlings exposed to playback decreased their general begging levels and simultaneously increased the relative contribution of communicative over competitive begging. This behavior may favor needy nestlings to obtain impending feedings while keeping high levels of food solicitation from parents and is consistent with a cooperative strategy among nestlings. Future research should consider the actual response of parents to these signals. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|Several {{techniques}} in ecological immunology {{have been used}} to assess bird immunocompetence thus providing useful information to understand the contribution of the immunological system in life-history decisions. The phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) -skin test has been the most widely employed technique being interpreted as the sole result of T lymphocytes proliferation and hence used to evaluate acquired immunological capacity. However, the presence of high numbers of phagocytic cells in the swelling point has cast some doubt about such an assumption. To address this issue, we collected blood from 14 days-old nestlings of <b>spotless</b> <b>starling</b> (Sturnus unicolor), administered subcutaneous PHA immediately after and then measured the swelling response 24 hours later. Differential counts of white blood cells suggested that an intense development of acquired immunological defences was taking place. The phagocytic activity of both heterophiles and monocytes was also very intense as it was the swelling response. Moreover, our results show, {{for the first time in}} birds, a positive relationship between the phagocytic activity of both kinds of cells and the swelling response. This broadens the significance of the PHA test from reflecting T lymphocytes proliferation -as previously proposed but still undetermined in vivo- to evaluate phagocytosis as well. In other words, our data suggest that the PHA swelling response may not be considered as the only consequence of processes of specific and induced immunity -T lymphocytes proliferation- but also of constitutive and nonspecific immunity -heterophiles and monocytes phagocytosis. We propose the extensive use of PHA-skin test as an optimal technique to assess immunocompetence...|$|E
40|$|Female birds may {{adjust their}} {{offspring}} phenotype {{to the specific}} requirements of the environment by differential allocation of physiologically active substances into yolks, such as androgens. Yolk androgens {{have been shown to}} accelerate embryonic development, growth rate and competitive ability of nestlings, but they can also entail immunological costs. The balance between costs and benefits of androgen allocation is expected to depend on nestling environment. We tested this hypothesis in a multibrooded passerine, the <b>spotless</b> <b>starling,</b> Sturnus unicolor. We experimentally manipulated yolk androgen levels using a between-brood design and evaluated its effects on nestling development, survival and immune function. Both in first and replacement broods, the embryonic development period was shorter for androgen-treated chicks than controls, but there were no differences in second broods. In replacement broods, androgen-treated chicks were heavier and larger than those hatched from control eggs, but this effect was not observed in the other breeding attempts. Androgen exposure reduced survival with respect to controls only in second broods. Regarding immune function, we detected nonsignificant trends for androgen treatment to activate two important components of innate and adaptive immunity (IL- 6 and Ig-A levels, respectively). Similarly, androgen-treated chicks showed greater lymphocyte proliferation than controls in the first brood and an opposite trend in the second brood. Our results indicate that yolk androgen effects on nestling development and immunity depend on the environmental conditions of each breeding attempt. Variation in maternal androgen allocation to eggs could be explained as the result of context-dependent optimal strategies to maximize offspring fitness. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Avian embryos {{are exposed}} to yolk androgens that are {{incorporated}} into the egg by the ovulating female. These steroids can affect several aspects of embryo development, often resulting in increases in overall size or the speed of growth of different traits. However, several studies suggest that they also entail immune costs to the offspring. In this study, we explored whether variation in yolk androgen concentration affected several measures of the constitutive and cell-mediated immune axes in the <b>spotless</b> <b>starling</b> (Sturnus unicolor). Using a within-brood design, we injected different doses of androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) into the eggs. Our study showed that experimentally increased yolk androgens led to sex-specific immunosuppression in both the innate and adaptive axes of the immune system. Both cell-mediated immune response (CMI) and lysozyme activity decreased with increasing androgen levels injected into the egg {{in the case of}} male nestlings, whereas there were no effects on females. The effects that we found were always linear: no quadratic or threshold patterns were detected. We found no effects of the experimental treatment in hemolysis or agglutination capacity, but these measures were negatively correlated with CMI, suggesting negative correlation among different branches of the immune system. Blood (trypanosomes and hemosporidians) and intestinal (coccidia) parasites were not affected by the experimental increase of yolk androgen levels. Our results show that in our study species yolk androgens induce immunosuppression in some axes of the male nestling immune system. Further studies should analyze the proximate causes for these contrasting effects in different axes of the immune system and the reason for the differential impact on males and females...|$|E
40|$|The avian nest is an {{essential}} structure for offspring development. For adults, nest building entails costs in terms of time, energy, and exposure to predators and parasites. Amount and diversity of materials used for nest building depend on their availability and functionality in scenarios of sexual selection and parasitism. Green plants and feathers of different colors have been hypothesized to play key roles in offspring protection against pathogens, and we here experimentally assessed <b>spotless</b> <b>starling</b> (Sturnus unicolor) preferences for pigmented versus unpigmented feathers and for different green plants (aromatic vs. non-aromatic plants) as nest materials. We predicted a preferential selection of unpigmented feathers and aromatic plants according to the antimicrobial properties of these materials described in the literature. We evaluated these predictions during nest building and during egg-laying stages. As expected, starlings preferentially selected unpigmented feathers both before and during egg laying, while aromatic plants were preferentially selected only during the egg-laying stage. These results suggest that starlings prefer nest materials that enhance antimicrobial protection of their offspring. We also discuss some other, non-exclusive functions that might explain the observed preference for nest materials, {{especially with regard to}} their potential role in sexual signalingThis work was supported by Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, European funds (FEDER) (CGL 2010 - 19233 -C 03 - 01, CGL 2010 - 19233 -C 03 - 03, CGL 2013 - 48193 -C 3 - 1 -P, CGL 2013 - 48193 -C 3 - 2 -P).
