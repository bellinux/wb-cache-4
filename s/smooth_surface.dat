5|$|Members of the Sclerodermatineae have {{fruit body}} shapes ranging from boletoid (with a cap, stipe, and tubes on the {{underside}} of the cap) to gasteroid. Boletoid fruit bodies sometimes have hollow stipes with a surface that is smooth to somewhat furfuraceous (covered with flaky particles), and lack the reticulation (a net-like pattern of interlacing lines) characteristic of some members of the Boletaceae. The pores are merulioid (wrinkled with low, uneven ridges), boletinoid, and either fine or coarse. The flesh is usually whitish to yellowish, and some species exhibit a blue staining reaction upon injury. In mass, spores are yellow; microscopically, the spores are ellipsoid in shape and have a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{ellipsoid}} in shape, with a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface,</b> {{and contain}} a large central oil drop surrounded by smaller droplets. The spore dimensions are 32–43 by 25–38μm, the walls measuring 1–3μm thick. Although not reactive with Melzer's reagent, spores stain readily with Methyl blue. The asci contain 6 to 8 spores per ascus. They are variably shaped, with dimensions of 70–110 by 60–100μm, with a stem 10–40 by 6–10μm, and a forked base. Initially about 3μm thick, the ascus walls thin to roughly 1μm when mature. The gleba comprises loosely interwoven, thin-walled hyaline hyphae measuring 5–13μm in diameter.|$|E

They are thin-walled, inamyloid, {{and have a}} <b>smooth</b> <b>surface.</b> Each features a prominent hilar appendage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells), measuring 32–42 by 6–9μm, are club-shaped and four-spored, with sterigmata up to 7μm long. Cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the gill edges) are abundant, and measure 15–40 by 3–6μm; no pleurocystida (cystidia on the gill faces) are present. The cap cuticle comprises {{a thin layer of}} 3–6μm-wide hyphae that are interwoven either loosely or tightly. All hyphae of O.nidiformis have clamp connections.|$|E

There are both two- and four-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), {{and they are}} club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 28–36 by 10–12µm. Cystidia are plentiful, and are found in bundles lined along the tube mouths (as cheilocystidia), or more commonly, singly {{along the sides of}} the tubes (as pleurocystidia). These structures are thin-walled, cylindrical, and measure 48–60 by 7–9µm. The scales on the cap surface comprise more or less erect hyphae with tips that are clustered together. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|A snow groomer is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether.

With {{the invention of the}} motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at ski resorts, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or snowcat and then hauled across the area to be groomed.|$|E

5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface.</b> Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
5|$|It has {{a smooth}} and bright surface, {{with a layer}} of water {{surrounding}} the mantle of the planet, thought to be 100 kilometers thick. The <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> includes a layer of ice, while the bottom of the ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean. So far, {{there is no evidence that}} life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive-brown. Spores are {{somewhat}} fuse-shaped in face view, and inequilateral in profile view. They have a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface,</b> a tiny apical pore, and dimensions of 11–15 by 4–5.5μm, with walls about 0.2μm thick. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 8–12μm thick. Pleurocystidia (on the tube walls) are 28–42 by 6–11μm with a 3–μm neck, whereas the cheilocystidia (on the pore edges) are narrowly club-shaped and slightly smaller, measuring 26–38 by 4–8μm. Pleurocystidia tend to not protrude further than sporulating basidia. The cap cuticle comprises a 150μm-thick layer of narrow hyphae measuring 3–5μm {{more or less}} arranged in a trichodermium (wherein the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface). These hyphae stain red when mounted in Melzer's reagent and yellow in potassium hydroxide. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E

5|$|Valuable {{clues about}} Han {{architecture}} {{can be found}} in Han artwork of ceramic models, paintings, and carved or stamped bricks discovered in tombs and other sites. The layout of Han tombs were also built like underground houses, comparable to the scenes of courtyard houses found on tomb bricks and in three-dimensional models. Han homes had a courtyard area (and some had multiple courtyards) with halls that were slightly elevated above it and connected by stairways. Multi-story buildings included the main colonnaded residence halls built around the courtyards as well as watchtowers. The halls were built with intersecting crossbeams and rafters that were usually carved with decorations; stairways and walls were usually plastered over to produce a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> and then painted.|$|E
5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E
5|$|Crucibulum {{species have}} light tan to cinnamon-colored fruiting bodies, {{known as a}} {{peridium}}, that are cup- or crucible-shaped. Depending on the species, {{the size of the}} peridium may range from 2–4tall by 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth (for C.parvulum) to 5–10mm tall by 5–8mm wide (for C.laeve). Viewed microscopically, the wall of the peridium is made of a single layer of tissue, in contrast to the three-layered peridium wall in Cyathus species. The outer surface of the peridium has hyphae that agglutinate so as to form a texture with visible filaments, a condition known as fibrillose; this outer layers of hairs typically wears off with age to leave a relatively <b>smooth</b> <b>surface.</b> Young specimens have a thin layer of tissue called an epiphragm that covers the top of the peridium; it wears off at maturity to expose the peridioles within. There are usually 4–6 peridioles (up to 15 have been noted for C.laeve) that are disc-shaped, whitish in color, and attached to the endoperidium by a strand called a funicular cord. Made of mycelia, The funicular cord tends to wither away and disappear as the fruiting body ages. Spores from Crucibulum species typically have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape, and are thick-walled, transclucent (hyaline) or light yellow-brown in color, with dimensions of 5–15 by 5–8µm. the spores of C.cyathiforme are notably slightly or strongly curved.|$|E

5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that {{the arrangement of the}} plates on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that the plates in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates of the same size and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of the plates of Hesperosaurus show a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> with long and parallel, shallow grooves.

5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface.</b> In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Appropriate surface {{wettability}} and roughness of biomaterials is {{an important}} factor in cell attachment and proliferation. In this study, we investigated the correlation between surface wettability and roughness, and biological response in human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs). We prepared wettable and rough gradient polyethylene (PE) surfaces by increasing the power of a radio frequency corona discharge apparatus with knife-type electrodes over a moving sample bed. The PE changed gradually from hydrophobic and <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> to hydrophilic (water contact angle, 90 ° to ~ 50 °) and rough (80 to ~ 120 nm) surfaces as the power increased. We found that hADSCs adhered better to highly hydrophilic and rough surfaces and showed broadly stretched morphology compared with that on hydrophobic and <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The proliferation of hADSCs on hydrophilic and rough surfaces was also higher than that on hydrophobic and <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Furthermore, integrin beta 1 gene expression, an indicator of attachment, and heat shock protein 70 gene expression were high on hydrophobic and <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces.</b> These results indicate that the cellular behavior of hADSCs on gradient surface depends on surface properties, wettability and roughness...|$|R
