2500|$|Ford began {{shipping}} Fordson tractors to Ford Motor Company Limited in Britain in 1917 to meet {{an order}} from the British government for 5,000. Between the time the order was accepted and when production started, Ford overhauled the design to solve several problems. The car-type radiator was enlarged to [...] capacity to cure overheating problems. The additional weight also helped hold the front down. In early Fordsons, the worm drive was located at the top under the driver's seat. During heavy operation the heat became unbearable to the operator. The worm drive was relocated {{to solve this problem}} and also allowed larger rear wheels which improved traction. Several changes were also made to simplify manufacture. The Fordson used the Model T coil magneto system; and water and oil pumps were eliminated in favor of the simpler thermosiphon cooling and <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> {{was also}} used on the first {{internal}} combustion engines. It persisted for some time, even in the first high-performance cars.

The {{aim of the}} work is to investigate the gas-liquid flows in the pipe at extrernal cross vibrations and at pulsations of the flow rate and also to investigate the dynamic processes in two-phase media in the closed capacities. The diagnostic methods of gas-liquid flows at presence of the vibrations and flow rate pulsations have been developed, the influence of the temperature and physical liquid properties on the vibration mixing has been investigated experimentally. The data about influence of the external cross vibrations and flow rate pulsations on the hydrodynamic parameters at flow of the gas-liquid flows in pipe have been obtained firstly.

5000|$|Bel Air {{interiors}} had {{an optional}} massive expanse of chrome across {{the lower part}} of the dashboard (most were painted), along with a deluxe Bel Air steering wheel with full chrome horn ring. Carpeting and full wheel covers rounded out Bel Air standard equipment. For 1954, the Bel Air stayed essentially the same, except for a revised grille and taillights, and a revised engine that had insert bearings and higher oil pressure, needed for the full-flow oil filtration system that was not available prior to 1954. Prior to 1954, the 235 and 216 cubic inch six cylinder engines had babbit bearings and scoops to create oil pressure at the bottom of each rod and the oil pressure was standard at 15-30 PSI. During these years, there were three engine choices, depending on the transmission ordered. Both 235 cubic inch engines were [...] "Blue Flame" [...] inline six cylinder OHV engines, featuring hydraulic valve lifters (in 1953 with automatic transmissions) and aluminum pistons. The [...] 235 cubic inch displacement engine was standard on stickshift models, with solid lifters and <b>splash</b> plus pressure <b>lubrication</b> including babbit bearings. Powerglide cars got a [...] version which had hydraulic lifters and full pressure lubrication.|$|R

5000|$|Lubrication: Wet sump, <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication.</b> A hook, {{attached}} {{onto the}} connecting rod, dips into {{the oil in}} the sump and splashes it around {{the inside of the}} engine.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> system no {{oil pump}} is used. Instead the {{crankshaft}} dips into {{the oil in}} the sump and due to its high speed, it splashes the crankshaft, connecting rods {{and bottom of the}} pistons. The connecting rod big end caps may have an attached scoop to enhance this effect. The valve train may also be sealed in a flooded compartment, or open to the crankshaft {{in a way that it}} receives splashed oil and allows it to drain back to the sump. <b>Splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> is common for small 4-stroke engines.|$|E
50|$|The old <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> was {{superseded}} by wet sump lubrication. A three-speed gearbox was now {{attached to the}} engine and incorporated a heavy-duty clutch. Sales soared and new dealerships were established.|$|E
50|$|A pumped {{oil system}} can use higher oil {{pressures}} and so makes {{the use of}} hydrostatic bearings easier. These gave a greater load capacity and soon became essential for small, lightweight engines such as in cars. It was this bearing design that saw the end of <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> and total loss oiling. It disappeared from nearly all cars in the 1920s, although total loss continued in small low power stationary engines into the 1950s. Chevrolet used <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> for their rod bearings until 1953, where it was phased out for the 235 'Six,' and then in 1954 when the 216 was eliminated from their line, and both the solid lifter and hydraulic lifter versions of the 235 had full-pressure lubrication.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> is a {{rudimentary}} form of oil cooling. Some slow-turning early engines {{would have a}} [...] "splashing spoon" [...] beneath the big end of the connecting rod. This spoon would dip into sump oil and would hurl oil about, {{in the hope of}} cooling and lubricating the underside of the piston.|$|E
50|$|Lubrication {{is fully}} forced {{including}} to the gudgeon pins. Cold starting conditions are provided for by <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> to all vital parts. There are separate inlet and exhaust manifolds on the offside (left) with a hotspot. Cooling water circulates naturally to the radiator. A mechanical fuel pump delivers petrol from a tank {{at the back}} of the car.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{recirculating}} systems used {{a collection}} sump, but no pumped circulation, merely 'splash' lubrication where the connecting rod dipped into the oil surface and splashed it around. These {{first appeared on}} high-speed steam engines. Later, <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> engines added a 'dipper', a metal rod whose only function was to dip into the oil and spread it around.|$|E
50|$|The 171 CID L was {{the sole}} member of this family. It {{featured}} <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication.</b> For its last year (1928) it gained a revised carburetor, higher compression, aluminum pistons, and larger valves for a rating of 35 horsepower at 2,200 rpm. Because of increased weight of the slightly longer 1928 Chevrolet National Series AB performance failed to improve from the 1927 Chevrolet Series AA Capitol.|$|E
50|$|Most manual {{transmissions}} rely on <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> {{although some}} five speed Rover gearboxes did incorporate an oil pump. The problem with <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> {{is that it}} is speed dependent. There are centrifugal effects, hydrodynamic effects and effects from the gears working as pumps. If a gearbox is fitted with Perspex windows and run on a test rig these effects can be observed. As the gearbox is run through its rev range, the oil jets will switch over and move around. Research on the Austin Maxi 1500 gearbox showed that one of the ball races was running dry at 80 mph. The solution was to alter the casting to include a small projection that would intercept the main oil jet that was present at 80 mph and disperse it. This small modification enabled the later Maxi 1750 gearbox to be relatively trouble free. Four speed gearboxes seldom show these problems because at top speed (and maximum power) they are basically a solid shaft and the gears are not transmitting power.|$|E
50|$|For the 1930 {{model year}} Hudson debuted a new {{flathead}} inline eight cylinder engine with block and Crankcase {{cast as a}} unit and fitted with two cylinder heads. A 2.75 inch bore and 4.5 inch stroke displaced 218.8 cubic inches developing 80 HP at 3,600 RPM with the standard 5.78:1 Compression ratio. The 5 Main bearing Crankshaft had 8 integral counterweights, an industry first, and also employed a Lanchester vibration damper. Four rubber blocks were used at engine mount points. A valveless oil pump improved the Hudson <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the automotive uses listed above (i.e. in two-stroke-engine vehicles and early four-stroke Saabs), freewheels were used in some luxury or up-market conventional cars (such as Rovers and Cords) from the 1930s into the 1960s. Some engines of the period also tended to pass oil past the piston rings under conditions with a closed throttle and high engine speed, when the slight vacuum in the combustion chamber combined with high oil pressure and {{a high degree of}} <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> from the fast-turning crankshaft would lead to oil getting in the combustion chamber.|$|E

50|$|Simplicity is an {{important}} feature of the PC50 with an automatic clutch driving a fixed ratio, <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> to the engine parts except {{for the use of}} a small pump to the parallel valves. The sump has an oil capacity of 0.8 - 0.9 litre for the OHC model and 0.75 litre for the OHV. The engine has an 8.5:1 compression ratio, coil ignition with no advance-retard mechanism, and fixed timing position. The engine output is rated as 1.8 bhp @ 5,700rpm, and carburetion served by a 14mm Keihin with a direct shutter choke operated on a simple side lever. The early OHC models had a generator which developed a total 6V x 15W output, which was uprated to 23W with the introduction of the OHV engine in 1970.|$|E
50|$|Unlike larger engines, the {{crankcase}} {{does not}} contain only engine oil because it handles the fuel/air mixture. Instead, oil is {{mixed in with the}} fuel supply as petroil, and this mixture provides <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> for the cylinder walls, crankshaft and connecting rod bearings. Using ball or roller bearings for the bearings in such engines has always been more common than the oil-fed plain bearings used for other engines, as these are more amenable to using this oil mist lubrication. These engines have been used in larger sizes for small cars. They were considered in the 1980s as more fuel efficient engines for larger cars, but the increased interest in engine emissions at this time prevented their use: mixing their lubricating oil into the engine's intake mixture gave high HC emissions and this problem was not overcome.|$|E
5000|$|Ford began {{shipping}} Fordson tractors to Ford Motor Company Limited in Britain in 1917 to meet {{an order}} from the British government for 5,000. Between the time the order was accepted and when production started, Ford overhauled the design to solve several problems. The car-type radiator was enlarged to [...] capacity to cure overheating problems. The additional weight also helped hold the front down.

50|$|Smaller {{compressors}} {{are often}} splash lubricated - {{the oil is}} splashed around in the crankcase by {{the impact of the}} crankshaft and connecting rods - but larger compressors are likely to have pressurized lubrication using an oil pump which supplies the oil to critical areas through pipes and passages in the castings. Most oil lubricated compressors will have a wet sump {{at the bottom of the}} crankcase, and require the oil level to be within limits indicated by a sight glass or dipstick for proper lubrication. The compressor should also be level within the manufacturer's specification while operating. These constraints ensure that the lubricant is in the right place for either the moving parts to contact it for <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication,</b> or for reliable suction to the oil pump. Failure to comply with these specifications can lead to damage to the compressor due to excessive friction and overheating, and contamination of the breathing air by toxic breakdown products of the lubricants.|$|E
50|$|By 1925 the {{vertical}} {{arrangement of the}} engine had been taken advantage of to improve steam porting and access for maintenance. The Super-Sentinel engine used two camshafts: inlet and exhaust, placed near the crankshaft in the crankcase and operating the poppet valves through long pushrods. In the original waggon engine, all four valves were mounted {{at the far end of}} the cylinder from the crankshaft, requiring long narrow ports to the other end of the cylinder. With the locomotives the easily accessed vertical engine allowed a pair of these valves to be moved to the lower end of the cylinder, allowing for a short, efficient port with less 'dead space'. The crankcase of the engine, together with the crosshead trunk guide, was enclosed and provided with oil <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication.</b> A small plenum was left exposed between the cylinder's piston rod stuffing box and another gland seal into the crankcase. This allowed any steam that did leak past the seals to be vented to the atmosphere, rather than condensing within the crankcase.|$|E
5000|$|The 4-cylinder 903cc Amilcar CC {{appeared}} in 1922, with a wheelbase of just 2320 mm. [...] The CC subsequently became available in two further versions; the Amilcar C4 was a slightly longer sports car, while the CS, introduced in 1924, was a brisker sports version {{with the engine}} size increased to 1004 cc. The side-valve engine had <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication,</b> and came with a three-speed gearbox. The most famous model {{of all was the}} CGS [...] "Grand Sport" [...] of 1924; this featured a 1074 cc sv engine and four-wheel brakes. This in turn evolved into the more sporty CGSS [...] "Grand Sport Surbaissé". These models were built under license in Germany (as the Pluto) and in Austria (as the Grofri) and in Italy (as Amilcar Italiana). The marque entered automobile racing in the mid-1920s with a batch of supercharged dohc 1100 cc six-cylinder cars that used a roller bearing crankshaft in the full racing version; these vehicles were also available with plain metal bearings, driven by famous race driver André Morel.|$|E
5000|$|Reeves {{continued}} to work on developing a car and by 1904 had convinced his brothers to back another attempt. He made four Model D and six Model E cars by 1905. The D had a 12 hp engine and the E an 18-20 hp engine. In 1905 he produced an air cooled, valve in head motor with individually cast cylinders, <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication,</b> and intake and exhaust manifolds on opposite sides. That year Reeves obtained a contract for 500 of these engines from the Aerocar Company and by 1906 was making 15 engines a week. 1906 saw {{the introduction of a}} water cooled model and the Model J engined car the Reeves Go-Buggy. The Model P engine was used in the Sears Motor Buggy. The engines {{continued to}} evolve until 1910 when the family again abandoned the idea because of the collapse of the Aerocar Company. [...] Through this period Reeves had continued to make cars with the Model S and N being two of the types. The variable speed transmission continued to be made by the Reeves Pulley Company up until 1955 when it was acquired by the Reliance Electric Company, now part of the Baldor Electric Company.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Sport the Style 107 had {{an engine}} block, with engine and gearbox a common sump and {{lubrication}} system had. It was a head / side valve engine, but Carlo Guzzi deviated from the beaten track. Normally, such an engine {{was used in}} the overhead valve as inlet valve, and the side door as an outlet. But the outlet had the greatest need for cooling wind, so he fitted his lying to OHV engine this cover. She was operated by a push rod and a rocker arm [...] The inlet valve was driven by a simple tappet. The cast iron cylinder had cooling ribs in the length, in relation to the horizontal placement.

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ECI 2 D+PAFInternational audienceThe use of Inorganic Fullerene-like (IF) {{nanoparticles}} in lubricants {{has proved}} extremely effective to reduce friction and wear under severe boundary lubrication conditions, It has furthermore {{been suggested that}} the synthesis of smaller nanoparticles containing many structural defects would benefit friction and wear reduction, as they would penetrate and exfoliate more easily in the contact, leading to the quick formation of homogeneous tribofilms. In this study, four different types of IF-MoS 2 were synthesized {{so as to be}} able to differentiate the influence of both the size and the morphology of the nanoparticles on their tribological behavior. Pure-sliding, reciprocating tribological testing of these four types of nanoparticles revealed their excellent friction-reducing properties in severe boundary lubrication, with <b>splash</b> <b>lubrication</b> taking place for a high number of cycles. High wear reduction was also obtained and confirmed using optical profilometry. Although the nanoparticle structure was found to have an influence on their effectiveness in time, all the nanoparticles tested - regardless of size or crystallinity - were found to achieve the same performances as long as proper oil recirculation took place, ensuring a continuous feeding of the contact in nanoparticles. The formation of MoS 2 tribofilms on the wear surfaces was confirmed using XPS analyses and observed on FIB cross sections, and their nature was discussed {{in the light of the}} associated tribological results. As the size and morphology of the IF-MoS 2 did not affect their performance in the range studied, their friction reducing properties were compared to those of bulk h-MoS 2 tested in the same conditions. The benefits of using spherical nanoparticles such as IF-MoS 2 was clearly shown. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
