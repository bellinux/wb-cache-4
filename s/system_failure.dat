5|$|Damage Sustained by the System. Contrary to {{what was}} done in other places, {{electricity}} was not shut down in Grand Cayman before arrival of the hurricane. Total <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> came at around 01:40 hours on 12 September. Slight damage was sustained by the North Sound Road power plant, and more extensive damage occurred in transmission lines and several substations {{as well as in}} distribution grids. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} submarine cable in the North Sound was damaged 1,500 feet offshore.|$|E
5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side. The restoring force is applied in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E

Since the agency's relocation to Norman, the 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base would assume control of issuing the Storm Prediction Center's severe weather {{products in the}} event that the SPC is no longer able to issue them {{in the event of an}} outage (such as a computer <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> or building-wide power disruption) or emergency (such as an approaching strong tornadic circulation or tornado on the ground) affecting the Norman campus; on April 1, 2009, the SPC reassigned responsibilities for issuing the center's products in such situations to the 15th Operational Weather Squadron based out of Scott Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} mercury {{took some time}} – the latent period between {{ingestion}} and the first symptoms (typically paresthesia – numbness in the extremities) was between 16 and 38 days. Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in less serious cases. Worse cases included ataxia (typically loss of balance), blindness or reduced vision, and death resulting from central nervous <b>system</b> <b>failure.</b> Anywhere between 20 and 40mg of mercury has been suggested as sufficient for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8mg/kg of body weight). On average, individuals affected consumed 20kg or so of bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been sufficient for over 3 million cases.|$|E
5|$|As Q3 started, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Lewis Hamilton would be unable to take part, suffering from a hybrid <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> in the turbo charger, the same problem that had plagued him in China two weeks earlier. Nico Rosberg went on to secure pole position, even though his last timed lap was compromised by a tyre lockup into turn 13. Sebastian Vettel was closest to Rosberg, but a five-place grid penalty meant that he would start the race from seventh on the grid, moving Valtteri Bottas into the first row. Kimi Räikkönen was fourth fastest, ahead of Massa, Ricciardo, Pérez, Kvyat and Verstappen. After qualifying, Mercedes decided to switch Hamilton's car back to his spare power unit, which had been rebuilt following its failure at the Chinese Grand Prix, thereby avoiding a grid penalty, which they would have incurred if a new power unit would have been installed. Williams were satisfied with their pace in qualifying, praising the advances they made in slow-corner speed.|$|E

25|$|The primary flight {{controls}} are intrinsically safe. In {{the event of}} total hydraulic <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> or double engine failure, they will automatically and seamlessly revert to control via servo tab. In this mode, the servo tabs aerodynamically control the elevators and ailerons; these servo tabs are in turn controlled by cables running to the control yoke. The pilot's muscle forces alone control the tabs. For the 737 Next Generation, a six-screen LCD glass cockpit with modern avionics was implemented while retaining crew commonality with previous generation 737.|$|E
40|$|Fair {{exchange}} between {{two or more}} potentially mutually distrusted parties {{has been identified as}} an important issue in electronic commerce. However, the correctness (fairness) of the existing fair exchange protocols that use a Trusted Third Party (TTP) {{is based on the assumption}} that during an exchange there are no failures at any of the local systems involved in the exchange, which is too strong in many situations. This paper points out that (1) <b>system</b> <b>failures</b> could cause loss of fairness, and (2) existing fair exchange protocols that use TTPs cannot ensure fairness in presence of <b>system</b> <b>failures.</b> We present a systematic way to develop such data exchange systems that can recover from <b>system</b> <b>failures</b> without losing fairness. We identify a set of fairness loss risks caused by local <b>system</b> <b>failures.</b> We identify a fault tolerance correctness criteria for fair data exchange, denoted fairness-lossless recoverability. A fairness-lossless recoverable fair exchange system is immune from the set of fairness loss risks. Standard message logging approaches are then studied and extended to achieve fairness-lossless recoverability with good performance...|$|R
