40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that people associate each of the basic tastes (e. g., sweet, sour, bitter, and salty) with specific colors (e. g., red, green, black, and white). In the present study, we investigated whether pairs of colors (both associated with a particular taste or taste word) would give rise to stronger associations relative to pairs of colors that were associated with different tastes. We replicate the findings of previous studies highlighting {{the existence of a}} robust crossmodal correspondence between individual colors and basic tastes. However, while there was evidence that pairs of colors could indeed communicate taste information more consistently than <b>single</b> <b>colors,</b> our participants took more than twice as long to match the color pairs with tastes than the <b>single</b> <b>colors.</b> Possible reasons for these results are discussed...|$|R
25|$|In some {{configurations}} {{information about}} several specimen properties is gathered per pixel, usually {{by the use}} of multiple detectors. In SEM, the attributes of topography and material contrast can be obtained by a pair of backscattered electron detectors and such attributes can be superimposed in a <b>single</b> <b>color</b> image by assigning a different primary color to each attribute. Similarly, a combination of backscattered and secondary electron signals can be assigned to different colors and superimposed on a <b>single</b> <b>color</b> micrograph displaying simultaneously the properties of the specimen.|$|E

25|$|Currently {{available}} scanners typically use {{charge-coupled device}} (CCD) or {{contact image sensor}} (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor. Early color film scanners used a halogen lamp and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures were needed to scan a <b>single</b> <b>color</b> image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.|$|E
25|$|The printed format {{has gone}} through several changes. The first publications, in 1967–72, were in folded tabloid {{newspaper}} format, with no staples, black ink text, and a <b>single</b> <b>color</b> highlight that changed each edition. From 1973 onwards, editions were produced on a four-color press with a different newsprint paper size. In 1979, the bar code appeared. In 1980, it became a gloss-paper, large format (10"×12") magazine. As of edition of October 30, 2008, Rolling Stone has had a smaller, standard-format magazine size.|$|E

A similar construction also applies if a <b>single</b> <b>color</b> is used for all bodies of water, as is usual on real maps. For maps in which more than one country may have multiple disconnected regions, six or more colors might be required.|$|E

40|$|The {{controlled}} and coherent manipulation of individual quantum systems {{is a fundamental}} key {{for the development of}} quantum information processing. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond is a promising system since its photoluminescence is perfectly stable at room temperature and its electron spin can be optically read-out at the individual level. We review here the experiments currently realized in our laboratory, concerning the use of <b>single</b> NV <b>color</b> center as <b>single</b> photon source and the coherent magnetic manipulation of the electron spin associated to a <b>single</b> NV <b>color</b> center. Furthermore, we demonstrate a nanoscopy experiment based on saturation absorption effect, which allows to optically pin-point <b>single</b> NV <b>color</b> center at a sub-? resolution. This opens a possibility to independently address two or multiple magnetically-coupled <b>single</b> NV <b>color</b> centers, which is a necessary step toward the realization of a diamond-based quantum computer.

25|$|On March 27, 1991, IBM {{divested}} {{a number}} of its hardware manufacturing operations, including keyboard manufacturing, to the investment firm Clayton & Dubilier, Inc. in a leveraged buyout to form Lexmark International Group, Inc. Lexmark continued manufacturing the Model M in the United States, United Kingdom and Mexico, with IBM being Lexmark's major customer. Many of these keyboards had IBM assembly part numbers such as 52G9658, 52G9700, 82G2383 and 42H1292. Due to pricing pressures, many Model M's in this period were manufactured with a new lower-cost design including lighter plastic, an integrated cable, and a <b>single</b> <b>color</b> for key legends.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} fairly deeply colored, {{usually in a}} <b>single</b> <b>color,</b> and have a hard porcelain-like gloss. Colors vary with species, ranging through green, purple, violet, turquoise, steel grey, {{chocolate}} and lemon-yellow. White is rare, but does occur. Though the eggs are bright and colorful when laid, over time they fade and become duller. For example, the egg of the red-winged tinamou dulls from purple to leaden. Most tinamou eggs are solid colored, without spots or specling; however, the eggs of Tinamotis species may exhibit small white speckles. The benefit of laying brightly colored eggs is unknown, but is not detrimental as most tinamou predators hunt at night.|$|E
25|$|HDR images often don't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than {{traditional}} images—to represent many more colors over {{a much wider}} dynamic range. For that purpose, they don't use integer values to represent the <b>single</b> <b>color</b> channels (e.g., 0-255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common are 16-bit (half precision) or 32-bit floating point numbers to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate transfer function is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with a color depth that has as few as 10–12bits for luminance and 8bits for chrominance without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.|$|E

25|$|The {{content of}} photos tends to {{outweigh}} their quality {{when it comes}} to news value. On February 18, 2004, The New York Times published on their front page a photo of AT CEO John Zeglis which was taken with a camera phone. Content remains the most important element of photojournalism, but the ability to extend deadlines with rapid gathering and editing of images has brought significant changes. As recently as 15 years ago, nearly 30 minutes were needed to scan and transmit a <b>single</b> <b>color</b> photograph from a remote location to a news office for printing. Now, equipped with a digital camera, a mobile phone and a laptop computer, a photojournalist can send a high-quality image in minutes, even seconds after an event occurs. Camera phones and portable satellite links increasingly allow for the mobile transmission of images from almost any point on the earth.|$|E
25|$|During its {{campaign}} for FCC approval, CBS gave the first demonstrations of color television {{to the general}} public, showing an hour of color programs daily Mondays through Saturdays, beginning January 12, 1950, and running {{for the remainder of}} the month, over WOIC in Washington, D.C., where the programs could be viewed on eight 16-inch color receivers in a public building. Due to high public demand, the broadcasts were resumed February 13–21, with several evening programs added. CBS initiated a limited schedule of color broadcasts from its New York station WCBS-TV Mondays to Saturdays beginning November 14, 1950, making ten color receivers available for the viewing public. All were broadcast using the <b>single</b> <b>color</b> camera that CBS owned. The New York broadcasts were extended by coaxial cable to Philadelphia's WCAU-TV beginning December 13, and to Chicago on January 10, making them the first network color broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|They {{designed}} experiments {{involving the}} codification of colors. In their first experiment, they investigated {{whether it was}} easier for speakers of English to remember color shades for which they had a specific name than to remember colors that were not as easily definable by words. This allowed them to compare the linguistic categorization directly to a non-linguistic task. In a later experiment, speakers of two languages that categorize colors differently (English and Zuni) were asked to recognize colors. In this way, it could be determined whether the differing color categories of the two speakers would determine their ability to recognize nuances within color categories. Brown and Lenneberg found that Zuñi speakers who classify green and blue together as a <b>single</b> <b>color</b> did have trouble recognizing and remembering nuances within the green/blue category. Brown and Lenneberg's study began a tradition of investigation of linguistic relativity through color terminology.|$|E
