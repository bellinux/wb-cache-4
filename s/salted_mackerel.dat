50|$|Gyeongsang cuisine {{is based}} on Gyeongsang province, {{consisting}} of the North Gyeongsang and South Gyeongsang provinces. The region has a similar climate to that of Jeolla province because both geographically border two seas—Gyeongsang province borders the Sea of Japan (East Sea) to the east, and the East China Sea to the south. However, the types of harvested fish and seafood are different from each other, and fish are regarded as the best foodstuff in Gyeongsang cuisine. Seafood is variously cooked in the cuisine, and especially hoe, raw sliced seafood, is considered the best delicacy. Soups made with fresh fish are common in Gyeongsang province, unlike other mountainous and landlocked regions. Myeolchi jeot (fermented salted anchovies) is the most commonly prepared jeotgal (fermented salted seafood); the number of jeotgal types placed {{on the table for}} a meal is the next after Jeolla province. The style of Gyeongsang cuisine is simple with less decoration, while various seasonings are heavily used, so the taste is even more salty and hot and spicy than Jeolla's. Fields in the province produce diverse grain crops and noodles are the most enjoyed dish among the foods made with grains. The locals prefer noodles with a soft texture made by mixing raw soybean powder, cut by a kitchen knife.Andong, a city that was once the center of Korea's Confucianist traditions, has a wide variety of local delicacies.

5000|$|Dumplings come {{in three}} forms in Jamaica, fried, boiled, and roasted. All {{are made with}} flour, white or wheat, and the white-floured {{dumpling}}s are often mixed {{with a bit of}} cornmeal. These foods are often served with a variety of dishes like ackee and saltfish, kidneys, liver <b>salt</b> <b>mackerel,</b> etc. and often taste better when refried. A refried dumpling is an already boiled dumpling left over from previous cooking that is fried, which gives it a slightly crispy outer layer and a tender middle. A purely fried white flour dumpling (also known as a [...] "Johnny Cake") is golden brown and looks a lot like buñuelos, often substituting the boiled dumpling, but it is mostly consumed as part of breakfast. Fried dumplings can be made with or without sugar. When mixed with sugar, cornmeal and baking powder and fried, this variation is called festival.

40|$|Autolytic {{activity}} in the muscle of Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) cured in saturated brine and dry salt, was monitored at pH 3, 4, 9 and 10 along with weight loss, moisture, salt and a-amino nitrogen, at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h of curing. The fish lost 14 to 29 % of the initial weight after 48 h of curing, in brine and dry salt, respectively. Correspondingly the moisture decreased from 76 to 57 % in brine cured and 52 % in dry salted fish. Salt content in the muscle increased from 1 % to 14. 82 and 13. 32 % {{in the case of}} brine cured and dry <b>salted</b> <b>mackerel</b> respectively, with slower uptake of salt in the latter because of the lesser surface area in contact. Tissue proteinases were activated initially in all cases when salting commenced, with higher activation in the case of pH 3 and 4. But subsequently increasing salt concentrations. suppressed the autolytic activity. Autolytic proteinases in the mackerel muscle were suppressed between 37 to 78 % of their original {{activity in}} case of the brine cured fish and between 36 to 74 % in the dry salted fish, at the pH assayed. Concentration of a-amino nitrogen in the muscle increased initially in both types of curing at 3 h, but decreased later on.

40|$|The word {{mackerel}} is {{a common}} one in every day conversation. Everywhere we can hear such expressions as, "holy mackerel," "dead as a mackerel," and "cold as a mackerel. " Undoubtedly the fish called mackerel, from which these terms have arisen, must be universally popular and well known. It is hoped that the following pages will give {{some idea of the}} popularity and economic importance of this fish. The irregular habits and the unheralded periods of scarcity or abundance of the common Atlantic mackerel are subjects of great concern to the fishermen of Europe and America. The occasional failure of the mackerel to appear spells hardship and privation for many fishermen and dealers, and when its does appear in the vast shoals that are eagerly awaited each spring, adverse economic conditions sometimes prevent the fishermen from making a living. In California the mackerel is always present, summer and winter, year in and year out, but because of economic factors the fishery is subject to sudden ups and downs. As might be expected, the habits of the Atlantic mackerel have long been the subject of speculation and study, both by fishermen and scientists. Many stories are current about how the mackerel spends the winter, the time when it is absent from the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North America. One of the most common stories is that the fish bury themselves in the mud {{at the bottom of the}} sea and that during this hibernation a film comes over their eyes so they are rendered blind. Some people claim that the mackerel go into the Arctic Ocean to spend the winter; others say that they go south into the tropics. The only certain fact is that nobody really knows where the majority of the mackerel spend the winter and that one guess is as good as another. Mackerel occasionally appear in shoals so dense and extensive that the ocean is colored with them for miles. At these times it is said to be dangerous to enter the water. A story is told of a Norwegian fisherman who fell overboard into a school of mackerel and was torn to pieces by the savage fish before his comrades could pull him out. This story is probably somewhat exaggerated, but the thought of that luckless fellow would suffice to keep most people from diving into a swarm of hungry mackerel. The idea has arisen in some places, notably Australia, that the flesh of the mackerel and mackerel-like fishes is poisonous. As a matter of fact, no food is more wholesome than fresh or properly preserved mackerel, tuna or bonito. However, all these fish spoil readily if not cared for, and stale fish can cause illness, and the illness can cause stories about poison. The scombroid or mackerel-like fishes are of very great commercial importance throughout the world. The four most important groups of fishes are those comprising the herring, salmon, codfish and mackerel families. Of the mackerel family, the two mackerels (Scomber and Pneumatophorus) are among the most widespread and universally important, although the tunas, bonitos, seerfishes, and Spanish mackerels help to keep the family Scombridae in a leading position. The fishermen of nearly every maritime nation in the temperate zones catch mackerel in large numbers. The annual catch (1928 – 1929) off the North Sea and Atlantic coasts of Europe amounts to 100, 000, 000 pounds. The fishermen of the Atlantic coast of North America catch 40, 000, 000 to 60, 000, 000 pounds of mackerel every year (1924 – 1930). The California fishery accounts for 15, 000, 000 to 60, 000, 000 pounds annually (1928 – 1931). Japan, with an annual (1923 – 1925) catch of about 150, 000, 000 pounds, is the largest consumer of mackerel in the world. In addition to the foregoing, there are important mackerel fisheries in the Mediterranean and Black seas, and lesser fisheries in Australia, New Zealand and South America. The mackerel is everywhere primarily a fresh fish, that is to say, the greatest part of the world catch is consumed in a fresh state. Nevertheless, really enormous quantities are canned, salted or dried in many parts of the world. The canning industry is a recent development, dating back no farther than the nineteenth century. Salting and drying, however, are ancient methods of preserving fish so they can be sent to distant markets or held over from periods of abundance to times of scarcity. Before modern refrigeration methods made possible the transportation or holding of fresh mackerel in quantities, <b>salted</b> <b>mackerel</b> was by far the most important product of the world's mackerel fishery...|$|E
50|$|The company traces {{its roots}} to a fishery called John Pew & Sons. William Pew, son of John Pew, picked up fishing {{after serving as}} a Colonial soldier in the French and Indian War. While most people moved West after the war, Pew turned eastward and arrived in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1755. The father-and-son fishery {{business}} emerged as an official commercial company, John Pew & Sons, in 1849. When nearby Rockport’s chief industry, the Annisquam Cotton Mill, burned down, Slade Gorton, the mill’s superintendent, was out of a job. At his wife’s urging, he began a fishing business in 1874 known as Slade Gorton & Company, and began to pack and sell <b>salt</b> codfish and <b>mackerel</b> in small kegs. This company {{was the first to}} package salt-dried fish in barrels. In 1899, the company patented the “Original Gorton Fish Cake.” In 1905, the Slade Gorton Company adopted the fisherman at the helm of a schooner (the “Man at the Wheel”) as the company trademark. Today, he is known as the Gorton’s Fisherman.|$|R

40|$|Fish {{products}} {{contribute significantly}} to protein nutriture, food security, livelihoods and the economy in West Africa. Food safety of processed fish products however remains an important concern. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the safety of traditionally processed fish from Ghana. Microbiological analysis of selected traditionally processed fish products was conducted. Challenge tests were employed to determine the effects of storage temperature on survival of Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. The effects of salting, temperature, pH and inoculum size on the survival and enterotoxin production of S. aureus was also determined. Food safety surveys were conducted. Self-reported and observed food safety practices and the role of food safety inspectors were assessed. The pH levels observed in all samples were not at optimum levels to inhibit microbial growth. Water activity (aw) levels were: fried bonga (0. 82 – 0. 95), koobi (0. 53 – 0. 75), kako (0. 55 – 0. 70, smoked catfish (0. 72 – 0. 95), smoked herrings (0. 54 – 0. 94) and smoked mackerel (0. 84 – 0. 99). Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens were not detected in 25 g and 1 g, respectively, of any of the samples. Varying levels of Bacillus cereus, S. aureus and yeast and mould were detected in fried bonga and smoked fish samples. Aerobic bacteria and coliforms were present in 50 % and 44. 4 %, of fried bonga. Only yeast and moulds were detected in kako and koobi at levels of < 2 log to 4 log cfu/g in koobi and from < 2 log to 5 log cfu/g in kako. High levels of between 5 log 10 CFU/g and 6 log 10 CFU/g aerobic bacteria were recorded in smoked mackerel. On the basis of aw levels and microbial quality, smoked mackerel and fried bonga were classified as high risk fish products requiring time-temperature control, and salted koobi, kako, smoked herrings and catfish as low risk products. Challenge tests with S. aureus in <b>salted</b> smoked <b>mackerel</b> and catfish showed no growth and no enterotoxin A and B at 4 °C. S. aureus numbers increased in smoked catfish and mackerel samples stored at 30 oC but decreased with increasing NaCl concentration (p< 0. 001; r 2 = 0. 0507). At 30 oC, SEA and SEB were detected in samples formulated with 5 % (w/w) NaCl with high inoculum. Samples formulated with higher than 5 % (w/w) NaCl suppressed growth and enterotoxin production. Food safety knowledge among respondents was good and consumers were concerned with some aspects of food safety in Ghana although not fish in particular. Very few food handlers had received adequate food safety training, the majority of whom overestimated their food safety compliance, evidenced by observed poor hygiene practices. Only 43. 8 % of inspectors had higher professional qualifications and 29. 2 % were trained in HACCP. Inspectors identified lack of information (41. 7 %), support (41. 7 %) and operational costs (39. 6 %) among the barriers to food safety compliance. These findings suggest a need for education at all levels including food safety enforcement professionals. A framework model which integrates all aspects of the findings in developing a national regulatory and policy framework for fish food safety has been proposed. Some of the skills that are missing are identified and suggestions put forward that will benefit traditional fish processing...|$|R
