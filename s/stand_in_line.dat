5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E

25|$|The museum's {{popularity}} {{has led to}} some problems. Visitors <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> in the museum foyer to take an elevator down to the underground level where the exhibits start with the Middle Passage and slavery. The hallway there {{is designed to be}} cramped and somewhat claustrophobic. The large number of visitors who stop to read the exhibit's signs has caused dangerous overcrowding. Museum officials have had {{to limit the number of}} people who can take the elevator (and thus enter the exhibit) to mitigate this problem. This has led to still longer lines in the foyer.|$|E

25|$|Each {{party has}} two goals, {{ten or fifteen}} yards apart. The parties, ten or fifteen on a side, <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line,</b> facing each other at about ten yardsâ€™ {{distance}} midway between their goals and that of their adversaries. An indifferent spectator throws up a ball {{the size of a}} cricket ball midway between the confronted players and makes his escape. The rush is to catch the falling ball. He who first can catch or seize it speeds home, making his way through his opponents and aided by his own sidesmen. If caught and held or rather in danger of being held, for if caught with the ball in possession he loses a snotch, he throws the ball (he must in no case give it) to some less beleaguered friend more free and more in breath than himself, who if it be not arrested in its course or be jostled away by the eager and watchful adversaries, catches it; and he in like manner hastens homeward, in like manner pursued, annoyed and aided, winning the notch or snotch if he contrive to carry or throw it within the goals. At a loss and gain of a snotch a recommencement takes place.|$|E
500|$|The {{gestation}} of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, {{was only}} slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with [...] "A Career" [...] as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: [...] "'At the Store' {{is a tribute to}} the women who have to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.|$|E
500|$|Saville {{evaluated}} the ambitious Radar Fence Plan of Major General Francis L. Ankenbrandt, which had recently failed in Congress {{because it was}} too expensive in manpower and material, and would take too long to put in place. Fairchild and Saville determined to devise a more practical radar defense plan, one that would bypass the slow approval methods previously established. In pushing his plan to fruition, Saville angered other officers who expected to have a say in air defense; he said, [...] "I wasn't going to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> and wait." [...] He first focused on a foundation of radar systems, and concluded that the U.S. should spend $116million in 1949 and 1950, to build 75 radar sites and 20 control centers in the continental U.S., with 10 more radar sites facing the Soviet Union from the Territory of Alaska, controlled through a territorial center. The radar sites would primarily be composed of older World War II-era microwave units, but these would be augmented by a few advanced radar units, carefully positioned. Dubbed the [...] "Lashup" [...] plan (from [...] "lash-up", meaning [...] "hastily improvised"), it was about 20% of the cost of Ankenbrandt's Radar Fence Plan, and it was more flexible in terms of future expansion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} {{stations have}} prepaid fare areas (also called fare control), to allow quick boarding and exiting through {{front and rear}} doors. [...] At all other stations, passengers must <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> and use {{the front door to}} pay fares, slowing travel times especially during peak periods. [...] At non fare control stops, an MBTA policy of forcing exiting passengers to also use the front doors (to prevent other riders from entering without paying) causes further congestion and delays.|$|E
2500|$|A {{larger and}} more crowded altarpiece is the San Barnaba Altarpiece of about 1487, now in the Uffizi, where {{elements}} of Botticelli's emotional late style begin to appear. [...] Here the setting is a palatial heavenly interior in the latest style, showing Botticelli taking a new degree of interest in architecture, possibly influenced by Sangallo. The Virgin and Child are raised high on a throne, {{at the same level}} as four angels carrying the Instruments of the Passion. [...] Six saints <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> below the throne. [...] Several figures have rather large heads, and the infant Jesus is again very large. [...] While the faces of the Virgin, child and angels have the linear beauty of his tondos, the saints are given varied and intense expressions. [...] Four small and rather simple predella panels survive; there were probably originally seven.|$|E

2500|$|On June 1, 2011, Palin stated her {{opposition}} to the DREAM Act, {{a bill that would}} provide conditional permanent residency to certain illegal and deportable alien students who graduate from U.S. high schools, who are of good moral character, arrived in the U.S. legally or illegally as minors and have been in the country continuously {{for at least five years}} prior to the bill's enactment: [...] "The immigrants in the past, they had to literally and figuratively <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> and follow rules to become U.S. citizens. I'd like to see that continue, but unfortunately, the Dream Act kind of usurps that, the system, that is a legal system, to make sure that immigrants who want to be here legally, working hard, producing and supplying revenue and resources for their family, that they're able to do that right and legally. Unfortunately, the DREAM act doesn't accomplish that." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the state}} convention, Handley {{ran for the}} {{nomination}} {{to run for governor}} with the backing of Senator Jenner. Although Craig tried to block his nomination, Handley was able to overcome his opposition and win the nomination. In the general election his opponent was Democrat Ralph Tucker. The central election issues was the bribery scandal, the impending state budget deficit, and reform of the state health institutions. Handley also repudiated past governors who had taken federal grant money for selling out control of the state to the federal government. He said [...] "Hoosiers refuse to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> in front of the treasury in Washington with tin cups in their hands," [...] and that depending on the federal government for revenue would lead to the ruin of the state. President Eisenhower was running for re-election in the same year, and again thanks in part to his popularity, Handley won a second landslide victory, defeating Tucker by 227,475 votes.|$|E
2500|$|The United States, {{observed}} in 1940 that [...] "many thousands of black cotton farmers each year {{now go to}} the polls, <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with their white neighbors, and mark their ballots independently without protest or intimidation, {{in order to determine}} government policy toward cotton production control." [...] However, discrimination towards blacks continued {{as it did in the}} rest of society, and isolated incidents often broke out. On September 25, 1961, Herbert Lee, a black cotton farmer and voter-registration organizer, was shot in the head by a white state legislator in Liberty, Missouri. Yet the cotton industry continued to be very important for blacks in the southern United States, much more so than for whites. By the late 1920s around two-thirds of all African-American tenants and almost three-fourths of the croppers worked on cotton farms. Three out of four black farm operators earned at least 40% of their income from cotton farming during this period. Studies conducted during the same period indicated that two in three black women from black landowning families were involved in cotton farming.|$|E
