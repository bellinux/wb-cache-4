5|$|Ashland, {{originally}} called Ashland Mills, {{was named}} after Ashland County, Ohio, the original home of founder Abel Helman, and secondarily for Ashland, Kentucky, where other founders had family connections. Ashland has a mayor-council government assisted by citizen committees. Historically, its liberal politics have differed, often <b>sharply,</b> <b>with</b> {{much of the rest}} of southwest Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Just one sound can be {{complete}} in itself, for its complexity {{lies in the}} formulation of ma, an unquantifiable metaphysical space (duration) of dynamically tensed absence of sound. For example, in the performance of nō, the ma of sound and silence does not have an organic relation for the purpose of artistic expression. Rather, these two elements contrast <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> one another in an immaterial balance.|$|E

5|$|With a {{head and}} body length of , Eliurus petteri is a {{moderately}} large species of Eliurus. Its upperparts are gray-brown to gray and contrast <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> the white underparts. The tail tuft, a characteristic feature of Eliurus, is weakly developed. The skull is delicate and the incisive foramina (openings {{in the front}} part of the palate) are short and narrow. The incisors are weak.|$|E
5|$|It {{was again}} rebuilt by them in 1930, {{and then by}} Hill, Norman and Beard in 1948, which brought the number of stops to 58. In 1972 this was {{increased}} {{to a total of}} 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence– the 1895 pipework contrasting <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> that of 1972– and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.|$|E
5|$|Reign in Blood was {{recorded}} and produced in Los Angeles with Rubin. The album was the label boss' first professional experience with heavy metal, and his fresh perspective {{led to a}} drastic makeover of Slayer's sound. Steve Huey of AllMusic believed Rubin drew tighter and faster songs from the band, and delivered a cleanly produced sound that contrasted <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> their previous recordings. This resulted in drastic changes to Slayer's sound, and changed audiences' perception of the band. Araya has since stated their two previous releases were not up to par production-wise.|$|E

5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It {{is more difficult to}} separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> pale areas and bill colour.|$|E
5|$|The first amniotes (clade of {{vertebrates}} {{that today}} includes reptiles, mammals, and birds) are {{known from the}} early part of the Late Carboniferous. By the Triassic, this group had already radiated into the earliest mammals, turtles, and crocodiles (lizards and birds appeared in the Jurassic, and snakes in the Cretaceous). This contrasts <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> the (possibly fourth) Carboniferous group, the baphetids, which have left no extant surviving lineages.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents {{the events of the}} biblical Third Day. Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole. They show an unpopulated earth composed solely of rock and plants, contrasting <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> the inner central panel which contains a paradise teeming with lustful humanity.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Big Bang, {{primordial}} protons and neutrons formed from the quark–gluon plasma {{of the early}} Universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in {{a process known as}} Big Bang nucleosynthesis, nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium, but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> increasing atomic number. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, carbon, was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The Caribbean Carnival is an {{important}} part of Dominican culture. Originally featuring masquerade songs (chanté mas) and other local traditions, traditional Carnival, Mas Domnik, came to be dominated by imported calypso music and steel bands in the early 1960s; calypso appealed to Carnival-goers because the lyrical focus on local news and gossip was similar to that of chanté mas, despite a rhythmic pattern and instrumentation which contrast <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> traditional Dominican Mas Domnik music. After a fire in 1963, the traditional Carnival was banned, though calypso and steelpan continued to grow in popularity. Modern Carnival on Dominica takes place on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, and is a festive occasion during which laws against libel and slander are suspended. The modern Dominican Carnival is heavily based on the Trinidadian celebration, but is not as commercialized due to a lack of corporate sponsorship.|$|E
5|$|The {{new school}} of hip hop was a {{movement}} in hip hop music starting 1983–84 with the early records of Run–D.M.C. and LL Cool J. Like the hip hop preceding it, it came predominantly from New York City. The new school was initially characterized in form by drum machine led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock. It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> the funk and disco influenced outfits, novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of artists prevalent in 1984, and rendered them old school. New school artists made shorter songs that could more easily gain radio play, and more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts. By 1986 their releases began to establish the hip hop album as a fixture of the mainstream.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{possible}} explanations {{for the evolution of}} this sexual difference in bill shape. The most widely supported is that it allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources. This divergence may have arisen {{because of a lack of}} competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems. The other idea is that the ivory-coloured bill, which contrasted <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> the bird's black plumage, may have been used to attract a mate. In animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract a mate, the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body, as with the huia. It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation, this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein-rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Although Arsenal were rumoured to be signing Robinson at the {{beginning}} of the 2010–11 season, no move materialized. Robinson was in goal during Blackburn's 7–1 defeat away to Manchester United on 27 November, with five of the goals being scored by Dimitar Berbatov. Despite this result, Blackburn reached as high as seventh position in the league in January, following a 2–0 victory over West Bromwich Albion. This resulted in Robinson being yet again linked with a move away from Blackburn, with Aston Villa, Liverpool and former club Tottenham all rumoured to be interested in signing him. Following the win over West Brom, however, Blackburn's form dipped <b>sharply,</b> <b>with</b> the club eventually finishing in 15th, having won just 2 out of its last 14 matches. Robinson kept 8 clean sheets in the 36 league matches he played in, while he also conceded the 500th league goal of his career towards the end of the season, becoming the fifth goalkeeper in Premier League history to do so. He also was voted the 2011 Player of the Year by the Blackburn Rovers' supporters club.|$|E
