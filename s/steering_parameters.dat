Artificial Neural Network and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition approaches are combined to approximate and predict tunnelling induced time variant surface settlement fields computed by a process-oriented finite element simulation model.

Physiological signals such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiography (ECG) and nonphysiological signals such as <b>steering</b> wheel related <b>parameters</b> {{have been investigated}} for drowsiness detection in previous researches. EEG has been deemed as a reliable way to detect drowsiness; while the accuracy of using ECG or <b>steering</b> wheel related <b>parameters</b> for drowsiness detection is {{not as high as}} that of EEG’s but they have the advantages of low cost and non-intrusive. This work is devoted to find out the possibility to enhance the accuracy of drowsiness detection based on the ECG and <b>steering</b> wheel related <b>parameters.</b> The correlation between EEG and ECG parameters and the correlation between EEG and <b>steering</b> wheel <b>parameters</b> for drowsiness detection are analyzed. If strong correlation between them are found it is possible to use the ECG and <b>steering</b> wheel related <b>parameters</b> to represent the EEG parameters which means the accuracy of drowsiness detection based on ECG and <b>steering</b> wheel <b>parameters</b> can be improved. Several parameters were chosen for the correlation analysis, the EEG parameters are the alpha, beta and theta band power, the ECG parameters are heart rate, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters and a parameter derived from Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), and the <b>steering</b> wheel related <b>parameters</b> are four variables derived from steering wheel movement, all of these parameters are most commonly used parameters for driver drowsiness detection in the literature.

40|$|TNO Human Factors and TNO Automotive are {{investigating}} relationships between subjective and objective {{measures in the}} area of vehicle handling. This paper presents a driving simulator study and a field experiment in which these relationships were investigated. First, in the driving simulator experiment, the characteristics of the steering system of the simulated vehicle were manipulated. With various steering settings, subjects drove on a 2 km normal straight lane, as well as through short and narrow tracks marked with cones. Questionnaires were used to obtain subjective ratings and workload measures. Results of the driving simulator experiment led to the test method that was used for the field experiment. In the second phase, actual vehicle tests were performed. The scope of these field experiments was to test the hypothesis that the subjective assessment correlates with driver workload. Using a single vehicle in this type of research is essential: Only then will the assessment not be biased by factors that are not under test such as (amongst others) seating comfort and driveline behaviour. The vehicle has been equipped with a steer-by-wire system to enable on-line modification of <b>steering</b> <b>parameters.</b> This allows testing a large number of steering settings or even control principles in a short stretch of time.

The calculation is carried out under the bad cavity limit, the adiabatic approximation of a slowly varying amplitude of the cavity mode, and with the assumption of driving the cavity mode with a blue detuned strong laser pulse. Under such conditions, explicit expressions of the bipartite and tripartite <b>steering</b> <b>parameters</b> are obtained, {{and the concept of}} collective tripartite quantum steering, recently introduced by He and Reid [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 250403 (2013) ], is clearly explored. It is found that both bipartite and tripartite <b>steering</b> <b>parameters</b> are sensitive functions of the initial state of the modes and distinctly different steering behaviour could be observed depending on whether the modes were initially in a thermal state or not. We find that the initial thermal noise is more effective in destroying the bipartite rather than the tripartite steering which, on the other hand, can persist even for a large thermal noise. For the initial vacuum state of a steered mode, the tripartite steering exists over the entire interaction time even if the steering modes are in very noisy thermal states. When the steered mode is initially in a thermal state, it can be collectively steered by the other modes. There are thresholds for the average number of the thermal photons above which the existing tripartite steering appears as the collective steering. Finally, we point out that the collective steering may provide a resource in a hybrid quantum network for quantum secret sharing protocol. Comment: 13 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

Here, the pharmacological properties of riparins were investigated in in vitro and in vivo assays {{of pain and}} inflammation in Swiss mice. Inflammatory mediators were measured by radioimmunoassay and Real-Time PCR. Riparins I, II, III and IV (1. 56 – 100 mg/kg; ip) produced dose-related antinociceptive effects in the formalin test, exhibiting ED 50 values of 22. 93, 114. 2, 31. 05 and 6. 63 mg/kg, respectively. Taking the greater potency as <b>steering</b> <b>parameter,</b> riparin IV was further investigated. Riparin IV did not produce antinociceptive effect on the tail flick, suggesting that its antinociception is not a centrally-mediated action. In fact, riparin IV (1. 56 – 25 mg/kg) produced dose-related antinociceptive and antiedematogenic effects on the complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) -induced paw inflammation in mice. During CFA-induced inflammation, riparin IV did not modulate either the production of cytokines, TNF-α and IL- 10, or COX- 2 mRNA expression. On the other hand, riparin IV decreased the PGE 2 levels in the inflamed paw. In in vitro assays, riparin IV did not exhibit suppressive activities in activated macrophages.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop and test a robust {{guidance}} strategy for use on the flyback mission of a winged launch booster. The guidance system employs a numerical Newton-Raphson restoration technique to update <b>steering</b> <b>parameters,</b> coupled with heuristic logic, to improve robustness. The guidance system uses a prediction of the final state of the launch vehicle to close the feedback loop and is therefore called “Predictive guidance”. Virtual environment and virtual vehicle models are used to simulate the booster and the environment in which it operates. The virtual booster passes the current velocity and position to the predictive guidance system at given guidance intervals. The predictive guidance system then integrates along the trajectory, using the current parameterized steering model, to determine the expected final position of the virtual booster. It compares the achieved final state to the required target state and calculates the target error. A parameterized non-linear restoration technique then determines new values for the <b>steering</b> <b>parameters,</b> to guide the virtual booster from the current state to the desired state. The final phase of the flyback mission is guided by a series of controllers, which achieve and maintain the required cruise flight conditions. Once the guidance system is operational for the nominal case, various errors are introduced in the virtual environment to test robustness. A Monte Carlo type analysis is performed to test the guidance system operation in 1000 different flight regimes, with randomly varied environmental and state parameters. The randomly varied parameters include: wind speed and direction, staging flight path angle, velocity and altitude and modelled state estimation errors. Different gravitation and atmosphere models are also used in the virtual environment and guidance computer to introduce further differences between the guidance estimate of the flight environment and the virtual flight environment. The guidance system is found to be fast enough for real-time implementation and able to achieve cruise conditions in all cases. The Monte Carlo analysis also allows for a statistical analysis to determine the mean and standard deviations for the target conditions. Matthew R. Tetlow, Michael E. Evans, Gerald M.

For an optimal function of the DOE, e. g. as a multiple-beam splitter, the DOE design must account for these artifacts. We present an iterative design method in which the optimal setting of each SLM pixel is carefully chosen by considering the SLM artifacts and the design targets. For instance, the deadspace-interpixel effects are modeled by dividing the pixel to be optimized, and its nearest neighbors, into a number of subareas, each with its unique response and far-field contribution. Besides the customary intensity control, the design targets can also include phase control of the optical field in {{one or more of the}} beams in the beam splitter. We show how this can be used to cancel a strong unwanted zeroth-order beam, which results from using a slightly incorrect modulation characteristic for the SLM, by purposely sending a beam in the same direction but with the opposite phase.

Earlier attempts to identify task-specific pathways between two photoreceptor systems (R 1 - 6, R 7 + 8) and three <b>steering</b> <b>parameters</b> (wingstroke asymmetry, abdomen deflection, hindleg deflection) attributed course control and object fixation to R 1 - 6 mediated simultaneous reactions of these parameters. The present investigation includes first results from fixed flying or freely walking ninaE 17 mutants which cannot synthesize the R 1 - 6 photoreceptor-specific opsin. Retention of about 12 {{percent of the}} normal course control and about 58 percent of the object fixation in these flies suggests partial input sharing for both responses and, possibly, a specialization for large-field (R 1 - 6) and small-field (R 7 + 8) motion. Such signals must be combined to perceive relative motion between an object and its background. The combining links found in larger species might explain a previously neglected interdependence of course control and object fixation in Drosophila. Output decomposition revealed an unexpected orchestration of steering. Wingstroke asymmetry and abdomen deflection do not contribute in fixed proportions to the yaw torque of the flight system.

With road traffic noise being the dominant noise source in most countries, particular interest lies in the synthesis of realistic pass-by sounds. This article describes an auralizator for pass-bys of accelerating passenger cars. The key element is a synthesizer that simulates the acoustical emission of different vehicles, driving on different surfaces, under different operating conditions. Audio signals for the emitted tire noise, as well as the propulsion noise are generated using spectral modeling synthesis, which gives complete control of the signal characteristics. The sound of propulsion is synthesized as a function of instantaneous engine speed, engine load and emission angle, whereas the sound of tires is created in dependence of vehicle speed and emission angle.

40|$|The next {{generation}} of reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) require significant improvements in guidance methods {{in order to reduce}} cost, increase safety and flexibility, whilst allowing for possible autonomous operation. Research has focused on the ascent and hypersonic re-entry flight phases. This thesis presents a new method for trajectory design, optimisation and guidance of RLVs during the terminal area flight phases. The terminal area flight phase is the transitional phase from hypersonic re-entry to the approach and landing phase. The trajectory design, optimisation and guidance methods within this thesis are an evolution of previous work conducted on the ascent and re-entry flight phases of RLVs. The methods are modified to incorporate the terminal area flight phase through the adaption of the problem definition and the inclusion of the speed brake setting as a steering parameter. The methods discussed and developed in this thesis are different to previous methods for the terminal area flight phase as they encompass optimisation, trajectory design and guidance based on the definition of the <b>steering</b> <b>parameters.</b> The NLPQL nonlinear optimiser contained within the International Mathematics Standards Library (IMSL) is utilised for trajectory design and optimisation. Real-time vehicle guidance is achieved using the restoration steps of an accelerated Gradient Projection Algorithm (GPA). The methods used are evaluated in a three degrees of freedom (3 DOF) simulation environment. To properly evaluate the programs and {{gain a better understanding of}} the terminal area flight phase, two different vehicles are utilised within this study. These vehicles are the German sub-orbital Hopper concept vehicle, a previously proposed replacement for the Ariane series of launch vehicles and the recently cancelled joint National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Lockheed Martin sub-orbital test bed vehicle, X- 33. The two vehicles each have a terminal area flight phase, but their mission profiles and vehicle characteristics are significantly different. The Hopper vehicle is a winged re-entry vehicle, whereas the X- 33 vehicle is a lifting body. The trajectory design method takes into account the initial and final conditions, in-flight restrictions such as dynamic pressure and vehicle loads as well as safety margins. The designed trajectories are evaluated to analyse the terminal area flight phase and to assist in the development of the guidance program. The guidance method is evaluated utilising an program consisting of two parts, a real world simulator with high order models and a representation of the on-board guidance computer, the predictor, which uses low order models for computational efficiency. The guidance method is evaluated against a variety of off-nominal conditions to account for dispersions within the high order real world models and common errors experienced by re-entry vehicles. These off-nominal conditions include atmospheric disturbances, winds, aerodynamic, mass, navigation, steering and initial condition errors. The results of this study include a detailed analysis of the terminal area flight phase highlighting the major influences for vehicle and trajectory design. The study also confirms the applicability of the non-linear programming method utilising the vehicle <b>steering</b> <b>parameters</b> as a viable option for trajectory design and guidance.
