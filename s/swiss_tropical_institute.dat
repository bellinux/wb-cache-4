50|$|The Novartis Foundation {{has been}} one of the leading {{organizations}} in the private sector for international development for the last 35 years. The humanitarian engagement of the Novartis Foundation goes back to the 1960s, when the Basel-based companies Ciba, Geigy, Sandoz, Durand & Huguenin, Hoffmann-La Roche and Lonza founded the Basel Foundation for Developing Countries. The Basel Foundation, for example, supported the field laboratory of the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Tropical</b> <b>Institute</b> (now known as the Ifakara Health Institute) located in Ifakara, which still works closely with the Novartis Foundation.|$|E

50|$|The Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute or Swiss TPH, (formerly {{known as}} the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Tropical</b> <b>Institute)</b> was founded in 1943 as through the {{initiative}} of Professor Rudolf Geigy. He recognised the need to combine sound interdisciplinary research {{within the context of}} the social and cultural conditions of an endemic area with training and service provision. He felt that this approach would generate new evidence as well as contribute to health development. Since then, this goal remains the mandate of the Swiss TPH - to contribute to the improvement of the health of populations internationally and nationally through excellence in research, services, and teaching and training with a special focus on developing countries.|$|E
40|$|Rational {{planning}} {{of health care}} delivery services and health care interventions are of crucial importance for an efficient use of scarce resources. The decentralisation in the health sector {{to the level of}} districts requires the development of planning tools for the management of health care and health promotion at this level. Computer simulation is a potentially useful way of analysing health systems and health programmes. At the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Tropical</b> <b>Institute,</b> Basel, a computer based health resources allocation model was developed in collaboration with the Institut fr Informatik, University of Basel. Consecutively, in a collaborative effort between the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Tropical</b> <b>Institute</b> and the King Edward Memorial Hospital Research Centre, Pune, India, the feasibility of this approach was tested by adapting the model to simulate the health system with reference to maternal and child health in two rural sub districts in the Pune district of Maharashtra, India.

40|$|Neither high {{theoretical}} {{efficacy of}} disease control tools, nor diagnostic accuracy, nor good compliance, nor adequate coverage can lead {{on its own}} to the final goal of community effectiveness. There is a complex relationship between these factors. The different steps in the process leading to effective {{health care in the}} community are discussed on the basis of biomedical and health systems research activities of the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Tropical</b> <b>Institute.</b> Schistosomiasis and malaria control provide the background to problems related to the efficacy of tools. In particular, information on the trial of a malaria vaccine candidate (SPf 66) is given. Approaches to the rapid, accurate and economical diagnosis of communities at risk are discussed with reference to Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni. Health service support projects in Tanzania and Chad are presented to exemplify problems linked to the compliance of users/providers and coverage. Finally, it is shown that community effectiveness depends on the highest possible success rate for each step. This requires the co-operative efforts of all those involved: the scientist, the manager, the community health worker and, last but not least, the community itsel...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{new approaches}} to social and economic research being developed by the Social and Economic Research component of the Special Programme for Research and Trainning in Tropical Diseases of the World Health Organization. One of these is a study to acess the possibility of identifying high risk communities for urinary schistosomiasis through a "mailed"questionaire approach distributed through an existing administrative system, thereby {{eliminating the need for}} face-to-face interviews by the research or disease control team. This approach, developed by the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Tropical</b> <b>Institute</b> in Ifakara, Tanzania, i s currently being tested in seven other African countries. The paper also describes a change of emphasis of economic research on schistosomiasis, focusing on the intra-household effects of the disease on rural households, rather than, as previously done, studying the impact of the disease on the productivity of individual wage labourers. Other priorities involve the identification of epidemiological information neede for improoved decision-making regarding acceptable treatment strategies in endemic areas with limited financial capacity, as well as research on how the adverse effects of economic development projects can be alleviated...|$|E
