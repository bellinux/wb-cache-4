5|$|The <b>Signpost</b> (formerly The Wikipedia <b>Signpost)</b> is the English Wikipedia's online newspaper. Managed by the Wikipedia community, it is {{published}} online with contributions from Wikipedia editors. The newspaper {{reports on the}} Wikipedia community and events related to Wikipedia, including Arbitration Committee rulings, Wikimedia Foundation issues, and other Wikipedia-related projects.|$|E

5000|$|... {{directional}} <b>signposting</b> on some regional {{roads in}} Ireland remains poor, with even modern signage usually relying on fingerpost <b>signposts</b> located directly at junctions. However, work on improving <b>signposting</b> on regional roads has been continuing since 2003; routes which previously {{had the most}} deficient <b>signposting</b> were selected for upgrading first. In 2007, a total of [...] "€7 million to continue progress on the regional roads <b>signposting</b> programme, which commenced in 2003" [...] was granted to local authorities.|$|R
25|$|Even though legal {{authority}} {{and responsibility for}} the erection of directional <b>signposts</b> was given to local councils, the Automobile Association of Ireland began an extensive road <b>signposting</b> scheme in 1938 which included comprehensive <b>signposting</b> of routes from Belfast, Cork and Dublin.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} sets of ticket {{barriers}} giving access to the platforms: the [...] "South Gate" [...] at ground level (<b>signposted</b> in red), and the [...] "Central Gate" [...] (<b>signposted</b> in blue) and [...] "North Gate" [...] (<b>signposted</b> in green) on the first basement level.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Signpost</b> {{published}} its 200th {{issue in}} November 2008. A total of 1,731 articles had been published, written by 181 contributors. Wikipedia user Ragesoss {{took over as}} editor of the newspaper in February 2009, in an issue which featured a new layout. Ragesoss resigned as editor in June 2010, and HaeB took over as the newspaper debated changing its name from The Wikipedia <b>Signpost</b> to The <b>Signpost.</b> That year, sister Wikipedia publications managed by volunteer contributors included The Wikipedia Weekly, a podcast, and The Wikizine, a news bulletin.|$|E
5|$|The online newspaper, first {{published}} in January 2005 as The Wikipedia <b>Signpost,</b> was later renamed The <b>Signpost.</b> It was founded by Michael Snow, a Wikipedian and later chair of the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees. Similar efforts had been made with Wikipedia:Announcements by Larry Sanger on November 20, 2001, Wikimedia News on Meta-Wiki November 14, 2002, and Wikipedia-Kurier in the German Wikipedia on December 10, 2003.|$|E

50|$|Signs on, {{and leading}} to, French {{motorways}} generally refer to some {{three or four}} towns on that motorway. In other words, there are no stand-out towns that could {{be referred to as}} the French equivalent of a control city. The towns <b>signposted</b> have been picked from the three categories <b>signposted</b> along motorways, with towns in category 5 <b>signposted</b> from the biggest distance out (typically, on any motorway that leads to a town in category 5, the first category 5 town ahead is <b>signposted).</b>|$|R

40|$|Background The <b>Signposts</b> {{program is}} an {{evidence-based}} intervention system {{for parents of}} children with intellectual disability and problem behaviours. This study provided an initial investigation of the outcomes for mothers associated with father participation in <b>Signposts,</b> using data collected from the <b>Signposts</b> Statewide project, conducted in Victoria, Australia. Method Data from <b>Signposts</b> Statewide were analysed, with the effect size Cohen &# 039; s d and 95 % confi dence interval around d calculated for pre- to post-program changes for 134 mothers who participated in <b>Signposts</b> with fathers and 483 mothers who participated without fathers. Results Although mothers in both groups benefi tted from the program, as evidenced by pre- to post-program improvements across all measures, the mean effect size was notably larger for mothers who participated in <b>Signposts</b> with fathers. Conclusions These results highlight possible further program benefi ts for mothers who participate in <b>Signposts</b> with fathers, and are of particular signifi cance in light of research describing the increased stress experienced by mothers of children with a disability...|$|R

5|$|The Warden's House was {{the home}} of the penitentiary's warden. It is located at the northeastern end of the Main Cellblock, next to Alcatraz Lighthouse. The 3-floor 15-room mansion was built in 1921 {{according}} to the Golden Gate National Recreational Area <b>signpost,</b> although some sources say it was built in 1926 or 1929 and had 17 or 18 rooms.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, {{in stark contrast to}} the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The <b>signpost</b> at the spot shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo Lawn is {{so called}} {{because of the}} replica of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Silver Buffalo Award that was {{presented}} by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926. This was to honour the Unknown Scout that helped William D. Boyce bring Scouting to the United States. Located there is a <b>signpost</b> with the directions and distances to all the World Scout Jamborees from Gilwell Park. Surrounding the Buffalo Lawn {{is part of the}} original balustrade of London Bridge which was re-built in 1820. The sections were moved to Gilwell Park after being purchased at auction in 1826.|$|E

5000|$|In New Zealand {{they are}} <b>signposted</b> as [...] "No Exit", but {{are often not}} <b>signposted</b> at all. The terms 'cul-de-sac' and 'dead end' have the same senses as in Australia (see above).|$|R
40|$|<b>Signposts</b> make complex {{documents}} {{more flexible}} {{and easier to}} read; <b>signposts</b> exist in many forms, but are familiar as cross references and as hypertext links. <b>Signposting</b> systems need to be carefully designed, {{so that they are}} reliable, easy to use for readers yet convenient for authors to embed in their writing. There are fundamental problems in achieving good <b>signposting,</b> which this paper explores through cross-referencing in the popular medium of LATEX, which is often the typesetting system of choice for heavily cross-referenced documents. This paper provides an implementation of cross references for LATEX users. Problems with LATEX and TEX arise, and are explored and mostly solved: some problems are due to the designs of these systems, but, crucially, some problems are unavoidable, an inevitable part of <b>signposting</b> in principle, whatever systems are used, even including the web. 1...|$|R
5|$|The State Trunkline Highway System {{was created}} on May 13, 1913, by {{an act of}} the Michigan Legislature; at the time, none of the system's {{divisions}} corresponded to the modern I-69 either. In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) was required to <b>signpost</b> the highway system for the first time, and the state become the second after Wisconsin to do so. At the time, two different highways followed sections of the modern I-69 corridor. The original M-29 ran from the Indiana state line north to Charlotte and turned northeasterly to Lansing. The second highway was M-21 from Flint east to Goodells, a community west of Port Huron; the highway was extended to Port Huron by 1924.|$|E
5|$|The {{clothing}} worn by characters {{was brought}} up-to-date, while the old steam railways {{were replaced by}} electrified alternatives. Adverts for the genuine Johnnie Walker whisky were replaced by adverts for a fictional alternative, Loch Lomond whisky, while a Sussex County Council <b>signpost</b> was added to page 11. Various English towns and villages were renamed, with Puddlecombe becoming Littlegate, and Eastbury becoming Eastdown, while Scottish pub Ye Dolphin was renamed The Kiltoch Arms. The police were no longer depicted as carrying guns, as was accurate, while the journalists Christopher Willoughby-Drupe and Marco Rizotto, who had first appeared in The Castafiore Emerald (1963), were retroactively added into the background of one scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{first saw}} action during Operation Wegweiser (<b>Signpost)</b> from 9 to 12 March 1944. The aim of Operation Wegweiser was {{to clear a}} part of the Syrmia region which was occupied by Partisans who threatened the Zagreb-Belgrade railway. The Partisans were operating from forests around Bosut and villages along the Sava. As the division entered the area, the Partisans withdrew to the south-east, avoiding decisive engagement. Sauberzweig claimed the Partisans suffered 573 killed and 82 captured. Hoare writes that the division massacred hundreds of Serb civilians during the operation. According to Vladimir Dedijer and Antun Miletić, 223 civilians were killed in Bosut, 352 in Sremska Rača, and 70 in Jamena, mostly old men, women and children. The operation was a success in clearing the Bosut forests, but the Partisans returned to the area soon after it concluded.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reserve is}} on the left of the road <b>signposted</b> [...] "Lilley" [...] from Hexton. There is also access by a footpath, <b>signposted</b> [...] "circular walk", from Barton Hill Road, close to the Icknield Way Path.|$|R
5000|$|The path {{is fairly}} well <b>signposted,</b> {{but there are}} one or two places in Edinburgh where the path meets a road and it is {{necessary}} to hunt around for its continuation. Some <b>signposts</b> have been vandalised or pointed in the wrong direction.|$|R
40|$|Problem and background: Dysmelia {{is usually}} {{detected}} prenatally or postnatally in maternity services. The provision of family-centred care for {{parents at the}} time of initial diagnosis is crucial to facilitate decision making, access to appropriate services, and the provision of parental care-giving, but no research has investigated parent experiences or preferences in this population. Aims: The current research aimed to address this by investigating satisfaction with service, occurrence of <b>signposting</b> and preferences in this group. Methods: Two online surveys were conducted. In the first survey (n = 417), parents reported whether they were offered <b>signposting</b> information and their level of satisfaction with the service they received when initially diagnosed. In the second survey (n = 130), a subgroup of participants who completed the first survey reported their preferences for <b>signposting</b> and health service access after diagnosis. Findings: On average, participants were less than satisfied with the service they received and only 27 % were offered <b>signposting</b> information. Satisfaction was higher amongst parents who had been offered <b>signposting</b> information. 91 % of parents said they would have wanted <b>signposting</b> information and 67 % would have wanted access to a support group. Conclusions: There is a need to improve the family-centeredness of care when dysmelia is identified. Offering <b>signposting</b> information to relevant third-sector organisations may increase parent satisfaction and address parent preferences. These findings could have implications for parents of children with other rare diseases identified in maternity services...|$|R
5|$|The game {{takes place}} over six levels called zones. Each zone is {{split into two}} acts, in which the player must guide their {{selected}} character past enemies and obstacles such as spikes and bottomless pits to reach the end in under ten minutes. Scattered around acts are springboards, boost pads, and golden rings, which serve {{as a form of}} health; players survive hits {{as long as they have}} at least one ring, but their rings will scatter and disappear after a short period of time. Players can also collect canisters that contain power-ups such as speed shoes, elemental shields, and invincibility. The first act ends when players pass a <b>signpost,</b> while the second culminates in a boss fight with Eggman; after hitting him eight times, Eggman will flee and drop a capsule of captured animals. Each character starts the game with a limited number of lives, which are lost when the player is hit with no rings in their possession, is crushed, drowns, or falls in a bottomless pit. If the player loses all their lives, they will receive a game over.|$|E
25|$|To {{track and}} locate {{vehicles}} along fixed routes, a technology called <b>Signpost</b> transmitters is employed. This {{is used on}} transit routes and rail lines where the vehicles to be tracked continually operated on the same linear route. A transponder or RFID chip along the vehicle route would be polled as the train or bus traverses its route. As each transponder was passed, the moving vehicle would query and receive an ack, or handshake, from the <b>signpost</b> transmitter. A transmitter on the mobile would report passing the <b>signpost</b> to a system controller. This allows supervision, a call center, or a dispatch center to monitor {{the progress of the}} vehicle and assess whether or not the vehicle was on schedule. These systems are an alternative inside tunnels or other conveyances where GPS signals are blocked by terrain.|$|E
