40|$|SummaryThroughout life, adult organs {{continually}} {{adapt to}} variable environmental factors. Adaptive mechanisms must fundamentally differ from homeostatic maintenance, but {{little is known}} about how physiological factors elicit tissue remodeling. Here, we show that <b>specialized</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> responses underlie the adaptive resizing of a mature organ. In the adult Drosophila midgut, intestinal stem cells interpret a nutrient cue to “break homeostasis” and drive growth when food is abundant. Activated in part by niche production of insulin, stem cells direct a growth program through two altered modes of behavior: accelerated division rates and predominance of symmetric division fates. Together, these altered modes produce a net increase in total intestinal cells, which is reversed upon withdrawal of food. Thus, tissue renewal programs are not committed to maintain cellular equilibrium; stem cells can remodel organs in response to physiological triggers...|$|E
40|$|Stomata, {{which are}} {{epidermal}} pores surrounded by two guard cells, develop from a <b>specialized</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> lineage and function in shoot gas exchange. The Arabidopsis thaliana FOUR LIPS (FLP) and MYB 88 genes encode closely related and atypical two-MYB-repeat proteins, which when mutated result in excess divisions and abnormal groups of stomata in contact. Consistent with {{a role in}} transcription, we show here that FLP and MYB 88 are nuclear proteins with DNA binding preferences distinct from other known MYBs. To identify possible FLP/MYB 88 transcriptional targets, we used chromatin immunoprecitation (ChIP) followed by hybridization to Arabidopsis whole genome tiling arrays. These ChIP-chip data indicate that FLP/MYB 88 target the upstream regions especially of cell cycle genes, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and components of the prereplication complex. In particular, we show that FLP represses {{the expression of the}} mitosis-inducing factor CDKB 1; 1, which, along with CDKB 1; 2, is specifically required both for the last division in the stomatal pathway and for cell overproliferation in flp mutants. We propose that FLP and MYB 88 together integrate patterning with the control of cell cycle progression and terminal differentiation through multiple and direct cell cycle targets. FLP recognizes a distinct cis-regulatory element that overlaps with that of the cell cycle activator E 2 F-DP in the CDKB 1; 1 promoter, suggesting that these MYBs may also modulate E 2 F-DP pathways...|$|E
40|$|Rise of {{atmospheric}} CO 2 {{is one of}} the main causes of global warming. Catastrophic climate change can be avoided by reducing emissions and increasing sequestration of CO 2. Trees are known to sequester CO 2 during photosynthesis, and then store it as wood biomass. Thus, breeding of trees with higher wood yield would mitigate global warming as well as augment production of renewable construction materials, energy, and industrial feedstock. Wood is made of cellulose-rich xylem cells produced through proliferation of a <b>specialized</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche called cambium. Importance of cambium in xylem cells production makes it an ideal target for the tree breeding programs; however our knowledge about control of cambium proliferation remains limited. The morphology and regulation of cambium are different from those of stem cell niches that control axial growth. For this reason, translating the knowledge about axial growth to radial growth has limited use. Furthermore, genetic approaches cannot be easily applied because overlaying tissues conceal cambium from direct observation and complicate identification of mutants. To overcome the paucity of experimental tools in cambium biology, we constructed a Boolean network CARENET (CAmbium REgulation gene NETwork) for modelling cambium activity, which includes the key transcription factors WOX 4 and HD-ZIP III as well as their potential regulators. Our simulations predict that: (1) auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, and brassinosteroids act cooperatively in promoting transcription of WOX 4 and HD-ZIP III; (2) auxin and cytokinin pathways negatively regulate each other; (3) hormonal pathways act redundantly in sustaining cambium activity; (4) individual cambium cells can have diverse molecular identities. CARENET can be extended to include components of other signalling pathways and be integrated with models of xylem and phloem differentiation. Such extended models would facilitate breeding trees with higher wood yield...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> have a {{critical}} role during adult growth and regeneration. Germline <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are <b>specialized</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> that produce gametes during sexual reproduction. Capitella teleta (formerly Capitella sp. I) is a polychaete annelid that reproduces sexually, exhibits adult growth and regeneration, and thus, is a good model to study the relationship between somatic and germline <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Results We characterize expression of the two C. teleta orthologs of piwi, genes with roles in germline development in diverse organisms. Ct-piwi 1 and Ct-piwi 2 are expressed throughout the life cycle in a dynamic pattern that includes both somatic and germline cells, and show nearly identical expression patterns at all stages examined. Both genes are broadly expressed during embryonic and larval development, gradually becoming restricted to putative primordial germ cells (PGCs) and the posterior growth zone. In juveniles, Ct-piwi 1 is expressed in the presumptive gonads, and in reproductive adults, it is detected in gonads and the posterior growth zone. In addition, Ct-piwi 1 is expressed in a population of putative PGCs that persist in sexually mature adults, likely in a <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche. Ct-piwi 1 is expressed in regenerating tissue, and once segments differentiate, it becomes most prominent in the posterior growth zone and immature oocytes in regenerating ovaries of regenerating segments. Conclusions In C. teleta, piwi genes may have retained an ancestral role as genetic regulators of both somatic and germline <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> It is likely that piwi genes, and associated <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> co-regulators, became restricted to the germline in some taxa {{during the course of}} evolution. </p...|$|R

Ninety-three live normal pre- and postnatal animals were obtained. Of 14 thus far analyzed, three were cellular genetic mosaics with substantial contributions of tumor-derived cells in many developmentally unrelated tissues, including some never seen in the solid tumors that form in transplant hosts. The tissues functioned normally and synthesized their specific products (e. g., immunoglobulins, adult hemoglobin, liver proteins) coded for by strain-type alleles at known loci. In addition, a tumor-contributed color gene, steel, not previously known to be present in the carcinoma cells, was detected from the coat phenotype. Cells derived from the carcinoma, which is of X/Y sex chromosome constitution, also contributed to the germ line and formed reproductively functional sperms, some of which transmitted the steel gene to the progeny. Thus, after almost 200 transplant generations as a highly malignant tumor, embryoid body core cells appear to be developmentally totipotent and able to express, in an orderly sequence in differentiation of somatic and germ-line tissues, many genes hitherto silent in the tumor of origin. This experimental system of "cycling" teratocarcinoma core cells through mice, in conjunction with experimental mutagenesis of those cells, may therefore provide a new and useful tool for biochemical, developmental, and genetic analyses of mammalian differentiation. The results also furnish an unequivocal example in animals of a non-mutational basis for transformation to malignancy and of reversal to normalcy.

Several insults, both intrinsic and extrinsic, can precipitate destruction of the delicate microenvironment of these cells, resulting in limbal <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> deficiency (LSCD). In such cases, reepithelialization fails and conjunctival epithelium extends across the limbus, leading to vascularization, persistent epithelial defects, and chronic inflammation. In partial LSCD, conjunctival epitheliectomy, coupled with amniotic membrane transplantation, could be sufficient to restore a healthy surface. In more severe cases and in total LSCD, <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation is currently the best curative option. Before any attempts are considered to perform a limbal <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation procedure, the ocular surface must be optimized by controlling causative factors and comorbid conditions. These factors include adequate eyelid function or exposure, control of the ocular surface inflammatory status, and a well-lubricated ocular surface. In cases of unilateral LSCD, <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{can be obtained from}} the contralateral eye. Newer techniques aim at expanding cells in vitro or in vivo in order to decrease the need for large limbal resection that may jeopardize the “healthy” eye. Patients with bilateral disease can be treated using allogeneic tissue in combination with systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Another emerging option for this subset of patients is the use of noncorneal cells such as mucosal grafts. Finally, the use of keratoprosthesis is reserved for patients who are not candidates for any of the aforementioned options, wherein the choice of the type of keratoprosthesis depends on the severity of the disease. In summary, limbal <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation improves both vision and quality-of-life in patients with ocular surface disorders associated with LSCD, and overall, the use of autologous tissue offers the best results.

40|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cell</b> {{research}} is revolutionizing the way scientists think about mammalian development. It {{is a field}} full of promise to treat many debilitating and degenerative diseases. Regulation of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> by transcription factors that bind to specific DNA loci to control gene regulatory networks have been well studied in various <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> populations. However, the mechanisms by which the regulation of post-transcriptional RNA processing influences the timely, highly <b>specialized</b> differentiation of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are not well understood. Only recently have researchers started focusing attention {{on the importance of}} RNA regulation in the control of gene expression and, thus, to impact human health. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) bind to and regulate RNA metabolism at multiple levels from processing within the nucleus, nuclear export, and transport to organelles within the cytoplasm. In addition, RBPs can regulate RNA stability and protein translation. Techniques to study and identify the RNA substrates regulated by RNA binding proteins have only recently been developed within the last decade, with the availability of high-throughput sequencing revolutionizing established techniques, enabling transcriptome-wide views of RNA biology. My dissertation research focuses on the function of the IGF 2 BP/IMP family of RNA binding proteins. In particular, I have investigated the role of IGF 2 BP 1 /IMP 1, in early human development using human embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (hESCs) as a model system. I have used CLIP-seq to identify the endogenous targets of IMP 1 in hESCs and have determined the mechanism of regulation for the novel target ITGB 5. Additionally, I have uncovered a role for IMP 1 in early neural progenitor cell populations and in localization of target RNAs. Ongoing studies comparing and contrasting the various targets and functions of IMP 1 and IMP 2 in hESCs at the genome-wide level will pave the way for future investigators to dissect the individual functions for each of these RBPs. This work will provide a resource for those aiming to understand the mechanisms of how these proteins control their target RNAs during development and tumorigenesi...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Interactions between stromal cell-derived factor- 1 α (SDF- 1 α) and its cognate {{receptor}} CXCR 4 {{are crucial}} for the recruitment of mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (MSCs) from bone marrow (BM) reservoirs to damaged tissues for repair during alarm situations. MicroRNAs are differentially expressed in <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niches, suggesting a <b>specialized</b> role in <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> regulation. Here, we gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating SDF- 1 α. METHODS: MSCs from green fluorescent protein transgenic male mice were transfused to irradiated recipient female C 57 BL/ 6 mice, and skin burn model of bone marrow-chimeric mice were constructed. Six miRNAs with differential expression in burned murine skin tissue compared to normal skin tissue were identified using microarrays and bioinformatics. The expression of miR- 27 b and SDF- 1 α was examined in burned murine skin tissue using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Correlation of miR- 27 b and SDF- 1 α expression was analyzed by Pearson analysis Correlation. miRNAs suppressed SDF- 1 α protein expression by binding directly to its 3 'UTR using western blot and luciferase reporter assay. The importance of miRNAs in MSCs chemotaxis was further estimated by decreasing SDF- 1 α in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: miR- 23 a, miR- 27 a and miR- 27 b expression was significantly lower in the burned skin than in the normal skin (p< 0. 05). We also found that several miRNAs suppressed SDF- 1 α protein expression, while just miR- 27 a and miR- 27 b directly bound to the SDF- 1 α 3 'UTR. Moreover, the forced over-expression of miR- 27 a and miR- 27 b significantly reduced the directional migration of mMSCs in vitro. However, only miR- 27 b in burn wound margins significantly inhibited the mobilization of MSCs to the epidermis. CONCLUSION: miR- 27 b may be a unique signature of the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche in burned mouse skin and can suppress the directional migration of mMSCs by targeting SDF- 1 α by binding directly to its 3 'UTR...|$|R
40|$|Endometrial {{regeneration}} is mediated, {{at least}} in part, by {{the existence of a}} <b>specialized</b> somatic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> (SSC) population recently identified by several groups using the side population (SP) technique. We previously demonstrated that endometrial SP displays genotypic, phenotypic and the functional capability to develop human endometrium after subcutaneous injection in NOD-SCID mice. We have now established seven human endometrial SP (hESP) cell lines (ICE 1 - 7) : four from the epithelial and three from the stromal fraction, respectively. SP cell lines were generated under hypoxic conditions based on their cloning efficiency ability, cultured for 12 - 15 passages (20 weeks) and cryopreserved. Cell lines displayed normal 46 XX karyotype, intermediate telomerase activity pattern and expressed mRNAs encoding proteins that are considered characteristic of undifferentiated cells (Oct- 4, GDF 3, DNMT 3 B, Nanog, GABR 3) and those of mesodermal origin (WT 1, Cardiac Actin, Enolase, Globin, REN). Phenotype analysis corroborated their epithelial (CD 9 +) or stromal (vimentin+) cell origin and mesenchymal (CD 90 +, CD 73 + and CD 45 ⁻) attributes. Markers considered characteristic of ectoderm or endoderm were not detected. Cells did not express either estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) or progesterone receptor (PR). The hESP cell lines were able to differentiate in vitro into adipocytes and osteocytes, which confirmed their mesenchymal origin. Finally, we demonstrated their ability to generate human endometrium when transplanted beneath the renal capsule of NOD-SCID mice. These findings confirm that SP cells exhibit key features of human endometrial SSC and open up new possibilities for the understanding of gynecological disorders such as endometriosis or Asherman syndrome. Our cell lines can be a valuable model to investigate new targets for endometrium proliferation in endometriosis...|$|R
