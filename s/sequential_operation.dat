40|$|Abstract — Operational {{transformation}} (OT) is {{an established}} optimistic consistency control method in collaborative applications. This approach requires correct transformation functions. In general all OT algorithms only consider two character-based primitive operations and hardly {{two or three}} of them support string based two primitive operations, insert and delete. In our earlier paper [1] we have proposed new algorithms that consider first time in history new string operations that are update for atomic string operations in addition to primitive operations like insert and delete. In this paper we have proposed new algorithms LocalU and RemoteU for handling local and remote update operations of strings for both atomic and <b>sequential</b> <b>operations.</b> These algorithms first time in history are handling <b>sequential</b> update string <b>operations.</b> These algorithms satisfy correctness criteria like causality preservation and admissibility preservation. These algorithms are for <b>sequential</b> update <b>operations</b> but have synchronization with existing primitive operations like insert and delete also. It also handles overlapping and splitting of operations when concurrent operations are transformed. These algorithms can be applied {{in a wide range of}} practical collaborative applications.

Whereas in external devices changing environmental conditions cannot be prevented, cells are retained in their optimal environment in internal devices. Conventional reverse-flow diafiltration utilizes an internal membrane device, but pulsed feeding causes temporal heterogeneities. In this study, {{the influence of}} conventional reverse-flow diafiltration on the yeast Hansenula polymorpha is investigated. Alternating 180 s of feeding with 360 s of non-feeding at a dilution rate of 0. 2 h(- 1) results in an oscillating DOT signal with an amplitude of 60 %. Thereby, induced short-term oxygen limitations result {{in the formation of}} ethanol and a reduced product concentration of 25 %. This effect is enforced at increased dilution rate. To overcome this cyclic problem, <b>sequential</b> <b>operation</b> of three membranes is introduced. Thus, quasi-continuous feeding is achieved reducing the oscillation of the DOT signal to an amplitude of 20 % and 40 % for a dilution rate of 0. 2 h(- 1) and 0. 5 h(- 1), respectively. Fermentation conditions characterized by complete absence of oxygen limitation and without formation of overflow metabolites could be obtained for dilution rates from 0. 1 h(- 1) - 0. 5 h(- 1).

Scaling limitations associated with higher order systems can be addressed by using the multiple degree-of-freedom cell mapping (MDCM) method.

By running the PMDCM method on a workstation with a quad-core processor and by parallelizing 100 numerical integration operations, the total computation time is decreased by 93 % from the time required of the MDCM method.

40|$|Abstract Particle filter (PF) is an {{emerging}} signal processing methodology, which can effectively deal with nonlinear and non-Gaussian signals by a sample-based approximation {{of the state}} probability density function. The particle generation of the PF is a data-independent procedure and can be implemented in parallel. However, the resampling procedure in the PF is a sequential task in natural and difficult to be parallelized. Based on the Amdahl's law, the sequential portion of a task limits the maximum speed-up of the parallelized implementation. Moreover, large particle number is usually required to obtain an accurate estimation, and {{the complexity of the}} resampling procedure is highly related to the number of particles. In this article, we propose a multi-prediction (MP) framework with two selection approaches. The proposed MP framework can reduce the required particle number for target estimation accuracy, and the <b>sequential</b> <b>operation</b> of the resampling can be reduced. Besides, the overhead of the MP framework can be easily compensated by parallel implementation. The proposed MP-PF alleviates the global <b>sequential</b> <b>operation</b> by increasing the local parallel computation. In addition, the MP-PF is very suitable for multi-core graphics processing unit (GPU) platform, which is a popular parallel processing architecture. We give prototypical implementations of the MP-PFs on multi-core GPU platform. For the classic bearing-only tracking experiments, the proposed MP-PF can be 25. 1 and 15. 3 times faster than the sequential importance resampling-PF with 10, 000 and 20, 000 particles, respectively. Hence, the proposed MP-PF can enhance the efficiency of the parallelization. </p...|$|E
