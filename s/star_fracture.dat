40|$|Gravitational, {{magnetic}} and superfluid {{forces can}} stress the crust of an evolving neutron <b>star.</b> <b>Fracture</b> of the crust under these stresses {{could affect the}} star’s spin evolution and generate high-energy emission. We study the growth of strain in the crust of a spinning down, magnetized neutron star and examine the initiation of crust cracking (a starquake). In preliminary work (Link, Franco & Epstein 1998), we studied a homogeneous model of a neutron star. Here we extend this work by considering a more realistic model of a solid, homogeneous crust afloat on a liquid core. In the limits of astrophysical interest, our new results qualitatively agree with those from the simpler model: the stellar crust fractures under shear stress at the rotational equator, matter moves to higher latitudes and the star’s oblateness is reduced. Magnetic stresses favor faults directed toward the magnetic poles. Thus our previous conclusions concerning the star’s spin response still hold; namely, asymmetric redistribution of matter excites damped precession which could ultimately {{lead to an increase}} in the spin-down torque. Starquakes associated with glitches could explain the permanent offsets in period derivative observed to follow glitches in at least three pulsars.

50|$|As {{a six-year-old}} in 1943 Tranquil Star was beaten {{narrowly}} by Amana in the Caulfield Stakes, V.R.C. Melbourne Stakes and L. K. S. Mackinnon Stakes but Tranquil Star gained revenge on Amana in the St George Stakes by relegating him into second place. Tranquil Star also placed second in V.A.T.C. Memsie Stakes and VRC C. M. Lloyd Stakes {{as well as}} placing third in the C F Orr Stakes and Underwood Stakes. During her final start of the 1944 season Tranquil <b>Star</b> <b>fractured</b> her jaw so badly {{that it had to}} be wired. It was only the patient attention of her trainer and her iron constitution enabled her to survive this disaster. Her tally for this season was 14 starts for 1 win, 5 seconds and 2 thirds.|$|R
50|$|She did {{extensive}} voice acting for Stan Freberg's commercials, albums, and 1957 radio series, memorably {{as secretary}} to the werewolf advertising executive. She {{also appeared in}} several Rankin/Bass TV specials in the 1960s and 1970s, voicing the young Karen and the teacher in the TV special Frosty the Snowman (although only her Karen singing parts remained in later airings, after Rankin-Bass re-edited the special {{a few years after}} it debuted, with Foray's dialogue re-dubbed by an actress who was uncredited). She also voiced all the female roles in Rikki-Tikki-Tavi (1975), including the villainous cobra Nagaina. She played multiple characters on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, including Natasha Fatale and Nell Fenwick, as well as male lead character Rocket J. Squirrel (a.k.a. Rocky Squirrel) for Jay Ward, and played Ursula on George of the Jungle; and also <b>starred</b> on <b>Fractured</b> Flickers.|$|R
40|$|Soft gamma {{repeaters}} (SGRs) have unique {{properties that}} make them intriguing targets for gravitational wave (GW) searches. They are nearby, their burst emission mechanism may involve neutron <b>star</b> crust <b>fractures</b> and excitation of quasi-normal modes, and they burst repeatedly and sometimes spectacularly. A recent LIGO search for transient GW from these sources placed upper limits {{on a set of}} almost 200 individual SGR bursts. These limits were within the theoretically predicted range of some models. We present a new search strategy which builds upon the method used there by "stacking" potential GW signals from multiple SGR bursts. We assume that variation in the time difference between burst electromagnetic emission and burst GW emission is small relative to the GW signal duration, and we time-align GW excess power time-frequency tilings containing individual burst triggers to their corresponding electromagnetic emissions. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm that gains in GW energy sensitivity of N^{ 1 / 2 } are possible, where N is the number of stacked SGR bursts. Estimated sensitivities for a mock search for gravitational waves from the 2006 March 29 storm from SGR 1900 + 14 are also presented, for two GW emission models, "fluence-weighted" and "flat" (unweighted).

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{study was}} conducted to evaluate cutting fluids for Single Point Diamond Turning (SPDT) of single crystal silicon. The pH of distilled waster was adjusted with various additives the examine the effect of pH on cutting operations. Fluids which seemed to promote ductile cutting appeared to increase tool wear as well, an undesirable tradeoff. High Ph sodium hydroxide solutions showed promise for further research, as they yielded the best combination of reduced tool wear and good surface finish in the ductile regime. Negative rake tools were verified to improve the surface finish, but the negative rake tools used in the experiments also showed much higher wear than conventional 0 {degree} rake tools. Effects of crystallographic orientation on SPDT, such as <b>star</b> patterns of <b>fracture</b> damage forming {{near the center of the}} samples, were observed to decrease with lower feedrates. Silicon chips were observed and photographed, indicative of a ductile materials removal process...|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest that}} some galactic {{transient}} X-ray sources are actually very old neutron stars. An intense transient thermal X-ray flux will be emitted from these sources when a sudden period jump occurs. This phenomenon, called a glitch, results from either sudden angular momentum transfer from crustal superflid to the solid part of the <b>star</b> or sudden <b>fracture</b> of the crustal lattice due to gravitational stress. The excess of the rotation energy will be dissipated in terms of thermal radiation. Such transient X-ray emission should be detectable if the source is located within 1 kpc of the solar system. Most important, {{the evolution of a}} thermal X-ray transient can provide valuable information for the equation of state of the stars because the peak of the thermal flux and the characteristic timescales, e. g., the timescale to reach the X-ray flux peak, duration of the thermal pulse, and the timescale to reach the steady state, which are observable and are sensitive to the equation of state of neutron stars. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
