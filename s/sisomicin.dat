40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of <b>sisomicin</b> against Pseudomonas is two- to eight-fold greater then gentamicin or amikacin, and similar to tobramycin. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of <b>sisomicin</b> are usually <]· 0 pg/ml. <b>Sisomicin</b> interacts synergistically {{with a variety}} of penicillins against many Pseudomonas, including strains resistant to gentamicin. The degree ofcross-resistance between <b>sisomicin</b> and other aminoglycosides varies depending upon mechanism. Many strains with inactivating enzymes are resistant to <b>sisomicin,</b> gentamicin and tobramycin. However, due to high intrinsic potency, <b>sisomicin</b> is active against many strains that are resistant to other aminoglycosides as a result of impermeability. Thus <b>sisomicin</b> is active against 4 % to 66 % of strains resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin or amikacin. The ability of <b>sisomicin</b> to protect animals from fatal Pseudomonas infections has been assessed in 29 paired tests with tobramycin and 36 paired tests with gentamicin.

In the evaluable patients (n= 290), impetigo was the commonest clinical condition reported. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest pathogen isolated from the lesons. Both <b>sisomicin</b> and mupirocin treatments produced a steady improvement in the scores of erythema, oedema, vesiculation, pustulation, crusting and scaling but the improvement produced by <b>sisomicin</b> was quicker and more pronounced.

The in vitro activities of <b>sisomicin,</b> gentamicin, and tobramycin, three similar aminoglycosides, were determined against 228 clinical isolates representing 10 genera of common pathogens. No difference was noted {{in the activities of}} these antimicrobial agents when assayed by a standard broth dilution technique against Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Salmonella, Citrobacter, enterococci, or Staphylococcus aureus. <b>Sisomicin</b> was significantly more active than tobramycin against Serratia and indole-positive Proteus strains. <b>Sisomicin</b> was significantly more active than gentamicin against indole-negative Proteus strains and slightly more active against indole-positive Proteus strains.

40|$|Gentamicin, <b>sisomicin,</b> tobramycin, and {{kanamycin}} {{were compared}} in parallel tests in vitro and in vivo against {{a variety of}} bacterial strains and species.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of intravenously administered <b>sisomicin</b> {{were studied}} in 33 patients with normal renal function and {{different degrees of}} renal impairment. In all patients, the serum disappearance of <b>sisomicin,</b> once distribution equilibrium had been achieved, followed first-order kinetics and percentage of hourly loss from serum decreased proportionally with decreasing renal function.
