The Treaty Debates were difficult but also comprised a wider and robust <b>stock-taking</b> of the position by the contending parties. Their differing views {{of the past and}} their hopes for the future were made public. The focus had to be on the constitutional options, but little mention was made of the economy, nor of how life would now be improved {{for the majority of the}} population. Though Sinn Féin had also campaigned to preserve the Irish language, very little use was made of it in the debates. Some of the female TDs were notably in favour of continuing the war until a 32-county state was established. Much mention was made of '700 years' of British occupation. Personal bitterness developed; Arthur Griffith said of Erskine Childers: [...] "I will not reply to any damned Englishman in this Assembly" [...] and Cathal Brugha reminded everyone that the position of Michael Collins in the IRA was technically inferior to his.|$|E

40|$|The diploma thesis follows up {{a process}} of inventary in a chosen {{accountant}} unit, its found insufficiencies and its consecutive solution. The process of inventary belongs to activities that lead to completion of a closing financial statement of an organization {{and that is why}} all the actions and processes must be done with carefulness and accuracy according to law number 563 / 1991 of law collection about accountancy, which states, according to law of the European union, extent and way of managing the accountancy and all requirements for its conclusivness and conditions for handing it over to a state. 	 The theoretical part of the thesis is related to defining basic terms of inventory process. The valid law regulations, which are dealing with those issues, are stated there. Individual phases of the whole process, important intern regulations and documents, which are obligatory for every single accountant unit, are also stated in the theoretical part of the thesis. A continuity of the inventory of property and commitments in financial statements and statements is being described there. 	 The practical part of the thesis involves the process of inventory in a chosen non-profitable accountant unit of the district court in Jičín. In the individual phases of the inventory, when the physical and documentary <b>stock-takings</b> are being done, are found insufficiencies and proposals of their solutions. A complete process of inventory belongs to activities of the chosen accountant unit, on which state´s controlling institutions are focusing in recent years, because the activities involve economy of the state´s essets. A methodic instruction for the processing of inventory of property and commitments for an accountant unit is worked out in the last chapter of the practical part. 	By the compilization of the diploma thesis a complete view on an inventory as a whole was given, which is a starting point for completion of a financial statement. While working out the thesis, rocess or system insufficiencies were analysed. These insufficiencies might cause that the accountant unit will not fullfill the § 6 paragraph 3 of law of accountancy, from which the compulsatory duty of inventory of property and commitments according to provision § 29 and § 30 of law of accountancy flows. The audit office can, on the basis of those insufficiences, proclaim that the inventory of property and commitments was not done correctly and can apply a sanction on the accountant unit. After the inventory process the accountant unit is compulsory to make an inventory report that is a substantial document together with financial statements, balance-sheet, profit and loss sheet and attachments to the authorization of the financial statements...|$|R

These are the amounts you have purchased since. Now, upon the other side are all the sales of this cable entered in the sales-book.

60|$|Godfrey, who was {{received}} by the servants with many bows, and requests {{that they might be}} allowed to continue in their employment, wandered through the big rooms which looked so desolate now, and stared until he was tired at examples of beautiful French furniture, of which he understood nothing. Then, oppressed by memories of his kind friend into whose death chamber he had blundered, and, as it seemed to him, by a sense of her presence which he imagined was warning him of something, he left the house, telling the Pasteur, who was peering about him through his blue spectacles in an innocent and interested way, that he would meet him at the five o'clock diligence. Indeed, he had business of his own to do, which seemed to him more important than all this <b>stock-taking</b> and legal discussion. Having plenty of money in his pocket Godfrey wished to spend some of it in presents.|$|E
60|$|On the whole, however, {{at the end}} of a few months, {{the balance}} of {{substantial}} loss was on the side of the Anti-Tryanites. Mr. Pratt, indeed, had lost a patient or two besides Mr. Dempster's family; but as it was evident that Evangelicalism had not dried up the stream of his anecdote, or in the least altered his view of any lady's constitution, it is probable that a change accompanied by so few outward and visible signs, was rather the pretext than the ground of his dismissal in those additional cases. Mr. Dunn was threatened with the loss of several good customers, Mrs. Phipps and Mrs. Lowme having set the example of ordering him to send in his bill; and the draper began to look forward to his next <b>stock-taking</b> with an anxiety which was but slightly mitigated by the parallel his wife suggested between his own case and that of Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego, who were thrust into a burning fiery furnace. For, as he observed to her the next morning, with that perspicacity which belongs to the period of shaving, whereas their deliverance consisted in the fact that their linen and woollen goods were not consumed, his own deliverance lay in precisely the opposite result. But convenience, that admirable branch system from the main line of self-interest, makes us all fellow-helpers in spite of adverse resolutions. It is probable that no speculative or theological hatred would be ultimately strong enough to resist the persuasive power of convenience: that a latitudinarian baker, whose bread was honourably free from alum, would command the custom of any dyspeptic Puseyite; that an Arminian with the toothache would prefer a skilful Calvinistic dentist to a bungler stanch against the doctrines of Election and Final Perseverance, who would be likely to break the tooth in his head; and that a Plymouth Brother, who had a well furnished grocery shop in a favourable vicinage, would occasionally have the pleasure of furnishing sugar or vinegar to orthodox families that found themselves unexpectedly 'out of' those indispensable commodities. In this persuasive power of convenience lay Mr. Dunn's ultimate security from martyrdom. His drapery was the best in Milby; the comfortable use and wont of procuring satisfactory articles at a moment's notice proved too strong for Anti-Tryanite zeal; and the draper could soon look forward to his next <b>stock-taking</b> without the support of a Scriptural parallel.|$|E

50|$|From a {{financial}} accounting perspective, backflushing {{is a technique}} of the perpetual inventory system. Small businesses which have a rather modest variety of items in their inventory still use periodic inventory management. A periodic inventory system does not require day-to-day tracking of physical inventory. Purchases, cost of goods sold, and inventory on hand cannot be tracked {{until the end of}} the accounting time period when a physical inventory is performed and ending inventory is compared against the sum of beginning inventory and purchases. Cost of ending inventory can be calculated by using the LIFO or FIFO inventory accounting methods, or other less common methods. The end of the accounting period is considered usually the end of each month because otherwise some taxes like the VAT (value added tax) cannot be charged. The monthly <b>stock-taking</b> is the main disadvantage of the periodic inventory system. Another disadvantage is that it requires also monthly a reconciliation between the records of the management accounting and the financial accounting.|$|E

5000|$|Quoting {{from the}} {{notes of the}} CRI album (SD 437) that {{contains}} the first recording of his song cycle At The End Of The Parade (1974) for baritone and six players Yannay writes: [...] "In 1970 my music took a gentle turn. It was not a conscious decision, but a gradual awareness of a shaping of fresh musical taste and thinking. It was then I sensed the first time freedom and directness in musical expression including the Tradition of the New." [...] This fresh zeitgeist, as perceived by Yannay, signaled a need to move beyond [...] "International Style" [...] in composition and transition to an individualized approach in creating every single new work. Similar transformations {{have taken place in}} other composers’ stylistic turns as this new phase in modernism came to be prefixed by [...] "post".The carryover into this maturing phase of his oeuvre is the continuing exploration and realization of new challenges in terms of subject matter and media, extended and invented vocal and instrumental techniques, and required virtuosity and perseverance from performers. In fact, virtually all works have been tied to fortuitous encounters with extremely capable and enterprising performers who welcomed the challenges the composer presented in his new works. In 1982 Yannay received a Fulbright guest professorship in Stuttgart and returned to Europe after a hiatus of 31 years. Germany was already in a high-gear phase of <b>stock-taking</b> of its dim National Socialist past. Yannay’s deeply felt response was a series of works under the title European Trilogy that included Im Silberwald for trombone, glass harmonica and tape (1983), Celan Ensembles for tenor and instruments (1986), vocal and instrumental pieces, the electronic theater piece In Madness There is Order (1988) and the music film Jidyll (1990). The trombone solo piece, along with the choral Le campane di Leopardi (1979) use a fixed drone of tuned glasses and electronics, diatonic and just-intonation proportions to a central note that extends the entire work. As the first non-German composer who delved into the complex poetry of Paul Celan, a Holocaust survivor, in its original language, Yannay collaged his texts from different poems and wedded it to the non-sequitur texts and the persona of Antonin Artaud. Both endured madness and a tragic end in Paris.|$|E
5000|$|Parsons met Alfred Schutz (or Schütz) {{during the}} {{rationality}} seminar, which he conducted, together with Schumpeter, at Harvard {{in the spring}} of 1940. Schutz has been close to Edmund Husserl and was deeply embedded in his phenomenological philosophy. Schutz was born in Vienna but moved to the US in 1939, and for years, he worked on the project of developing a phenomenological sociology, primarily based on an attempt to find some point between Husserl's method and Weber's sociology. Parsons had asked Schutz to give a presentation at the rationality seminar, which he did on April 13, 1940, and Parsons and Schutz had lunched together afterward. Schutz was fascinated with Parsons' theory, which he regarded as the state-of-the-art social theory, and wrote an evaluation of Parsons' theory that he kindly asked Parsons to comment. That led to a short but intensive correspondence, which generally revealed that the gap between Schutz's sociologized phenomenology and Parsons concept of voluntaristic action was far too great. From Parsons' point of view, Schutz's position was too speculative and subjectivist that tended to reduce social processes to the articulation of a Lebenswelt consciousness. For Parsons, the defining edge of human life was action as a catalyst for historical change, and it was essential for sociology, as a science, to pay strong attention to the subjective element of action, but it should never become completely absorbed in it since the purpose of a science was to explain causal relationships, by covering laws or by other types of explanatory devices. Schutz's basic argument was that sociology cannot ground itself and that epistemology was not a luxury but a necessity for the social scientist. Parsons agreed but stressed the pragmatic need to demarcate science and philosophy and insisted moreover that the grounding of a conceptual scheme for empirical theory construction cannot aim at absolute solutions but need to take a sensible <b>stock-taking</b> of the epistemological balance at each point in time. However, the two men shared many basic assumptions about the nature of social theory, which has kept the debate simmering ever since. By request from Ilse Schutz, after her husband's death, Parsons gave, on July 23, 1971, permission to publish the correspondence between him and Schutz. Parsons also wrote [...] "A 1974 Retrospective Perspective" [...] to the correspondence, which characterized his position as a [...] "Kantian point of view" [...] and found that Schutz's strong dependence on Husserl's [...] "phenomenological reduction" [...] would make it very difficult to reach the kind of [...] "conceptual scheme," [...] which Parsons found essential for theory-building in social sciences.|$|E
