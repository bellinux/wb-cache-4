40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: <b>Sheet</b> metal <b>extrusion</b> is {{a process}} in which the punch penetrates one surface of the sheet metal {{material}} to cause it to extrude and flow toward the outlet of the die. Therefore, the process can invent different thickness of sheet metal work piece. From these advantages on the <b>sheet</b> metal <b>extrusion,</b> nowadays, it is generally used in many manufacturing of industrial elements fields. The <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Extrusions</b> in Fine Blanking (SME-FB) advantages, over a conventional extrusion, are possible due to a blank holder force, a counterpunch force and a large die radius. However, the selection on those parameter values affects on the material flow and the surface quality on the extrusion parts also. Namely, it causes the crack surface and shrinkage failure which are the general problems in the SME-FB. Approach: Objective of this research was to study the effect of die radius on the SME-FB surface which investigated the formation of the failure defection with respect to the several die radiuses by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Results: From the results, it indicated that applying the small die radius caused the material flow difficult resulting in the decreasing of smooth surface.

50|$|Melt {{filtration}} {{is typically}} used to remove contaminants from polymer melts during the extrusion process. There is a mechanical {{separation of the}} contaminants within a machine called a ‘screen changer’. A typical system will consist of a steel housing with the filtration medium contained in moveable pistons or slide plates that enable the processor to remove the screens from the extruder flow without stopping production. The contaminants are usually collected on woven wire screens which are supported on a stainless steel plate called a ‘breaker plate’ -- a strong circular piece of steel drilled with large holes to allow {{the flow of the}} polymer melt. For the recycling of polyester it is typical to integrate a screen changer into the extrusion line. This can be in a pelletizing, <b>sheet</b> <b>extrusion</b> or strapping tape extrusion line.|$|E

5000|$|Sheet/film {{extrusion}} is used {{to extrude}} plastic sheets or films that are too thick to be blown. There {{are two types of}} dies used: T-shaped and coat hanger. The purpose of these dies is to reorient and guide the flow of polymer melt from a single round output from the extruder to a thin, flat planar flow. In both die types ensure constant, uniform flow across the entire cross sectional area of the die. Cooling is typically by pulling through a set of cooling rolls (calender or [...] "chill" [...] rolls). In <b>sheet</b> <b>extrusion,</b> these rolls not only deliver the necessary cooling but also determine sheet thickness and surface texture. [...] Often co-extrusion {{is used to}} apply one or more layers on top of a base material to obtain specific properties such as UV-absorption, texture, oxygen permeation resistance, or energy reflection.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike in blown film, pipe, and <b>sheet</b> <b>{{extrusion}},</b> {{the dies}} used in profile extrusion are rarely round or completely flat. Whereas a round (or flat) profile has uniform flow rates along all edges, {{this is not}} the case for more complex shapes. Take, for instance, the example of a simple, solid, square profile. The velocity of the melt is highest at the center of the die, and slowest at the edges and corners due to friction between the melt and die walls. When moving from the center of the die to the midpoint of one of the edges, the velocity gradient is high, especially near the outer die wall. However, when moving from the center to one of the corners, the velocity gradient is more gradual. As a result, the extruded square profile will experience more die swell at the edges than the corners, causing the once square profile to become more circular. This can be compensated for by bowing in the sides of the die so it approximates the shape of a four-pointed star; the sides of the polymer melt will now swell to the intended dimensions.|$|E

Modification of PLA by fillers has been widely carried out to obtain desired properties for various applications. This research aims to investigate the effect of micro-/nano-particle size of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) on thermal stability and melt rheology behavior of PLA <b>extrusion</b> <b>sheet.</b> PLA pellets were compounded with CaCO 3 particles by a twin-screw extruder, and fabricated by a cast flat sheet process to produce CaCO 3 -PLA <b>extrusion</b> <b>sheets.</b> Fatty acid treated on CaCO 3 surface showed profound impact on thermal stability of CaCO 3 -PLA <b>extrusion</b> <b>sheets</b> as identified by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA).

50|$|There are {{two methods}} to {{manufacture}} faceshields, extrusion and injection molding. Faceshields cut from <b>extrusion</b> <b>sheets</b> provide better impact resistance than injection molding faceshields because <b>extrusion</b> <b>sheets</b> {{are made of}} high molecular weight plastic pellets while injection molding must use lower molecular weight plastic pellets, which provide better melt flowing property needed by injection molding. For example, even 0.8 mm thickness faceshields made of <b>extrusion</b> polycarbonate <b>sheets</b> can withstand {{the impact of a}} 6 mm nominal diameter steel ball traveling at the speed 120 m/s (European standard, protection against high-speed particles - medium energy impact), while injection molding faceshields must have at least 1.5 mm thickness to withstand the same impact. However, injection molding can provide more complicated shape than extrusion.|$|R

40|$|Initial work {{presented}} in this dissertation on extrusion supports the findings of others with regard to standard die extrusion. In addition, comparisons between ram and screw extrusion results were made and are briefly discussed. In relation to wide <b>sheet</b> <b>extrusion,</b> unusual flow instabilities {{in the form of}} central line splitting of the extrudates were observed for the first time, indicating that the chocolate was weak in tension. Solutions for eliminating for flow defects are also presented and mathematical modelling provided insight into the flow mechanism. Post extrusion mechanical characterisation of the extruded chocolate was carried out by means of bending and indentation tests and the effect of processing conditions on the flexibility and hardness of chocolate extrudate was examined. The results showed the presence of a two-stage, post extrusion rehardening process, which was consistent with earlier findings. In terms of stamping, the process itself and the effect of processing variables on the shape formability and surface gloss formation in the chocolate product were established for the first time. Optimal conditions that contributed to the formation of well-defined products with high gloss finish were identified. Product demoulding was also found to be facilitated {{with the use of a}} Teflon die. Both the wide <b>sheet</b> <b>extrusion</b> and the stamping process were simulated by numerical models using the finite element codes Forge 3 ® and 2 ® respectively. In general, good agreement was achieved between the experimental and numerical results.

40|$|<b>Sheet</b> metal <b>extrusion</b> is a {{metal forming}} {{process in which}} the {{movement}} of a punch penetrates a sheet metal surface and it flows through a die orifice; the extruded parts can be deflected to have an extrusion cavity and protrusion on the opposite side. Therefore, this process results in a narrow region of highly localized plastic deformation due to the formation and microstructure effect on the work piece. This research investigated the characteristics of the material-flow behavior during the formation and its effect on the microstructure of the extruded sheet metal using the finite element method (FEM). The actual parts and FEM simulation model were developed using a blank material made from AISI- 1045 steel with a thickness of 5 [*]mm; the material’s behavior was determined subject to the punch penetration depths of 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, and 80 % of the sheet thickness. The results indicated the formation and microstructure effects on the <b>sheet</b> metal <b>extrusion</b> parts and defects. Namely, when increasing penetration, narrowing the die orifice the material flows through, the material was formed by extruding, and defects were visibility, and the microstructure of the material’s grains’ size was flat and very fine. Extrusion defects were not found in the control material flow. The region of highly localized plastic deformation affected the material gain and mechanical properties. The FEM simulation results agreed with the experimental results. Moreover, FEM could be investigated as a tool to decrease the cost and time in trial and error procedures...|$|R

Two kinds of pure aluminum sheets of 2 mm thick were applied and a boss of 1 mm in diameter was formed on the sheet. In the case without a blank holder, increase in a punch/die diameter ratio caused local thickening around the boss and the boss height became lower than that expected.

40|$|Two {{types of}} polylactic acid (PLA) films (one {{amorphous}} and one semi-crystalline) were produced by <b>sheet</b> <b>extrusion.</b> Talc {{was used as}} a nucleation agent for the semi-crystalline PLA. The films were annealed above their T-g or were uniaxially orientated in two ways: (1) via a drawing system in front of the extruder and die or (2) via a three-roller stretching system. The slower crystallization rate and lower melting stress of the PLA resulted in amorphous film using the drawing system. Annealing above T-g increased crystallinity and polymer chain relaxation, which resulted in increases in both strength and toughness. Stretching above T-g also produced simultaneous crystallization and chain relaxation, which resulted in increases in both modulus and toughness.

Evidence for the formation of hydroperoxides and carbonyl groups, the occurrence of chain scission, and the loss of mechanical properties was achieved, being greater for samples with benzophenone. It was also observed that for the same ketone level, benzophenone caused greater changes in the mechanical properties, and this was in agreement with the decrease in the molecular weight observed.
