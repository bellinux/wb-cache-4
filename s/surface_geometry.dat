The first phase is when the abrasive first contacts the workpiece surface: dull grains of the abrasive fracture and fall away leaving a new sharp cutting surface. In the second phase the abrasive [...] "self dresses" [...] while most of the stock is being removed. Finally, the abrasive grains become dull as they work which improves the <b>surface</b> <b>geometry.</b>|$|E

40|$|Plume {{dispersion}} of hazardous materials within urban area resulting from accidental or intentional releases {{is of great}} concern to public health. Many researchers have developed local-scale atmospheric dispersion models using building-resolving computational fluid dynamics.

40|$|The {{internal}} corrosion {{of carbon}} steel pipelines by carbonic acid is commonly controlled using film forming corrosion inhibitors. Generic filming forming corrosion inhibitors are surfactant molecules that adsorb at the corroding steel surface {{to form a}} barrier against the corrosive aqueous components.
