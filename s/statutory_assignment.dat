40|$|Assessment of {{citizenship}} competences has become common practice following the <b>statutory</b> <b>assignment</b> {{of citizenship}} education to schools in many countries. Assessment can serve various goals. The suitability {{of various types}} of instruments depends on the alignment with the goals intended. In this paper we evaluate four types of instruments and their suitability to assess citizenship competences. Tests and questionnaires, portfolios, game-based assessment, and vignettes are each evaluated in terms of seven attributes relevant to instruments aiming to assess students’ citizenship competences. Our results indicate no single type of instrument aligns with all attributes, and expanding the range of available instruments appears the best way forward so that educators and researchers can make a choice that fits their purpose. The analysis presented provides further insight into {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of particular assessment types...|$|E
40|$|Mr Trukhtanov {{has made}} his own summary of and {{response}} to my own account of equitable (and <b>statutory)</b> <b>assignment,</b> and how notice of assignment operates within them. Having been reminded of how the cases on the topic are usually understood, readers {{will have to make}} up their own minds. While there is, always, room for further thought, {{it is important not to}} lose sight of two fairly important distinctions. Where A is the debtor, B is the creditor, and C is an assignee to whom B has assigned the chose in action arising from A’s debt obligation, a distinction should be drawn between: the question to whom the debtor is liable; and what the debtor is obliged to do to be discharged from that debt obligation. A distinction should also be drawn between cases where A has paid B in satisfaction of the contractual promise (thus discharging the contractual obligation by precise performance) and cases where A has not...|$|E
40|$|Notice {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the equitable assignment of legal choses in action, such as a contractual debt. As noted in a recent treatise, once the debtor is given notice of the equitable assignment: (i) should she pay the sum owed to her creditor, she is not discharged from her obligation but will have to make payment again to the assignee [the 2 ̆ 7 no discharge after notice 2 ̆ 7 rule]; (ii) the assignee’s right against the debtor has priority against subsequent assignments by the assignor, in order of precedence of notice [the rule as to priorities]; and (iii) the debtor is no longer entitled to assert such equities as may arise between herself and the creditor postnotice to reduce her liability to the assignee by way of setoff [the rule as to equities]. Leaving aside discussion of the second and third of these rules for another day, this paper will focus on an examination of the 2 ̆ 7 no discharge after notice 2 ̆ 7 rule. This is prompted because the rule as applied in the context of equitable assignment of a debt presents a contradiction: it does not explain how it is that the common law rules as to discharge by precise performance and the invariability of contractual obligations are displaced by what appear to be equitable doctrines relating to assignment and notice thereof. By examining the mechanics and subject matter of an equitable assignment of a chose in action, this paper will demonstrate that the rule may, perhaps, have been too broadly stated and that the true position is quite otherwise: that a debtor is discharged from her obligation to make payment so long as she precisely performs her obligations as set out in the contract, even if the rights under that contract have been assigned to a third party to that contract, the equitable assignee, and even if she has been notified of such assignment. The paper will then examine whether the same may be true in the case of a <b>statutory</b> <b>assignment...</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} requirements that exist for an equitable assignment of property, outside the 'standard' clear and unconditional intention to assign. These requirements are fundamental {{characteristics of a}} <b>statutory</b> assignment: Absolute <b>assignment</b> (an unconditional transfer: conditions precedent or part of a debt are not absolute) and the assignment must {{be made in writing}} and signed by the assignor, and in particular, this applies to real property.|$|R
40|$|In Finland the Regional Fire and Rescue Services (RFRS) are {{responsible}} for near shore oil spill response and shoreline cleanup operations. In addition, they assist in other types of maritime incidents, such as search and rescue operations and fire-fighting on board. These <b>statutory</b> <b>assignments</b> require the RFRS to have capability to act both on land and at sea. As maritime incidents occur infrequently, little routine has been established. In order to improve their performance in maritime operations, the RFRS are participating in a new oil spill training programme to be launched by South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences. This training programme aims to utilize new educational methods; e-learning and simulator based training. In addition to fully exploiting the existing navigational bridge simulator, radio communication simulator and crisis management simulator, an entirely new simulator is developed. This simulator is designed to model the oil recovery process; recovery method, rate and volume in various conditions with different oil types. New simulator enables creation of a comprehensive training programme covering training tasks from a distress call to the completion of an oil spill response operation. Structure of the training programme, {{as well as the}} training objectives, are based on the findings from competence and education surveys conducted in spring 2016. In these results, a need for vessel maneuvering and navigation exercises together with actual response measures training were emphasized. Also additional training for maritime radio communication, GMDSS-emergency protocols and collaboration with maritime authorities were seemed important. This paper describes new approach to the maritime operations training designed for rescue authorities, a way of learning by doing, without mobilising the vessels at sea...|$|R
40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the principles and}} practice of real estate mortgages in an easily accessible text referenced to all the Australian States. It specifically deals with the major theoretical and practical aspects of the land mortgage including vitiating factors in formation, mortgagees powers and duties and mortgagors’ rights both <b>statutory</b> and other, <b>assignment,</b> insurance and discharge. As a successor to Mortgages Law in Australia, this book adopts an exclusive focus on real estate mortgages in Australia and provides a thorough account of the law through analysis of the plethora of court decisions and statutory provisions in this area. Duncan and Dixon analyse {{the substance of the}} mortgage transaction from creation through to rights of enforcement. This analysis includes detailed consideration of the rights and obligations of both mortgagors and mortgagees covering topics such as priorities and tacking, insurance, variation and assignment, rights of discharge, entry into possession, foreclosure and power of sale. In addition, the book contains a separate chapter on factors that may affect the validity and enforcement of a mortgage together with separate consideration of a mortgagee’s right to enforce a guarantee provided on behalf of a mortgagor and the rights and liabilities associated with a receivership regime initiated by a mortgagee. Written for the national market, the book {{is one of the few}} substantial works on this subject for practitioners throughout Australia. It is a very accessible text which enables readers to decide whether or not they have a problem and provides primary guidance to its solution. The book has been deliberately, heavily referenced to incorporate statutory references from across Australia and contains extensive case analysis in order to satisfy both these objectives...|$|R
