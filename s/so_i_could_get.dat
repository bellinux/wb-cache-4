500|$|Originally {{released}} on the independent label Republic Records, One Fierce Beer Coaster was later {{picked up by}} Geffen Records two months after its release due to word-of-mouth popularity. The album has received mixed to moderately favorable reviews. Three singles were released from the album including [...] "Fire Water Burn", [...] "I Wish I Was Queer <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Get</b> Chicks" [...] and [...] "Why's Everybody Always Pickin' On Me?". The first single, [...] "Fire Water Burn", was a modern rock hit, charting on seven different international charts.|$|E
500|$|The album's best-known single, [...] "Fire Water Burn", is a {{diatribe}} {{against a}} white boy who attempts, and fails, {{to act like}} a black thug. [...] "I Wish I Was Queer <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Get</b> Chicks" [...] is satirical song about the belief that girls only like gay men, playing on the stereotype that gay men are often better looking and more sensitive than straight men. [...] "Why's Everybody Always Pickin' On Me?" [...] is mainly about how Jimmy Pop was constantly picked on in high school and has since developed extreme katagelophobia, an intense fear of being ridiculed.|$|E
500|$|Åkerman {{attended}} {{many different}} schools, including Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School in St. Catharines, Ontario.

She has recalled some portions of her childhood as [...] "painful", explaining that [...] "I loved my father very much and I only got to see him during the school holidays. But I {{think it was an}} advantage that they split up when I was very young, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> used to it." [...] She visited her father in Falsterbo, Sweden, during school breaks and talked to him regularly over the phone. She cites her parents as [...] "supportive, positive influences" [...] in her life.|$|E

2500|$|In Paris {{friends and}} acquaintances sent {{bouquets}} of flowers weekly for his still life paintings. He also purchased bouquets inexpensively, choosing a variety of flowers and colors for his paintings. [...] In {{a letter to his}} sister Wil he said, [...] "Last year I painted almost nothing but flowers <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> used to colors other than grey - pink, soft or bright green, light blue, violet, yellow, glorious red." [...] That was an exaggeration, as during his time in Paris he painted 230 paintings, about 30 of which were flowers. Yet, the comment demonstrates his interest in painting flowers as a subject and to further develop his appreciation and understanding of color.|$|E
2500|$|Van Gogh {{carefully}} {{studied the}} art of floral arranging, the works of Dutch masters, Japanese woodcut prints and Impressionist still life arrangements to master his paintings of flowers. Expressing his enthusiasm for the subject {{and the number of}} paintings he completed in Paris, Van Gogh wrote to his sister Wil, [...] "I painted almost nothing but flowers <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> used to colors other than grey - pink, soft or bright green, light blue, violet, yellow, glorious red." [...] His expertise in color, composition, texture and placement may have made an impression on Constance Spry, a noted floral arranger who created guidelines for flower arranging as an art form. [...] She learned a great deal about [...] "structure, style, form, balance, harmony and rhythm" [...] from studying the paintings by great masters of flowers.|$|E
2500|$|He {{has used}} Fender Stratocaster guitars almost exclusively. His black 1957/63 (the body {{is from a}} '63; the neck from a '57) Stratocaster, {{previously}} owned by late Free guitarist Paul Kossoff, was used circa 1978–1990. It {{was used as a}} template by Fender to manufacture an Artist Signature model in 2009. The original now resides at his mother's home. [...] "I bought it in 1976," [...] he said. [...] "I saw it advertised in Melody Maker… I got the serial number to check it was [...] guitar. It cost quite a bit of money but I didn't care. I just sold everything I had <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> it, and I used it from then on. It just felt like I was holding a piece of magic because he had used this guitar." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the trial}} in November 1929, Shuler's lawyer cross-examined Cryer about {{allegations}} that he [...] "pitched dice at in Farmer Page's place," [...] and about his accumulation of wealth during his eight years as mayor. [...] Cryer testified {{that he had a}} personal fortune of $160,000 when he took office in 1921 and left office in 1929 with a personal wealth of $450,000 which Cryer credited to [...] "realty deals absolutely uninfluenced by his political position." [...] Asked if he had ever taken a bribe, Cryer replied: [...] "No, sir; never at any time, directly or indirectly. [...] I never profited by my office. [...] In fact, I considered it a financial detriment. [...] It was the darndest job I ever had. [...] It took practically all of my time, Sundays and every other day, and most of the night. [...] I had to take the telephone out of my house <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a little sleep. [...] I used to come home at nights from a banquet or something and people would call me sometimes at 3 o'clock in the morning -- some of them apparently insane." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His Majesty's delicacy. They {{told me to}} be {{sure and}} back out from the presence, and find the door-knob as best I could; it was not {{allowable}} to face around. Now the Emperor {{knew it would be}} a difficult ordeal for me, because of lack of practice; and so, {{when it was time to}} part, he turned, with exceeding delicacy, and pretended to fumble with things on his desk, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> out in my own way, without his seeing me." ...|$|E
60|$|We went on fishing. Sailfish {{would jump}} around {{us for a}} while and then they would stop. We would not see one for several minutes. It is always very {{exciting}} to be among them this way. Presently I had one take hold to run off slowly and steadily, and I let him go for fifty feet, and when I struck I tore the hook away from him. Quickly I let slack line run back to him ten or fifteen feet at a time, until I felt him take it once more. He took it rather suspiciously, I felt, and I honestly believe that I could tell that he was mouthing or chewing the bait, which made me careful to let the line run off easily to him. Suddenly he rushed off, making the reel smoke. I let him run one hundred and fifty feet and then stood up, throwing on the drag, and when the line straightened tight I tried to jerk at him as hard as the tackle would stand. As a matter of fact, however, he was going so fast and hard that he hooked himself. It is indeed seldom that I miss one when he runs like this. This fellow came up two hundred yards from the boat and slid along the water with half of his body raised, much like one of those coasting-boards I have seen bathers use, towed behind a motor-launch. He went down and came up in a magnificent sheer leap, with his broad sail shining in the sun. Very angry he was, and he reminded me of a Marlin swordfish. Next he went down, and came up again bent in a curve, with the big sail stretched again. He skittered over the water, going down and coming up, until he had leaped seven times. This was a big, heavy fish, and on the light six-ounce tip and nine-thread line I had my work cut out for me. We had to run the boat toward him <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> back my line. Here was the advantage of having a fast boat with a big rudder. Otherwise I would have lost my fish. After some steady deep plugging he came up again and set my heart aflutter by a long surface play in which he took off one hundred yards of line and then turned, leaping straight for the boat. Fortunately the line was slack and I could throw off the drag and let him run. Slack line never bothers me when I really get one of these fish well hooked. If he is not well hooked he is going to get away, anyhow. After that he went down into deep water and I had one long hour of hard work in bringing him to the boat. Six hours later he weighed fifty-eight and a half pounds, and as he had lost a good deal of blood and dried out considerably, he would have gone over sixty pounds, which, so far, is the largest sailfish I know of caught on light tackle.|$|E

5000|$|Cherobon {{graduated}} from Harding in 2005 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree {{in health care}} management and nursing. [...] Of her college experience, Cherobon later remarked: [...] "I don't think I ever really became interested running. I ran to get a scholarship <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> my education. My goal was to come here, {{learn as much as}} I can, and then go back.

6000|$|... "They considered," [...] said Putney, who had {{completed}} the affair {{on the part of}} Suzette, and was afterwards talking it over with his crony, Dr. Morrell, in something of the bitterness of defeat, [...] "that their first duty was to care for the interests of their stockholders, who seemed to turn out all widows and orphans, as nearly as I could understand. It appears as if nobody but innocents of that kind live on the Ponkwasset dividends, {{and it would have been}} inhuman not to look after their interests. Well," [...] he went on, breaking from this grievance, [...] "there's this satisfactory thing about it; somebody has done something at last that he intended to do; and, of course, the he in question is a she. 'She that was' Miss Suzette is the only person connected with the whole affair, that's had her way. Everybody else's way has come to nothing, beginning with my own. I can look back to the time when I meant to have the late J. Milton Northwick's blood; I was lying low for years, waiting for him to do just what he did do at last, and I expected somehow, by the blessing of God, to help run him down, or bring him to justice, as we say. The first thing I knew, I turned up his daughter's counsel, and was devoting myself to the interests of a pair of grass-orphans with the high and holy zeal of a Board of Directors. All I wanted was to have J. Milton brought to trial, not so I could help send him to State's prison with a band of music, but <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> him off on the plea of insanity. But I wasn't allowed to have my way, even in a little thing like that; and of all the things that were planned for and against, and round about Northwick, just one has been accomplished. The directors failed to be in at the death; and old Hilary has had to resign from the Board, and pay the defaulter's debts. Pinney, I understand, considers himself a ruined man; he's left off detecting for a living, and gone back to interviewing. Poor old Adeline lived in the pious hope of making Northwick's old age comfortable in their beautiful home on the money he had stolen; and now that she's dead it goes to his creditors. Why, even Billy Gerrish, a high-minded, public-spirited man like William B. Gerrish,--couldn't have his way about Northwick. No, sir; Northwick himself couldn't! Look how he fooled away his time there in Canada, after he got off with money enough to start him on the high road to fortune again. He couldn't budge of his own motion; and the only thing he really tried to do he failed in disgracefully. Adeline wouldn't let him stay when he come back to buy himself off; and that killed her. Then, when he started home again, to take his punishment, the first thing he did was to drop dead. Justice herself couldn't have her way with Northwick. But I'm not sorry he slipped through her fingers. There wasn't the stuff for an example in Northwick; I don't know that he's much of a warning. He just seems to be a kind of--incident; and a pretty common kind. He was a mere creature of circumstances--like the rest of us! His environment made him rich, and his environment made him a rogue. Sometimes I think there was nothing to Northwick, except what happened to him. He's a puzzle. But what do you say, Doc, to a world where we fellows keep fuming and fizzing away, with our little aims and purposes, and the great ball of life seems to roll calmly along, and get where it's going without the slightest reference to what we do or don't do? I suppose it's wicked to be a fatalist, but I'll go a few æons of eternal punishment more, and keep my private opinion that it's all Fate." ...|$|E
