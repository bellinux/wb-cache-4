25|$|The {{reason for}} the anomaly is disputed. A widely {{accepted}} view, but not the official view, states that the road was set out by two surveyors, one moving north and the other moving south, each of whom set out {{the road to the}} right of their <b>survey</b> <b>line.</b> Another widely held belief is that the change of course was designed to protect a large tree which formerly stood at the site where the kink is. However, why during the development of a milling area a single tree would be protected, and why the road would not return to its original line after passing the tree are both unexplained by this theory.|$|E
500|$|The colony's {{boundaries}} expanded somewhat during Endecott's tenure, {{mainly in}} the 1650s. In addition to formally claiming present-day Stonington, Connecticut as spoils from the Pequot War, Endecott sought to establish the colony's northern boundary. In 1652 he sent a commission with surveyors to locate the most northerly point on the Merrimack River, since the colonial grant defined its northern border as [...] north of that river. These surveyors were led by Indian guides to the outlet of Lake Winnipesaukee which was claimed by the guides {{to be the source}} of the Merrimack. At that location, the party incised an inscription on a rock that survives, and is now located in a small New Hampshire state park. When this <b>survey</b> <b>line</b> was extended eastward, the boundary was determined to fall on the coast at Casco Bay, and the colony thus claimed most of what is now southern Maine and New Hampshire.|$|E
500|$|The modern {{monitoring}} system on Mauna Loa is constituted {{not only by}} its locally seismic network but also {{of a large number}} of GPS stations, tiltmeters, and strainmeters that have been anchored on the volcano to monitor ground deformation due to swelling in Mauna Loa's subterranean magma chamber, which presents a more complete picture of the events proceeding eruptive activity. The GPS network is the most durable and wide-ranging of the three systems, while the tiltmeters provide the most sensitive predictive data, but are prone to erroneous results unrelated to actual ground deformation; nonetheless a <b>survey</b> <b>line</b> across the caldera measured a [...] increase in its width over the year preceding the 1975 eruption, and a similar increase in 1984 eruption. Strainmeters, by contrast, are relatively rare. The Observatory also maintains two gas detectors at Mokuʻāweoweo, Mauna Loa's summit caldera, as well as a publicly accessible [...] and occasional screenings by interferometric synthetic aperture radar imaging.|$|E

40|$|Terrain {{conductivity}} (EM- 31) {{measurements are}} made by inducing an electromagnetic current into the ground from a transmitter coil, and recording the resulting secondary electromagnetic field at a receiver coil a fixed distance away. The strength of the secondary field depends upon the conductivity of materials in the ground. Measurements are recorded in units of conductivity called milli-Siemens per meter (mS/m). Terrain conductivity may be affected {{by a number of}} factors including moisture content, mineralogy, and soil thickness. The conductivity of groundwater, however, is the primary factor. Large increases in conductivity may be due to increased ion concentration (total dissolved solids) in the groundwater. In addition to conductivity readings, measurements of the inphase component of the electromagnetic field are recorded. The inphase measurement is sensitive to the presence of metallic conductors and this measurement is used for metal detection. Abrupt negative spikes in the inphase and conductivity measurements are indicative of metallic conductors A Geonics EM- 31 terrain conductivity meter will be used for this survey. The EM- 31 is a one-person device containing both transmitter and receiver coils on a 3. 7 -meter frame. Effective exploration depth for this instrument is about 18 feet.
