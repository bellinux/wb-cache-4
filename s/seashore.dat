5|$|County Route 626 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Beach Avenue (County Route 604) {{in the city}} of Cape May. The route heads northward on Broadway through the residential portions of Cape May, reaching an intersection with Sunset Boulevard (County Route 606) and West Perry Street (County Route 633). County Route 626 continues for several blocks before curving to the northwest into West Cape May. The route heads northward, passing into a commercial district along Broadway, turning to the northeast. Route 626 leaves West Cape May and switches names to <b>Seashore</b> Road through rural Cape May. The route passes several large farms before intersecting with Bridge Road and <b>Seashore</b> Road (County Route 641). At this intersection, the state takes over maintenance as State Route 162.|$|E
5|$|Route S4C was {{designated}} by the New Jersey Legislature in 1929 as a spur of Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9), beginning at Bennett and running south on <b>Seashore</b> Road and Broadway, past Sunset Boulevard to the Delaware Bay. Route S4C was never {{taken over by the}} state. However, when the United States Army Corps of Engineers built the Cape May Canal during World War II, <b>Seashore</b> Road was chosen as one of two roads to cross the canal. (The other was Route 4, now Route 109). The Army Corps built a low level bridge close to the pre-canal alignment. The New Jersey Department of Transportation built a higher bridge in 1971 on a new alignment.|$|E

5|$|In Washington, sea otters {{are found}} almost {{exclusively}} on the outer coasts. They can swim as close as six feet off shore along the Olympic coast. Reported sightings of sea otters in the San Juan Islands and Puget Sound almost always {{turn out to be}} North American river otters, which are commonly seen along the <b>seashore.</b> However, biologists have confirmed isolated sightings of sea otters in these areas since the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|Most ferugliotheriids {{come from}} the Late Cretaceous epoch (Campanian–Maastrichtian ages, 84–66 million years ago, or mya) of Argentina, where they may have lived in a marshy or <b>seashore</b> environment.

5|$|The katipo is {{restricted}} to a highly specialised habitat and is only found near the <b>seashore</b> living among sand dunes. They generally reside on the landward side of dunes closest to the coast where they are most sheltered from storms and sand movement.

5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland was {{subjected}} to glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch.

5|$|After construction, {{the station}} {{served as the}} PRR's sole Philadelphia stop for most long-distance east-west Main Line traffic to avoid a reverse move into Broad Street Station (and later 30th Street Station). It also served local trains from Fort Washington, Chestnut Hill, Bustleton, and Trenton, {{as well as a}} variety of {{services}} from the PRR-owned West Jersey and <b>Seashore</b> Railroad system. Within a decade of completion, the station was already overcrowded. On June 22, 1912, the PRR signed a million-dollar contract for massive renovations to the station. Designed by PRR architect William H. Cookman, the modifications reflected the latest in passenger station design.|$|E
5|$|At the {{intersection}} with <b>Seashore</b> Road (County Route 603), {{the designation of}} Route 626 picks up again, following <b>Seashore</b> Road northward through rural Cape May County. The route leaves the rural area, intersecting with U.S. Route 9 (Sandman Boulevard), where the commercial district picks up. County Route 626 heads northward through the short district, entering an area of residences and intersecting with Academy Road (County Route 639). The route passes a large field with one large red barn before turning northeastward past more residences. County Route 626 parallels U.S. Route 9 for a distance, intersecting with the Bennetts Crossing, which connects the two roads. The highway continues northeastward through Cape May County, intersecting with Tabernacle Road (County Route 647). County Route 626 continues through the residential districts in Lower Township, paralleling U.S. Route 9 and a local railroad for some distance. The highway intersects with the Old Stage Road, a dead-end stagecoach road, heading through a short rural area {{before returning to the}} residential districts. The highway continues northward, switch names to South Railroad Avenue and into the community of Rio Grande. County Route 626 becomes a divided highway before reaching an intersection with New Jersey Route 47, where county maintenance ends completely. North Railroad Avenue continues locally along the right-of-way.|$|E

5|$|August 30, 1999– Hurricane Dennis {{parallels}} the state offshore, and {{five days later}} it executes a loop and makes landfall along Cape Lookout National <b>Seashore</b> as a strong tropical storm. The hurricane drops heavy rainfall peaking at 19.9inches (506mm) in Ocracoke, while its extended duration offshore causes localized severe beach erosion. The rainfall causes flooding along several rivers, which {{is compounded by the}} effects of Hurricane Floyd just weeks later. Damage in the state amounts to over $50million.|$|E
5|$|Despite Tropical Storm Warnings, 3,500tourists {{remained}} on the Outer Banks, though many planned to leave if Alex were to track closer or become stronger. No evacuations were ordered. Officials recommended residents to take precautions for the approaching hurricane. The National Weather Service in Morehead City issued a flash flood watch a day before the hurricane moved past the Outer Banks. The service also issued flash flooding warnings for Craven and Carteret Counties {{on the day of}} the hurricane's closest approach. In preparation for the hurricane, the Cape Lookout National <b>Seashore</b> was closed and evacuated. The National Park Service also closed Cape Point Campground.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, a {{route from}} the Delaware Bay {{just short of}} Sunset Boulevard (the former Cape Island Turnpike) northward to U.S. Route 9 at Bennett Station via Broadway and <b>Seashore</b> Road was {{designated}} {{in the state legislature}} as State Highway Route S4C. The route was designated along County Route 626's length along with County Route 604 as a county-maintained highway, remaining the same until January 1, 1953. On that day, State Highway Route S4C was decommissioned during the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. No number was designated to replace the highway's former number.|$|E
