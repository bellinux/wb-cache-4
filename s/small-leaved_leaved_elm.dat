50|$|In {{addition}} to his achievements in the business world, Mabry wrote eighteen books, among them collections of poetry and sayings. His first book, Maybryana, was a cinquain-centric book of poetry. It was followed the next year by Maybryettes, a sequel. Further titles included <b>Elm</b> <b>Leaves,</b> <b>Elm</b> <b>Leaves</b> Keep Falling, Sail On! and The Velvet Touch. All 18 {{were published in the}} United States by Pond-Ekberg.|$|R

The rocks {{on top of}} the graves were created by Jan (c. 1480) at the order of Ştefan cel Mare, [...] "in a style that is different by principle from the oriental decorative sculpture" [...] (P. Comarnescu). They are decorated with Byzantine-oriental ornaments like palmata-a stylized palm plant leaf and local motives like leaves of beech, ash tree <b>leaves,</b> <b>elm</b> tree <b>leaves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The elm {{cultivar}} Ulmus ''''Myrtifolia'''' occasionally {{referred to}} as the Myrtle <b>Leaved</b> <b>Elm</b> was identified by Nicholson in Kew Hand-List Trees & Shrubs 2: 135, 1896 but without description. It was later listed as a cultivar by Rehder in 1939, and by Krüssmann in Handbuch der Laubgehölze 2: 540, 1962. The specimen under this name in the Herb. Nicholson at Kew was considered by Melville to be a probable U. minor × Ulmus minor 'Plotii' hybrid.|$|R

5000|$|Bugs then {{offers a}} free shot at himself; fakes an {{elaborate}} death; and plays dead, <b>leaving</b> <b>Elmer</b> miserable with remorse; but survives the shot and sneaks {{up behind the}} despairing Fudd, kicks him in his rear, shoves a cigar into his mouth, and tiptoes away, ballet-style. Finally, the frustrated Elmer walks away sobbing about [...] "wabbits, cawwots, guns", etc. Bugs then begins to play his carrot like a fife, playing the tune The Girl I Left Behind Me, and marches with one stiff leg towards his rabbit hole (recalling The Spirit of '76).|$|R
5000|$|Hazell {{transferred}} to First Division rivals Leicester City in September of the 1983-84 campaign. He helped Gordon Milne's [...] "Foxes" [...] {{to post a}} 15th-place finish in 1984-85, but became plagued by injury problems. He had a brief loan spell at old club Wolves in 1985-86, but could do little to prevent Sammy Chapman's side from slipping into the Fourth Division. He left Filbert Street {{and moved on to}} Second Division side Reading for the 1986-87 season, but made just four league appearances for Ian Branfoot's [...] "Royals", before <b>leaving</b> <b>Elm</b> Park.|$|R

5000|$|Ulmus × diversifolia, {{also known}} as the Diverse <b>Leaved</b> <b>Elm,</b> was {{originally}} described by Melville in 1939 as a new species, U. diversifolia, though he later believed it a natural hybrid of Coritanian elm, Plot elm and Wych elm. He recorded its distribution in Hertfordshire, between Hatfield, Hertford and Watton-at-Stone, and in Suffolk, where it was common along the coastal plain from Ipswich and Felixstowe to Lowestoft and Beccles, occurring inland as far as Diss and Debenham, and probably extending further north into Norfolk and south towards Colchester, Essex. He accordingly referred to it as [...] "the East Anglian elm".|$|R

50|$|Spike and an {{associate}} interrupt Elmer, who’s reading a book: Modern Salesmanship and Big Business. Spike offers to buy 1,000 barrels a day, and gives Elmer $10,000 down payment. Full of the advice from the book, Elmer agrees. Spike says that his partners stay partners {{as long as they}} live, and he <b>leaves.</b> <b>Elmer</b> tells the three workers that they need to increase production, then goes to the State Employment Bureau for 50 more men. After they start work, Jimmy comes in and learns about the contract; he has a meltdown. He puts the $10,000 in his overcoat pocket, which he hangs on the office coat rack, and leaves. Hortense drives up and pretends to twist her ankle, so Elmer must rescue her and carry her to the office.|$|R

5000|$|Later {{a special}} {{delivery}} letter arrives for Elmer, which informs him that Uncle Louie has [...] "kicked the bucket" [...] (died) {{and that he}} now inherits the $3 million. However, {{the amount of the}} various estate taxes, including a $2 million inheritance tax, claims the entirety of the inheritance and <b>leaves</b> <b>Elmer</b> owing Louie's lawyer $1.98. Furious at Bugs' torment and intrusion for all that, Elmer, at his wits' end, is finally free to vent his anger on Bugs and chases him around the house until Bugs escapes out the front door, to which Elmer slams shut. Elmer, briefly relieved that he is finally rid of Bugs, then receives a large Easter egg delivery from a postman. Upon opening it, an impossibly large litter of baby Bugs Bunnies who say 'Eh, what's up Doc?' in unison, begin to leap around the house.|$|R
50|$|After 12 matches of the 2002-03 season, they {{resigned}} from the North West Counties League, and rejoined the Manchester League for 2003-04. They finished fourth in the Manchester League Division One in 2008-09 and had also fielded a team in Division Three. They were forced to <b>leave</b> the <b>Elms</b> Park site {{in the summer of}} 2008 when the local council closed the changing facilities, which were used by various local sports teams.|$|R
60|$|An autumnal feature,--boys {{had swept}} {{together}} the fallen <b>leaves</b> from the <b>elms</b> {{along the street}} in one huge pile, and had made a hollow, nest-shaped, in this pile, in which {{three or four of}} them lay curled, like young birds.|$|R
60|$|Meantime the {{handsome}} {{face of the}} Reverend Edward Fareforth Furlong began to wear a sad and weary look {{that had never been}} seen on it before. He watched the congregation drifting from St. Asaph's to St. Osoph's and was powerless to prevent it. His sadness reached its climax one bright afternoon in the late summer, when he noticed that even his episcopal blackbirds were <b>leaving</b> his <b>elms</b> and moving westward to the spruce trees of the manse.|$|R
50|$|When first created, the {{district}} {{consisted of two}} detached parts separated by the long, narrow tail of Wisbech Municipal Borough.

5000|$|Bugs then {{is seen in}} {{the patio}} area of the {{penthouse}} when Elmer tries to shoot him, but constantly misses. Bugs then asks if Elmer is {{trying to get rid of}} him and, when Elmer says that [...] "rabbits don't belong in penthouses" [...] accuses Elmer of thinking he is [...] "better" [...] than a rabbit and if Elmer can prove that he is better, Bugs will <b>leave.</b> <b>Elmer</b> accepts the challenge and Bugs fashions several contests around the penthouse that Elmer wins, but not before suffering large consequences. The first two events are a strength test and then a shooting test, both of which Bugs loses. He then says that there is one more event, the [...] "jump test". Bugs fails his test, which involves jumping over an outdoor bench, and then sets up the bench for Elmer. However, Bugs positions the bench vertically and near the overlook of the penthouse so that when Elmer jumps over it, he is actually jumping off the edge of the building. Elmer flies over the edge and lands on the ground in a popcorn machine, and Bugs admits that Elmer is [...] "a better man than I am, but only because I'm a rabbit" [...] and then departs down the sidewalk with the flower that Elmer had dug up in the opening scene.|$|R

50|$|Xanthogaleruca luteola is {{a serious}} pest of the elm.

500|$|Upon {{meeting the}} eastern {{terminus}} of Route 48, US 40 {{turns to the}} southeast and becomes the Harding Highway, a two-lane undivided road that passes through more agricultural areas. Upon crossing CR 646, the road enters Pilesgrove Township and continues past the Cowtown Rodeo. The route passes through the residential community of Sharptown before coming to an intersection with Route 45. At this point, US 40 turns to the northeast to run concurrent on Route 45 and enters Woodstown, where it becomes West Avenue and passes residences before reaching the downtown area. Here, Route 45 splits from US 40 by heading north on Main Street and US 40 continues to the east as East Avenue, passing more developed areas. The route crosses from Woodstown into Pilesgrove Township again, where it turns east-southeast as Harding Highway and heads back into a mix of fields and woods amid homes. About [...] after entering Upper Pittsgrove Township, the road crosses CR 581. In the community of Pole Tavern further to the east, US 40 encounters Route 77, CR 604, and CR 635 at the Pole Tavern Circle. Past Pole Tavern, the road passes more farm fields before coming to Elmer, where it becomes Chestnut Street. In Elmer, the route passes homes and makes a turn to the northeast onto Front Street. Upon <b>leaving</b> <b>Elmer,</b> US 40 becomes Harding Highway again and forms the border of Upper Pittsgrove Township {{to the north and}} Pittsgrove Township to the south, passing through forested areas among development. The route crosses CR 553 before passing through the community of Porchtown.|$|R
50|$|Weston {{described}} the tree as having leaves striped, spotted and margined with white. The photograph in Krüssman (1984) of a specimen in Schönaich-Carolath Park, Hamburg, shows the typical, almost orbicular <b>leaves</b> of English <b>elm,</b> but variegated. In other respects {{the form of}} the tree is similar to the type. The tree, which is the only variegated English Elm in cultivation, sometimes produces variegated suckers.|$|R
5000|$|The genus is hermaphroditic, having apetalous perfect flowers {{which are}} wind-pollinated. <b>Elm</b> <b>leaves</b> are alternate, with simple, single- or, most commonly, doubly serrate margins, usually {{asymmetric}} {{at the base}} and acuminate at the [...] The fruit is a round wind-dispersed samara flushed with chlorophyll, facilitating photosynthesis before the leaves emerge. All species are tolerant {{of a wide range}} of soils and pH levels but, with few exceptions, demand good drainage. The elm tree can grow to great height, often with a split trunk creating a vase-shape profile.|$|R
50|$|The larvae {{are mainly}} scavengers, feeding on dry or {{decaying}} fruit, dead floral parts, and sooty mold among fruit clusters and under sepals. The larvae {{have been recorded}} feeding on cones of several species of Pinus and Cassia pods, dead fruits of peach and loquat, lime, grapefruit, banana, cabbage, coconut blossoms and <b>elm</b> <b>leaves.</b> During summer, larvae may nibble on rind of ripe oranges, often near the stem end or {{on the sides of}} fruit in a cluster. The feeding is usually superficial and does not cause appreciable damage.|$|R
50|$|The imago (adult beetle) is 6-8 mm in length, {{ranges from}} yellow to green in colour, with {{a spot on}} its head, an {{hourglass}} mark and two spots on the pronotum, and a broad, dark stripe {{along the edge of}} each elytron. The larvae are usually black, occasionally black and yellow, with multiple rows of dots on the back and on the sides and < 13 mm long. The pupae are orange-yellow with black chaetae. The ova are yellow, and laid in spindle-like clusters of < 25 on the undersides of the <b>elm</b> <b>leaves.</b>|$|R
40|$|Dry Chinquapin oak (Quercus macrocarpa) and American <b>elm</b> (Ulmus americana) <b>leaves</b> {{were placed}} in four microcosms fed by {{groundwater}} springs to monitor changes in dry mass, ash-free dry mass, and microbial activity over a 35 -day period. Oxygen microelectrodes were used to measure microbial activity and to estimate millimeter-scale heterogeneity in that activity. Oak leaves lost mass more slowly than <b>elm</b> <b>leaves.</b> Generally, there was a decrease in total dry weight over the first 14 days, after which total dry weight began to increase. However, there were consistent decreases in ash-free dry mass over the entire incubation period, suggesting that the material remaining after initial leaf decomposition trapped inorganic particles. Microbial activity was higher on <b>elm</b> <b>leaves</b> than on oak leaves, with peak activity occurring at 6 and 27 days, respectively. The level of oxygen saturation on the bottom surface of an elm leaf ranged between 0 and 75 % within a 30 -mm 2 area. This spatial heterogeneity in O 2 saturation disappeared when the water velocity increased from 0 to 6 cm s- 1. Our results suggest that as leaves enter the groundwater, they decompose and provide substrate for microorganisms. The rate of decomposition depends on leaf type, small-scale variations in microbial activity, water velocity, {{and the length of}} submersion time. During the initial stages of decomposition, anoxic microzones are formed that could potentially be important to the biogeochemistry of the otherwise oxic aquifer...|$|R
