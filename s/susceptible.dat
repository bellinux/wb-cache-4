5|$|Banksia sessilis {{is highly}} <b>susceptible</b> to dieback {{caused by the}} {{introduced}} plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; {{in fact it is}} so reliably <b>susceptible</b> that it is considered a good indicator species for the presence of the disease. Most highly <b>susceptible</b> species quickly become locally extinct in infected areas, {{and in the absence of}} hosts the disease itself eventually dies out. However, B.sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites. The new colonies are themselves infected, and thus P.cinnamomi survives at these sites indefinitely.|$|E

In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin {{may be used}} to treat infections caused by <b>susceptible</b> aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.|$|E

These mice are less <b>susceptible</b> to poliovirus infection through the intracerebral route, possibly because they express decreased levels of hPVR.

All measures of anterior-mediated attentional functions significantly declined during hypnosis.

Use of rehearsal strategy (instrumental set) decreased significantly in hypnosis but more so for highs than lows.

5|$|Cowpea is <b>susceptible</b> to nematode, fungal, {{bacterial}} and virus diseases, {{which can}} result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is <b>susceptible</b> to mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
