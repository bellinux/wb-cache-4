5|$|On land, {{the river}} otter can walk, run, bound, or slide. Foot falls during walking and running follow the {{sequence}} of left limb, right limb, right limb, left limb. During walking, the limbs are moved in a plane parallel to the long axis of the body. Bounding {{is the result of}} simultaneous lifting of the limbs off the ground. As the front feet make contact with the ground, the back feet are lifted and land where the front paws first contacted the ground, producing a pattern of tracks in pairs typical of most mustelids. <b>Sliding</b> occurs mostly on even surfaces of snow or ice, but can also occur on grassy slopes and muddy banks. <b>Sliding</b> across snow and ice is a rapid and efficient means of travel, and otters traveling over mountain passes, between drainages, or descending from mountain lakes often slide continuously for several hundred meters. Rear leg paddling enables continuous <b>sliding</b> where gravity is an insufficient or an opposing force. During winter, the river otters heavily use openings in the ice, and may excavate passages in beaver dams for accessing open water.|$|E

5|$|The Whistler <b>Sliding</b> Centre in Whistler, British Columbia was {{the site}} of women's {{skeleton}} at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada. The track was constructed between 2005 and 2008, and became only the 15th competition-level track in the world. It was certified for competition in <b>sliding</b> sports by the International Luge Federation (FIL) and the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT) in March, 2008 in a process called homologation where hundreds of athletes ran the track. This was the first time many competitors at the 2010 Games were able to try the track and begin to develop strategies for it. Canadian athletes hoped that having it open two years before the Games, and having that amount of time to train on it, would give them an advantage in the Games. The Whistler <b>Sliding</b> Centre quickly gained {{a reputation as one of}} the fastest tracks in the world.|$|E
5|$|The non-sliding {{logarithmic}} scale, Gunter's rule, {{was invented}} shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred enhanced it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on <b>sliding</b> scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. <b>Sliding</b> the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.|$|E
