The formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>surface</b> morphology was dependent on the speed of evaporation of the solvent(s) (ACE, DMF, and their mixtures), as well as the inter-diffusion and penetration of the non-solvent (water) and solvent(s).

40|$|Surface defects such as ring cracks {{are located}} on silicon nitride ceramic rolling elements. The random nature of ring crack {{position}} creates difficulties in predicting rolling contact fatigue (RCF) life. The influence of the lubricant, contact pressure and crack geometry on the RCF mechanism {{is difficult to determine}} due to the variable nature of RCF life when the crack location is not defined. In this study, rolling contact fatigue was tested using a novel experimental technique. The test ceramic ball specimen with identified surface ring cracks was precisely located in the contact path. The rolling contact fatigue tests were conducted using a modified four-ball machine in a hybrid ceramic/steel combination with five different types of lubricating mediums at various contact pressures. Detailed analysis of damage progression was carried out to study the mechanisms of fatigue failure. A boundary element analysis was used to determine the stress intensity factors around the crack front and stress distributions on the surface {{in the presence of the}} surface crack. The RCF tests of silicon nitride balls with surface ring cracks showed that fatigue life was strongly influenced by load/contact stress, crack size,lubricant and material type. Ring crack spalling failure is not only influenced by sub-surface fatigue crack propagation but also strongly influenced by <b>secondary</b> <b>surface</b> cracks. The formation of the <b>secondary</b> <b>surface</b> cracks is a key factor which dominates spalling of rolling contact fatigue. Modelling work showed that the crack length was an important parameter. Increasing the crack length for given crack radius resulted in higher tensile surface stresses ahead of the original ring crack and also gave higher absolute K 11 values. In addition, the crack gap and crack face friction had a significant effect on the formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>surface</b> cracks and fatigue crack propagation behaviour. Increasing the crack face friction decreased both the surface tensile stress and absolute magnitude of K 11. Numerical calculation results were consistent with the experimental observations. ...|$|E

We believe that our strategy opens the way of using a stabilized amorphous phase as a versatile reservoir system that can be converted in a highly controlled fashion to a crystalline form upon contacting the nucleating template...|$|E
