40|$|The {{event of}} a default for low-default portfolios, such as {{sovereign}} debt or banks, have received much attention {{as a result of}} the increasing instabilities in financial markets. The lack of sufficient default information on low-default portfolios complicates the protection of such portfolios. Default protections have typically, in the past, relied on extreme value theory and reporting the value at risk. The focus here, is the application of an engineering concept, accelerated test techniques, to the problem of insufficient data on low-default portfolios. In the application, high-default portfolios serve as <b>stressed</b> <b>cases</b> of low-default portfolios. Since high-default portfolios have more data available, viewing it as a <b>stressed</b> <b>case</b> of a low-default portfolio enables us to extrapolate the data to the low-default portfolio environment, and do estimation such as estimating the default probability for a low-default portfolio.

40|$|Abstract Background Recently {{there is}} a growing concern about stress during {{undergraduate}} medical training. However, studies about the same are lacking from Pakistani medical schools. The objectives of our study were to assess perceived stress, sources of stress and their severity and to assess the determinants of <b>stressed</b> <b>cases.</b> Methods A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey was carried out among undergraduate medical students of CMH Lahore Medical College, Pakistan during January to March 2009. Perceived stress was assessed using the perceived stress scale. A 33 -item questionnaire was used to assess sources of stress and their severity. Results The overall response rate was 80. 5 % (161 out of 200 students). The overall mean perceived stress was 30. 84 (SD = 7. 01) and was significantly higher among female students. By logistic regression analysis, <b>stressed</b> <b>cases</b> were associated with occurrence of psychosocial (OR 5. 01, 95 % CI 2. 44 - 10. 29) and academic related stressors (OR 3. 17 95 % CI 1. 52 - 6. 68). The most common sources of stress were related to academic and psychosocial concerns. 'High parental expectations', 'frequency of examinations', 'vastness of academic curriculum', 'sleeping difficulties', 'worrying about the future', 'loneliness', 'becoming a doctor', 'performance in periodic examinations' were the most frequently and severely occurring sources of stress. There was a negative but insignificant correlation between perceived stress and academic performance (r = - 0. 099, p > 0. 05). Conclusion A higher level of perceived stress was reported by the students. The main stressors were related to academic and psychosocial domains. Further studies are required to test the association between <b>stressed</b> <b>cases</b> and gender, academic stressors and psychosocial stressors. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Stress and {{emotional}} disturbances among students at medical colleges are relatively common, and seemingly, {{this is a}} worldwide problem. Recently studies have reported high levels of stress among medical students.   Objectives: To assess prevalence of perceived stress and find out sources of stress among undergraduate medical students.   Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} a private medical college in Mangalore during March-August 2012. Data was collected with the help of self-administered questionnaire using “Perceived stress scale (PSS 14) ”. Academic, health related and psychological stressors were assessed using a questionnaire containing 33 items. Logistic regression analysis was done to find out determinants of <b>stressed</b> <b>cases.</b> Results: Total 200 students completed the questionnaire. Overall prevalence of stress among study participants was found to be 42. 5 % (85 students out of 200). Female students reported higher prevalence of stress than males. Mean PSS score in the study population was 27. 53 (95 % CI: 26. 4 - 28. 7, SD = 7. 01). Frequency of examination, performance in examination, academic curriculum were reported as important academic stressors. High parental expectations, lack of entertainment in the institution and quality of food in mess were reported as important psycho-social stressors by the students. Conclusion: High levels of perceived stress existed in the first and second year undergraduate medical students. The associations between <b>stressed</b> <b>cases</b> and occurrence of academic and psychosocial stressors needs to be further tested by prospective studies.

Significant differences were noted between non-stress and severe stress category means for all entries under severe stress, which implies that the performance under non-stress and severe stress was considerably different.
