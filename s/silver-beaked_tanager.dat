50|$|The <b>silver-beaked</b> <b>tanager</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name Lanius carbo.|$|E
50|$|The <b>silver-beaked</b> <b>tanager</b> (Ramphocelus carbo) is a {{medium-sized}} passerine bird. This tanager is a resident breeder in South America from eastern Colombia and Venezuela south to Paraguay and central Brazil, per√∫ and on Trinidad. It is common and conspicuous.|$|E
50|$|These {{are social}} birds which eat mainly fruit, but insects are also taken. The <b>silver-beaked</b> <b>tanager</b> {{is often seen}} in groups of six to ten, {{frequently}} giving a call described as cheeng. Its song is a slow thin kick-wick.|$|E
50|$|The Tropical Encounters Exhibit {{was created}} in 2005. Animals in this exhibit include Arrau River turtles, bay-headed tanagers, black pacu, {{turquoise}} honeycreepers, emerald tree boas, golden-headed manakins, leafcutter ants, mata matas, paradise tanagers, peacock bass, red-capped cardinals, red-tailed catfish, rufous-crowned <b>tanagers,</b> <b>silver-beaked</b> <b>tanagers,</b> stingrays, sunbitterns, swallow tanagers, turquoise tanagers, violaceous euphonia, yellow-rumped cacique, yellow-spotted Amazon river turtles, green anaconda, and saffron finches.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silver-beaked</b> <b>tanagers</b> are 18 cm {{long and}} weigh 25 g. Adult males are velvety crimson black {{with a deep}} crimson throat and breast. The upper {{mandible}} of the bill is black, but the enlarged lower mandible is bright silver in appearance. The bill is pointed upwards in display. The female is much duller, with brownish upperparts, reddish brown underparts and a black bill.|$|R
50|$|The {{other species}} form two superspecies. One {{includes}} crimson-backed, Huallaga, <b>silver-beaked</b> and Brazilian <b>tanagers,</b> {{and the other}} comprises Passerini's, Cherrie's and flame-rumped tanagers.|$|R
50|$|The masked crimson tanager {{has been}} speculated to engage in reverse sexual {{dominance}} behavior similar to their congener pair, the <b>silver-beaked</b> <b>tanager.</b> The masked crimson tanagers, who belong to the passerine bird order exhibit this behavior {{similar to that of}} their cousin. However, there is no observable evidence to support the hypothesis that the masked crimson tanager are among the rare and unexplained phenomenon of reverse sexual dominance. Under normal circumstances, passerine species of birds exemplify a default hierarchy of dominance wherein larger, heavier birds tend to dominate the smaller, lighter birds and males tend to dominate females. Between masked crimson tanagers and the <b>silver-beaked</b> <b>tanager,</b> individuals engage in a form of interference competition, also known as competition by resource defense, when partitioning resource-rich habitats. The masked crimson tanager prefer to inhabit sites close to or around oxbow lakes, a common geographical feature of their native Amazon biome. They demonstrate aggression while defending the more productive areas around the lakes, causing the <b>silver-beaked</b> <b>tanager</b> to occupy the riparian forest. The masked crimson tanagers are competitively superior and dominate most interspecies interactions with their cousin.|$|E
50|$|The masked crimson tanager {{is found}} across Amazonia and is abundant. It prefers to dwell near {{bodies of water}} such as lakes, swamps or rivers, {{generally}} at altitudes below 600 m (2000 ft). Masked crimson tanagers move about in troops of 10 to 12 birds. The species can form mixed species flocks with the <b>silver-beaked</b> <b>tanager</b> (Ramphocelus carbo). It is frugivorous (fruit-eating).|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{observed}} in the park include the rufous-tailed jacamar (Galbula ruficauda), squirrel cuckoo (Piaya cayana), southern beardless tyrannulet (Camptostoma obsoletum), purple-throated euphonia (Euphonia chlorotica), grey-headed tanager (Eucometis penicillata), barred antshrike (Thamnophilus doliatus), pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), white-throated spadebill (Platyrinchus mystaceus), sepia-capped flycatcher (Leptopogon amaurocephalus), <b>silver-beaked</b> <b>tanager</b> (Ramphocelus carbo), planalto tyrannulet (Phyllomyias fasciatus), bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus).|$|E
50|$|Given the fruit's {{attractive}} {{color and}} the conspicuous display at the branch-tips, this tree appears to be distributed by birds which eat the fruit and spread the seeds. Perching birds, namely tanagers (Thraupidae), thrushes (Turdidae) and tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), are most commonly seen to feed on the fruit. Some birds, such as the <b>silver-beaked</b> <b>tanager</b> (Ramphocelus carbo), prune off the seedcoat and eat it, discarding the seed, but most swallow the entire fruit. Species such as the swallow tanager (Tersina viridis) and the pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), but perhaps most of all the sayaca tanager (Thraupis sayaca), appear to be particularly fond of them. Indeed, the sayaca tanager will defend richly fruiting A. glandulosa trees against similar-sized birds such as the blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana) or the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus). It may be that at least locally, T. sayaca is crucial for the tree's reproduction and survival.|$|E
40|$|At higher latitudes, as {{a result}} of the {{predictable}} and ubiquitous nature of the annual photoperiod, most temperate-zone bird species have converged in using day length as a primary environmental cue to time seasonal processes. Instead, in equatorial biomes the environmental fluctuations have usually a more heterogeneous degree of seasonality. Hence, the neural and endocrine mechanisms that mediate the occurrence of seasonal behaviors and life history stages might operate in diverse manners among equatorial songbirds. In the present thesis I investigated the regulatory mechanisms underlying the annual cycle and song behavior of the equatorial <b>silver-beaked</b> <b>tanager,</b> an endemic Amazon songbird with an entirely tropical phylogenetic background. Thereby, I sought to study proximate regulatory mechanisms that have likely evolved with small photoperiodic cycles. I show that males inhabiting the equatorial zone of the eastern Amazon, a highly productive region that surrounds the Amazon estuary, have marked seasonal schedules of molt and dawn-song behavior. This region imposes singular environmental conditions for birds, including unconstrained food availability over the year. Accordingly, male silver-beaked tanagers exhibited uniform annual levels of baseline corticosterone (Chapter 1). However, individual baseline corticosterone and testosterone levels are clearly associated with the molting status of males. On the other hand, males exhibited important seasonal changes in testis size and gonadal testosterone production, which denote a strong seasonal breeding pattern (Chapters 1 & 2). Particularly interesting is the neuroendocrine regulation of seasonal dawn-song, a behavior directly involved in the breeding territoriality of males, whose seasonal activation appears as decoupled from the seasonal peak of testosterone levels in plasma that occurs later in the breeding (Chapter 2). Further, although at equatorial latitudes environmental photic cues have a very small magnitude of variation over time, they do seem to influence the occurrence of dawn-song in male silver-beaked tanagers on a daily basis, as well as at a seasonal level. Besides this, males also integrate the occurrence of rainfall cycles as an environmental signal for the timing of seasonal phenotypes and dawn-song. Finally, in Chapter 4 I complemented my PhD research by proposing a new method of steroid hormone implantation to be used for the study of wild birds. Overall, the present thesis demonstrates a concerted orchestration of seasonal events in equatorial males. This phenology of silver-beaked tanagers is mediated by conserved neuroendocrine regulatory networks that function with a different temporal and relational pattern when compared with widely studied temperate-zone bird specie...|$|E
