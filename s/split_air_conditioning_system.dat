The experiment was done using HFC 134 a as the refrigerant and Polyol-ester oil (POE) as the conventional lubricant in the air conditioning system. The performance of the <b>split</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> with HFC 134 a/POE oil system was compared with HFC 134 a/POE oil/MHE for different load conditions. The result indicates that the system performance has improved when HFC 134 a/POE oil/MHE system was used instead of HFC 134 a/POE oil system and there was also a reduction in power consumption at all load conditions. The HFC 134 a/POE oil/MHE works normally and safely in the air conditioning system. HFC 134 a/POE mineral oil/MHE system reduced the energy consumption by 33. 84 % when compared with the HFC 134 a/POE oil system.

40|$|Abstract. In {{conventional}} air-conditioning system, {{fresh air}} volume is always restricted to save energy, which Sacrifices {{indoor air quality}} to some level. However, removing the latent load of air by liquid Desiccant rather than by cooling is an alternative way of reducing energy consumption. Most of the research works on energy saving methods for air conditioning have focused on large chillers. Hence, this research work discusses energy conservation in a <b>split</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system,</b> with a helical type intercooler {{that acts as a}} heat exchanger.

In this ratio the time taken for required cooling temperature from 28 °C to 18 °C was achieved by 1380 seconds.

40|$|AbstractBecause {{of their}} low cost, small <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> (AC) like <b>split</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> are often {{installed}} without a proper study of building envelope performance. Furthermore, these systems are sometimes installed by tradesmen who neglect {{to comply with}} the appropriate rules and regulations. Finally, when routine maintenance is not rigorously carried out (as so often happens), the energetic performance of the system is compromised over time. This article presents a practical, global approach to diagnose the performance of existing small air-conditioning installations in buildings applied in Reunion Island. This tropical Island aspires to become electricity self-sufficient. This approach relies on a numerical tool and dynamic simulations of buildings equipped with AC. The simulations, which take account of the building envelope, a description of the system as well as the practices of the users, are based on the kernel calculation EnergyPlus. They also take into account the climatic conditions and provide an estimate of the annual electricity consumption related to the cooling of the zone. This global analysis helps to qualify the entire system by assigning an energy label. In addition to the tool, a diagnostic procedure is proposed, helping an auditor defining guidance to improve the building envelope and to install and maintain the system...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} application of direct evaporative cooling to reduce energy consumption in a residential sized <b>split</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Conditioning</b> <b>system.</b> Direct evaporative cooling is employed at the air-cooled condenser of a split air-conditioning system to pre-cool the ambient air flowing over the condenser coils. Different ambient conditions of air were simulated using a heater to mimic typical high temperature environments. Rigid cellulose pads with thickness ranging from 2 - 6 inches (5. 1 cm- 15. 2 cm) served as the heat exchange medium for air-water interaction, and were tested to {{determine the influence of}} the pad thickness in pre-cooling the ambient air before it flows over the condenser coils to extract heat from the refrigerant in the condenser. ^ It was observed that a 1 °C drop in ambient air temperature causes the condensing temperature of the refrigerant to drop by 0. 6 °C. This drop in condensing temperature of the refrigerant causes a decrease in power consumption of the unit, accompanied by an increase in Coefficient of Performance (COP). Results obtained shows that up to 44 % increase in COP, and a 20 % decrease in power consumption can be achieved by employing evaporative cooling. Additionally, the COP was found to increase by 4 % for every 1 °C drop in refrigerant condensing temperature. The water consumption pattern of the hybrid system is monitored to provide a realistic estimate of the operating cost, and profitability of the hybrid system. It was observed that 0. 34 liters of water is consumed for every percent increase in COP. To provide a realistic estimate of the daily water consumption of the hybrid system, the operation time was increased from 1 - 4 hours, in step increments of 1 hour. The volume of water consumed was found to increase by a factor of 1. 8, 2. 5, and 3. 2, for 2 hrs, 3 hrs and 4 hrs of operation respectively. This shows that as the operating hours of the hybrid system in a day increases, the volume of water consumed will decrease. Intermittent operation of the water pump was also investigated and found to be beneficial to the system in terms of reduction in energy associated with the pump operation, and also prevention of water buildup in the flutes of the pad. Studies on water quality shows that water of high salinity (up to 35 ppt), and turbidity (up to 30 NTU) did not affect the evaporative cooling process, over the duration of usage. However, it is expected that over time, accumulation of salts, or other foreign materials on the pad surface will reduce the pad performance. ...|$|E
