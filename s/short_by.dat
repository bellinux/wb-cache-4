5|$|Although {{it was cut}} <b>short</b> <b>by</b> Roosevelt's {{desire to}} have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph.

5|$|Cienfuegos led electors {{that were}} part of the {{imperial}} party in an attempt to elect Giulio Piazza. Piazza was almost elected on May 13, but was <b>short</b> <b>by</b> four votes. The electors were confident that {{they would be able to}} elect him, because more cardinals were arriving to participate in the conclave, and it became public in Rome that Piazza was likely to be the new pope. Albani did not support this because he had not been a part of the negotiations despite being the original elector to suggest Piazza, and undermined his election by proposing Vincenzo Orsini as an alternate candidate.|$|E
5|$|Early reviews {{praised the}} style of Carnivàle but {{questioned}} the approach and execution of the story. Its first episode set a new audience record for an HBO original series, {{but was unable to}} retain its ratings in its second season. It was canceled after 24 episodes, cutting its intended six-season run <b>short</b> <b>by</b> four seasons. It won five Emmys out of fifteen nominations in 2004, and received numerous other nominations and awards between 2004 and 2006.|$|E

5|$|From late 1918, {{the ships}} {{were used to}} escort convoys part-way across the Atlantic. In late September, Minnesota struck a naval mine laid by the German U-boat U-117, causing serious damage that kept her out of service for five months. Convoy duty was cut <b>short</b> <b>by</b> the German {{surrender}} in November; thereafter, the Connecticuts were used to ferry American soldiers back from the battlefields of France. This work was completed by mid-1919. The ships briefly operated as training ships in the early 1920s, though {{under the terms of}} the Washington Naval Treaty, they were all sold for scrap by 1924 and broken up.|$|E
5|$|Hooper {{finished}} school aged 16, then {{wrote the}} script for his first professional short film, entitled Painted Faces. He {{spent the next two}} years raising capital for the <b>short</b> <b>by</b> courting advertisement directors, whose financial dominance during the late 1980s was noticed by Hooper. Director Paul Weiland invested in the short, which provided Hooper with the equipment he needed. After two years of financing and production, Painted Faces was completed. Hooper wrote, produced, directed and edited it. It was sold to Channel 4 and broadcast on the channel's First Frame strand in 1992, had a screening at the 35th London Film Festival and had a limited theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|In 1908 Prus serialized, in the Warsaw Tygodnik Ilustrowany (Illustrated Weekly), {{his novel}} Dzieci (Children), {{depicting}} the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists {{of the day}} — an uncharacteristically humorless work. Three years later a final novel, Przemiany (Changes), was to have been, like The Doll, a panorama of society and its vital concerns. However, in 1911-12 the novel had barely begun serialization in the Illustrated Weekly when its composition was cut <b>short</b> <b>by</b> Prus' death.|$|E

McTeague had been filmed once before as Life's Whirlpool, a five-reel <b>short</b> <b>by</b> William A. Brady's World Pictures, starring Broadway star Holbrook Blinn as McTeague, which had been released in 1916. Film critics disliked this version and Stroheim later criticized Blinn's performance.
