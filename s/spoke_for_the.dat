5|$|In {{the first}} year of World War I, Macmillan <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> peace-seeking women of the United Kingdom at the International Congress of Women, a peace {{congress}} convened at The Hague. Afterward, she met with world leaders such as President Woodrow Wilson, whose countries were still neutral, to present the proposals formulated at The Hague. Wilson subsequently used these proposals as some of his Fourteen Points, his justification for making war to forge a lasting peace. At war's end, Macmillan served as a delegate at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, and helped encourage the founding of the League of Nations. Macmillan tried but did not succeed in getting the League to establish nationality for women independent of the nationality of their husbands.|$|E

25|$|While the Social Credit {{party was}} founded {{to promote the}} social credit {{theories}} of monetary reform, these could not be implemented at the provincial level, as the Alberta Social Credit Party had learned in the 1930s. Bennett quickly converted the provincial party into a populist conservative party, {{and it became a}} vehicle for those who sought to keep the CCF out of power. However, as leader of the Social Credit Party of Canada's second most powerful provincial branch, he <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> party in federal election campaigns. During the 1957 election, he <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> party at a rally in Regina, Saskatchewan. In the 1965 election, Bennett and his cabinet ministers toured BC to encourage voters to elect Social Credit MPs to promote BC's interests.|$|E

Judge Friedman said he hoped to rule within two weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{reading of}} the 2,455-page {{indictment}} lasted until 13 November 2008.

25|$|In 1994, Perelman bought {{four more}} {{stations}} from the Great American Communications Company for $360 million and four more from Argyle Television Holdings <b>for</b> $716 million. <b>The</b> purchase of Genesis and New World set {{up one of}} <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> major 1994 television industry realignment {{in the wake of}} Fox's acquisition of NFL rights. Rupert Murdoch bought complete control of New World Communications for $3 billion, giving Perelman a large profit from the sale.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is all this?" [...] Harold {{shouted as}} he turned to Osgod, the only figure standing, raising his sword as he <b>spoke,</b> <b>for</b> in <b>the</b> dim light he did not {{recognize}} him.|$|R

25|$|Territorial {{governors}} were {{political appointees}} and beholden to Washington so they usually governed {{with a light}} hand, allowing the legislatures {{to deal with the}} local issues. In addition to his role as civil governor, a territorial governor was also a militia commander, a local superintendent of Indian affairs, and the state liaison with federal agencies. The legislatures, on the other hand, <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> local citizens and they were given considerable leeway by the federal government to make local law.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013 {{his former}} wife <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time to the press. According to her, Gustl Mollath was {{continually}} violent towards her, prior and during marriage. The alleged money laundering activities became an issue only after their divorce, which directly contradicts Gustl Mollath's version that he had suffered from the illegal activities of {{his former wife}}. Gustl Mollath has denied the allegations levied against him and {{has said that he}} was being persecuted for blowing the whistle on tax evasion at HypoVereinsbank.|$|E

50|$|Also {{available}} is the VN900C Custom, which {{is regarded as}} the more aggressively styled sister of the VN900B. Major changes are cast alloy wheels (solid on <b>the</b> rear, and <b>spoked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> front), a much larger diameter 21 in 80/90 front wheel, redesigned fenders, forward controls with pegs (as opposed to floorboards), a smaller headlight, and drag-style bars. Also different is the slimmer one-piece seat, which is still capable of carrying a passenger, but not quite as comfortably as the VN900B.|$|R
25|$|A two-volume {{supplement}} to the third edition was published in 1801, having 1,624 pages and 50 copperplates by D. Lizars. A revised edition was published in 1803. This supplement was published by a wine-merchant, Thomas Bonar, the son-in-law of the Britannica's owner Andrew Bell; unfortunately, the two men quarreled and they never <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last ten years of Bell's life (1799–1809). Bonar was friendly to the article authors, however, and conceived the plan of paying {{them as well as}} the article reviewers, and of allowing them to retain copyright for separate publication of their work.|$|E
25|$|Next {{to serve}} as the {{assistant}} to Commandant George Barnett was Colonel John A. Lejeune. During his tenure of 1915—1917, he <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Commandant, stressing the missions of the Advanced Base Force. He argued that the Marine Corps' organization needed reconstructing, urging that the Marine Corps as a whole, not just particular regiments, be assigned to advanced base duty; this reorganization should be the Marine Corps' primary function in the United States' naval services. Col. Lejeune also supported the article printed in the Marine Corps Gazette by John H. Russell, who drafted one of the earliest advanced base force studies.|$|E
25|$|Calypso music {{developed}} {{together with}} Carnival. The chantuelle, who <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band, {{evolved into the}} calypsonian (and other characters, such as the Midnight Robber). The music, which drew upon African and French influences, became {{the voice of the}} people. It allowed the masses to challenge the doings of the unelected Governor and Legislative Council, and the elected town councils of Port of Spain and San Fernando. As English replaced patois (Creole French) as the dominant language, calypso migrated into English, and in so doing it attracted more attention from the government. Calypso continued {{to play an important role}} in political expression, and also served to document the history of Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
