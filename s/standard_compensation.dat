Under the current fee structure, managers' compensation is maximized at a much larger size than is optimal for fund performance. Therefore, hedge fund managers have strong incentives to increase their assets under management. However, to avoid capital outflows and retain fund assets, managers are also motivated to restrict fund growth to maintain style-average performance, which explains why funds sometimes close themselves to new investment...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} the {{management}} accounting system (MAS) to support marketing decisions has been identified in literature and practice. Accordingly, several improvements have been suggested with the main intention of providing more detailed information on marketing segments. Yet, even with respect to these improved systems {{it has to be}} acknowledged that the quality of the information provided will not be identical for all marketing segments: it can be assumed that it will be more precise for existing segments, which are already served by the firm, than for new ones, with which the firm has comparatively little experience. Further, it has to be considered that the MAS will seldom be the only source of useful information, as the example of the good salesforce having gained a 'deep understanding' of the market while doing his job shows. A problem arises if the acquisition of this additional information is (personally) costly and unobservable and therefore has to be motivated by incentive compensation schemes. This paper emphasizes that <b>standard</b> <b>compensation</b> contracts, as recommended by literature and practice, may fail to induce goal-congruent behaviour. It is shown that ranking commission rates according to the profitabilities reported by the MAS may be dysfunctional and that a non-intuitive rank order may be necessary to motivate the salesforce to become better informed and to use this knowledge appropriately. ...|$|E
40|$|Advanced Multivariable Control Law Design For Future ACT Rotorcraft Neale Prescott Foster This thesis {{considers}} {{the use of}} variable structure and Hinfinity control system designs {{for the improvement of}} the handling qualities of the Lynx helicopter, with full flight envelope operation and enhanced turbulence rejection capabilities. A model-following variable structure controller is designed, where the 'ideal model' was designed in four different ways using the following methods: eigenstructure assignment, Hinfinity minimum entropy, Hinfinity one degree-of-freedom loop shaping, and Hinfinity two degrees-of-freedom loop shaping. The combination of the ideal model and the loop shaping is seen to allow the time and frequency domain objectives to be specified during the variable structure control system design. The decomposition of the Hinfinity one degree-of-freedom and two degrees-of-freedom control laws into state-feedback and observer form allows the use of these observers in the implementation of the variable structure controllers. Extensive testing and evaluating of handling qualities, throughout the operating flight envelope, is performed on the non-linear Rationalised Helicopter Model. Successful Advanced Flight Simulator trials performed at the Defence Research Agency are described, which signify the first real-time 'flight' of a helicopter controlled by a variable structure control law design. A variable structure observer is designed to complete the variable structure observer/controller framework, and shows good handling qualities and time response characteristics throughout the flight envelope. A novel method of combining established Hinfinity control system design procedures with modelling of the turbulence entering the linearised system equations, enables generic Hinfinity control law designs with significantly enhanced turbulence rejection qualities to be successfully demonstrated. The turbulence effects are modelled as perturbing the helicopter's velocity equations, and are included as an extra input to the Hinfinity <b>Standard</b> <b>Compensation</b> Configuration. Therefore, no statistical knowledge of the turbulence was required. The variable structure control law designs are tested for their turbulence rejection capabilities, and exhibit high levels of handling qualities without having been designed explicitly for turbulence rejection in the design procedure...|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} way {{of improving}} the robustness of speech recognition systems to noise is model compensation. This replaces a speech recogniser's distributions over clean speech by ones over noise-corrupted speech. For each clean speech component, model compensation techniques usually approximate the corrupted speech distribution with a diagonal-covariance Gaussian distribution. This thesis looks into improving on this approximation in two ways: firstly, by estimating full-covariance Gaussian distributions; secondly, by approximating corrupted-speech likelihoods without any parameterised distribution. The {{first part of this}} work is about compensating for within-component feature correlations under noise. For this, the covariance matrices of the computed Gaussians should be full instead of diagonal. The estimation of off-diagonal covariance elements turns out to be sensitive to approximations. A popular approximation is the one that state-of-the-art compensation schemes, like VTS compensation, use for dynamic coefficients: the continuous-time approximation. Standard speech recognisers contain both per-time slice, static, coefficients, and dynamic coefficients, which represent signal changes over time, and are normally computed from a window of static coefficients. To remove the need for the continuous-time approximation, this thesis introduces a new technique. It first compensates a distribution over the window of statics, and then applies the same linear projection that extracts dynamic coefficients. It introduces a number of methods that address the correlation changes that occur in noise within this framework. The next problem is decoding speed with full covariances. This thesis re-analyses the previously-introduced predictive linear transformations, and shows how they can model feature correlations at low and tunable computational cost. The second part of this work removes the Gaussian assumption completely. It introduces a sampling method that, given speech and noise distributions and a mismatch function, in the limit calculates the corrupted speech likelihood exactly. For this, it transforms the integral in the likelihood expression, and then applies sequential importance resampling. Though it is too slow to use for recognition, it enables a more fine-grained assessment of compensation techniques, based on the KL divergence to the ideal compensation for one component. The KL divergence proves to predict the word error rate well. This technique also makes it possible to evaluate the impact of approximations that <b>standard</b> <b>compensation</b> schemes make.
