Assessments are done with various methods and tools, including Computer crash simulation (typically finite element analysis), crash test dummies, and partial system sled and full vehicle crashes.Fuel economy/emissions: Fuel economy is the measured fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon or kilometers per liter. Emissions testing includes the measurement of vehicle emissions, including hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and evaporative emissions.NVH engineering (noise, vibration, and harshness): NVH is the customer's feedback (both tactile felt and audible heard) from the vehicle.

This feedback is generated by components either rubbing, vibrating, or rotating. NVH response can be classified in various ways: powertrain NVH, road noise, wind noise, component noise, and squeak and rattle. Note, there are both good and bad NVH qualities. The NVH engineer works to either eliminate bad NVH or change the “bad NVH” too good (i.e., exhaust tones).|$|E

Subjects experienced vertical <b>seat</b> <b>vibration</b> at frequencies in the range 2. 5 to 25 Hz at vibration magnitudes in the range 0. 016 to 2. 0 ms^- 2 r. m. s. Equivalent comfort contours were determined with five backrest conditions: no backrest, and with a stationary backrest inclined at 0 degree (upright), 30, 60 and 90 degree. Within all conditions, the frequency of greatest sensitivity to acceleration decreased with increasing vibration magnitude. Compared to an upright backrest, around the main resonance of the body, the vibration magnitudes required to cause similar discomfort were 100 % greater with 60 -degree and 90 -degree backrest inclinations and 50 % greater with a 30 -degree backrest inclination.

40|$|In this {{conclusion}} to a four-part series of papers, {{an interpretation of}} the experimental data presented in the earlier three papers is given. The results obtained from the experiments are compared with those obtained by other researchers. A set of simplified approximations to the various equivalent comfort contours are defined and a general approach to the prediction of discomfort due to multi-axis, multi-input complex vibration is given. It is shown that the results for translational vibration of a seat surface supporting the body are reasonably consistent with some previous studies. Although the contours for fore-and-aft and lateral vibration are in agreement with those in ISO 2631 (1978) there is evidence that sensitivity to vertical <b>seat</b> <b>vibration</b> above 8  Hz should be greater than defined in that standard. It is shown that the results for rotational <b>seat</b> <b>vibration</b> differ by an order of magnitude from those published by other authors but that this difference may be explained by the positions of the centres of rotation used in other studies. It is shown that simple approximations to the median equivalent comfort contours for translational and rotational <b>seat</b> <b>vibration</b> and translational foot and back vibration may be defined by contours on acceleration frequency graph having a slope of O dB per octave (constant acceleration) and 6 dB per octave (constant velocity).

Yaguchi et al. 1 has proposed a method to evaluate automobile <b>seat</b> <b>vibration</b> that is based on judgments using a subjective mental state. Their method focuses on the time-variant magnitude of the peak frequency on a power spectrum density. However, their method has no consideration of all the frequency contents of the discomfort, nor comparison between different peak frequency vibrations.

He clarified that the human sensation to the vehicle vibration discomfort changes every moment showing the relationship between the frequency-weighted r. m. s. acceleration calculated every 5 seconds and the category judgment to vehicle vibration discomfort every 5 seconds. However, his study doesn 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 t show what parameter connects to the subjective final judgment to vehicle vibration. Therefore, we applied the method similar to ISO 100563 considering the time-variant to the vehicle seat z-axis vibration evaluation.

Repeatability measures within a single subject and studies of the variability across a group of twelve subjects have been conducted with two seating conditions: a rigid seat with a backrest, and the same seat with no backrest. Fore-and-aft seat motion mainly resulted in head motion within the mid-sagittal plane (x-z plane). Without the backrest, transmissibilities for the fore-and-aft, vertical and pitch axes of the head were greatest at about 2 Hz. The backrest greatly increased head vibration at frequencies above 4 Hz and caused a second peak in the transmissibility curves at about 6 to 8 Hz. Lateral seat motion mainly caused lateral head motion with a maximum transmissibility at about 2 Hz. The backrest had little effect on the transmission of lateral vibration to the head.
