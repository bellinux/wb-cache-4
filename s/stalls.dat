5|$|Supermarkets {{continued}} to affect shopping patterns. In 1979 {{fruit and vegetable}} <b>stalls</b> occupied 70 of the market's 205 stalls; by 1988 greengrocers occupied only 28 <b>stalls,</b> and by 2010 there were only seven remaining fruit and vegetable <b>stalls</b> on the market. A wide variety of other <b>stalls</b> have taken their place, and the market remains active. One of the largest markets in Britain, it is a tourist attraction as well as remaining heavily used by local residents, and is a {{focal point of the}} city.|$|E
5|$|Although superficially {{the market}} {{remained}} little {{changed in the}} decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and cold running water and refrigeration were provided to those <b>stalls</b> handling food, {{and many of the}} <b>stalls</b> were converted into lockable units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout the market, the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19thcentury lavatories were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of corrugated plastic covers over the walkways between the <b>stalls.</b> Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, and the decline of market gardening meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, the market survived competitive pressures. Many <b>stalls</b> diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of <b>stalls</b> allowed the market to sell a range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, {{the local}} {{authority}} began to systematically buy {{up all the}} <b>stalls</b> on the market, eventually bringing the entire market into public ownership. It was radically redesigned in the 1930s: <b>stalls</b> were arranged into parallel rows and a new City Hall was built along the entire {{western side of the}} marketplace to replace the by then inadequate Guildhall. This new arrangement survived with few significant changes {{for the rest of the}} 20thcentury. By the 1990s, the market was becoming decrepit and, in 2003, proposals were made for another radical rebuilding of the area. These proposals were extremely controversial and were abandoned in 2004 in favour of a scheme which retained the parallel rows of <b>stalls,</b> but replaced the old <b>stalls</b> with steel units of four <b>stalls</b> each. The rebuilt market was completed in early 2006 and is one of the largest markets in Britain.|$|E
50|$|Garter <b>stall</b> {{plates are}} small {{enamelled}} brass plates located in St George's Chapel displaying {{the names and}} arms of the Knights of the Garter. Each knight is allotted a <b>stall</b> in St George's Chapel and the <b>stall</b> plate is affixed to his personal <b>stall.</b> His successor knight in that <b>stall</b> adds his own <b>stall</b> plate and thus a fairly complete series of <b>stall</b> plates survives for the successive occupants of each <b>stall.</b> Many other ancient European Orders of Chivalry use similar <b>stall</b> plates in the home church or other building of their order.|$|R

40|$|<b>Stall</b> flutter is an {{aeroelastic}} phenomenon resulting in unwanted oscillatory loads on the blade, such as wind turbine blade, helicopter rotor blade, and other flexible wing blades. Although the <b>stall</b> flutter and related aeroelastic control {{have been studied}} theoretically and experimentally, microtab control of asymmetric limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) in <b>stall</b> flutter cases has not been generally investigated. This paper presents an aeroservoelastic model to study the microtab control of the blade section undergoing moderate <b>stall</b> flutter and deep <b>stall</b> flutter separately. The effects of different dynamic <b>stall</b> conditions and the consequent asymmetric LCOs for both <b>stall</b> cases are simulated and analyzed. Then, {{for the design of}} the <b>stall</b> flutter controller, the potential sensor signal for the <b>stall</b> flutter, the microtab control capability of the <b>stall</b> flutter, and the control algorithm for the <b>stall</b> flutter are studied. The improvement and the superiority of the proposed adaptive <b>stall</b> flutter controller are shown by comparison with a simple <b>stall</b> flutter controller...|$|R

5|$|The Sibu Central Market is {{the biggest}} indoor market in Sarawak. It is located at Channel Street, {{opposite}} the Sibu wharf terminal. The central market has food <b>stalls</b> on top floor with dry and wet market on the ground floor. Among the items on sale in this market are exotic fruits, jungle produce, handicrafts, Bario rice, and poultry. There are 1,100 <b>stalls</b> in the market on weekdays and 400-500 additional <b>stalls</b> on weekends when the indigenous people from the interior brought their jungle produce to the market.|$|E
5|$|While the 1976 renovations {{prolonged}} {{the life}} of the 1930s market, by the 1990s the market was once more becoming decrepit. The covers erected in 1976 over the walkways blocked sunlight, leaving much of the market dingy and poorly lit. The walkways themselves, already narrow, were becoming even more restricted as <b>stalls</b> erected external displays and additional weatherproofing. Removable shutters used to secure the <b>stalls</b> overnight were stacked against the sides of the <b>stalls</b> during trading hours, causing further obstruction, while on those <b>stalls</b> fitted with doors the doors opened outwards to maximise the limited space inside the units. In addition, the floors of <b>stalls</b> followed the slope of the hill, a gradient of about 1:12, causing health problems for those market workers who had to stand at this angle for prolonged periods during the day. Norwich City Council decided that these problems needed to be addressed, and in December 2003 invited the public to choose between three proposals for a rebuilt market.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigated unsteady {{events such}} as <b>stall</b> inception, stall-cell development, and surge. <b>Stall</b> {{is characterized by a}} decrease in overall pressure rise and nonaxisymmetric throughflow. Compressor <b>stall</b> can lead to surge which is characterized by quasi-axisymmetric fluctuations in mass flow and pressure. Unsteady measurements of the flow field around the compressor rotor are examined. During the <b>stall</b> inception process, initial disturbances were found within the rotor passage near the tip region. As the <b>stall</b> cell develops, blade lift and pressure ratio decrease within the <b>stall</b> cell and increase ahead of the <b>stall</b> cell. The <b>stall</b> inception event, stall-cell development, and <b>stall</b> recovery event were found to be nearly identical for stable rotating <b>stall</b> and surge cases. As the <b>stall</b> cell grows, {{the leading edge of the}} cell will rotate at a higher rate than the trailing edge in the rotor frame. The opposite occurs during <b>stall</b> recovery. The trailing edge of the <b>stall</b> cell will rotate at the approximate speed as the fully developed <b>stall</b> cell, while the leading edge decreases in rotational speed in the rotor frame...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the numerical analysis}} of a <b>stall</b> suppression system for helicopter rotors. The analysis employs a finite element method and includes advanced dynamic <b>stall</b> and vortex wake models. The <b>stall</b> suppression system {{is based on a}} transfer function matrix approach and uses blade root actuation to suppress <b>stall</b> directly. The rotor model used in this investigation is the UH- 60 A rotor. At a severe <b>stalled</b> condition, the analysis predicts three distinct <b>stall</b> events spreading over the retreating side of the rotor disk. Open loop results show that 2 P input can reduce <b>stall</b> only moderately, while the other input harmonics are less effective. The responses of the <b>stall</b> index, a measure of <b>stall,</b> to individual input harmonics are highly nonlinear. Such nonlinear <b>stall</b> behavior makes the closed-loop controller ineffective in suppressing <b>stall</b> and the combined effects of individual harmonics nonadditive. Also, <b>stall</b> reduction does not guarantee gains in rotor performance. 1...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} to operate, {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the plague it was at a much reduced level and many <b>stalls</b> were left empty for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of <b>stalls</b> in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich had fallen from at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.|$|E

40|$|Several nascent {{peptides}} <b>stall</b> ribosomes {{during their}} own translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Leader peptides that induce <b>stalling</b> can regulate downstream gene expression. Interestingly, <b>stalling</b> peptides show little sequence similarity {{and interact with}} the ribosome through distinct mechanisms. To explore the scope of regulation by <b>stalling</b> peptides and {{to better understand the}} mechanism of <b>stalling,</b> we identified and characterized new examples from random libraries. We created a genetic selection that ties the life of Escherichia coli cells to <b>stalling</b> at a specific site. This selection relies on the natural bacterial system that rescues arrested ribosomes. We altered transfer-messenger RNA, a key component of this rescue system, to direct the completion of a necessary protein if and only if <b>stalling</b> occurs. We identified three classes of <b>stalling</b> peptides: C-terminal Pro residues, SecM-like peptides, and the novel <b>stalling</b> sequence FXXYXIWPP. Like the leader peptides SecM and TnaC, the FXXYXIWPP peptide induces <b>stalling</b> efficiently by inhibiting peptidyl transfer. The nascent peptide exit tunnel and peptidyltransferase center are implicated in this <b>stalling</b> event, although mutations in the ribosome affect <b>stalling</b> on SecM and FXXYXIWPP differently. We conclude that ribosome <b>stalling</b> can be caused by numerous sequences and is more common than previously believed...|$|R

5|$|The misericords {{date from}} 1330 to 1340. They {{may have been}} carved under the {{direction}} of master carpenter John Strode, although his name is not recorded before 1341. He was assisted by Bartholomew Quarter, who is documented from 1343. They originally numbered ninety, of which sixty-five have survived. Sixty-one are installed in the choir, three are displayed in the cathedral and one is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum. New <b>stalls</b> were ordered when the eastern end of the choir was extended in the early 14th century. The canons complained that they had borne the cost of the rebuilding and ordered that the prebendary clerics should pay for their own <b>stalls.</b> When the newly refurbished choir opened in 1339 many misericords were left unfinished, including one-fifth of the surviving 65. Many of the clerics had not paid, and were required to contribute a total sum of £200. The misericords survived better than the other sections of the <b>stalls,</b> which, during the Protestant Reformation, had their canopies chopped off and galleries inserted above them. One of the misericords, depicting a boy pulling a thorn from his foot, dates from the 17th century. In 1848 there was a complete rearrangement of the choir furniture, and 61 of the misericords were reused in the restructured <b>stalls.</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{observations on}} compressors, in particular those of Rannie and Iura, have clarified some {{features of the}} phenomenon of <b>stall</b> propagation. Using these observations as a guide, the process of <b>stall</b> in an airfoil cascade has been characterized by a static pressure loss across the cascade which increases discontinuously at the <b>stall</b> angle, the turning angle being affected in only a minor way. Deductions from this simple model yield the essential features of <b>stall</b> propagation such as dependence {{of the extent of}} <b>stalled</b> region upon operating conditions, the pressure loss associated with <b>stall,</b> and the angular velocity of <b>stall</b> propagation. Using two-dimensional approximation for a stationary or rotating blade row, free from interference of adjacent blade rows, extent of the <b>stalled</b> region, the total pressure loss and <b>stall</b> propagation speed are discussed in detail for a general cascade characteristic. Employing these results, the effect of <b>stall</b> propagation upon the performance of a single-stage axial compressor is illustrated and the mechanism of entering the regime of <b>stall</b> propagation is discussed.

40|$|The {{transition}} {{process from}} a diffuser rotating <b>stall</b> to a stage <b>stall</b> in a centrifugal compressor with a vaned diffuser was investigated by experimental and numerical analyses. From the velocity measurements, {{it was found}} that the rotating <b>stall</b> existed on the shroud side of the diffuser passage in the off-design flow condition. The numerical results revealed the typical vortical structure of the diffuser <b>stall.</b> The diffuser <b>stall</b> cell was caused by the systematic vortical structure which consisted of the tornado-type vortex, the longitudinal vortex at the shroud/suction surface corner (i. e., leading edge vortex (LEV)), and the vortex in the throat area of the diffuser passages. Furthermore, the stage <b>stall,</b> which rotated within both the impeller and diffuser passages, occurred instead of the diffuser <b>stall</b> as the mass flow rate was decreased. According to the velocity measurements at the diffuser inlet, the diffuser <b>stall</b> which rotated on the shroud side was shifted to the hub side. Then, the diffuser <b>stall</b> moved into the impeller passages and formed the stage <b>stall.</b> Therefore, the stage <b>stall</b> was caused by the development of the diffuser <b>stall,</b> which transferred from the shroud side to the hub side in the vaneless space and expanded to the impeller passages...|$|R

40|$|A two-spool {{turbojet}} engine was operated in the Lewis {{altitude wind tunnel}} to study the inception of compressor surge. In addition to the usual steady-state pressure and temperature measurements, the compressors were extensively instrumented with fast-response interstage pressure transducers. Thus {{it was possible to}} obtain maps for both compressors, pressure oscillations during rotating <b>stall,</b> effects of <b>stall</b> on efficiency, and stage-loading curves. In addition, with the transient measurements, it was possible to record interstage pressures and then compute stage performance during accelerations to the <b>stall</b> limit. Rotating <b>stall</b> was found to exist at low speeds in the outer spool. Although the <b>stall</b> arose from poor flow conditions at the inlet-stage blade tips, the low-energy air moved through the machine from the tip at the inlet to the outer spool to the hub at the inlet to the inner spool. This tip <b>stall</b> ultimately resulted in compressor surge in the mid-speed region, and necessitated inter-compressor air bleed. Interstage pressure measurements during acceleration to the compressor <b>stall</b> limit indicated that rotating <b>stall</b> was not a necessary condition for compressor surge and that, at the critical <b>stall</b> point, the circumferential interstage pressure distribution was uniform. The exit-stage group of the inner spool was first t o stall; then, the stages upstream <b>stalled</b> in succession until the inlet stage of the outer spool was <b>stalled.</b> With a sufficiently high fuel rate, the process repeated with a cycle time of about 0. 1 second. It was possible to construct reproducible stage <b>stall</b> lines as a function of compressor speed from the stage <b>stall</b> points of several such compressor surges. This transient <b>stall</b> line was checked by computing the <b>stall</b> line from a steady-state stage-loading curve. Good agreement between the stage <b>stall</b> lines was obtained by these two methods...|$|R

Although it is not within the scope of this paper to discuss <b>stalling</b> characteristics, it is desired to point out that in general the danger of inadvertent <b>stalling</b> is greatest with those airplanes that behave worse when the <b>stalling</b> occurs; that is, with airplanes in which the <b>stall</b> starts at the wing tips.
