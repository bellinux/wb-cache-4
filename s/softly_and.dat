25|$|Indirect free-kicks {{can throw}} a defence into {{confusion}} when taken quickly, or in unexpected directions. The third goal of Brazil's 1970 World Cup victory over Italy illustrates the method. Brazil's midfield general Gerson Nunes approached rapidly and lofted the dead ball {{in a high}} arc almost from the midfield line. It found Pele perfectly positioned near the Italian goal. The Brazilian headed down <b>softly</b> <b>and</b> accurately, straight {{into the path of}} the onrushing winger Jairzinho, who virtually walked the ball into the net. Italy's catenaccio defence was caught out of position here, not only failing to neutralise Pele, but providing little cover to stop Jairzinho. A rapid, daring set-piece kick will often accomplish this unbalancing of defences.|$|E

Theodore Roosevelt's administration became involved in the politics of the Caribbean and Central America, with interventions in 1901, 1902, 1903, and 1906. At a speech in 1901, Roosevelt said, [...] "Speak <b>softly</b> <b>and</b> carry a big stick, you will go far", which was a cornerstone of diplomacy during his presidency.|$|E

500|$|Of appearance, {{after meeting}} Nolan for {{an article about}} The Dark Knight Rises, {{journalist}} Jeffrey Ressner described the director as [...] "the picture of Zen-like calm, speaking <b>softly</b> <b>and</b> deliberately about his work." [...] Nolan speaks with an English accent, which supports a more sophisticated impression accentuated by his habit of wearing suits. Professionally, he commonly dresses in a clubbable but also muted ensemble, often wearing a dark and narrow-lapeled jacket over a blue dress shirt. In colder weather, he is observed as carrying a herringbone waistcoat (with the bottom button left open). An article in The New York Times Magazine understood Nolan's clothing style to [...] "split {{the difference between the}} demands of an executive suit and a tundra". Empire declared him [...] "the best dressed director since Hitchcock." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{songs are}} also {{spatially}} arranged and experiment with tension, including listeners' expectations for a hook to unfold, a dance beat to develop, {{and a time}} signature to change. Elements such as drum beats, vocals, and guitar motifs fade to silence throughout the songs. Kitty Empire of The Observer comments that [...] "no pattern here hangs around {{for more than a}} couple of bars, and rarely in multiples of four." [...] Stephen Thompson of NPR comments on the music's lack of dynamism, writing that the band [...] "lets its songs billow out <b>softly</b> <b>and</b> quietly, with only achingly pretty guitar lines to lessen the tension." [...] Michael Hann of The Guardian writes that the album refines the band's [...] "already skeletal frame" [...] and that most of its songs are [...] "defined as much by space as by sound", adding that the music's [...] "gaps bring greater emphasis" [...] to guitar, piano, and vocal elements. Melissa Locker of Time comments that [...] "each sound, be it instrument or voice, is given ample room to exist and to soar." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger advises Lane {{about how}} to ensnare a client at dinner. Roger informs Lane to find the man's source of regret, and make it {{relatable}} to himself, forming a [...] "conspiracy" [...] of feeling between the pair. Pryce's dinner does not go smoothly; the Jaguar representative appears to have no regrets in his life, and Lane is forced to plan another lunch to try again at confirming the new business. Upon hearing of this failure, Pete tactfully tells Lane to maintain a friendly relationship with the target, and to let Accounts take the business from there. Roger compliments Pete's letting Lane down <b>softly</b> <b>and</b> taking the task off his hands, forming a renewed alliance with Pete. At the dinner meeting, Edwin, the Jaguar representative, assures Don, Roger, and Pete they have his business, {{but he wants to}} have some fun. The executives quickly learn what kind of fun Edwin has in mind and they visit a local brothel, where Edwin, Roger, and Pete all cheat on their wives, leaving Don at the bar. Don later shares a cab with Pete on the way home in which the latter, drunk, criticizes Don as hypocritical for judging Pete's adulterous actions. Don explains he is not judging; he merely didn't know Pete was miserable. Pete replies sarcastically that he has everything, and Don warns him not to throw it away.|$|E

500|$|... "Bye Bye" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, and was heavily speculated {{to have become}} Carey's 19th number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. Many reviewers complimented its simple and understated musical arrangement and personalized lyrics, while some felt the song was too simple for an artist of Carey's stature. Jeffrey Mitchell from The Hollywood Reporter {{described it as a}} [...] "high point" [...] on the album, and wrote [...] "Mariah <b>softly</b> <b>and</b> sweetly lamenting the loss of any kind of loved one on the truly touching 'Bye Bye'. Mitchell concluded his review put stock in the song's success, and ended with [...] "Thankfully, it looks like we won’t be saying “bye” to Mariah for a long time." [...] An anonymous journalist writing in for MTV UK called [...] "Bye Bye" [...] a [...] "tear jerking ode to people who have passed away", and assumed it would [...] "have reality pop contestants singing away for decades to come!" [...] The Houston Chronicles Goey Guerra highlighted the song as [...] "truly trademark Mimi", and described it as [...] "a lighters-and-hands-in-the-air tribute to deceased loved ones". Dan Hinkley of Daily News branded it [...] "the album's most potentially personal song", and assured it would become Carey's 19th chart-topping single in the United States. The song received positive response from both Rolling Stones Christian Hoard and Yahoo! Music writer Dann Gennoe, who describes the track as a [...] "piano-based big-voiced" [...] and [...] "lighter-friendly" [...] ballad.

2500|$|After the campaign, Roosevelt {{took office}} as vice {{president}} in March 1901. The office of Vice President was a powerless sinecure and did not suit Roosevelt's aggressive temperament. Roosevelt's six months as Vice President were uneventful, and Roosevelt presided over the Senate for a mere four days before it adjourned. On September 2, 1901, Roosevelt first publicized an aphorism that thrilled his supporters at the Minnesota State Fair: [...] "Speak <b>softly</b> <b>and</b> carry a big stick, and you will go far." ...|$|E

[...] Roosevelt became president just 12 days later after William McKinley was assassinated. In 1925, the Minnesota State Fair was the site of the Norse-American Centennial celebration. During his appearance at the Norse-American Centennial, President Calvin Coolidge gave recognition to the contributions of Scandinavian-Americans and noted Leif Erikson as the discoverer of America.|$|E
2500|$|President Roosevelt famously {{stated that}} [...] "I took the Isthmus, started the canal {{and then left}} Congress not to debate the canal, but to debate me." [...] Several parties in the United States called this {{an act of war}} on Colombia: The New York Times called the support given by the United States to Bunau-Varilla an [...] "act of sordid conquest." [...] The New York Evening Post called it a [...] "vulgar and {{mercenary}} venture." [...] It is often cited as the classic example of U.S. gunboat diplomacy in Latin America, and the best illustration of what Roosevelt meant by the old African adage, [...] "Speak <b>softly</b> <b>and</b> carry a big stick [...] you will go far." [...] After the revolution in 1903, the Republic of Panama became a U.S. protectorate until 1939.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt's [...] "Speak <b>Softly</b> <b>and</b> Carry a Big Stick" [...] {{ideology}} is still quoted by politicians and columnists in different countries—not only in English, {{but also in}} translations to various other languages. Another lasting, popular legacy of Roosevelt is the stuffed toy bears—teddy bears—named after him following an incident on a hunting trip in Mississippi in 1902. Roosevelt has been portrayed in films and television series such as Brighty of the Grand Canyon, The Wind and the Lion, Rough Riders, My Friend Flicka, and Law of the Plainsman.

2500|$|Ruppelt {{concluded}} that Adamski was a talented con artist whose UFO stories {{were designed to}} make money from his gullible followers and listeners, and he compared Adamski to the famed hoaxer, carnival, and circus showman PT Barnum. In describing Adamski's speaking style, Ruppelt wrote [...] "to {{look at the man}} and listen to his story you had an immediate urge to believe him...he was dressed in well-worn, but neat, overalls. He had slightly graying hair and the most honest pair of eyes I've ever seen. He spoke <b>softly</b> <b>and</b> naively, almost pathetically, giving the impression that 'most people think I'm crazy, but honestly, I'm really not.'" [...] According to Ruppelt, Adamski had a persuasive effect on his audience, [...] "you could actually have heard the proverbial pin drop" [...] in the restaurant as Adamski told of his initial 1952 meeting with Orthon. When Adamski finished his story, Ruppelt noted that many of his listeners purchased copies of Adamski's UFO photos that were on sale in the restaurant. At another lecture led by Adamski and other well-known contactees, Ruppelt wrote that [...] "people shelled out hard cash to hear Adamski's story." ...|$|E

Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, who described [...] "Countdown" [...] as a [...] "monogamous romance", added {{that it is a}} love song that is [...] "no less sexy for being unblinkingly true to life", and Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the song is [...] "all about the rapture of true love". Kicking off with a reggae-ish beat, horns and drums, Knowles starts to chant the introductory lines, which also serves as the pre-chorus lines, [...] "Oh, killing me <b>softly</b> <b>and</b> I'm still falling / Still the one I need, I will always be with you / Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go / Say it real loud if you fly / If you leave me you're out of your mind", followed by the chorus lines, which is a literal count backwards where Knowles counts down the ways in which she loves her man, [...] "My baby is a ten / We dressing to the nine / He pick me up at eight / Make me feel so lucky seven / He kiss me in his six / We be making love in five / Still the one I do this four / I’m trying to make a three / From that two / He still the one." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Skull Session, {{fans are}} {{treated to a}} variety of activities. Each week the band's [...] "cheer groups" [...] perform a song {{to go along with the}} {{football}} team's opponent of the week. The cheer groups are selected from their respective sections: Trumpet Cheers (the oldest Cheer Group), Trombone Cheers, Horn Cheers, Baritone Cheers, Stadium Brass (An instrument from every part of the band except percussion), Percussion Cheers (often playing Wipeout) and the Tuba-Fours. At some point after these performances, the football team enters to the sounds of James Swearingen's [...] "Fanfare for a New Era". Immediately after their entrance a pre-selected Senior football player speaks to the band and fans in St. John Arena followed by the head coach. The team then exits to the sounds of [...] "Hang On, Sloopy!" [...] Upon the football team's exit, the band commences with the traditions associated with the Skull Session. This includes performance of [...] "Fight the Team Across the Field" [...] first <b>softly</b> <b>and</b> slowly, and on the repeat of the chorus, at the well-known tempo and dynamics. The band is also known for performing Eternal Father, Strong to Save, otherwise known as The Navy Hymn to formally begin every Skull Session concert. If a visiting college band is in attendance they will perform their pre-game and halftime show, followed by the OSUMB's performance of pre-game and halftime. At every Skull Session, there is a guest Ohio high school marching band. The high school band plays various songs before the Skull Session to entertain the audience waiting the arrival of the OSUMB. During Homecoming, the OSU Athletic Band also performs at Skull Session, trading off with the guest high school band on various pieces of music. The OSU Athletic Band is run by the same band staff as the marching band, and often has many students who perform in both.|$|E
