40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to simulate pressure relief valve <b>seat</b> <b>leakage</b> under conditions of angular and misaligned loading. The model incorporates loading parameters as well as relevant geometric properties of valve components. The model can be implemented to establish tolerable levels of misaligned and angular loading for a valve with a specified set of design parameters. The operating limitations of a 3 / 4 in. inlet by I in. outlet Crosby JMBL valve were evaluated using the model. The limit of angular loading was shown to theoretically be 1. 225 degrees, and the tolerable level of misalignment was shown to be 0. 0167 inches. The disc radius and {{the distance from the}} point of load application to the disc sealing surface were varied independently to link valve performance trends to these parameter values. Increasing the disc radius was shown to minimize <b>seat</b> <b>leakage</b> under a specified set of loading conditions. Decreasing the distance between load application and the disc sealing surface was shown to further reduce <b>seat</b> <b>leakage.</b> Concerns about implementing these design modifications are discussed, and appropriate recommendations for design nuld testing are submitted...|$|E

A detailed review of historical failure data available through the Institute of Nuclear Power Operation`s Nuclear Plant Reliability Data System has been conducted for several types of MSIVs and valve operators for both boiling-water reactors and pressurized-water reactors.

40|$|The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, {{is funding}} the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in {{performing}} research investigating {{the performance of}} gate valves subjected to pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. Pressure locking and thermal binding are phenomena that make a closed gate valve difficult to open. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause {{the pressure of the}} fluid in the bonnet (and, in most gate valves, between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the disc assembly. Thermal binding can occur when thermal expansion/contraction effects cause the disc to be squeezed between the valve body seats. If the loads associated with pressure locking or thermal binding are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The authors tested a flexible-wedge gate valve and a double-disc gate valve under pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. The results show that these valves are susceptible to pressure locking; however, they are not significantly affected by thermal binding. For the flexible-wedge gate valve, pressure locking loads (in terms of stem thrust) were higher than corresponding hydrostatic opening loads by a factor of 1. 1 to 1. 5. For the parallel disc gate valve, pressure locking loads were higher by a factor of 2. 05 to 2. 4. The results also show that <b>seat</b> <b>leakage</b> affects the bonnet pressurization rate when the valve is subjected to thermally induced pressure locking conditions...|$|E

40|$|In {{nuclear power}} plants, many valves are {{operated}} under harsh {{conditions such as}} high temperature-high pressure and radiation environments but high levels of reliability are required from valves for safety operation of the power plant. However, deterioration of valve parts due to power plant aging and the system's transient phenomena due to rapid load shift operation are acting as obstacles that impede securing valve reliability. To secure valve reliability, quality in design/production stages and intended performance under the worst operation conditions shall be assured. Also, {{it is necessary to}} meet the reliability level given in the specified environment conditions and to perform the designed functions throughout its lifetime without failure. Meanwhile, to enhance the safety and the operation of nuclear power plants, it is important to early detect the deterioration of valve performance and take measures quickly. However the mechanical defects of valves are occurs suddenly in various types and {{it is very difficult to}} predict them. Valves which are responsible for the important functions of nuclear power plants are confirmed performance and durability before the installation. However, the performance degradation and defects of the valve are occurs during plant operating. Therefore, to ensure that the valves perform their designed functions for the requested period without failure, it is important to demonstrate their reliability in all stages such as design, production, and operation. The purpose of this paper is the best preventive maintenance and life cycle management, including comprehensive quality control measures established in the valves. Therefore, the performance verification through performance validation tests were performed on air operated valves most commonly used in nuclear power plants. In addition, the leakage and stroke time were measured by performing an accelerated life test (thermal aging, radiation exposure, mechanical cycling) under the operating conditions of the power plants. Results show that the thermal aging of valves has significant effects on the valve <b>seat</b> and stem <b>leakage</b> but it has almost no effect on the actuator leakage and the stroke time. Meanwhile, it is found that the radiation and mechanical aging of valves have no clear effect on the leakage and stroke time of valves...|$|R

The {{focus is on}} spacecraft carrying multiple science instruments and power systems that will allow extended operations on the lunar surface or other air-less bodies in the solar system. Initial trade studies of launch vehicle options indicate the spacecraft will be significantly mass and volume constrained. Because of the investment by the DOD in low mass, highly volume efficient components, NASA has investigated the potential integration {{of some of these}} technologies in space science applications. A 10, 000 psig helium pressure regulator test activity has been conducted as part of the overall risk reduction testing for the RLL spacecraft. The regulator was subjected to typical NASA acceptance testing to assess the regulator response to the expected RLL mission requirements. The test results show the regulator can supply helium at a stable outlet pressure of 740 psig within a +/- 5 % tolerance band and maintain a lock-up pressure less than the + 5 % above nominal outlet pressure for all tests conducted. Numerous leak tests demonstrated leakage less than 10 - 3 standard cubic centimeters per second (SCCS) for the internal <b>seat</b> <b>leakage</b> at lock-up and less than 10 - 5 SCCS for external leakage through the regulator body. The successful test has shown the potential for 10, 000 psig helium systems in NASA spacecraft and has reduced risk associated with hardware availability and hardware ability to meet RLL mission requirements...|$|E

This paper discusses only the pressure locking phenomenon in a flexible-wedge gate valve; we will publish {{the results of our}} thermal binding research at a later date. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause the pressure of the fluid in the bonnet (and, in most valves, between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the disc assembly. This high fluid pressure presses the discs against both seats, making the disc assembly harder to unseat than anticipated by the typical design calculations, which generally consider friction at only one of the two disc/seat interfaces. The high pressure of the bonnet fluid also changes the pressure distribution around the disc in a way that can further contribute to the unseating load. If the combined loads associated with pressure locking are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The results of the NRC/INEL research discussed in this paper show that the relationship between bonnet pressure and pressure locking stem loads appears linear. The results also show that for this valve, <b>seat</b> <b>leakage</b> affects the bonnet pressurization rate when the valve is subjected to thermally induced pressure locking conditions...|$|E

These {{missions}} focus on spacecraft carrying multiple science instruments and power systems {{that will allow}} extended operations on the lunar surface. Initial trade studies of launch vehicle options for these mission concepts indicate that the spacecraft design will be significantly mass-constrained. To minimize mass and facilitate efficient packaging, the notional propulsion system for these landers has a baseline of an ultra-high pressure (10, 000 psig) helium pressurization system {{that has been used}} on Defense missiles. The qualified regulator is capable of short duration use; however, the hardware has not been previously tested at NASA spacecraft requirements with longer duration. Hence, technical risks exist in using this missile-based propulsion component for spacecraft applications. A 10, 000 -psig helium pressure regulator test activity is being carried out as part of risk reduction testing for MSFC RLLD project. The goal of the test activity is to assess the feasibility of commercial off-the-shelf ultra-high pressure regulator by testing with a representative flight mission profile. Slam-start, gas blowdown, water expulsion, lock-up, and leak tests are also performed on the regulator to assess performance under various operating conditions. The preliminary test results indicated that the regulator can regulate helium to a stable outlet pressure of 740 psig within the +/- 5 % tolerance band and maintain a lock-up pressure less than + 5 % for all tests conducted. Numerous leak tests demonstrated leakage less than 10 - 3 standard cubic centimeters per second (SCCS) for internal <b>seat</b> <b>leakage</b> at lock-up and less than 10 - 5 SCCS for external leakage through the regulator ambient reference cavity.
