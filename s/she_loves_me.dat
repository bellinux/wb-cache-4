25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore <b>she</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me</b> alone.|$|E

Tom Stoppard's Travesties, with Antony Sher was next, and in 1994 the musical <b>She</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>Me</b> played, with Ruthie Henshall and John Gordon Sinclair.

[...] She's wonderful, <b>she</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me</b> and I love her." [...] In the on-screen story, the dog is named after Pauline's aunt Betty, but in reality, Wendy Richard named her after Mollie Sugden's fictional character Betty Slocombe, who appeared along with Richard's Shirley Brahms in the sitcom, Are You Being Served? ...|$|E
500|$|Aubrey {{announced}} plans for faster and cheaper movies, none of which would have a budget above $1 million, {{but many of these}} inexpensive films bombed with critics and audiences. [...] One notable success was the Richard Roundtree film Shaft, which cost $1 million and grossed around $12 million at the box office. Agent Sue Mengers said he was a very tough dealmaker. [...] "I'd rather go to bed with him than negotiate with him." [...] Upon assuming his MGM post, Aubrey almost immediately canceled production on two Julie Andrews pictures, <b>She</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>Me</b> and Say It With Music, the late 1960s fad for musicals having ended. He also clashed with David Lean, whose production of Ryan's Daughter was running overbudget, in early 1970, attempting to cancel or at least scale down the film; but Lean held too much sway for Aubrey's actions to have any effect.|$|E
500|$|In his memoirs, Ernst {{said he had}} {{difficulty}} persuading Elisabeth to visit her mother. Before one visit, he found the child [...] "whimpering under a sofa, full of despair." [...] He assured Elisabeth that her mother loved her too. [...] "Mama says <b>she</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me,</b> but you do love me," [...] Elisabeth replied. Margaret Eagar thought the child's eyes were the saddest she had ever seen. [...] "Looking at her I used to wonder what those wide grey-blue eyes saw, to bring such a look of sadness to the childish face," [...] she wrote. Eagar wondered if Elisabeth had a premonition of her own death because she often told her cousin Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia that [...] "I shall never see this again." [...] However, despite Elisabeth's sad eyes, she was generally a sweet, happy child who was a peacemaker when her cousins had a dispute.|$|E

500|$|After her divorce, Victoria went to {{live with}} her mother at Coburg and at her house in the French Riviera. She and Ernst shared custody of Elisabeth, who spent six months of each year with each parent. Elisabeth blamed Victoria for the divorce and Victoria had a {{difficult}} time reconnecting with her daughter. Ernst wrote in his memoirs that Elisabeth hid under a sofa, crying, before one visit to her mother. Ernst assured the child that her mother loved her too. Elisabeth responded, [...] "Mama says <b>she</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me,</b> but you do love me." [...] Ernst remained silent and didn't correct the child's impression. Elisabeth died at age eight and a half of typhoid fever during a November 1903 visit to Tsar Nicholas II and his family at their Polish hunting lodge. The doctor advised the Tsar's family to notify the child's mother of her illness, but the Tsarina delayed in sending a telegram. Victoria received the final telegram notifying her of the child's death just as she was preparing to travel to Poland to be at her bedside. At Elisabeth's funeral, Victoria removed her Hessian Order, a medallion, and placed it on her daughter's coffin as a final gesture [...] "that she had made a final break with her old home." ...|$|E
500|$|Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail hailed [...] "Belle" [...] as [...] "one of {{the most}} {{delightful}} openings of any movie musical". The New York Times Janet Maslin was very enthusiastic about the song, praising {{the way in which}} it advances the film's plot, while describing [...] "Belle" [...] as [...] "a spectacular opening number that captures the essence of this film's appeal." [...] Additionally, Maslin drew similarities between [...] "Belle" [...] and some of the songs featured in the musical film West Side Story (1961). Beliefnet called the song a [...] "joyous introductory". Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press liked both the song and its reprise, admitting to the inevitability of having to experience an [...] "unexpected swell of emotion" [...] when both songs are heard. Highlighting the song as one of the film's most [...] notable, Sandie Angulo Chen described [...] "Belle" [...] as an [...] "infectious" [...] song [...] "that reveals how different Belle is from the other Disney heroines". While describing the song as a [...] "teeming ... opener", TV Guide positively compared [...] "Belle" [...] to some of the songs featured in the musicals Fiddler on the Roof and <b>She</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>Me.</b> James Berardinelli of ReelViews described [...] "Belle" [...] as [...] "the animated equivalent of Broadway show-stoppers, with all the energy and audacity of something choreographed by Busby Berkeley." [...] Similarly, the New York Posts Lou Lumenick also hailed [...] "Belle" [...] as a [...] "show-stopper".|$|E

The album has sold over 500,000 copies and has been certified gold. The album features a bigger focus on singing over rapping, though the band retained their nu metal sound. The album had two singles which were <b>She</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>Me</b> Not and [...] Time and Time Again, both had rapping and both had the rap metal sound of Infest.

2500|$|The Kennedy Center held a Sondheim Celebration, {{running from}} May to August 2002, {{consisting}} of six of Sondheim's musicals: Sweeney Todd, Company, Sunday in the Park With George, Merrily We Roll Along, Passion and A Little Night Music. On April 28, 2002, {{in connection with}} the Sondheim Celebration Sondheim and Frank Rich of the New York Times had a conversation. They appeared in four interviews, entitled [...] "A Little Night Conversation with Stephen Sondheim", in California and Portland, Oregon in March 2008 and at Oberlin College in September. The Cleveland Jewish News reported on their Oberlin appearance: [...] "Sondheim said: 'Movies are photographs; the stage is larger than life.' What musicals does Sondheim admire the most? Porgy and Bess tops a list which includes Carousel, <b>She</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>Me,</b> and The Wiz, which he saw six times. Sondheim took a dim view of today's musicals. What works now, he said, are musicals that are easy to take; audiences don't want to be challenged". Sondheim and Rich had additional conversations on January 18, 2009 at Avery Fisher Hall, on February 2 at the Landmark Theatre in Richmond, Virginia, on February 21 at the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia and on April 20 at the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio. The conversations were reprised at Tufts and Brown University in February 2010, at the University of Tulsa in April and at Lafayette College on March 8, 2011. Sondheim had another [...] "conversation with" [...] Sean Patrick Flahaven (associate editor of The Sondheim Review) at the Kravis Center in West Palm Beach on February 4, 2009, in which he discussed many of his songs and shows: [...] "On the perennial struggles of Broadway: 'I don't see any solution for Broadway's problems except subsidized theatre, as in most civilized countries of the world.'" ...|$|E
