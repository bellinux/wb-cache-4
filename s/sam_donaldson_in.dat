5000|$|Over {{the course}} of time, WEOL's news and sports {{department}} has garnered dozens of awards from the Ohio Associated Press and Cleveland Press Club, particularly [...] "Outstanding News Operation" [...] in large market radio. On November 28, 1997, WEOL dropped its MOR format for a [...] "news all day, sports at night" [...] approach with the Associated Press All News Radio network from 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., and One-on-One Sports (today SB Nation Radio) from 7:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m., along with long-form local news programming in drive-time hours. WEOL was re-branded as [...] "The News Station," [...] taking its cue from the All News Radio positioners. WEOL started to segue into airing topical talk programming by adding Clark Howard in the late 90s, Jim Bohannon in 2000, <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> <b>in</b> 2001, and Mitch Albom's show in early 2003. In May 2005, WEOL picked up Glenn Beck in the late morning slot, {{one year after the}} cancellation of Sam Donaldson's talk show. At the beginning of 2006, WEOL replaced Mitch Albom, whose show was no longer distributed nationally, with Sean Hannity. Hannity's show was dropped from the lineup at the end of 2016, and ultimately replaced with a local news/interview program hosted by area broadcaster Andy [...] "Bull" [...] Barch.|$|E

50|$|As {{the shuttle}} program {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly. Christa McAuliffe {{was chosen as the}} first Teacher in Space in July 1985 from 11,400 applicants. 1,700 applied for the Journalist in Space program, including Walter Cronkite, Tom Brokaw, Tom Wolfe, and <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson.</b> An Artist <b>in</b> Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe's flight two to three civilians a year would fly on the shuttle. After McAuliffe was killed in the Challenger disaster in January 1986 the programs were canceled. McAuliffe's backup, Barbara Morgan, eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on STS-118 as a mission specialist. A second journalist-in-space program, in which NASA green-lighted Miles O'Brien to fly on the space shuttle, was scheduled to be announced in 2003. That program was canceled {{in the wake of the}} Columbia disaster on STS-107 and subsequent emphasis on finishing the International Space Station before retiring the space shuttle.|$|R

5000|$|The {{documentary}} Framing an Execution: The Media & Mumia Abu-Jamal {{looks at}} the way <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> from the ABC program 20/20 covered the case. Many scholars believe that Mumia is a political prisoner and is only in jail because of his specific views and criticisms of how the police {{have dealt with the}} black community. This case only got recognition after people continued to dispute that Mumia's trial was fair or lawful, {{to the extent that it}} reached national and international attention. 20/20 begins to tell this case as an emotional story, making people see it as if it isn't that important. <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> starts his interviewing with the widow, Maureen Faulkner. She is seen as a damsel in distress, which makes it easier to sympathize with her. From the beginning we know the specific angle of ABC News and where the bias of <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> comes from. ABC stated in their letter sent to the Pennsylvania prison authorities when trying to get an interview with Mumia that they were [...] "currently working in conjunction with Maureen Faulkner and the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of the Police." ...|$|R
