5|$|Elemental iodine is <b>slightly</b> <b>soluble</b> in water, {{with one}} gram {{dissolving}} in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E
5|$|Neptunocene, Np(C8H8)2, was {{synthesized}} in 1970 by reacting neptunium(IV) chloride with K2(C8H8). It is isomorphous to uranocene and plutonocene, {{and they}} behave chemically identically: all three compounds are insensitive to water or dilute bases but {{are sensitive to}} air, reacting quickly to form oxides, and are only <b>slightly</b> <b>soluble</b> in benzene and toluene. Other known neptunium cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives include Np(RC8H7)2 (R = ethanol, butanol) and KNp(C8H8)·2THF, which is isostructural to the corresponding plutonium compound. In addition, neptunium hydrocarbyls have been prepared, and solvated triiodide complexes of neptunium are a precursor to many organoneptunium and inorganic neptunium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Selenium forms several allotropes that interconvert with {{temperature}} changes, depending somewhat on {{the rate}} of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually an amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads. The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is <b>slightly</b> <b>soluble</b> in CS2. Upon heating, it softens at 50°C and converts to gray selenium at 180°C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 121 g of KOH will {{dissolve}} in 100 mL {{of water}} at room temperature compared with 100 g of NaOH in the same volume (on a molar basis, KOH is <b>slightly</b> less <b>soluble</b> than NaOH). Lower molecular weight alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and propanols are also excellent solvents.|$|R
500|$|Commercial {{zirconium}} metal typically contains 1–3% of hafnium, {{which is usually}} not problematic because the chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are very similar. [...] Their neutron-absorbing properties differ strongly, however, necessitating the separation of hafnium from zirconium for nuclear reactors. [...] Several separation schemes are in use.

5000|$|Cannabis {{can also}} be {{consumed}} as a cannabis tea. Although THC is lipophilic and only <b>slightly</b> water <b>soluble</b> (with a solubility of 2.8 mg per liter), [...] enough THC can be dissolved to make a mildly psychoactive tea. However, water-based infusions are {{generally considered to be}} an inefficient use of the herb. However, bhang, a decoction of cannabis and spices in milk, averts the issue, as milk contains the fat in which the THC is soluble and first dissolved by cooking in ghee.|$|R
5|$|Plutonium {{can form}} alloys and {{intermediate}} compounds with most other metals. Exceptions include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals; and magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium of the alkaline earth metals; and europium and ytterbium {{of the rare}} earth metals. Partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and tungsten, which are soluble in liquid plutonium, but insoluble or only <b>slightly</b> <b>soluble</b> in solid plutonium. Gallium, aluminium, americium, scandium and cerium can stabilize the δ phase of plutonium for room temperature. Silicon, indium, zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable δ state when rapidly cooled. High amounts of hafnium, holmium and thallium also allows some retention of the δ phase at room temperature. Neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the α phase at higher temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only <b>slightly</b> <b>soluble</b> in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|As pH {{rises above}} 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form {{and as it}} rises above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous iron(III) oxide {{precipitates}} out of solution. Although Fe3+ has an d5 configuration, its absorption spectrum is not like that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region. On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II) carbonate being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the <b>slightly</b> <b>soluble</b> bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form iron(III) oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.|$|E

40|$|Adsorption {{behaviour}} of pyrene was {{studied at}} different model interfaces (air/water, air/lipid monolayer, mercury electrode/solution interface and lipid coated electrodes), {{with the aim}} to evaluate the most relevant processes influencing the distribution and effects of highly hydrophobic and <b>slightly</b> water <b>soluble</b> organic contaminants in natural aquatic systems. Studies have been performed by absorption, reflection and fluorescence spectroscopy, surface pressure and surface potential measurements and electrochemical methods. It was found that pyrene molecules incorporate into the hydrophobic core of lipid monolayers, thus influencing the charge and mass transfer through monolayers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{estimator}} for {{the on-line}} monitoring of emulsion terpolymerization is presented. A high gain observer {{is used to}} estimate the individual monomer conversions, the instantaneous and cumulative terpolymer composition, and {{the total number of}} moles of radicals in the polymer particles on-line. The estimator requires the input of the overall conversion. This input is obtained by calorimetry in the current case, but can be provided by any other type of in-line probe. The estimator has been experimentally validated (on- and offline) for hydrophobic and <b>slightly</b> water <b>soluble</b> monomers, in 3 liter and 250 liter pilot scale reactors. The results obtained demonstrate the usefulness of the high gain approach...|$|R
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of moscovium {{in aqueous solution}} should essentially be that of the Mc+ and Mc3+ ions. The former should be easily hydrolyzed and not be easily complexed with halides, cyanide, and ammonia. Moscovium(I) hydroxide (McOH), carbonate (Mc2CO3), oxalate (Mc2C2O4), and fluoride (McF) should be soluble in water; the sulfide (Mc2S) should be insoluble; and the chloride (McCl), bromide (McBr), iodide (McI), and thiocyanate (McSCN) should be only <b>slightly</b> <b>soluble,</b> so that adding excess hydrochloric acid would not noticeably affect the solubility of moscovium(I) chloride. Mc3+ should be about as stable as Tl3+ and hence should also be {{an important part of}} moscovium chemistry, although its closest homolog among the elements should be its lighter congener Bi3+. Moscovium(III) fluoride (McF3) and thiozonide (McS3) should be insoluble in water, similar to the corresponding bismuth compounds, while moscovium(III) chloride (McCl3), bromide (McBr3), and iodide (McI3) should be readily soluble and easily hydrolyzed to form oxyhalides such as McOCl and McOBr, again analogous to bismuth. Both moscovium(I) and moscovium(III) should be common oxidation states and their relative stability should depend greatly on what they are complexed with and the likelihood of hydrolysis.|$|E

50|$|As {{described}} by the Food Chemicals Codex 7th edition, SSL is a cream-colored powder or brittle solid. SSL is currently manufactured by the esterification of stearic acid with lactic acid and partially neutralized with either food-grade soda ash (sodium carbonate) or caustic soda (concentrated sodium hydroxide). Commercial grade SSL {{is a mixture of}} sodium salts of stearoyl lactylic acids and minor proportions of other sodium salts of related acids. The HLB for SSL is 10-12. SSL is <b>slightly</b> hygroscopic, <b>soluble</b> in ethanol and in hot oil or fat, and dispersible in warm water. These properties are the reason that SSL is an excellent emulsifier for fat-in-water emulsions and can also function as a humectant.|$|R
40|$|A hydrophobic/amino {{functionalized}} {{derivative of}} hyaluronic acid (HA-EDA-C 18) has been processed by salt leaching technique as porous scaffold without need of chemical crosslinking. Aim {{of this work}} is to demonstrate the improved versatility of HA-EDA-C 18 in terms of processing and biological functionalization. In particular, the chemical procedure to tether thiol bearing RGD peptide has been described. Moreover, the possibility to load and to control the release of <b>slightly</b> water <b>soluble</b> effectors has been demonstrated by using dexamethasone. First, the swelling and degradation profiles of the scaffolds have been investigated, then the evaluation of metabolic activity of bovine chondrocytes, the histological analysis, and microscope observations has been performed to evaluate cellular adhesion and proliferation {{as well as the}} production of collagen type II...|$|R
50|$|It is also {{important}} to mention that only the L- isomer of the photo-leucine amino acid is synthetized. The reason for this {{lies in the fact that}} all human amino acids are found in the L form, and, therefore, if photo-leucine has to be introduced in human samples it is imperative for it to be in the L form. Currently, it's not fully know why all the human amino acids are found in the L- form, however, evidence suggests that L- amino acids are <b>slightly</b> more <b>soluble</b> than is the racemic mixture of D- and L- amino acids, which tends to form crystals. This small solubility difference could have been amplified over time to the point where the L- isomer became dominant in the solution.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{hexamethylene}} diisocyanate (HMDIC) as a crosslinking agent for dermal sheep collagen (DSC) was studied. Because HMDIC is on ly <b>slightly</b> water <b>soluble,</b> a surfactant {{was used to}} obtain a clear and micellar crosslinking solution and to promote the penetration of HMDIC in the DSC matrix. Using optimized conditions treatment of non-crosslinked DSC (N-DSC) with HMDIC (H-DSC) increased the shrinkage temperature (T-s) of N-DSC from 56 degrees C to 74 degrees C for H-DSC. A linear relation between the decrease in free amine group content {{and the increase in}} T-s was observed. Crosslinking with HMDIC did not influence the tensile strength of the N-DSC samples but increased the elongation at break from 141 % to 163 % and decreased the high-strain modulus from 26 MPa to 16 MPa for the H-DSC samples, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Distribution {{and damage}} of Scaptomyza nigrita Wheeler on its host (bittercress, Cardamine cordifolia A. Gray), a native {{perennial}} crucifer, were examined over two growing seasons {{in relation to}} leaf position. Concentrations of defensive compounds (glucosinolates) and of nutritive compounds (total nitrogen, free amino acids, soluble carbohydrates) were also examined. The fly-host plant relationship was studied in sun and shade habitats at two sites. Oviposition and leaf-mining damage were concentrated on the lower central leaves of a stem in both habitats. These mature leaves have lower glucosinolate concentrations than new leaves. Adult densities and larval feeding damage were consistently and significantly greater on plants in the sun than on those in the shade. Higher S. nigrita densities in the sun habitat and <b>slightly</b> higher <b>soluble</b> carbohydrate concentrations in sun leaves {{at the beginning of}} the growing season, rather than variation in defensive glucosinolate levels, are the most likely mechanisms determining higher levels of leaf mining on host plants in the sun habitat...|$|R
40|$|The project {{started with}} {{studying}} the unique {{characteristics of the}} zwitterionic drug (norfloxacin), considered {{as an example of}} very <b>slightly</b> water <b>soluble</b> drug. The study focused on the effects of its chemical structure on its interaction with surfactants (PEG 200 and Synperonic TM PE/L- 61) in liquisolid systems and, consequently, on its release into water dissolution medium. The next stage was an approach to solve the problems of the dissolution, compressibility and flowability of norfloxacin liquisolid formulations through adding water as a liquid binder to make wet granulated liquisolid formulations. The water in the liquisolid formulations works as a liquid binder to the carrier and coating particles, creating a wider space inside their structure, which allows the amount of the liquid vehicle (PEG 200 and Synperonic TM PE/L- 61) to increase inside the formulations. This feature reflects positively on the flowability (decreasing the angle of the slide), compressibility (increasing the load factor) and the dissolution behaviour of norfloxacin (increasing drug release to more than 20...|$|R

40|$|Autoradiographic {{analysis}} and gas chromatography {{were used to}} measure the solubility in silicate melts of CO-CO 2 vapors (30 to 40 % CO by thermodynamic calculation) in equilibrium with graphite at temperatures up to 1700 deg C and pressures to 30 kbar. At near-liquidus temperatures CO-CO 2 vapors were found to be <b>slightly</b> more <b>soluble</b> than CO 2 alone. As a result of the apparently negative temperature dependence of CO solubility, the solubility of CO-CO 2 at superliquidus temperatures is less than that of CO 2. Melting points of two silicates were depressed more by CO than by CO 2. Phase boundary orientations suggest that CO/CO + CO 2 is greater in the liquid than in the vapor. The effect of the presence of CO on periodotite phase relations was investigated, and it was found that melts containing both CO and CO 2 are nearly as polymerized as those containing only CO 2. These results suggest that crystallization processes in planetary interiors can be expected to be about the same, whether the melts contain CO 2 alone or CO 2 and CO...|$|R

The viscosity and turbidity of guava juice pressurized at 600 MPa and 25 degrees C for 10 min increased slightly; whereas the viscosity of juice heated at 95 degrees C for 5 min decreased while turbidity increased. There were no apparent changes in water soluble, oxalate soluble and alkali soluble pectin in pressurized juice. However, heat treatment of juice decreased water and alkali <b>soluble</b> pectins and <b>slightly</b> increased oxalate <b>soluble</b> pectin.

40|$|Background: Fenoprofen calcium {{dehydrate}} (FCD) is {{counted as}} a non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic drug. FCD is <b>slightly</b> water <b>soluble.</b> It is indicated for mild pain relief, where the suggested dosage is 200 mg orally every 4 to 6 h. Aim: Reduce dissolution efficiency, reach an extended therapeutic effect {{and reduce the}} frequency of the drug side effects. Method: Combination of the co-evaporated drug:triacetyl-β-cyclodextrin complex prepared in a ratio of 1 : 3 and either of two polymers—hydroxylpropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) or ethyl cellulose (EC) —in the same formulation. In vitro dissolution studies were carried in simulated gastric (pH 1. 2) and intestinal (pH 6. 8) fluids, by using the USP dissolution tester (rotating paddle apparatus). The FCD in vitro release from EC/drug complex was markedly retarded. Interaction between fenoprofen, TA-β-CD, EC, HPMC in the solid state were confirmed by FT-IR, DSC, XRD and SEM. In vivo studies assessed the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities and the results were compared with the market product Nalfosab® Capsules. Results: Remarkable inhibition of inflammation and nociception after 24 h was attained for EC/drug complex. Conclusions: EC/drug complex has a sustained effect due to high remaining amount after elapsing with remarkable inhibition of inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Solubility {{profiles}} of uranium dusts in a uranium recycling plant {{were determined by}} performing in vitro solubility tests on breathing zone air samples conducted in all process areas of the processing plant. The recycling plant produces high density shields, closed end tubes that are punch and formed from uranium sheet metal, and high-fired uranium oxide which {{is used as a}} catalyst. The recycled uranium is cut, melted in a vacuum furnace, and part of the molten uranium is poured into molds for further processing. Air samples were taken in process areas under normal working conditions. The dissolution rate of the uranium in a simulant solution of extracellular airway lining fluid (Gamble's solution) was then determined over the next 28 d. Airborne uranium in the oxide section of the plant was found to be highly insoluble with 99 % of the uranium having a dissolution half time in excess of 100 d. The solubility of the airborne uranium {{in other areas of the}} facility was only <b>slightly</b> more <b>soluble</b> with over 90 % of the airborne uranium having dissolution half-times in excess of 90 days...|$|R
40|$|A natural gum, damar was {{investigated}} as a novel microencapsulating material for sustained drug delivery. Microparticles were prepared by oil-in-oil emulsion solvent evaporation method. Ibuprofen and diltiazem hydrochloride {{were used as}} model drugs. Microparticles were evaluated for particle size, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release kinetics. Images of the microparticles were obtained by bright field microscopy. The effect of different gum:drug ratios and solubility of drug on microparticle properties was principally investigated. Gum damar could produce discrete and spherical microparticles with both drugs. With a freely water soluble drug (diltiazem hydrochloride), gum damar produced bigger (45 - 50 &#x 00 B 5;m) and fast drug releasing microparticles with low encapsulation efficiencies (44 - 57 &#x 0025;). Contrary, with a <b>slightly</b> water <b>soluble</b> drug (ibuprofen), gum damar produced small (24 - 33 &#x 00 B 5;m) microparticles with better drug encapsulation (85 - 91 &#x 0025;) and sustained drug delivery. The increase in gum:drug ratio showed an increase in particle size, encapsulation efficiency and decrease in drug release rate in all cases. Drug release profiles of all microparticles followed zero order kinetics. In conclusion, gum damar can be used successfully to produce discrete and spherical microparticles of ibuprofen and diltiazem hydrochloride...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} the new crown-shaped heteropolyanion [As 8 W 48 O 184](40 -) was investigated. Compared to the analogous complex [P 8 W 48 O 184](40 -) [As 8 W 48 O 184](40 -) displayed a close similar behavior. As previously reported for [P 8 W 48 O 184](40 -), [As 8 W 48 O 184](40 -) {{is found to be}} stable in a large range of pH, roughly from 0 to 8 and found to be <b>slightly</b> more <b>soluble</b> than [P 8 W 48 O 184](40 -). Comparison between the cyclic voltammetry curves of the two complexes reveals that the potentials of the redox waves of [As 8 W 48 O 184](40 -) are slightly shifted towards the positive values. Contrary to the high dependence of [P 8 W 48 O 184](40 -) to buffer capacity of the supporting electrolyte, interestingly, [As 8 W 48 O 184](40 -) displays less sensitivity. The numerous possibilities for chemical applications opened up by the electrochemistry of this new complex are exemplified here by the good linear relationship between the peak potentials of the redox waves as a function of pH and, by the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrite.
