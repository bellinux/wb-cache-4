5|$|Rhabdomyolysis is {{recognized}} in horses. Horses {{can develop a}} number of muscle disorders, many of which may progress to rhabdomyolysis. Of these, some cause isolated attacks of rhabdomyolysis (e.g., dietary deficiency in vitamin E and selenium, poisoning associated with pasture or agricultural poisons such as organophosphates), while others predispose to exertional rhabdomyolysis (e.g., the hereditary condition equine polysaccharide storage myopathy). 5–10% of thoroughbred horses and some standardbred horses <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> condition equine exertional rhabdomyolysis; no specific cause has been identified, but an underlying muscle calcium regulation disorder is suspected.|$|E

5|$|Imperatritsa Mariya {{proved to}} be very bow-heavy in service and tended to ship large amounts of water through her forward casemates. The {{ammunition}} for the forward 12-inch guns was reduced from 100 to 70 rounds each while the 130mm ammunition was reduced from 245 to 100 rounds per gun {{in an attempt to}} compensate for her trim. This did not fully cure the problem, but Imperatritsa Mariya was lost before any other changes could be implemented. This did not fully cure the problem so Volias, as she was known by then, forward pair of 130mm guns were removed while she was fitting out. Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya did not <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same degree of trim by the bow by virtue of her greater size and retained her forward guns.|$|E

5|$|The average Soviet soldier {{suffered}} from inexperience. With the Soviet debacle {{of the previous}} year ameliorated only by the barest victory at Moscow, most of the original manpower of the Red Army had been killed, wounded or captured by the Germans, with casualties of almost 1,000,000 just from the Battle of Moscow. The typical soldier in the Red Army was a conscript and had little to no combat experience, and tactical training was practically nonexistent. Coupled with the lack of trained soldiers, the Red Army also began to <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> loss of Soviet industrial areas, and a temporary strategic defense was considered necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> side reaction described above. On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the residual acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture interferes with the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters. Therefore, for the {{synthesis of}} OPS, it is advisable to conduct the sulfurization step prior to the capping step.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} positioning, the 5th Parachute Brigade was largely {{protected}} by the 6th Airborne Division's other units, and did not <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> almost constant German attempts to dislodge the division. However, the 12th Parachute Battalion was attacked on 7June by seven tanks and an infantry company. The attack was beaten off {{for the loss of}} three tanks, but caused several casualties amongst 'A' Company, including the crew of their only supporting 6pounder anti-tank gun. Later the same day during an attack on the 13th Parachute Battalion, three German self-propelled guns were destroyed, and the next day the battalion destroyed another six attacking tanks. The 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment arrived by sea later in the day, and took over the 12th Parachute Battalion's position. The 7th and 12th Parachute Battalions and the 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry now formed the divisional reserve. Elements from three German formations were responsible for the attacks on the division; the 21st Panzer Division and the 346th and 711th Infantry Divisions.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 51 {{provides}} {{a detailed account}} of Ragnarök interspersed with various quotes from Völuspá, while chapters 52 and 53 describe the aftermath of these events. In Chapter 51, High states that the first sign of Ragnarök will be Fimbulwinter, during which time three winters will arrive without a summer, and the sun will be useless. High details that, prior to these winters, three earlier winters will have occurred, marked with great battles throughout the world. During this time, greed will cause brothers to kill brothers, and fathers and sons will <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> collapse of kinship bonds. High then quotes stanza 45 of Völuspá. Next, High describes that the wolf will swallow the sun, then his brother will swallow the moon, and mankind will consider the occurrence as a great disaster resulting in much ruin. The stars will disappear. The earth and mountains will shake so violently that the trees will come loose from the soil, the mountains will topple, and all restraints will break, causing Fenrir to break free from his bonds.|$|E
5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E
50|$|As {{they cross}} the Himalayas, Draupadi is {{the first person to}} die. Bhima asks Yudhishthira why Draupadi died early and couldn't {{continue}} the journey to heaven. Yudhishthira claims that Draupadi <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vice of partiality, in her affections for Arjuna. The remaining Pandavas continue their journey. Next, Sahadeva dies on the way. Yudhishthira explains Sahadeva like his other brothers was virtuous in every respect, except he <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vice of pride and vanity, thought none was equal to him in wisdom. The brothers continue on their way to Mount Meru. Nakula dies next. Yudhishthira explains that Nakula also <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vice of pride and vanity, thinking he was the most handsome person in the world. Arjuna is the next person to die without completing the journey. Yudhishthira explains to Bhima, Arjuna too <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vice of pride and vanity, thinking he was the most skilled, most powerful warrior in the world. Yudhishthira, Bhima and the dog continue forward.|$|R

5|$|The 48th Panzer Corps {{had fewer}} than 100 {{serviceable}} modern tanks to combat Soviet armor. Furthermore, they lacked fuel, and {{the shortage of}} tanks forced commanders to organize tank crews into infantry companies; the 22nd Panzer Division, which formed part of the corps, was almost completely destroyed in the fighting that ensued. The 22nd had entered the fighting with fewer than thirty working tanks, and left with a company of tanks. The Romanian 1st Armored Division, attached to the 48th Panzer Corps, engaged the Soviet 26th Tank Corps after having lost communications with their German corps commanders, and were defeated by 20 November. As the Soviets continued to advance southwards, many Soviet tank crews began to <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> worsening blizzard, which affected men and equipment, and blocked gunsights. It was not uncommon for tanks to lose traction on the ground, and for a crew member to have an arm broken as he was thrown around inside the hull. However, the blizzard also neutralized the German corps' coordination.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both scleroderma and either polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extracts, immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Tkach {{grew up in}} the Russian Orthodox faith, but {{eventually}} his family, including his parents, became interested in the Radio Church of God through the radio broadcast of Herbert W. Armstrong, the founder of the church. The Radio Church of God would eventually change its name in 1968 to the Worldwide Church of God (WCG), the church that Tkach would lead. It was a church characterized by the strong influence of its founder and his unique doctrines based on his own interpretation of the Bible. Initially, Tkach was the only member of his family who was not interested in listening to the radio broadcasts. However, a purportedly miraculous event was to change him. At the time, Tkach suffered from severe ulcers and was required to stay on a special diet. His wife then suggested that God would heal him if he were to become a minister in Armstrong's church. Although skeptical, he accepted the suggestion of becoming a minister and he found himself cured, never again to <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ulcers. He was baptized by Radio Church of God minister, Dean Blackwell, on March 1, 1957. On June 7, 1961, Blackwell ordained him a deacon in the Chicago congregation, and on June 3, 1963, Roderick C. Meredith, who would eventually lead a breakaway church from the WCG, ordained him as an elder.|$|E
