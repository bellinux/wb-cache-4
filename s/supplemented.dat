An interview schedule was developed for these purposes containing questions on demographic and health and lifestyle-associated variables, regularity of <b>supplement</b> use, reasons for non-use or sporadic use and regular <b>supplement</b> use-related questions. Setting. Stellenbosch University, South Africa. Subjects. Four hundred undergraduate and postgraduate students. Results. Non-use of <b>supplements</b> was reported by 38. 5 % of students. The main reason given for not using <b>supplements</b> at all was 'not necessary' and 'don't know/no reason'. Sporadic <b>supplement</b> use was reported by 19. 5 %, with the main reason for sporadic <b>supplement</b> use being 'use when stressed' and 'use when tired/ill'. Regular <b>supplement</b> use was reported by 42 % of the students interviewed, with vitamin-mineral combination <b>supplements</b> being the most commonly used <b>supplements.</b> Regular <b>supplement</b> users showed no specific demographic or health and lifestyle-associated characteristics. Reasons provided by the regular <b>supplement</b> users were similar for most <b>supplement</b> types and seem to reflect the advertising strategies used by producers of <b>supplements.</b> The main reasons cited in this regard were 'physical health', 'dietary reasons' and 'body conditioning and energy'.

Unfortunately, potential risks associated with <b>supplement</b> intake pose threats to an athlete???s health, and unlabeled banned substances in <b>supplements</b> may produce positive drug tests leading to loss of eligibility. The {{purpose of this study was}} to (a) analyze the prevalence of dietary <b>supplement</b> consumption among NCAA collegiate athletes, (b) determine their self-reported levels of knowledge regarding the potential health risks associated with <b>supplement</b> consumption and the NCAA banned substances policies concerning dietary <b>supplements,</b> and (c) identify if any associations exist between these two knowledge levels and the consumption of dietary <b>supplements.</b> In Fall 2014, 288 athletes completed a 13 -item survey assessing their knowledge levels of <b>supplement</b> safety and the NCAA banned substances policies, their reasons for consuming <b>supplements,</b> and their sources of information. Chi-square (????) analysis determined that <b>supplement</b> intake did not vary between sport-types (p = 0. 963), including sports that use the phosphagen system, anaerobic system, or aerobic system. The frequency of <b>supplement</b> intake among all athletes was 69. 3 %. Multivariate logistic regression models identified the higher an athlete???s knowledge of dietary <b>supplement</b> safety, the more likely they were to consume <b>supplements</b> (p < 0. 001), and the higher their knowledge regarding the NCAA banned substances policies, the more likely they were to consume the <b>supplements</b> (p = 0. 045).
