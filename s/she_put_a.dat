25|$|None of this, apparently, was enough. Sage {{wrote in}} a journal in August 1961, “I have said all that I have to say. There is nothing left {{for me to do}} but scream.” On January 8, 1963, <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> fatal bullet through her heart. Following {{instructions}} in her will, Pierre Matisse buried urns containing Sage’s and Tanguy’s ashes in the water off the coast of Tanguy’s native Brittany in 1964.|$|E
2500|$|Klarsfeld {{stated that}} she felt {{supported}} by the Left hundred percent {{in the fight against}} fascism. The fact that the party had nominated them with knowledge of their commitment to Israel, show that the party was in agreement on this relationship with her. <b>She</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> program established for their administration in case of their choice, intention, however, to improve the image of Germany. It had a moral Germany to be created that can bring about social justice in other European countries. Klarsfeld had announced, to assist in the French presidential election, 2012 Incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy. You have no [...] "abdominal pain that I just left for a candidate" [...] although it would have preferred a nomination {{on the part of the}} CDU or the SPD. The election for President of the Confederation would be the [...] "highest honor" [...] that she could be granted.|$|E

2500|$|She invited groups not {{normally}} invited to presidential residences {{to visit her}} in Áras an Uachtaráin; from the Christian Brothers, a large religious order who ran schools throughout Ireland but had never had its leaders invited to the Áras, to G.L.E.N., the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network. She visited Irish nuns and priests abroad, Irish famine relief charities, attended international sports events, met the Pope and, against pressure from the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, not to do so, was the only head of state to meet the 14th Dalai Lama during his tour of Europe. <b>She</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> special symbolic light in her kitchen window in Áras an Uachtaráin which was visible {{to the public as}} it overlooked the principal public view of the building, as a sign of remembering Irish emigrants around the world (placing a light in a darkened window to guide the way of strangers was an old Irish folk custom). Robinson's symbolic light became an acclaimed symbol of an Ireland thinking about its sons and daughters around the world. [...] She visited Rwanda where she brought world attention to the suffering in that state in the aftermath of its civil war. After her visit, she spoke at a press conference, where she became visibly emotional. As a lawyer trained to be rational, she was furious at her emotion, but it moved many who saw it. One media critic who had slated her presidential ideas in 1990, journalist and Sunday Tribune editor Vincent Browne, passed her a note {{at the end of the}} press conference saying simply [...] "you were magnificent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the reign}} of Elizabeth the Russian court {{was one of the}} most splendid in all Europe. Foreigners were amazed at the sheer luxury of the sumptuous balls and masquerades. The Russian court had {{steadily}} increased in importance throughout the 18th century and came to hold more cultural significance than many of its Western counterparts due its inclusive nature; any “well to do inhabitants” were welcome at Court. The Court, like most Imperial Courts, was considered a reflection of the ruler at its center and Elizabeth was said to be “the laziest, most extravagant and most amorous of sovereigns.” Elizabeth was intelligent but lacked the discipline and early education necessary to flourish as an intellectual; she found the reading of secular literature to be “injurious to health.” [...] She was kind and warm-hearted for the emotion's sake alone, once going so far as to offer to finance the reconstruction of Lisbon after the 1755 earthquake destroyed the Portuguese city despite having and wanting no diplomatic relationship with the nation. She hated bloodshed and conflict and went to great lengths to alter the Russian system of punishment, even outlawing capital punishment. Even in court this peacemaker spirit made itself evident. According to historian Robert Nisbet Bain, it was one of Elizabeth’s “chief glories that, so far as she was able, <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> stop to that mischievous contention of rival ambitions at Court, which had disgraced the reigns of Peter II, Anne and Ivan VI, and enabled foreign powers to freely interfere in the domestic affairs of Russia.” [...] She was also deeply religious, passing several pieces of legislation that undid much of the work her father had done to limit the power of the church. Yet of all her various characteristics manifested in the structure of Court life the most evident were her extravagance, her vanity, and her gaiety and playful nature.|$|E

50|$|The king {{returned}} home.
