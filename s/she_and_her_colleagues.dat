5|$|The protein-only {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} criticised by those maintaining that the simplest {{explanation of the}} evidence to date is viral. For more than a decade, Yale University neuropathologist Laura Manuelidis has been proposing that prion diseases are caused instead by an unidentified slow virus. In January 2007, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> published an article reporting {{to have found a}} virus in 10%, or less, of their scrapie-infected cells in culture.|$|E
5|$|Jean Jennings Bartik (December 27, 1924 – March 23, 2011) {{was one of}} the {{original}} programmers for the ENIAC computer. She studied mathematics in school then began work at the University of Pennsylvania, first manually calculating ballistics trajectories, then using ENIAC to do so. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> developed and codified many of the fundamentals of programming while working on the ENIAC, since it was the first computer of its kind. After her work on ENIAC, Bartik went on to work on BINAC and UNIVAC, and spent time at a variety of technical companies as a writer, manager, engineer and programmer. She spent her later years as a real estate agent and died in 2011 from congestive heart failure complications.|$|E

25|$|Gerty Cori was a {{biochemist}} {{who discovered}} the mechanism by which glycogen, a derivative of glucose, is transformed in the muscles to form lactic acid, and is later reformed {{as a way to}} store energy. For this discovery <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> were awarded the Nobel prize in 1947, making her the third woman and the first American woman to win a Nobel Prize in science. She was the first woman ever to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Cori is among several scientists whose works are commemorated by a U.S. postage stamp.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Carenza Lewis {{reported}} {{the results of}} a new method of assessing the death toll. She argues that pottery before and after the Black Death is datable because there was a change at that time from the high medieval to the late medieval style, and that counts of pottery of each type therefore provide a useful proxy for long term changes in population. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> analysed pottery sherds from test pits in over fifty continuously occupied rural settlements in eastern England, and found a {{decline in the number of}} pottery producing pits of 45%. Norfolk had the greatest drop of 65%, while there was no drop in 10% of settlements, mostly commercial centres.|$|E

500|$|Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail criticised Home and Away for {{the amount}} of car {{accidents}} it features. When Miles nearly crashed his car, she asked if anyone in Summer Bay is capable of [...] "sitting atop four wheels" [...] without nearly getting killed. Stephen was not a fan of Miles' long hair. When he returned in 2011, she said [...] "we can only hope that he’s seen a hairdresser since his departure." [...] When he left the series, Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap said that Home and Away [...] "won't be the same without Miles' shaggy barnet". Laura Morgan of All About Soap said that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> were [...] "in mourning" [...] over Miles' exit. She added that they [...] "sorely missed" [...] him.|$|E
500|$|During the Harper government, {{it was not}} {{possible}} for government employed scientists to openly speak about the government policy that prohibited communication with the media. [...] However, following the election of a new government in 2015, several scientists who are or were employed by the government have come forward to confirm the allegations made by anonymous sources during the Harper years. [...] Kristi Miller-Saunders was a scientist employed by the government at the time as is currently employed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. [...] She has stated that she was repeatedly prevented by the Harper government from speaking with the public and the press about her research. [...] A high-profile example is the paper that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> published on their investigation into why sockeye salmon were dying in unusual numbers in the Fraser River on their way to spawn. [...] The government denied her permission to speak with any reporter. [...] Miller-Saunders is one example of many.|$|E

Amen, sister." ...|$|E

25|$|Annie Besant {{had been}} tried in 1877 for {{publishing}} Charles Knowlton's Fruits of Philosophy, a work on family planning, under the Obscene Publications Act 1857. Knowlton {{had previously been}} convicted in the United States. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleague</b> Charles Bradlaugh were convicted but acquitted on appeal, the subsequent publicity resulting in {{a decline in the}} birth rate. Not discouraged in the slightest, Besant followed this with The Law of Population.|$|R

2500|$|Olcott started {{outreach}} programs to bring books into homes, schools, detention centers, and beyond.

2500|$|Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in {{physiology}} or medicine in 1997 [...] "for his discovery of Prions—a new biological principle of infection". However, Yale University neuropathologist Laura Manuelidis has challenged the prion protein (PrP) explanation for the disease. In January 2007, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{reported that they had}} found a virus-like particle in naturally and experimentally infected animals. [...] "The high infectivity of comparable, isolated virus-like particles that show no intrinsic PrP by antibody labeling, combined with their loss of infectivity when nucleic acid–protein complexes are disrupted, make it likely that these 25-nm particles are the causal TSE virions".|$|E
2500|$|But {{on the eve}} of the war, {{the paper}} rallied to the war cause: [...] "The simple cause, at the end, is just. An evil regime in Iraq instituted an evil and brutal invasion. Our {{soldiers}} and airmen are there, at UN behest, to set that evil to rights. Their duties are clear.... Let the momentum, and the resolution, be swift." [...] After the event, journalist Maggie O'Kane conceded that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> had been a mouthpiece for war propaganda: [...] "...we, the media, were harnessed like 2,000 beach donkeys and led through the sand to see what the British and US military wanted us to see in this nice clean war".|$|E

5000|$|Early in {{her career}} Frommer {{investigated}} the molecular biology of [...] "satellite DNAs" [...] in the human genome. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleague</b> Jane Prosser showed that classical satellites were all A+T-rich simple repeated sequences.

2500|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Linda Drane Burdick in {{the prosecution}} rebuttal told the jurors that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> backed up every claim they made in their opening statement six weeks ago, and implied that the defense never directly backed up their own opening-statement claims. [...] "My biggest fear is that common sense will be lost in all {{the rhetoric of the}} case," [...] she said, insisting that she would never ask the jury to make their decision based on emotion but rather the evidence. [...] "Responses to guilt are oh, so predictable," [...] she stated. [...] "What do guilty people do? They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong." [...] She suggested that the garbage bag in the trunk of the car was a [...] "decoy" [...] put there to keep people from getting suspicious about the smell of the car when she left it abandoned in a parking stall directly beside a dumpster in an Amscot parking lot. [...] "Whose life was better without Caylee?" [...] she asked, stressing how George and Cindy Anthony were wondering where their daughter and granddaughter were in June and July 2008, the same time Casey was staying at her boyfriend's apartment while Caylee's body was decomposing in the woods. [...] "That's the only question you need to answer in considering why Caylee Marie Anthony was left {{on the side of the}} road dead." [...] Burdick then showed the jury a split-screen with a photo of Casey partying at a night club on one side and a close-up of the [...] "Bella Vita" [...] (meaning [...] "Beautiful Life") tattoo that she got weeks after Caylee died on the other.|$|E
