5|$|Complications {{are either}} {{directly}} caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing {{a common cause}} such as a poor diet or a <b>sedentary</b> <b>lifestyle.</b> The strength {{of the link between}} obesity and specific conditions varies. One of the strongest is the link with type 2 diabetes. Excess body fat underlies 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases in women.|$|E
5|$|Louis Stanislas lived a {{quiet and}} <b>sedentary</b> <b>lifestyle</b> at this point, {{not having a}} great deal to do since his self-proclaimed {{political}} exclusion in 1774. He kept himself occupied with his vast library of over 11,000 books at Balbi's pavilion, reading for several hours each morning. In the early 1780s, he also incurred huge debts totalling 10million livres, which his brother Louis XVI paid.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and <b>sedentary</b> <b>lifestyle.</b> Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E

5|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} the Columbia's watershed {{for more than}} 15,000years, with a transition to a <b>sedentary</b> <b>lifestyle</b> based mainly on salmon starting about 3,500years ago. In 1962, archaeologists found evidence of human activity dating back 11,230years at the Marmes Rockshelter, near {{the confluence of the}} Palouse and Snake rivers in eastern Washington. In 1996 the skeletal remains of a 9,000-year-old prehistoric man (dubbed Kennewick Man) were found near Kennewick, Washington. The discovery rekindled debate in the scientific community over the origins of human habitation in North America and sparked a protracted controversy over whether the scientific or Native American community was entitled to possess and/or study the remains.|$|E
5|$|The {{first human}} {{presence}} in the region dates to 8,000years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds. About 2,000years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly <b>sedentary</b> <b>lifestyle.</b> Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until about 500CE. Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.|$|E
5|$|The short-tailed isopods {{have a short}} pleotelson and terminal, stylus-like uropods {{and have}} a <b>sedentary</b> <b>lifestyle</b> on or under the {{sediment}} on the seabed. The long-tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods {{which can be used}} in swimming. They are much more active and can launch themselves off the seabed and swim for short distances. The more advanced long-tailed isopods are mostly endemic to the southern hemisphere and may have radiated on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana soon after it broke away from Laurasia 200 million years ago. The short-tailed forms may have been driven from the shallow seas in which they lived by increased predatory pressure from marine fish, their main predators. The development of the long-tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force the short-tailed forms into refugia. The latter are now restricted to environments such as the deep sea, freshwater, groundwater and dry land. Isopods in the suborder Asellota are by far the most species-rich group of deep sea isopods.|$|E

40|$|Obesity and sedentarism have {{unfortunately}} {{become a}} way of life for many people in the United States. In 2007, only 10 % of women in the United States reported meeting current rec-ommendations for physical activity (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2009). As a group, Hispanic women/Latinas are even less likely to report adequate physical activity (5. 8 %) and are more likely than other groups of women to report no leisure-time physical activity (USDHHS, 2009). The acculturation process may inadvertently support such <b>sedentary</b> <b>lifestyles,</b> as levels of both planned and incidental physical activity among Hispanic immigrants decrease dramatically following their arrival in the United States (Himmelgreen et al., 2003; Unger et al., 2004).

However, the official identification of al-Hijr as an archaeological site in 1972 led to the resettlement of the Bedouins towards the north, beyond the site boundary. This also included the development of new agricultural land and freshly dug wells, thereby preserving the state of al-Hijr.|$|E

Antipsychotic medications may also increase the risk. These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.|$|R
