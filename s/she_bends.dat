50|$|I set her on my pacing steed,And {{nothing else}} saw all day long,For sidelong would <b>she</b> <b>bend,</b> and singA faery’s song.|$|R
60|$|Seti {{stood still}} as a statue; we all stood still, even Merapi. Then <b>she</b> <b>bend</b> down, and lifted {{the body of the}} boy.|$|R

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>bends</b> {{a glance}} of pain, And, at a moment, lets escape a tear; [...] Is it that passing train, Whose alien whirr offends her country ear? - ...|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>bends</b> {{and kisses}} his hand. KEITH draws his hand [...] away, and she recoils a little humbly, {{looking up at}} him again. [...] Suddenly she stands rigid, listening.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘That {{may be the}} cause, certainly. Look here.’ He stops, becomes dreamy, {{and seems}} to forget that he has invited her attention. <b>She</b> <b>bends</b> over him, and speaks in his ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, then," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>bending</b> {{to invite}} the fall, {{and when it was}} playfully {{advanced}} above her head, bounding out of reach like some little chamois.|$|R
6000|$|... "Old Wragg is out, {{and me and}} Charlie Brown {{carry you}} into the house," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Harris, closing his eyes entirely. [...] "When you come to your senses, <b>she's</b> <b>bending</b> over you and crying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is this you, Hepzibah?" [...] {{he murmured}} sadly; then, more apart, and perhaps {{unconscious}} {{that he was}} overheard, [...] "How changed! how changed! And is she angry with me? Why does <b>she</b> <b>bend</b> her brow so?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Max. I'll {{not hear}} you speak, her crime is plain; [...] She owns her pride, which you perhaps may feign. [...] She shall be {{prisoner}} till <b>she</b> <b>bend</b> her mind [...] To that, which is {{for both of}} you designed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I sat her on my pacing steed, [...] And {{nothing else}} saw all day long, [...] For sidelong would <b>she</b> <b>bend,</b> and sing [...] A fairy's song, [...] She found me roots of relish sweet, [...] And honey wild, and manna dew;" ...|$|R

60|$|As o'er the {{fragrant}} stream <b>she</b> <b>bends</b> her head. First he expands the glittering forfex wide To inclose the lock; then joins it to divide: The meeting points the sacred hair dissever, From the fair head for ever and for ever.|$|E
6000|$|Cecilia has {{not been}} unobservant, in her own quiet way, {{of what has been}} going on. Waiting until Francine and Miss Plym are out of hearing, <b>she</b> <b>bends</b> over Emily, and says, [...] "My dear, I really do think Francine is in love with Mr. Mirabel." ...|$|E
60|$|Though <b>she</b> <b>bends</b> her head, in answer, {{there is}} {{something}} in the momentary action of her hand, as if she would crush the flowers it holds, and fling them, with contempt, upon the ground. But, she puts the hand through the arm of her new husband, who has been standing near, conversing with the Major, and is proud again, and motionless, and silent.|$|E
60|$|At these words, the Princess put {{her head}} out of the highest window, and when the Prince saw her lovely face, he fell down on his knees, {{trembling}} with happiness, and protesting in broken sentences his love for her; while <b>she,</b> <b>bending</b> out over the window-sill, wept silently tears of joy, which came down pitter, patter, on the Prince's head.|$|R

6000|$|How {{straight}} {{she sits}} in the water, and how her little streamer begins to float in the wind! Now see her sails gradually puff out! She moves gently from the shore. Now <b>she</b> <b>bends</b> over a little as the wind fills her sails, and she is off! Faster and faster she glides along, her cutwater rippling the water in front of her, and her flags fluttering bravely in the air; and her delighted owner, with laughing eyes, beholds her triumphantly scudding {{over the surface of}} the pond! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} give the true measure of our injury. You forget that supreme instant when the master-spirit of the ballet comes {{skipping}} suddenly forward, and leaping {{into the air}} with calves that exchange a shimmer of kisses, and catches the prima ballerina at the waist, and tosses her aloft, and when she comes down supports her as <b>she</b> <b>bends</b> {{this way and that}} way, and all at once stiffens for her bow to the house.

60|$|It was a {{night of}} long ago, but can you not see my dear Margaret still as <b>she</b> <b>bends</b> over her son? Not twice in many days dared the {{minister}} snatch a moment's sleep from grey morning to midnight, and, when this did happen, he jumped up by-and-by in shame, to revile himself for an idler and ask his mother wrathfully why she had not tumbled {{him out of his}} chair? Tonight Margaret was divided between a desire to let him sleep and a fear of his self-reproach when he awoke; and so, perhaps, the tear fell that roused him.|$|E

There, now you must stop crying. (But {{as soon as she}} lets go of him his head falls back on to the iron table with an unpleasant, meaty bump. That bump is too much for LUCREZIA. <b>She</b> <b>bends</b> over him, strokes his head, even kisses the lustrous curls.) Oh, forgive me, forgive me! I have been a beast. But, tell me first, what's the matter, Bertino? What is it, my poor darling? Tell me.|$|E
6000|$|Tessa did {{not like}} those words, even though Tito was smiling. She had some pouting {{distress}} in her face, as <b>she</b> said, <b>bending</b> anxiously over the baby-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... (<b>She</b> is <b>bending</b> over Chalmers, {{her hand}} on his wrist, when suddenly, as a sign he is recovering, he violently flings her hand off and {{straightens}} up.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Massa," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>bending</b> {{down and}} croaking the words into my ear, [...] "me die soon. Me very old woman. Not stay long on Massa Murray's plantation." ...|$|R
