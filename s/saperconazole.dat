40|$|The {{efficacy}} of orally and intravenously administered <b>saperconazole</b> against Aspergillus fumigatus was assessed in an immunosuppressed temporarily leukopenic rabbit model of invasive aspergillosis and {{compared with that}} of amphotericin B. Oral <b>saperconazole</b> at dosages of 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg of body weight per day improved survival {{compared with that of}} controls. In addition, <b>saperconazole</b> at 10 and 15 mg/kg/day reduced the tissue burden and reduced levels of circulating antigen, which correlated with increasing dosages of <b>saperconazole.</b> Intravenous <b>saperconazole</b> produced levels in serum more than 10 -fold that of oral therapy. Intravenous <b>saperconazole</b> not only improved survival and reduced antigen levels but also significantly eradicated A. fumigatus from tissues compared with those of controls and was as effective as amphotericin B in these studies. <b>Saperconazole</b> was effective in the treatment of experimental invasive aspergillosis and demonstrates the potential of the newer azoles in therapy for invasive aspergillosis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Saperconazole</b> (R 66905) is a broad-spectrum {{antifungal}} triazole with potent {{in vitro}} activity against Aspergillus spp. A total of 279 strains {{were tested in}} brain heart infusion broth. Development of the Aspergillus spp. was completely inhibited at 0. 1 and 1 microgram of <b>saperconazole</b> per ml for 80. 3 and 99. 6 % of the strains, respectively. Normal and immunocompromised guinea pigs were infected intravenously with Aspergillus fumigatus and treated orally, intravenously, or intraperitoneally with <b>saperconazole</b> or intraperitoneally with amphotericin B. Leukopenia, neutropenia, lymphocytosis, and monocytosis were obtained with mechlorethamine hydrochloride; leukopenia, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia were obtained with cyclophosphamide. <b>Saperconazole</b> was dissolved for oral treatment in polyethylene glycol and for parenteral treatment in cyclodextrins. Amphotericin B was given parenterally as Fungizone (E. R. Squibb & Sons). Treatment was given once daily for 14 days. An early starting treatment was efficacious, but the activity of <b>saperconazole</b> was maintained even when {{the onset of the}} treatment was delayed to the moribund state. The activity of <b>saperconazole</b> was not altered in immunocompromised animals. <b>Saperconazole</b> was clearly superior to amphotericin B and free of side effects. The oral and parenteral formulations of <b>saperconazole</b> were equipotent. The systemic activity of <b>saperconazole</b> in guinea pigs was confirmed in invasive aspergillosis in pigeons...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{of a new}} triazole antifungal agent, <b>saperconazole,</b> in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis was studied. Mice were intravenously infected with Candida albicans blastoconidia and treated for 14 days with oral <b>saperconazole,</b> intraperitoneal amphotericin B, {{or a combination of}} these. Amphotericin B alone was the most efficacious in prolonging survival and in decreasing renal colony counts, usually with complete sterilization of the kidneys {{by the end of the}} treatment course. <b>Saperconazole</b> improved survival rates and effected a decrease in renal colony counts, but kidneys were not microbiologically sterilized. Combination therapy with <b>saperconazole</b> and amphotericin B did not result in a decrease in the {{efficacy of}} amphotericin B by either end point (survival or renal colony counts). High-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of <b>saperconazole</b> concentrations in serum indicated low levels of absorption of the drug. We conclude that <b>saperconazole</b> is effective in the treatment of murine invasive candidiasis and that the theoretical concern about adverse interactions between the two drugs does not apply to the dosages studied in these experiments. <b>Saperconazole</b> is an antifungal triazole derivative closely related to itraconazole. It differs from itraconazole by the replacement of the two chlorines with two fluorines at the 2 and 4 positions of the benzene ring. Preclinical data indicat...|$|E
40|$|<b>Saperconazole,</b> a novel orally active {{triazole}} antifungal, inhibited Candida spp., Aspergillus spp. and dermatophyte {{fungi in}} vitro. Its minimal inhibitory concentra-tions for Candida spp. and dermatophytes were relatively high, {{like those of}} comparable triazole antifungals, {{but all of the}} Aspergilhis isolates tested were inhibited by less than 0 - 1 mg/ 1. Relative inhibition factors of <b>saperconazole</b> were in the range 31 - 76 % for Candida isolates, 6 - 18 % for Aspergillus isolates and 5 - 10 % for dermatophytes. These figures predict a good inhibitory activity of <b>saperconazole</b> for all the fungi tested, with particularly strong activity against Aspergillus spp. and dermatophytes. <b>Saperconazole</b> inhibited hyphal branch formation in C. albicans at concentrations as low as 10 * M...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the value of blood culture as a parameter of treatment effectiveness in experimental histoplasmosis. A total of thirty five hamsters, weighing approximately 120 g, were inoculated intracardiacly with 0. 1 ml of a suspension containing 4 x 10 (7) cells/ml of the yeast phase of H. capsulatum. Treatments were started one week after the infection and lasted for 3 weeks. The azoles, (itraconazole, <b>saperconazole</b> and fluconazole) were administered once a day by gavage, at a dose of 8 mg/kg; Amphotericin B was given intraperitonealy every other day at a dose of 6 mg/kg. Blood samples (1 ml) were obtained by heart punction from the 4 th day after infection and were seeded in Sabouraud honey-agar and BHI-agar. The hamsters that survived were killed one week after treatment completion and the following criteria were considered for treatment evaluation: 1) rate of spontaneous death, at the end of the experience; 2) microscopic examination of Giemsa smears from liver and spleen and 3) determination of CFU in spleen cultures. Amphotericin B was the most effective drug, with negative blood cultures at day 20, negative spleen cultures in all cases and all the animals survived until the end of the study. Fluconazole was the less effective drug, blood cultures were positive during the whole experience, spleen cultures showed a similar average of CFU when compared with the control animals and 42. 8 % of these animals died. <b>Saperconazole</b> and itraconazole showed a similar activity, with survival of all hamsters and negative blood cultures at 23 and 26 days respectively. Blood culture seems to be valuable parameter for treatments' evaluation in experimental histoplasmosis of the hamster...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{model of}} murine chromoblastomycosis and in vitro tests with Fonsecaea pedrosoi {{were used to}} test the sensitivity of this fungus to three different antimycotics. The experimental model was standardized in BALB/c mice inoculated intraperitoneally with a 10 (6) CFU/ml suspension of a F. pedrosoi isolate. Clinical infection was evident after 5 days of inoculation. Three groups of 27 mice each were used in the experiment. One group was treated with ketoconazole (KTZ), another with itraconazole (ITZ) and the other with <b>saperconazole</b> (SPZ). Antimycotic therapy was continued for 21 days. The control group consisted of 40 mice which were inoculated, but not treated. Infection was documented by macroscopic and microscopic examination of affected tissue in addition to culture of tissue macerates. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFC) for the F. pedrosoi strain used were done. The in vitro results showed that SPZ was the most active with MIC 0. 01 mg/ml and MFC 0. 1 mg/ml, followed by ITZ. SPZ was also the most effective in vivo since 63 % of the treated animals (p= 0. 01) showed a curative effect after the observation period. We concluded that SPZ had the best in vitro and in vivo activity against F. pedrosoi...|$|E
