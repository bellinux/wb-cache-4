5|$|The {{experimental}} potatoes {{had been}} transformed with the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) gene from the Galanthus (<b>snowdrop)</b> plant, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin is toxic to some insects. Rats were fed raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes, using unmodified Desiree Red potatoes as controls. One control group ate an unmodified Desiree Red potato spiked with the GNA <b>snowdrop</b> lectin. Twelve feeding experiments were conducted, ten short-term (10 days) and two long-term (110 days). Before the experiment Pusztai and his team said they expected no differences between the rats fed modified potatoes and rats fed the non-modified ones.|$|E
5|$|Inland, many of {{the attractions}} are small towns and villages or linked to the river valleys, such as the ancient clapper bridge at Tarr Steps and the <b>Snowdrop</b> Valley near Wheddon Cross, which is carpeted in {{snowdrops}} in February and, later, displays bluebells. Withypool {{is also in the}} Barle Valley, the Two Moors Way passes through the village. As well as Dunster Castle, Dunster's other attractions include a priory, dovecote, yarn market, inn, packhorse bridge, mill and a stop on the West Somerset Railway. Exford lies on the River Exe.|$|E

5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (<b>snowdrop)</b> plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin {{has been shown to}} be toxic to some insects.|$|E

25|$|Celebrated {{as a sign}} of spring, {{snowdrops}} {{can form}} impressive carpets of white in areas where they are native or have been naturalised. These displays may attract large numbers of sightseers. There are a number of <b>snowdrop</b> gardens in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Several gardens open specially in February for visitors to admire the flowers. Sixty gardens took part in Scotland's first <b>Snowdrop</b> Festival (1 Feb–11 March 2007). Several gardens in England open during <b>snowdrop</b> season for the National Gardens Scheme (NGS) and in Scotland for Scotland's Gardens. Colesbourne Park in Gloucestershire {{is one of the best}} known of the English <b>snowdrop</b> gardens, being the home of Henry John Elwes, a collector of Galanthus specimens, and after whom Galanthus elwesii is named.|$|E

25|$|Snowdrops figure {{prominently}} {{in art and}} literature, often {{as a symbol of}} spring, purity and religion in poetry (see Symbols), such as Walter de la Mare's poem The <b>Snowdrop</b> (1929). In this poem, he likened the triple tepals in each whorl ("A triplet of green-pencilled snow") to the Holy Trinity. He used <b>snowdrop</b> imagery several times in his poetry, such as Blow, Northern Wind (1950) - see Box.|$|E
25|$|<b>Snowdrop</b> were {{uncovered}} when a {{small area}} of garden was cleared. They have reappeared as carpets covering {{large areas of the}} leisure grounds from January to March each year. They were introduced to the gardens after the Crimean War in 1856 and have since spread across the estate. The snowdrops have cross pollinated and the variety has expanded, some of them are rare and have been removed off-site for protection until the hall is restored. New displays and paths were created for the 2010 season. Throughout February the gardens opened on Sundays for visitors to view the <b>snowdrop</b> carpets spread over the estate. In 2007 the United Kingdom <b>Snowdrop</b> Society visited the gardens and viewed a temporary display of rare snowdrops brought back for the occasion.|$|E

25|$|Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is a {{bacterial}} subspecies traditionally isolated from European yogurts. Lactobacillus bulgaricus GLB44 {{differs from the}} rest of the L. bulgaricus strains as it was isolated from the leaves of Galanthus nivalis (<b>snowdrop</b> flower) in Bulgaria, becoming the only known strain of this subspecies that has vegan origin (not from yogurt) available as a commercial probiotic. Probiotics are health promoting bacteria which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a benefit on the host, normally associated with positive effects on the digestive and immune systems, and are usually prescribed during or after antibiotic treatment to alleviate the symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Probiotics are also associated with decreasing of the risk of traveler’s diarrhea. The natural habitat of the <b>snowdrop</b> flower are European mountainous regions. Thus, GLB44 is capable of surviving in freezing temperatures, as the <b>snowdrop</b> flowers between January and May in nature, when the temperatures can fall below freezing in this region. These characteristics of its natural habitat allows for GLB44 to survive in foods that are plant based and remain unaffected when stored in refrigerator temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Giant <b>snowdrop,</b> Galanthus elwesii, {{a native}} of the Levant, 23cm tall, {{flowering}} January/February, with large flowers, the three inner segments of which often have a much larger and more conspicuous green blotch (or blotches) than the more common kinds; supervolute vernation. Grown as ornamental.|$|E
25|$|On 27 December 1836, an {{avalanche}} occurred in Lewes, the worst ever recorded in Britain. A large build-up {{of snow on}} the nearby cliff slipped down onto a row of cottages called Boulters Row (now part of South Street). About fifteen people were buried, and eight of these died. A pub in South Street is named The <b>Snowdrop</b> in memory of the event.|$|E
60|$|I {{gathered}} {{instead the}} primroses, {{that smelled of}} earth and of the weather. There were no <b>snowdrops.</b> I had found the day before a bank of crocuses, pale, fragile, lilac-coloured flowers with dark veins, pricking up keenly like myriad little lilac-coloured flames among the grass, under the olive trees. And I wanted very much to find the <b>snowdrops</b> hanging in the gloom. But there were not any.|$|R

25|$|Galanthus {{has about}} 20 species, but new species {{continue}} to be described. G. trojanus was identified in Turkey in 2001. G. panjutinii (Panjutin's <b>snowdrop)</b> was discovered in 2012 in five locations in a small area (estimated at 20km2) of the northern Colchis area (western Transcaucasus) of Georgia and Russia. G. samothracicus was identified in Greece in 2014. Since {{it has not been}} subjected to genetic sequencing, it remains unplaced. It resembles G. nivalis, but is outside that species' distribution.|$|E

A monthly comedy club based at the Con Club was created in 2010.|$|E
60|$|The months went by, {{and it was}} Christmas--the <b>snowdrops</b> came. There was {{a little}} hollow in the wood near Cossethay, where <b>snowdrops</b> grew wild. She sent him some in a box, and he wrote her a quick little note of thanks--very {{grateful}} and wistful he seemed. Her eyes grew childlike and puzzled. Puzzled {{from day to day}} she went on, helpless, carried along by all that must happen.|$|R

But with curious equanimity the {{returning}} woman watched the <b>snowdrops</b> {{on the edge of}} the grass below, blown white in the wind, but not to be blown away. She watched them fluttering and bobbing, the white, shut flowers, anchored by a thread to the grey-green grass, yet never blown away, not drifting with the wind.|$|R

25|$|In 1834, Goncharov {{graduated}} from the University and returned home to enter the chancellery of Simbirsk governor A. M. Zagryazhsky. A year later, he moved to Saint Petersburg and started working as a translator at the Finance Ministry's Foreign commerce department. Here, in the Russian capital, he became friends with the Maykov family and tutored both Apollon Maykov and Valerian Maykov in the Latin language and in Russian literature. He {{became a member of}} the elitist literary circle based in the Maykovs' house and attended by writers like Ivan Turgenev, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Dmitry Grigorovich. The Maykovs' almanac <b>Snowdrop</b> featured many of Goncharov's poems, but he soon stopped dabbling in poetry altogether. Some of those early verses were later incorporated into the novel A Common Story as Aduev's writings, a sure sign that the author had stopped taking them seriously.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>snowdrop</b> {{species are}} {{threatened}} in their wild habitats, due to habitat destruction, illegal collecting and climate change. In most countries collecting bulbs {{from the wild}} is now illegal. Under CITES regulations, international trade in any quantity of Galanthus, whether bulbs, live plants, or even dead ones, is illegal without a CITES permit. This applies to hybrids and named cultivars, as well as species. CITES lists all species but allows a limited trade in wild-collected bulbs of just three species (G. nivalis, G. elwesii, and G. woronowii) from Turkey and Georgia (see Horticulture). A number of species are on the IUCN Red List of threatened species, with the conservation status being G. trojanus as critically endangered, four species vulnerable, G. nivalis is near threatened and several species show decreasing populations. G. panjutinii is considered endangered. One of its five known sites, at Sochi, was destroyed by preparations for the 2014 Winter Olympics.|$|E
