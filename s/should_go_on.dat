5|$|At Whitsun in 1189, Coutances was {{a member}} of a {{commission}} appointed by the papal legate John of Anagni to arbitrate the dispute between King Henry II of England and his son, Richard, who was supported by King Philip II of France. Henry and Richard's conflict stemmed from Richard's desire to secure his inheritance to the throne of England, which he believed his father was trying to give to his youngest brother, John. The commission met near Le Mans. Richard and Philip insisted that Richard should be married to Philip's sister Alice, that Henry name Richard as Henry's heir, and that Richard's youngest brother John <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> crusade with Richard. Henry rejected those terms, and neither Philip nor Richard would negotiate, even under the legate's threat of an interdict on France.|$|E
5|$|The {{dampening}} {{of public}} enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued {{and the police}} and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing shows down. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew nervous about the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities. Merrick's group of managers decided that he <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> tour in Continental Europe, {{with the hope that}} authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the Continent. The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's £50 (2015 equivalent £) savings. Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to Ostend, where he attempted to board a ferry for Dover but was refused passage. He travelled to Antwerp and was able to board a ship bound for Harwich in Essex. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at Liverpool Street station.|$|E
25|$|The {{first day}} of car racing {{resulted}} in four finishes and two land speed records, but concerns over safety led AAA officials to consider canceling the remaining events. Fisher promised the track would be repaired {{by the next day}} and convinced officials that the show <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> The second day saw 20,000 spectators, no major incidents, and additional speed records broken.|$|E

25|$|In 1844 {{their mother}} took {{the girls to}} Paris to {{continue}} their studies, first with Francesco Piermarini, {{and then with the}} distinguished tenor Marco Bordogni. Bordogni thought highly of Sophie: it is said that he allowed her to sing only scales and solfeggi which he composed for her, for two whole years. After that time mother Crüwell wanted to remove her, saying that she had learnt scales enough and that {{if she was going to}} do nothing else she might as well get married and give it up. Bordogni persuaded mother that she would have a wonderful career, and that she <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to complete her studies in Milan. A first public appearance in January 1846 was reported in the musical journal Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris.|$|E
25|$|On 26 May 1886, a union {{committee}} went {{to several}} mine managers {{to propose that}} the $3 daily wage be restored to the lower-paid workers, but all the mine managers they spoke to refused. From the start, mine managers and owners took the position that they were meeting and negotiating with miners, and refused {{to acknowledge that the}} miners were union representatives. A union committee again met with a group of mine managers on 19 June, and was again rebuffed, although some managers said that they would consider the idea. That evening, a union meeting attended by about 1,200 miners voted almost unanimously that all workers receiving $2.50 per day <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> strike. The strike began that night with the 11:30 shift change, and by the next day, 968 miners had walked out, shutting down a number of mines.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{relatives}} of Betty Ong, a flight attendant on a hijacked American Airlines plane, a clip from her call to headquarters {{was used in the}} beginning of the film without attribution. They demanded that, if the film won any awards, the filmmakers apologize at the Academy Awards ceremony for using the clip without getting her heirs' consent. Her family also asked that the film's U.S. distributors make a charitable donation in Ong's name, and <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> record that the Ong family does not endorse the use of torture. The end of the film already includes a statement paying tribute to the victims and the families of the 9/11 attacks, and the film producers have already contributed to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. Mary and Frank Fetchet, parents of Brad Fetchet, who worked on the 89th floor of the World Trade Center's south tower, criticized the filmmakers for using a recording of their son's voicemail without permission. The recording has previously been heard in broadcast TV news reports and in testimony for the 9/11 Commission.|$|E

25|$|Ted Dexter was {{restored}} to the captaincy {{but it is not}} known if this would have happened anyway or if it was because Colin Cowdrey was unfit and could not play. Whichever, Dexter now held the England captaincy {{for the next two years}} until the end of the 1964 season. England having won the series, the selectors decided to make changes to help them decide who <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the winter tour. Geoff Pullar, fit again, was recalled and his opening partner was the third tour captaincy candidate David Sheppard, who had recently revived his cricket career at Sussex. They replaced Cowdrey and Stewart. Tony Lock was brought back in place of Allen and all-rounder Barry Knight came in as an extra bowler, replacing the out-of-form Kenny Barrington. Pakistan's dire injury troubles necessitated changes in their lineup. They had flown their old master bowler Fazal Mahmood out as a reinforcement. Imtiaz was fit again, Intikhab was recalled and Shahid Mahmood was introduced, making his Test debut as opening batsman. They replaced Mahmood, Farooq, Butt and Akhtar.|$|E
500|$|Shante's [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] had aimed some barbs at the {{principal}} {{two members of}} a new group from the Bronx called Boogie Down Productions (BDP): [...] "Now KRS-ONE you <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> vacation with that name soundin' like a wack radio station, and as for Scott La Rock, you should be ashamed, when T La Rock said [...] "It's Yours", he didn't mean his name". [...] Boogie Down Productions had manufactured a disagreement with the Juice Crew's MC Shan, releasing [...] "South Bronx" [...] and [...] "The Bridge is Over" [...] in reply to his [...] "The Bridge" [...] and [...] "Kill That Noise" [...] respectively.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Jesse Lacey commented on the upcoming album's content, [...] "It's a pretty exhausting record. It's quite dense and I {{think some of the}} decisions we made don't always go in the most obvious direction. We were thinking a lot more about what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." [...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I {{think a lot of the}} record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time to put something away and move on." ...|$|E

500|$|After discussion, it {{was decided}} to allow Morgan to revise his model under Fraser's supervision. Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen noted, [...] " [...] must have been doubly and trebly humiliating in that Fraser's initial was then adorning the current 5¢ nickel, while neither Barber's nor Morgan's was on any regular issue coinage then in production". On January 3, 1924, Fraser wrote to Moore that the new models had been {{considerably}} improved, and complained that Vestal had advised the Huguenot-Walloon commission to have the models made at the Mint as he had been told by its officials that private artists made models in a relief too high to be easily coined. [...] "It seems to me perfectly disgusting that this inane and lying criticism <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> constantly". The Fine Arts Commission approved the revised designs.|$|E
500|$|The country-folk-alternative blend on Tea & Sympathy {{formed a}} stark {{contrast}} to Powderfinger's last work, Vulture Street—the band's heaviest work yet. Initially intended to be a purely country album, Fanning abandoned the prospect shortly into the writing phase because he did not think he was able to make music of the quality he had expected. He thus turned to an amalgamation of country, rock, and folk elements. Fanning considered Powderfinger music to [...] "always [...] a song that just kind of grabs you" [...] but doubted his album had similar elements; instead he focused on an album that as a whole would move the listener. The album is primarily acoustic—"Which Way Home?" [...] a notable exception—and features fiddles and mandolins for backing music. The album centres on themes of love, {{in the context of the}} recent end to Fanning's relationship. Only three songs on the album exceed four minutes, while four are less than three minutes long; Fanning was critical of the [...] "convention that a song <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> for 3 , four minutes".|$|E
500|$|By 1966, Ready Steady Go! had ended, the mod {{movement}} was becoming unfashionable, and the Who {{found themselves in}} competition on the London circuit with groups including Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Lambert and Stamp realised that commercial success in the US was paramount to the group's future, and arranged a deal with promoter Frank Barsalona for a short package tour in New York. The group's performances, which still involved smashing guitars and kicking over drums, were well received, and led to their first major US appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival. The group, especially Moon, were not fond of the hippie movement, and thought their violent stage act would stand {{in sharp contrast to}} the peaceful atmosphere of the festival. Hendrix was also on the bill, and was also going to smash his guitar on stage. Townshend verbally abused Hendrix and accused him of stealing his act, and the pair argued about who <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> stage first, with the Who winning the argument. The Who brought hired equipment to the festival; Hendrix shipped over his regular touring gear from Britain, including a full Marshall stack. According to biographer Tony Fletcher, Hendrix sounded [...] "so much better than the Who it was embarrassing". The Who's appearance at Monterey gave them recognition in the US, and [...] "Happy Jack" [...] reached the top 30.|$|E

500|$|With [...] over [...] {{still to}} travel before the {{relative}} safety of Hut Point, Crean and Lashly began hauling Evans on the sledge, [...] "eking out {{his life with}} the last few drops of brandy that they still had with them". On 18 February they arrived at Corner Camp, still [...] from Hut Point, with [...] {{only one or two}} days' food rations left and still four or five days' man-hauling to do. They then decided that Crean <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> alone, to fetch help. With only a little chocolate and three biscuits to sustain him, without a tent or survival equipment, Crean walked the distance to Hut Point in 18hours, arriving in a state of collapse to find Atkinson there, with the dog driver Dmtri Gerov. Crean reached safety just ahead of a fierce blizzard, which probably would have killed him, and which delayed the rescue party by a day and a half. Atkinson led a successful rescue, and Lashly and Evans were both brought to base camp alive. Crean modestly played down the significance of his feat of endurance. In a rare written account, he wrote in a letter: [...] "So it fell to my lot to do the 30miles for help, and only a couple of biscuits and a stick of chocolate to do it. Well, sir, I was very weak when I reached the hut." ...|$|E
500|$|After touring {{in support}} of One by One, Dave Grohl was {{uncertain}} {{on what to do}} next with the Foo Fighters. He felt that rushing to do another record would not be creatively rewarding. Grohl considered a possible film score, and began writing acoustic songs, eventually amassing a full album's worth of songs. Grohl, not wanting to make a solo album and accepting the drift from his usual style, brought the songs to the Foo Fighters – [...] "who's to say what we should sound like?". Bassist Nate Mendel replied that the songs' uncharacteristic sound was [...] "why [...] <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the record." [...] Grohl decided against an acoustic record, saying [...] "I have to have loud rock music in my life somewhere", and decided to make a double album, with [...] "one CD that's all the really heavy rock shit" [...] and another [...] "that's really beautiful, acoustic-based, lower dynamic stuff", which Grohl described as [...] "the bottle and the hangover", and also with the rock record being [...] "my Jack and Coke record" [...] with songs that [...] "I realise I cannot live without that", and the acoustic being [...] "my Sapphire-and-Martini-with-Kylie record". Grohl also stated a decisive moment in making a double album was uploading demos to his computer and realizing he had five hours of music, adding that [...] "we've been a band for 10 years now, this is our fifth record, and I thought it would be boring to just keep making album after album and making videos and playing festivals, so I wanted to do something special." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oscar-nominated costume {{designer}} Jacqueline West created the intricate period costumes, using each character as inspiration. West previously worked with director Philip Kaufman on his crime drama Rising Sun. For Joaquin Phoenix's Abbé, costumers designed special [...] "pleather" [...] clogs {{to accommodate the}} actor's veganism. In one scene, Rush's Marquis de Sade wears a suit decorated in bloody script, which West described as [...] "challenging" [...] to make. It features actual writings of de Sade and costumers planned exactly where each sentence <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the fabric. Before production began, West gave Winslet a copy of French painter Léopold Boilly's [...] "Woman Ironing" [...] {{to give her a}} feel for the character, which Winslet said greatly influenced her performance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{birth of}} the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905, espousing the notion of [...] "One Big Union" [...] of all the workers, {{organized}} according to industries {{in accord with the}} principles of industrial unionism, excited a portion of the membership of the Socialist Party of Washington. As early as January 1906 the idea began to be voiced among some of the left wing of SPW that the organization <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the record as endorsing the new alternative to the American Federation of Labor (AF of L), an alliance of craft unions together with state and local labor federations. This potentially divisive groundswell of support for the fledgling IWW prompted influential left winger Alfred Wagenknecht to make an impassioned case for neutrality to the party press: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Turkish Foreign Minister Turan Güneş {{had said}} to the Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit, [...] "When I say 'Ayşe <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> vacation' (Turkish: [...] "Ayşe Tatile Çıksın"), it will mean that our armed forces {{are ready to go}} into action. Even if the {{telephone}} line is tapped, that would rouse no suspicion." [...] An hour and a half after the conference broke up, Turan Güneş called Ecevit and said the code phrase. On 14 August Turkey launched its [...] "Second Peace Operation", which eventually resulted in the Turkish occupation of 40% of Cyprus. Britain's then foreign secretary (later prime minister) James Callaghan later disclosed that U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger [...] "vetoed" [...] at least one British military action to pre-empt the Turkish landing. 40% of the land came under Turkish occupation reaching as far south as the Louroujina Salient.|$|E
2500|$|To {{explore the}} balance between good air and water {{performance}} and behaviour versus the expanding fault list, MAEE decided the Severn <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> a proving flight to the Near East. [...] This took the Severn and an accompanying Supermarine Southampton 6,530 miles via Port Sudan and included trials on Lake Timsah. [...] The conclusions were as before: the Severn performed well {{in the air and}} on the water, was seaworthy during a storm and returned without corrosion, but suffered from many problems both small and large. The second category included broken ribs and a servo-rudder kingpost and the conclusion was {{that this was not a}} practical aircraft for Service use, so no orders followed. [...] Nonetheless, the sole Severn served for about five months with No. 209 Squadron RAF after the end of the MAEE trials before it was lost in the English Channel.|$|E
