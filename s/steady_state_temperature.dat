5000|$|The most {{accurate}} method of evaluating how {{the environment is}} affecting the thermal manikin is by calculating the equivalent temperature of the environment, accounting {{for the effects of}} radiant heat, air temperature, and air movement. It is necessary to calibrate the manikin based on this before each experiment, as the factor to convert power output and manikin skin temperature to equivalent temperature (the heat transfer coefficient) changes slightly for each zone of the manikin and based on clothing the manikin is wearing. Calibration should be carried out in a thermally controlled chamber, where radiant and air temperatures are nearly identical, and minimal temperature variation occurs throughout the space. It is necessary that the manikin be wearing the same clothing as it will during experimental tests. Multiple calibration points must be taken, minimally spanning the range of temperatures that will be tested in the experiment. During calibration air movement should be kept as low as possible, and as much of the manikin’s surface should be exposed to air and radiant heat as possible, by placing it on supports that keep it in a seated position but do not block the back or legs as a traditional seat would. Manikin data should be recorded for each calibration point when the air, surface, and manikin temperatures have all reached <b>steady</b> <b>state.</b> <b>Temperature</b> of the “seat” should also be recorded, and data collection should not be stopped before the seat has reached a <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature.</b> To calculate the heat transfer coefficient (hcali) the following equation is used: Qsi = the dry heat loss, or power, recorded by the manikintski = the skin temperature of the manikin teq = the equivalent temperature of the room (the calibration temperature) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{prediction}} of geometric variation {{and its consequences}} is one important aspect of product development. For welded assemblies {{it has been shown}} that positioning errors of the parts prior to welding affects the weld-induced distortion. Therefore, to accurately predict geometric variation in welded assemblies, variation simulation and welding simulation need to be performed in combination. This is usually a very time consuming task, and therefore, the relatively fast SCV-method is utilized. This method is used to calculate welding distortion when positioning errors are present and it consists of the following three steps: 1) a steady state computation of the thermal distribution during welding, 2) the melted zone along the full joint is encapsulated by sweeping a two-dimensional convex hull along the weld gun path, and 3) a uniform temperature is applied to all nodes inside this zone. The two-dimensional convex hull is computed so that when swept along the weld path, it will encapsulate the melted zone from the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature</b> computation. The weld-induced distortion is obtained from the elastic volumetric shrinkage. In this article the focus is on the first step in this method; the temperature distribution computation. The positioning error can cause the connecting parts to have varying distances to each other at the joint, which cause the melted region to vary along the weld path. Therefore, it is not sufficient to capture the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature</b> distribution at only one location. Depending on the geometry surrounding the weld path, several locations may be needed. In this new approach, the two-dimensional convex hull that is to be swept along the weld path, can vary along the weld path, and is computed from an interpolation of the multiple two-dimensional convex hulls obtained from the multiple <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature</b> computations. A comparison of the melted region using transient temperature calculation, a single <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature</b> calculation and this new approach has been made. Furthermore, the implication on distortion calculation has been studied...|$|E

5000|$|Cox and Giuli (1968/1984) use a {{definition}} quite contrary {{to all the}} above usages. They define 'radiative equilibrium' for a star, {{taken as a whole}} and not confining attention only to its atmosphere, when the rate of transfer as heat of energy from nuclear reactions plus viscosity to the microscopic motions of the material particles of the star is just balanced by the transfer of energy by electromagnetic radiation from the star to space. This is a way of using the words 'radiative equilibrium' that is contrary to the above-mentioned usages. They note that a star that is radiating energy to space cannot be in a <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> of <b>temperature</b> distribution unless there is a supply of energy, in particular they have in mind a steady supply of energy from nuclear reactions within the star, to support the radiation to space. Likewise the condition that is used for the above definition of pointwise radiative equilibrium, namely, [...] at every point of the region that is in radiative equilibrium, cannot hold throughout a star that is in a <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> of <b>temperature</b> distribution, without an energy supply. Cox and Giuli's definition allows them to say {{at the same time that}} a star is in a <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> of <b>temperature</b> distribution and is in 'radiative equilibrium'; they are assuming that all the radiative energy to space comes from within the star, the very opposite assumption to the one made by the above-mentioned users of the concept 'global radiative equilibrium'.|$|R

The regulating bodies define {{the temperature rise}} limits for all equipments for safe operation. So during the design phase of any electrical equipment thermal analysis is mandatory to predict the temperature rise. The objective is to develop an analytical tool based on thermal networking method by exploiting the similarity between thermal and electrical analogy to calculate <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperatures</b> in less time along current carrying path in electrical equipments. As a later part, the tool developed is used to predict change in temperatures for change in geometry of the components in the electrical equipment. The problem is considered as two parts. As first part, an Excel tool is developed with Visual Basic backend, based on thermal networking method to calculate <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperatures</b> in electrical equipments. Here the numerical method used is Elementary Balance Method, in which every element is represented by a node and relevant energy balance equations are formulated for it. Temperatures are calculated using the Excel tool for frame 1 and 3. Test (Thermal Run) is conducted on AKD- 12 switch gear (frame 1 and frame 3) under continuous current to find out temperatures. Analytical results from the tool are then validated against the test data. As second part, dimensions of components in the switch gear are varied and variation in temperatures of components, particularly at moving contact (highest temperature point) with respect to original temperatures is observed. Good matching is observed in temperature profile between analytical and experimental results. The maximum percentage error is 15 %.

Alumina supported platinum catalysts were synthesized by using impregnation method and sol-gel made alumina. The methanol combustion reaction was performed in a tubular reactor. The characterization of the catalysts was performed by XRD and BET techniques. Particle size of Pt and surface area of the catalysts were compared before and after the reaction. In this study, it was found that the pure alumina was not active in methanol combustion whereas Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts with varying loadings were active starting at room temperature. 2, 3 and 5 % Pt loading catalysts showed the similar activity so it is possible that the average crystallite size and the crystallite size distribution of Pt on these catalysts would be similar. The space velocity tests indicated that low space velocity is required to quickly reach at 60 oC and also to achieve the highest <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature</b> for fresh catalyst whereas high space velocity is required to quickly reach at 60 oC and to achieve the highest <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature</b> for reused catalyst. The activity of the catalyst was also tested at sub-room temperatures. It was observed that the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature</b> of the catalyst decreased and the time to reach at 60 oC increased when the outside temperature was below the room temperature. In addition to the tubular reactor, plate reactor was prepared for the methanol combustion. For this purpose, varying concentration alumina sols were coated on the stainless steel plates.

We measure the local <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature</b> increase, heat source density and absorption in Ag, Au and Ni metallic nanowire networks under optical illumination. This allows direct experimental confirmation of increased heat generation at the junction between two metallic nanowires, and stacking dependent absorption of polarized light.

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{below to}} access the article (may not be free). A novel {{approach}} for obtaining the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature</b> distribution of cutting tools involves reducing the specific heat capacity of the cutting tool by a scale factor and carrying out a short duration single step thermomechanical analysis. Reduction of the specific heat causes the thermal time constant of the tool to be reduced by the same scale factor, making it closer to the mechanical time constant required for stabilization of the chip geometry, and enables rapid attainment of mechanical and thermal steady state conditions. As expected, FEA {{results show that the}} <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature</b> distribution achieved by the reduced specific heat approach is exact. Results obtained from a single step simulation of the first 1200 μs of cutting, using this approach, are found to be more accurate than those obtained using the time consuming multistep analysis approach used to date. Rapid attainment of an accurate <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>temperature</b> distribution permits tool wear rate to be calculated accurately using tool wear models. This enables tracking of changes in tool geometry due to wear over time, and resulting changes in the machining process and part quality produced. It is also shown that this approach is essential for accurate simulation of processes such as saw-tooth chip formation, where the ‘steady state’ involves local periodic thermomechanical changes, and leads to accurate thermomechanical results so long as the specific heat of the local region experiencing significant thermal oscillations is not scaled. An estimate for the size of this boundary layer, related to the wavelength of the thermal waves, is also given. The reduced specific heat approach can be used in many other applications involving a range of phenomena coupled with temperature, where the thermal changes are the most sluggish and take the most time to reach steady state.
