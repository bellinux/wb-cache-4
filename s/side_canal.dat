50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{began its}} formation on October 13, 1982, when the dam works were completed and the <b>side</b> <b>canal's</b> gates were closed. Throughout this period, heavy rains and flooding accelerated the filling of the reservoir {{as the water}} rose 100 m and reached {{the gates of the}} spillway at 10:00 on October 27.|$|R
50|$|Due to silt {{deposition}} in the reservoir area, the storage {{capacity of the}} dam has gradually reduced. The right <b>side</b> <b>canal</b> running towards Nashik is also closed due to the high civilization in the area. For these two reasons, an upstream dam, Kashypi Dam, is constructed which opened in 1998.|$|E
50|$|The first {{elements}} of the project to be built were the Leasburg Diversion Dam and about 6 mi of supporting canal, begun in 1906 and finished in 1908. Elephant Butte Dam, the largest dam on the Rio Grande, was authorized by the United States Congress on February 15, 1905. Construction began in 1908, when groundworks were laid. Conflicts over the lands to be submerged under the future reservoir bogged down the project for a while, but work resumed in 1912 and the reservoir began to fill by 1915. The Franklin Canal was an existing 1890 canal purchased by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1912 and rebuilt from 1914 to 1915. The Mesilla and Percha Diversion Dams, East <b>Side</b> <b>Canal,</b> West <b>Side</b> <b>Canal,</b> Rincon Valley Canal, and {{an extension of the}} Leasburg Canal were built in the period between 1914 and 1919.|$|E

50|$|At Minden {{the canal}} crosses the river Weser over two aqueducts (the second {{completed}} in 1998), and near Magdeburg it crosses the Elbe, also with an aqueduct. Connections by <b>side</b> <b>canals</b> exist at Ibbenbüren, Osnabrück, Minden (two canals connecting to the Weser), Hanover-Linden, Hanover-Misburg, Hildesheim and Salzgitter. West of Wolfsburg, the Elbe Lateral Canal branches off, providing {{a connection to}} Hamburg, and (via the Elbe-Lübeck Canal) to the Baltic Sea.|$|R

50|$|The North Star Woolen Mill, now the North Star Lofts, is a {{building}} in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The building, located in the St. Anthony Falls Historic District, was originally a textile mill for the North Star Woolen Company. The mill was built in 1864 by W.W. Eastman and Paris Gibson {{on the west side}} of the west <b>side</b> <b>canal.</b> High quality wool blankets, scarves, flannels, and yarns were manufactured at the facility and it became the nation's largest manufacturer of wool blankets by 1925.|$|E

He {{lived in}} the modest Ca' Michiel on a <b>side</b> <b>canal</b> and married the {{beautiful}} Maffea from the Soranzo family, built a villa, raised five sons and lived a private family life. In his youth he followed his father to Bergamo when the elder Michiel was appointed Capitano, and he {{spent two years in}} Rome at the court of Pope Leo X, {{as a member of the}} familia of Cardinal Pisani. His peers apparently did not want to entrust him with ambassadorial duties in spite of his rank and connections, and it is as a collector and connoisseur, that he is remembered.|$|E
50|$|In 1908, {{after leaving}} the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Idaho Division, Savage began an eight-year {{association}} with A. J. Wiley, an engineer in Boise, Idaho. Their engineering practice boomed because of increased water use {{by the private sector}} for agriculture. Savage spent the majority of his time in the association inspecting and consulting on projects. During his time with Wiley, Savage worked on the Salmon River Dam, the Swan Falls Power Plant on the Snake River, the Barber Dam on the Boise River, the Twin Falls North <b>Side</b> <b>Canal</b> System, and the American Falls Power Plant. Savage also designed the gates for the Arrowrock Dam on the Boise River.|$|E

50|$|In the Rhine Plain {{the course}} of the river was made more {{complicated}} by numerous hydro-engineering measures, especially the Acher-Rench Correction between 1936 and 1967. Even in the Black Forest foothill zone above Oberachern, the Acherner Mühlbach was cut short by the Acher at a weir, which has an average discharge here of around 5 m³/s. The Acher itself - from Oberachern also called the Feldbach - then crosses the borough of Achern and is finally led to the Rhine and Rench with some of its water (high water discharge) into the Acher Flood Control Channel. Just before the flood channel and the Acher divide, the Fautenbach joins it. The originally, partially canalised river runs northwards as the Acher (Feldbach) to Greffern. Before the construction of the Rhine <b>Side</b> <b>Canal</b> (Rheinseitenkanal) it emptied into the Rhine here. The Acher is now led parallel to it to the Rhine Dyke (Rheindeich). A section of the Rhine Plain Canal used to pass under it coming from the left, being joined by the water-rich Sulzbach, the lower reaches of the Sasbach and Laufbach as well as the Acherner Mühlbach. The Rhine Plain Canal then used to empty into the Acher itself from the right. Further north the Sandbach finally joins the Altrheinzug ("Old Course of the Rhine") as the lower reaches of the Acher are called. It empties below the Iffezheim Lock into th Rhine, a good 10 kilometres below its old confluence. From Greffern the Acher is used as a link for the different areas of the Söllingen/Greffern Polder. In order to protect the Acher even when the polder floods, in 2005 a pumping station near Greffern was brought into operation.|$|E

5000|$|The North Sea Canal {{was built}} by digging a channel through the old IJ Bay and lining it with dikes, after which the {{remaining}} portions of the IJ Bay were reclaimed and turned into polders.

40|$|On the inflow <b>side</b> <b>canal</b> {{water in}} the canal command area of Mirwah is mismanaged by {{irrigation}} officials and head-end and influential farmers. Farmers in Sindh generally and Khairpur particularly irrigate their land without scientific techniques {{and there is no}} economic pricing of water that might encourage conservation. This, together with the lack of any adequate substitute in the form of administrative control of water and cropping patterns, has been responsible for the excessive water-coefficient of output, and the unequal distribution of water, which have been {{at the heart of the}} problem of mismanagement water on the inflow side. The need for restructuring the irrigation system in Sindh is urgent not only because of both allocation and distribution, because, over the years, the province has suffered from unequal distribution of water between big and small farmers, and between head-end and tail-end farmers...|$|E
