2500|$|Peleus and Thetis bore a son, {{whom they}} named Achilles. It was foretold {{that he would}} either die of old age after an uneventful life, or die young in a {{battlefield}} and gain immortality through poetry. Furthermore, when Achilles was nine years old, Calchas had prophesied that Troy could not again fall without his help. A number of sources credit Thetis with attempting to make Achilles immortal {{when he was an}} infant. Some of these state that <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> over fire every night to burn away his mortal parts and rubbed him with ambrosia during the day, but Peleus discovered her actions and stopped her. According to some versions of this story, Thetis had already killed several sons in this manner, and Peleus' action therefore saved his son's life. Other sources state that Thetis bathed Achilles in the Styx, the river that runs to the underworld, making him invulnerable wherever he was touched by the water. Because she had held him by the heel, it was not immersed during the bathing and thus the heel remained mortal and vulnerable to injury (hence the expression [...] "Achilles heel" [...] for an isolated weakness). He grew up to be the greatest of all mortal warriors. After Calchas' prophesy, Thetis hid Achilles in Skyros at the court of King Lycomedes, where he was disguised as a girl. At a crucial point in the war, she assists her son by providing weapons divinely forged by Hephaestus (see below).|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> {{with strong}} and passionate clasp {{and kissed him}} again and again.|$|E
60|$|She {{had turned}} white. The hands <b>she</b> <b>held</b> out to <b>him</b> trembled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Into order,' {{said the}} Doctor, shaking {{himself into the}} coat <b>she</b> <b>held</b> for <b>him.</b> 'Tom {{surrendered}} to a pet patient of mine. Now for poor Leonard! Good-bye, young people! I am off to Cocksmoor!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did I {{say to the}} Devil?" [...] <b>She</b> still <b>held</b> <b>him</b> by the hand, and now {{she laughed}} lightly as she looked into his face. [...] "Cannot you guess what I said to him?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{even as he}} {{had tried}} to rise <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> back, down on his knees.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> closer {{round the}} neck, and rocked him {{on her breast}} like a child.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> {{with her}} hands in the darkness, she felt his body again with hers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't ask {{you as a}} beggar," [...] he said, jestingly, {{taking a}} piece of bread-and-butter from the plate <b>she</b> <b>held</b> before <b>him.</b> [...] "I asked as a friend. My dad is rich, you know." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{knelt beside}} {{her chair and}} kissed the cold fingers which, with a sad little smile, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> out to <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then {{he knelt}} {{on one knee}} and kissed the hand <b>she</b> <b>held</b> out to <b>him,</b> while {{desiring}} him to speak freely to her.|$|R
60|$|She {{kissed him}} with passionate fervor; <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> {{to her for}} a moment with all her strength.|$|E
60|$|DOCTOR. Right as rain! <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> like an angel--he just licked her, {{and never}} made a sound.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> fast by the arm. The hurried parting before {{other people}} seemed to be not a parting to Blanche's taste.|$|E
60|$|The negro-woman, {{with one}} finger upon her lips, as with an imploring, all but despairing look, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> up to <b>him</b> her little crucifix.|$|R
6000|$|He {{reached down}} and took the slip of paper which <b>she</b> <b>held</b> out to <b>him.</b> The {{following}} legend met his eye, printed in bold letters: ...|$|R
60|$|The sad {{change in}} her startled and distressed him. Sincerely, solemnly even, he {{declared}} that the one alternative before her was the alternative that he had mentioned. He entreated her to control herself. It was useless, <b>she</b> still <b>held</b> <b>him</b> as if <b>she</b> was holding to her last hope.|$|R
6000|$|Well, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> a while blank. [...] "Does {{it seem to}} you {{extraordinarily}} much--twelve-hundred-and-sixty? Because, you know," [...] she added, [...] "it's all." ...|$|E
60|$|Now Gizur {{looked at}} her, and was minded to go; but, as Swanhild knew well, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> too {{fast in the}} net of her witcheries.|$|E

[...] said the Vicar, {{as he took}} a {{fragrant}} apple from the basket which <b>she</b> <b>held</b> towards <b>him,</b> {{and put it in}} his pocket. [...] "Something to soften down that harsh judgment? I am going straight to see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rose {{had no idea}} of tantalization, or <b>she</b> {{would have}} <b>held</b> <b>him</b> a while in doubt. She {{answered}} briefly, [...] "I can't. I don't know her name." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted the}} {{beautiful}} goblet from the table, {{put it to}} her lips, and drank a deep draught from it; then, smiling mockingly, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> it towards <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|When he {{bent down}} she flung her arms round his neck. It was {{slightly}} uncomfortable, for <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> in such a position that he felt rather choked.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{called in}} at Tom Blair's {{on my way}} home from the harbor," [...] he answered, trying to walk on. But <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> back by his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say {{good-bye to}} your brother, Jerry," [...] Villa Kennan {{prompted}} in Jerry's ear, as <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>him,</b> his quivering flanks between her two palms, {{on the rail}} where she had lifted him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> sat up, <b>held</b> <b>him</b> for {{a moment}} at arm's length, and looked at him with a kind of violence, as though she were never to see him again.|$|R
60|$|So {{they all}} reached Ireland in safety, and, because Sir Tristram had aided the King of Ireland {{in the day}} of his extremity, the Queen forgave him all the despite <b>she</b> <b>held</b> against <b>him,</b> so that he was {{received}} at the court of the King and Queen with great friendship and high honor.|$|R
6000|$|That was {{the sort}} of haughty remark <b>she</b> <b>held</b> ready for <b>him</b> while they talked of other cases; but it was never uttered, for by and by he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{the first}} time in her life, she threw her arms round him. In the agony of that farewell, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> to her bosom. [...] "Goodbye, dear," [...] she said faintly--and kissed him.|$|E
6000|$|But, turning, he was 'ware {{her looks}} beheld him [...] Out {{of the mirror}} white; [...] And at the window yearning arms <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>him,</b> [...] Out of the vague and sombre fold of night.|$|E
6000|$|... "You ARE afraid," [...] she {{answered}} as {{she gave him}} her own; on which, as he made no rejoinder, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>him</b> before her. [...] "Do you mean you REALLY don't know if she gets it?" ...|$|E
