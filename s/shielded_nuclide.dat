40|$|It {{has been}} called to my {{attention}} that the initial core inventory of yield of Cs- 136 (169 MCi) as calculated by the British codes CACHE and WIMS (see section VI. 2. 2. "Chornobyl Unit- 4 Core Inventory Calculation") is seriously in error. 1 Upon investigation, it appears {{the source of the}} error is in the codes: because Cs- 136 is a special case (so-called <b>shielded</b> <b>nuclide)</b> and comes largely from the activation of Cs- 135, only. a small contribution arises from fission. Apparently, the codes do not take this into account. Using the cumulative fission yield of the 136 mass chain yields an incorrect result since the chain terminates at the stable nuclide Xe- 136 that, of course, does not decay to Cs- 136. The initial inventory of Cs- 136 in previous studies is estimated to be in the range of 2. 2 to 3. 6 MCi, so that a relatively good estimate should be about 3. 0 MCi. It {{should also be noted that}} the assumption implied by the table that 1 - 131 and 1 - 133 have the same fractional release is only true if the total iodine release takes place over a time period short compared to the 20. 8 hour half-life of 1 - 133. From measurements taken shortly after the accident, it appears that a large part of the core's iodine inventory was released in the first day. If this is not the case, then a correction must be made for the 1 - 133 released. As a bounding case, assume that all the iodine is released in 20. 8 hours so that to a rough approximation one-half of the 1 - 13...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the dismantling of}} the inactive and activated areas of the biological shield of the ASTRA research reactor at the Austrian Research Center in Seibersdorf. The calculation of the parameters determining the activated areas at the <b>shield</b> (reference <b>nuclide,</b> nuclide vector in the barite concrete and horizontal and vertical reduction behaviors of activity concentration) and the activation profiles within the biological shield for unrestricted release, release restricted to permanent deposit and radioactive waste are presented. Considerations of located activation anomalies in the shield, e. g. in the vicinities of the beam-tubes, were made according to the reactor's operational history. Finally, an overview of the materials removed from the biological shield is given...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The ongoing {{program of}} nuclear {{facilities}} decommissioning within the UK has generated {{a requirement for}} the characterization of diverse waste forms. Many of the radionuclides requiring quantification are rarely encountered in routine radioanalytical studies. One such radionuclide is 113 mCd, which is produced via neutron activation of Cd in reactor control rods and <b>shielding.</b> The <b>nuclide</b> decays predominantly via beta emission (Eβmax = 580 keV; 99. 86 %), which is accompanied by gamma emission with very low yields (Eγ = 263. 7 keV; Iγ = 0. 02296 %). Quantification of 113 mCd in decommissioning wastes by gamma spectrometry is therefore mostly limited to high-activity samples. Liquid scintillation counting offers an attractive alternative for sensitive measurement of this nuclide but is restricted {{by the lack of}} any reference standard suitable for instrument calibration. Calibration using the Ciemat-NIST approach has therefore been evaluated. 113 mCd was purified using a validated separation procedure from irradiated Cd obtained from a UK research reactor. The purified fractions were then measured on a Wallac 1220 Quantulus liquid scintillation counter previously calibrated using the Ciemat-NIST (CN) approach and results compared with those obtained by gamma spectrometry. Good agreement was observed, confirming the suitability of liquid scintillation counting for the quantification of 113 mCd and the validity of using the CN calibration method for radionuclides where no reference standards are currently available...|$|R
40|$|A revised multigroup {{cross-section}} library {{based on}} Release 3 of ENDF/B-VI data has been produced and tested for light-water-reactor shielding and {{reactor pressure vessel}} dosimetry applications. This new broad-group library, which is designated BUGLE- 96, represents an improvement over the BUGLE- 93 data library released in February 1994 and replaces the data package for BUGLE- 93 in the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center (formerly RSIC). The processing methodology {{is the same as}} that used for producing BUGLE- 93 and is consistent with ANSI/ANS 6. 1. 2. The ENDF data were first processed into a fine-group, pseudo-problem-independent format and then collapsed into the final broad-group format. The fine-group library, which is designated VITAMIN-B 6, contains 120 nuclides. The BUGLE- 96 47 -neutron-group/ 20 -gamma-ray-group library contains the same 120 nuclides processed as infinitely dilute and collapsed using a weighting spectrum typical of a concrete <b>shield.</b> Additionally, <b>nuclides</b> processed with resonance self-shielding and weighted using spectra specific to BWR and PWR material compositions and reactor models are available. As an added feature of BUGLE- 96, cross-section sets having upscatter data for four thermal neutron groups are included. The upscattering data should improve the application of BUGLE- 96 to the calculation of more accurate thermal fluences, although more computer time will be required. Several new dosimetry response functions and kerma factors for all 120 nuclides are also included in the library. The incorporation of feedback from users has resulted in a data library that addresses a wider spectrum of user needs...|$|R
40|$|In-situ-produced cosmogenic nuclides {{provide an}} {{important}} tool for studying terrestrial landforms. This work refines our current understanding of cosmogenic nuclide production processes, outlines procedures for obtaining geomorphologic information from Accelerator Mass Spectrometry data, and uses these techniques to study the exposure histories of eight landforms in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes. ^ The effects of geometric shielding, from local obstructions and from burial on sloped surfaces, are modeled theoretically for spallation-based production. Numerical solutions are obtained for several common geometries where analytic solutions are not possible, and equations are presented to model the results. Neutron activation-based production processes are modeled using Monte Carlo simulations, and results are presented to model neutron activation-based production {{at the base of}} high, vertical cliffs. In addition, depth dependence is modeled for andesites, rhyolites, and dacites following the procedure of Dep (1995). ^ For the interpretation of cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations, a FORTRAN code has been developed. This code uses fits of measured cosmic ray attenuation lengths as a function of geomagnetic latitude, Monte Carlo simulations of production profiles, and the presented numerical solutions for geometric <b>shielding</b> to interpret <b>nuclide</b> concentrations. Results are discussed from a theoretical perspective, with particular emphasis on utilizing multiple mineral separates from a specific sample to quantify both exposure age and erosion rate for landforms with simple exposure histories. ^ Production rate calibration appropriate to the 100 ka age range is determined from comparisons of cosmogenic nuclide data with age estimates resulting from Ar-Ar analysis. Exposure histories for the sampled landforms have been calculated from cosmogenic isotope data, with ages as low as a few thousand years for samples from Tata Sabaya to samples that are in erosional equilibrium at a few millimeters per thousand years of denudation for samples from Ucumasi and San Martin. ...|$|R
