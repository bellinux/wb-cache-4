More specifically, we introduce a suitable subcategory SFP m of SFP which is naturally related to the <b>special</b> <b>category</b> of Stone <b>spaces</b> 2 -Stone by the functor MAX, which associates to each object of SFP m the space of its maximal elements. The category SFP m is closed under limits {{as well as many}} domain constructors, such as lifting, sum, product and Plotkin powerdomain. The functor MAX preserves limits and commutes with these constructors. Thus, SFP domains which "partialize" solutions of a vast class of domain equations in 2 -Stone, can be obtained by solving the corresponding equations in SFP m. Furthermore, we compare two classical partializations of the space of Milner's Synchronization Trees using SFP domains (see [3], [15]). Using the notion of "rigid" embedding projection pair, we show that the two domains are not isomorphic, thus providing a negative a [...] ...|$|R

As {{part of a}} new British {{policy of}} [...] "criminalisation", and coinciding with the end of internment, the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, ended <b>Special</b> <b>Category</b> Status from 1 March 1976.

Some prisoners changed from being <b>Special</b> <b>Category</b> Status prisoners to being common criminals. Brendan Hughes, an IRA prisoner, had been imprisoned with <b>Special</b> <b>Category</b> Status in Cage 11, but was alleged to have been involved in a fight with warders.
