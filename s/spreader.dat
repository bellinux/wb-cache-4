5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt <b>spreader</b> or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so {{commonly}} seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

40|$|In complex networks, it is {{of great}} {{theoretical}} and practical significance to identify a set of critical <b>spreaders</b> which help to control the spreading process. Some classic methods are proposed to identify multiple <b>spreaders.</b> However, they sometimes have limitations for the networks with community structure because many chosen <b>spreaders</b> may be clustered in a community. In this paper, we suggest a novel method to identify multiple <b>spreaders</b> from communities in a balanced way. The network is first divided into a great many super nodes and then k <b>spreaders</b> are selected from these super nodes. Experimental results on real and synthetic networks with community structure show that our method outperforms the classic methods for degree centrality, k-core and ClusterRank in most cases...|$|R
40|$|Identifying {{the most}} {{influential}} <b>spreaders</b> {{is an important issue}} {{for the study of the}} dynamics of information diffusion in complex networks. In this paper we analyze the following spreading model. Initially, a few nodes know a piece of information and are active <b>spreaders</b> of it. At subsequent rounds, <b>spreaders</b> communicate the information to their neighbors. Upon receiving the information, a node becomes aware of it but does not necessarily become a spreader; it starts spreading only if it gets the information from a sufficiently large number of its neighbors. We study the problem of choosing a small set of initial <b>spreaders</b> so as to maximize the final number of nodes that become aware of the information...|$|R
25|$|Container cranes {{consist of}} a {{supporting}} framework that can traverse {{the length of a}} quay or yard on a rail track. Instead of a hook, they are equipped with a specialized handling tool called a <b>spreader.</b> The <b>spreader</b> can be lowered on top of a container and locks onto the container's four locking points ("corner castings") using a twistlock mechanism. Cranes normally transport a single container at once, but some newer cranes have the capability to pick up two to four 20-foot containers at once.|$|E

25|$|The spars are {{designed}} by C and fabricated by Offshore Spars. The standard boat has a keel stepped non-tapered double <b>spreader</b> masthead sloop rig, with rod rigging and a hydraulic backstay adjuster. the R and XL variants have a tapered triple-spreader mast with all rod rigging, plus runners, checkstays, and an adjustable babystay for mast bend control. The backstay is split, with two hydraulic rams, on the boats with walk through transom (37+ and XL). The masthead, gooseneck and boom end are custom machined aluminum, welded {{to the one}} piece extrusion. The aerodynamic spreaders are secured to the mast via machined, continuous aluminum <b>spreader</b> bars. They precisely fit the <b>spreader</b> bases and traverse the mast and along with separate support bars carry the compression loads exerted by the shrouds. On the 37R (and 37XL) mast the middle and lower spreaders are slightly swept back, 2° for the middle spreaders, 4° for the lowers.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} {{the effect on}} the heat management by adding both fin to Thermal Through Silicon Vias (TTSV) and heat <b>spreaders</b> to the conventional Three Dimensional Integrated Circuit (3 D IC) structure. Various effects such as thermal cooling and its impact on distribution of potential across IC at different conditions have been simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics with various architectures such as: (1) 3 D IC structure with no fins and <b>spreaders,</b> (2) TTSV with fins and <b>spreaders</b> made of graphene, and (3) TTSV with fins and heat <b>spreaders</b> made of Carbon Nanotube (CNT). Our result yielded, CNT being better thermal cooling material compared to graphene of order greater than 100 K. Furthermore, finned structure with heat <b>spreaders</b> added an extra cooling advantage of the order greater than 400 K. But performance of graphene with fin structure is better as per signal integrity point of view. Conclusively thermal management can be improved efficiently with the above proposed 3 D IC structures...|$|R

25|$|Members {{belonging}} to a yacht club or sailing organization may fly their club's unique burgee both while underway and at anchor (however, not while racing). Sailing vessels may fly the burgee from the main masthead or from a lanyard under the starboard <b>spreader</b> on the mast. Power boats fly the burgee off a short staff on the bow.|$|E

25|$|The orbit {{will have}} a higher {{inclination}} than previous missions, to further expand the X-37B's orbital envelope. While the complete payload for OTV-5 is unknown, the Air Force announced that one experiment flying is the Advanced Structurally Embedded Thermal <b>Spreader</b> II (ASETS-II), which will measure the performance of an oscillating heat pipe. A number of small satellites will also share the ride.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} nasal valve {{comprises the}} area bounded by the upper lateral-cartilage, the septum, the nasal floor, and the anterior {{head of the}} inferior turbinate. In the narrow (leptorrhine) nose, this is the narrowest portion of the nasal airway. Generally, this area requires an angle greater than 15 degrees for unobstructed breathing; for the correction of such narrowness, {{the width of the}} nasal valve can be increased with <b>spreader</b> grafts and flaring sutures.|$|E

25|$|Sawdust, {{bark and}} chips are already used for decades for fuel in {{industrial}} processes; {{examples include the}} {{pulp and paper industry}} and the sugar cane industry. Boilers in the range of 500,000lb/hr of steam, and larger, are in routine operation, using grate, <b>spreader</b> stoker, suspension burning and fluid bed combustion. Utilities generate power, typically in the range of 5 to 50 MW, using locally available fuel. Other industries have also installed wood waste fueled boilers and dryers in areas with low-cost fuel.|$|E
25|$|The crane {{is driven}} by an {{operator}} who sits in a cabin suspended from the trolley. The trolley runs along rails located on the top or sides of the boom and girder. The operator runs the trolley over the ship to lift the cargo, usually containers. Once the <b>spreader</b> locks onto the container, the container is lifted, moved over the dock, and placed on a truck chassis (trailer) {{to be taken to}} the storage yard. The crane also lifts containers from chassis on the dock to load them onto the ship.|$|E
25|$|Obstructed airways – The {{restoration}} of normal breathing by correcting nasal obstruction {{caused by a}} cosmetic rhinoplasty wherein nasal cartilages were over-aggressively trimmed, and the nose appears pinched, which compromises nasal potency (airflow), especially when the patient attempts deep inspiration. These grafting techniques restore normal breathing by increasing {{the size of the}} nose tip with baton grafts (internal cartilage), and <b>spreader</b> grafts to widen the nasal middle vault. Furthermore, to improve breathing a septoplasty can be performed concurrent to the reconstructive surgery; likewise, if there is turbinate hypertrophy, an inferior turbinectomy can be performed.|$|E
40|$|Social {{networks}} {{constitute a}} new platform for information propagation, but its success is crucially {{dependent on the}} choice of <b>spreaders</b> who initiate the spreading of information. In this paper, we remove edges in a network at random and the network segments into isolated clusters. The most important nodes in each cluster then form a group of influential <b>spreaders,</b> such that news propagating from them would lead to an extensive coverage and minimal redundancy. The method well utilizes {{the similarities between the}} pre-percolated state and the coverage of information propagation in each social cluster to obtain a set of distributed and coordinated <b>spreaders.</b> Our tests on the Facebook networks show that this method outperforms conventional methods based on centrality. The suggested way of identifying influential <b>spreaders</b> thus sheds light on a new paradigm of information propagation on social networks. Comment: 17 pages, 4 figures and 1 tabl...|$|R

In this position, if the subject is a female and facing down, her breasts would be pointing almost straight down depending on the strictness of the position, and nipple clamps and weights can be added for painful stimulation.

25|$|The <b>spreader</b> hangs {{the strands}} of long pastas on the metal sticks where heated air flow is blown to prepare the product for high temperature. Pre-dryer reduces the {{moisture}} quickly (from 30% to 18%) in about an hour. Heat is produced by hot water radiators and centrifugal fans. For {{the first phase of}} the finish drying, product goes into a dryer with multi rows of hot water circulation plates. This phase decreases high rate of moisture and pasteurized the product. In the second phase warm air are blown to the product in an isolated multi-tier dryer and removes all the excess moisture.|$|E
25|$|Once a load {{is lifted}} off the substrate, it will rotate until {{the centre of}} gravity is in the {{position}} of lowest potential energy. If it is suspended from a single point, the apparent centre of gravity (corrected for inherent buoyancy) will be directly below the lift point. If it is undesirable for the load to rotate by a large angle as it leaves the bottom, the lifting point must be chosen to allow for this effect, and a multi-part sling or <b>spreader</b> bar may be needed, and {{it may be necessary to}} secure slings so they do not slip.|$|E
