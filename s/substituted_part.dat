Second, when listeners reconstructed distorted words - e. g. panorama from panozema - responses were faster and more accurate when only a phoneme was distorted (panozama, panorema) than when a whole CV mora was distorted (panozema). Third, lexical decisions on the same nonwords were better predicted by duration and number of phonemes from nonword uniqueness point to word end than by number of morae. Our results indicate no role for morae in early spoken-word processing; we propose that rhythmic categories constrain not initial lexical activation but subsequent processes of speech segmentation and selection among word candidates...|$|E

The optimal formulation method should be determined based on the flow table test and rheological characteristics obtained by ConTec Viscometer 5.

We wanted to find out whether the reference mortar mixture is the best mixture to estimate the rheological properties of concrete or one of modified mixtures could be a better choice. All mixtures were composed of water, aggregate, cement and additives. The type of water and aggregate were the same for all mortars and we used two types of cement. In four mixtures we <b>substituted</b> <b>part</b> of the cement with mineral additive, microsilica or slag. As chemical admixtures we selected superplasticizer and air entraining agent.

40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} {{is a major}} carbon pool and can play a {{significant}} role in carbon mitigation measures. It is also a crucial factor for several soil physical properties and a major nutrient source for crops. To obtain an understanding of the changes that occur in the soil following long term annual compost application, the Soil Service of Belgium started a long term field trial in Boutersem, Belgium in 1997. Here 12 different treatments (fallow, unfertilized, mineral fertilized and 9 compost treatments differing in intensity from 15 to 45 t/ha and in frequency from annual to tri-annual) were implemented in 4 repetitions. All compost amended treatments <b>substituted</b> (<b>part)</b> of the mineral nutrient requirements of the crop and had a positive influence on soil chemical and physical parameters. The continued application of compost also has important effects on the amount, distribution and stability of the soil organic matter. To quantify this, soil samples from 5 treatments were divided into 7 fractions differing in physical and biochemical protection levels of the associated SOM. Carbon, nitrogen and their respective stable isotope concentrations were measured in all fractions. Not only did the total amount of carbon in the amended soils increase significantly over the course of the experiment, it also increased specifically in the free and occluded micro-aggregate fractions. A recently developed model based on the C/N and delta 15 N ratio of the SOM was used to determine its relative age and stability in all of the isolated SOM fractions. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Lignin {{containing}} substantial aromatic {{rings and}} high content of carbon has been employed as carbonizing agent {{to investigate the}} flame retardancy in the lignin/ammonium polyphosphate (APP) intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system. In addition, owing to the abundant phenolic and aliphatic hydroxyl groups, lignosulfonate, which is considered as a renewable aromatic macropolyols, <b>substituted</b> <b>part</b> of diethylene glycol (DEG) and copolymerized with isocyanate to produce lignosulfonate-based rigid polyurethane (LRPU) foams. Thermal stability was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and flame retardancy was investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI) and cone calorimetry testing (CCT). Lignosulfonate increases thermal stability of LRPU foams and LRPU containing 15  wt% of lignosulfonate based on DEG (L 15 RPU) give rise to the best thermal stability. When 15 % of lignosulfonate incorporated in the LRPU, reduced the heat release rate (HRR) and total heat release (THR) value 21  kW/m 2 and 13  MJ/m 2, respectively, and postponed 96  s time-to-peak carbon monoxide production than that of pure DEG rigid polyurethane (RPU) foam, the LOI values increased progressively with lignosulfonate content increasing. These results showed that lignosulfonate polyol may substitute polyol to produce lignosulfonate-based RPU foam {{and the presence of}} lignosulfonate could improve the flame retardancy. The mass loss gradually decreases with increasing APP addition, and the highest char yield was obtained from LRPU 5 foam which at the lignosulfonate-to-APP ratio is 1 : 5. At the lignosulfonate-to-APP ratio of 1 : 5, the LOI value increased over 30 %, and the HRR value reduced and the time-to-peak HRR postponed significantly. In addition, LRPU 5 foams give rise to the lowest effect heat combustion (EHC) value, less smoke, and carbon monoxide (CO) production. Lignosulfonate acts as carbonizing agent in the lignosulfonate/APP IFR system, and the best fire retardancy is obtained at 1 : 5 of lignosulfonate-to–APP ratio.|$|E
40|$|Semantic {{field of}} a word varies in every {{language}} since it {{is influenced by the}} culture where people originally come from. Javanese people have various terms in expressing smell. They differentiate each term based on what the object that causes smell is. This research is aimed at describing the semantic analysis of smell terms in Javanese. By using Lyon’s theory that is supported by the other linguists, this research shows semantic field of smell terms in Javanese and their definitions. In addition, componential meaning analysis (Nida, 1975) is used to know the differences of each term and find the meaning relations of it. 	This research uses a descriptive qualitative method (Moleong, 2007) as it describes smell terms in Javanese. In collecting the data, the researcher uses documentation technique (Mardalis, 2003) because the data that is related to the research is taken from Kamus Lengkap Bahasa Jawa (Sudarmanto, 2008). Meanwhile, the researcher uses total / jenuh sampling (Sugiyono, 1999) to be able to show differences among each words of Javanese smell terms clearly. In analyzing the data, teknik perluas or expansion method (Sudaryanto, 1993) is used to see how the word is grammatical or not if it is expanded. In addition, the researcher also uses substitution method (Sudaryanto, 1993) to see the <b>substituted</b> <b>part</b> is suitable with the data or not. 	From the analysis, the researcher finds twenty-nine smell terms in Javanese that can be categorized into pleasant and unpleasant smell terms. In general, the difference among those terms is on their collocation. Moreover, the researcher also finds the meaning relations, such as: hyponymy, synonymy, and antonymy. All smell terms can be grouped into five synonymy, one antonym, and two kinds of hypernymy and hyponymy. Synonymy is the meaning relation that is mostly appeared in Javanese smell terms. It is because some words almost have same semantic components, such as meaning, usage, collocation, etc. The difference things is usually in the Javanese speech level whether it is krama or ngoko level. ...|$|E
