40|$|Plant {{intraspecific}} variability {{has been}} proposed as a key mechanism by which plants adapt to environmental change. In boreal forests where nitrogen availability is strongly limited, nitrogen addition happens indirectly through atmospheric N deposition and directly through industrial forest fertilization. These anthropogenic inputs of N have numerous environmen-tal consequences, including shifts in plant species composition and reductions in plant spe-cies diversity. However, we know less about how genetic differences within plant populations determine how species respond to eutrophication in boreal forests. According to plant defense theories, nitrogen addition will cause plants to shift carbon allocation more towards growth and less to chemical defense, potentially enhancing vulnerability to antago-nists. Aspens are keystone species in boreal forests that produce condensed tannins to serve as chemical defense. We conducted an experiment using ten Populus tremula geno-types from the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Aspen</b> Collection that express extreme levels of baseline invest-ment into foliar condensed tannins. We investigated whether investment into growth and phenolic defense compounds in young plants varied in response to two nitrogen additio...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a study of natural variation in functional leaf traits and herbivory in 116 clones of European aspen, Populus tremula L., the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Aspen</b> (SwAsp) collection, originating from ten degrees of latitude across Sweden and grown in a common garden. In surveys of phytophagous arthropods over two years, we found the aspen canopy supports nearly 100 morphospecies. We identified significant broad-sense heritability of plant functional traits, basic plant defence chemistry, and arthropod community traits. The majority of arthropods were specialists, those coevolved with P. tremula to tolerate and even utilize leaf defence compounds. Arthropod abundance and richness were {{more closely related to}} plant growth rates than general chemical defences and relationships were identified between the arthropod community and stem growth, leaf and petiole morphology, anthocyanins, and condensed tannins. Heritable genetic variation in plant traits in young aspen was found to structure arthropod community; however no single trait drives the preferences of arthropod folivores among young aspen genotypes. The influence of natural variation in plant traits on the arthropod community indicates the importance of maintaining genetic variation in wild trees as keystone species for biodiversity. It further suggests that aspen can be a resource for the study of mechanisms of natural resistance to herbivores...|$|E
40|$|Salicinoids are {{well-known}} defense {{compounds in}} salicaceous trees and careful screening at the population level is warranted {{to fully understand}} their diversity and function. European aspen, Populus tremula, is a foundation species in Eurasia and highly polymorphic in Sweden. We exhaustively surveyed 102 replicated genotypes from the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Aspen</b> collection (SwAsp) for foliar salicinoids using UHPLC-ESI-TOF/MS and identified nine novel compounds, bringing the total to 19 for this species. Salicinoid structure followed a modular architecture of a salicin skeleton with added side groups, alone or in combination. Two main moieties, 2 '-cinnamoyl and 2 '-acetyl, grouped the SwAsp population into four distinct chemotypes, and the relative allocation of salicinoids was remarkably constant between different environments, implying a highly channeled biosynthesis of these compounds. Slightly {{more than half of}} the SwAsp genotypes belonged to the cinnamoyl chemotype. A fraction synthesized the acetyl moiety alone (∼ 7 %) or in combination with cinnamoyl (∼ 2 %), and close to forty percent lacked either of the two characteristic moieties, and thus resemble P. tremuloides in their salicinoid profile. The two most abundant chemotypes were evenly distributed throughout Sweden, unlike geographical patterns reported for SwAsp phenology traits, plant defense genes, and herbivore community associations. Here we present the salicinoid characterization of the SwAsp collection as a resource for future studies of aspen chemical ecology, salicinoid biosynthesis, and genetics...|$|E
30|$|In this study, two {{important}} <b>Swedish</b> hardwood species, <b>aspen</b> and birch, commercially TM by the WTT method, were taken under consideration. At the laboratory scale, {{three types of}} oils were impregnated in different wood samples and the water repellency, dimensional stability and mold susceptibility were investigated. Overall, this study provides {{a significant amount of}} information regarding the effects of thermal modification and oil impregnation on the moisture properties and mold susceptibility of these {{two important}} Swedish hardwood species.|$|R
40|$|The Swedish {{hardwood}} sawmills {{are today}} experiencing problems of finding profitable markets for products containing for instance knots and red or brown heartwood. By using hardwood outdoors, {{it would be}} possible to expand the market of hardwood with new products that may set other requirements on the wood than the present use. In Sweden today, hardwood is normally used in furniture, joinery, floors and kitchens where esthetical requirements are dominant. When considering outdoor use, technical requirements such as durability become more important and especially the capillary characteristics of the wood are of interest. The capillarity determines the ability of the material to absorb and desorb moisture, characteristics that affect the resistance of degrading.   In this paper, the capillary characteristics were modelled and studied by exposing the cross section of wood to a free water surface. The study compares two <b>Swedish</b> hardwood species, <b>aspen</b> and oak with pine, a softwood species that is common in Sweden and often used outdoors. The results show that the capillary transport mechanism is affected by the microstructure of the wood and the natural ability of the material to close the transport paths in the structure with for instance extractives, tyloses and closed pits. Based on these factors, a characteristic capillary mean radius is introduced to describe the longitudinal capillary water absorption in the studied wood species...|$|R
