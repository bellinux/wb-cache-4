5000|$|Some {{abrasive}} minerals (such as zirconia alumina) occur naturally but {{are sufficiently}} rare or sufficiently more difficult or costly to obtain such that a <b>synthetic</b> <b>stone</b> is used industrially. These and other artificial abrasives include: ...|$|E
50|$|Artificial {{stone is}} a name for various kinds of <b>synthetic</b> <b>stone</b> {{products}} used from the 18th century onward. As well as artistic uses, they {{have been used in}} building construction, civil engineering work, and industrial uses such as grindstones.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, the {{original}} <b>synthetic</b> Coade <b>Stone</b> caryatids were replaced with concrete replicas. The figure of Britannia and the six caryatids were replaced by a fibreglass copy in 1982.|$|R
5000|$|Modern <b>synthetic</b> <b>stones</b> are {{generally}} of equal quality to natural stones, {{and are often}} considered superior in sharpening performance due to consistency of particle size and control over {{the properties of the}} stones. For example, the proportional content of abrasive particles as opposed to base or [...] "binder" [...] materials can be controlled to make the stone cut faster or slower, as desired. Natural stones are often prized for their natural beauty as stones and their rarity, adding value as collectors' items. Furthermore, each natural stone is different, and there are rare natural stones that contain abrasive particles in grit sizes finer than are currently available in artificial stones.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, {{materials}} used as abrasives are either hard minerals (rated at 7 or above on Mohs scale of mineral hardness) or are <b>synthetic</b> <b>stones,</b> {{some of which}} may be chemically and physically identical to naturally occurring minerals but which cannot be called minerals as they did not arise naturally. (While useful for comparative purposes, the Mohs scale is of limited value to materials engineers as it is an arbitrary, ordinal, irregular scale.) Diamond, a common abrasive, for instance occurs both naturally and is industrially produced, as is corundum which occurs naturally but which is nowadays more commonly manufactured from bauxite. However, even softer minerals like calcium carbonate are used as abrasives, such as [...] "polishing agents" [...] in toothpaste.|$|R

50|$|The {{design was}} a {{departure}} from accepted forms for commercial buildings in Queensland at the time. McDonald fused the assertive curves and angles of the Art Deco with the flowing horizontal lines of the Functionalist movement. This latter style was characterised by its simple geometric shapes, its light colours and large glass areas. The building also exemplified the use of new materials like the original glass brick of the circular entry tower and the <b>synthetic</b> <b>stone</b> of the original signage. Both these elements have since been removed.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the study}} of alchemy began, there have been {{attempts}} to synthetically produce precious stones, and ruby, {{being one of the}} prized cardinal gems, has long been a prime candidate. In the 19th century, significant advances were achieved, with the first ruby formed by melting two smaller rubies together in 1817, and the first microscopic crystals created from alumina (aluminium oxide) in a laboratory in 1837. By 1877, chemist Edmond Frémy had devised an effective method for commercial ruby manufacture by using molten baths of alumina, yielding the first gemstone-quality <b>synthetic</b> <b>stones.</b> The Parisian chemist Auguste Verneuil collaborated with Fremy on developing the method, but soon went on to independently develop the flame fusion process, which would eventually come to bear his name.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2012, {{the news}} emerged that a parcel of 600 unmarked {{synthetic}} diamonds had been submitted by a buyer to the International Gemological Institute diamond certifying agency for evaluation without any accompanying disclosure {{that they were}} synthetic. The DTC Diamond Research Center issued an alert and said the undisclosed synthetics were [...] "strikingly similar" [...] in their characteristics to Gemesis diamonds, and a trade journal said the synthetics and Gemesis diamonds had [...] "identical characteristics" [...] and [...] "had the specific Gemesis fingerprint". The diamonds had been grown by CVD and then treated by HPHT, and thus their production required both technologies. It was noted {{that all of the}} stones in the parcel were synthetics - there was no mixing to hide <b>synthetic</b> <b>stones</b> among natural ones. The buyer of the parcel said the 600 diamonds were only a sampling from a collection that was four or five times larger.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the {{magnetic}} properties of four gem-quality synthetic diamonds indicate that higher levels of permanent magnetism can be induced in the synthetics than could be induced {{in a number of}} gem-quality natural stones. As received, the colored and included synthetics showed much higher levels of magnetism than the natural stones, but one near-colorless synthetic had less magnetism than many of the natural stones. Most of the magnetism of the natural stones is due to surface contamination, which can only be removed by rigorous acid cleaning. After cleaning, the natural diamonds were not only less magnetic than all of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>stones,</b> but they were also more resistant to demagnetization. Significant levels of metallic impurities were detected in most of the synthetics. These results on a limited number of samples suggest that natural diamonds can be distinguished from synthetics {{on the basis of their}} magnetic properties, but that in the case of near-colorless, inclusion-free stones, such tests may require sophisticated instrumentation. ...|$|R

5000|$|In China, {{the game}} is {{traditionally}} played with single-convex stones made of a composite called Yunzi. The material comes from Yunnan Province and is made by sintering a proprietary and trade-secret mixture of mineral compounds derived from the local stone. This process dates to the Tang Dynasty and, after the knowledge {{was lost in the}} 1920s during the Chinese Civil War, was rediscovered in the 1960s by the now state-run Yunzi company. The material is praised for its colors, its pleasing sound as compared to glass or to synthetics such as melamine, and its lower cost as opposed to other materials such as slate/shell. The term [...] "yunzi" [...] can also refer to a single-convex stone made of any material; however, most English-language Go suppliers specify Yunzi as a material and single-convex as a shape to avoid confusion, as stones made of Yunzi are also available in double-convex while <b>synthetic</b> <b>stones</b> can be either shape.|$|R
5000|$|Like all jewelry, {{the price}} for an {{engagement}} ring varies considerably depending on the materials used: {{the design of the}} ring, whether it includes a gemstone, the value of any gemstone, and the seller. The price of the gemstones, if any, in the ring depends on the type and quality of the gem. Diamonds have a standardized description that values them according to their carat weight, color, clarity and cut. Other gemstones, such as sapphires, rubies, emeralds, have different systems. These may be chosen to honor a family tradition, to use family heirlooms, to be unique, to be socially responsible (they are not associated with blood diamonds or the pollution caused by gold mining and cyanide process) , to fit the individual's stylistic preferences, or to manage cost. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>stones</b> and diamond substitutes such as cubic zirconias and moissanites are also popular choices that are socially responsible and reduce cost while maintaining the desired appearance.|$|R
40|$|Maps {{recorded}} by micro-proton-induced x-ray emission (micro-PIXE) {{were obtained for}} different chemical elements for natural and synthetic emeralds. Eighty pieces of natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>stones</b> were examined.

These (a) demonstrated the power of micro-PIXE in reveal-ing inclusions in emeralds, which was useful for easy and unambiguous identification, and which made the identification of inclusions in rough stones possible; (b) provided some criteria for discrimination between natural and synthetic emeralds; and (c) gave the source of some chemical elements, so that their presence derived from the PIXE spectra would be further supported (e. g.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} decades {{in the theory of}} {{machining}} nonmetallic materials some serious advances have been achieved in the field of applying fundamental scientific approaches to the grinding and polishing technologies for high-quality precision surfaces of electronic components, optical systems, and decorative articles made of natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>stone</b> [1 - 9]. These achievements include a cluster model of material removal in polishing dielectric workpieces [1 - 3, 6 - 7] and a physical-statistical model of formation of debris (wear) particles and removal thereof from a workpiece surface [8 - 10]. The aforesaid models made it possible to calculate, without recourse to Preston's linear law, the removal rate in polishing nonmetallic materials and the wear intensity for bound-abrasive tools. Equally important for the investigation of the workpiece surface generation mechanism and formation of debris particles are the kinetic functions of surface roughness and reflectance of glass and quartz workpiece surfaces, which have been established directly in the course of polishing. During the in situ inspection of a workpiece surface by laser ellipsometry [11] and reflectometry [12] it was found out that the periodic change of the light reflection coefficient of a workpiece surface being polished is attributed to the formation of fragments of a deposit consisting of work material particles (debris particles) and tool wear particles [13, 14]. The subsequent studies of the mechanism of interaction between the debris particles and wear particles in the tool-workpiece contact zone, which were carried out based on classical concepts [15, 16], yielded some unexpected results. It was demonstrated that electrically charged debris and wear particles, which are located in the coolant-filled gap between a tool and a workpiece, move by closed circular trajectories enclosed in spheres measuring less than one fifth of the gap thickness. This implies that the probability of the debris and wear particles reaching the tool and workpiece surfaces and, especially, getting localized on the surfaces is extremely low, which contradicts the results of experimental examination of these surfaces. Based on the quantum-mechanical description of the process of scattering of the debris and wear particles that are as small as 3 - 4 nm in the tool-workpiece contact zone, the mechanism of formation of a workpiece microrelief and the mechanism of formation of a debris-particle deposit on the tool surface were clarified [17 - 21]. However, the mechanism of formation of the deposit fragments and their discrete arrangement on the workpiece surface in the process of polishing with a bound-abrasive tool has not been studied yet...|$|E

Czochralski or pulled alexandrite is easier to identify because it is very clean and contains curved striations visible under magnification. Although the color change in pulled stones can be from blue to red, the color change does not truly resemble that of natural alexandrite from any deposit.

Gypsum stones were placed at the nominal focus and treated with 250, 500, or 1000 shocks. The residual mass following passage through a 2 -mm wire mesh was measured and compared using ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer HSD test. There was no statistically significant difference between the Modulith SLX F 2 and Piezolith 3000 lithotripters for 250 and 1000 shock treatments (p[*]=[*] 0. 34 and 0. 31, respectively). The Piezolith 3000 demonstrated the most favorable stone mass reduction for 500 shock treatments (187. 4 [*]±[*] 45. 2 [*]mg). The Sonolith i-sys was found to be significantly less effective than the other lithotripters for all shockwave conditions.

40|$|Measurements are {{presented}} of acoustic emissions from cavitation collapses {{on the surface}} of a <b>synthetic</b> kidney <b>stone</b> in response to shock waves (SWs) from an electrohydraulic lithotripter. A fiber optic probe hydrophone was used for pressure measurements, and passive cavitation detection was used to identify acoustic emissions from bubble collapse. At a lithotripter charging voltage of 20 kV, the focused SW incident on the stone surface resulted in a peak pressure of 43 +/- 6 MPa compared to 23 +/- 4 MPa in the free field. The focused SW incident upon the stone appeared to be enhanced due to the acoustic emissions from the forced cavitation collapse of the preexisting bubbles. The peak pressure of the acoustic emission from a bubble collapse was 34 +/- 15 MPa, that is, the same magnitude as the SWs incident on the stone. These data indicate that stresses induced by focused SWs and cavitation collapses are similar in magnitude thus likely play a similar role in stone fragmentation...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityPrien and Walker^ 39 {{have treated}} chronic kidney stone formers with aspirin. They {{obtained}} clinical evidence showing no new stone growth and inhibition {{of the growth}} of existing stones. The rationale behind such therapy is that aspirin is excreted as a glucuronide conjugate in the urine, and the glucuronide increases dissolution of calcium phosphate stones. Previous laboratory studies^ 39, 10 have shown glucuronides (a concentrate of mixed urinary glucuronides, or o-aminophenol glucuronide) to increase the dissolution of tricalcium phosphate. Tricalcium phosphate is neither a major nor even common component of urinary calculi. The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate the effect of a glucuronide of salicylates on the dissolution of urinary calculi and their major component compounds. The diffuse pharmacological action of salicylates makes critical, in vitro experiments imperative. The ether glucuronide conjugate of salicylic acid, o-carboxyphenyl-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid (o-CPG), a known metabolic product of salicylates found in urine^ 40 and stones of known composition or <b>synthetic</b> components of <b>stones</b> should be used in these experiments. In the course of this investigation evidence of increased dissolution warranted further experimentation into the possible cause of such effects. Aspirin therapy as initiated by Prien and Walker derived from the qualitative experiments of Neuberg, Mandl and Grauer^ 33, 29, 30. In these experiments the authors attempted to either dissolve calcium salts or to inhibit their precipitation by addition of naturally occurring organic and inorganic acids. They showed that 1 -menthol-Dglucuronic acid solubilizes both calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate salts, that it functions in this way much better than non conjugated glucuronic acid and that incubation of such a mixture with β-glucuronidase leads to precipitation of the salt. The work of Cessi^ 10 followed in which the solubilizing effect of a glucuronide was observed during the synthesis of the glucuronide by an in vitro biological system. p^ 32 in the supernatant fluid resulting from dissolution of a solid phase of tricalcium phosphate containing p^ 32 (placed in the flask with the liver slices) was measured by counting the activity. The increase of p^ 32 over a control flask was found to vary directly with the glucuronide concentration. Salicylates {{have been shown to be}} excreted as the phenolic glucuronide ^ 40, 25, 2. Smith^ 42 has shown that acetylsalicylic acid is probably hydrolyzed in plasma to form salicylic acid. An increase of urinary glucuronides could then be made to occur by the ingestion of various "glucurongenins" (Teague). Prien and Walker^ 39 have reported an increase of 200 - 400 per cent over the basal level of urinary glucuronides in man during a 2 gm dose of aspirin / day. Glucuronides are manufactured largely by the liver, kidney and mucosa of the alimentary tract^ 15, 23, 24. The biosynthesis requires a coenzyme, uridine diphosphate which is thought to react with glucose to produce uridine diphosphoglucose which then may be oxidized to uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid in the presence of DPN^+ 45. The uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid will then transfer the glucuronic acid to a proper acceptor such as a phenol. The role of ingested glucuronic acid in this metabolic scheme seems to be negligible. Only a small percentage is recovered in the urine^ 20. Douglas and King using labeled glucurone found the glucuronic acid in the urine to be labeled in such a way as to support the theory that the glucurone breaks to three-carbon fragments. These fragments probably form a six-carbon precursor of glucuronic acid. Urinary tract calculi have been shown by Prien^ 37 to contain calcium in 90 per cent of 1000 calculi studied. Thirty-three per cent were pure calcium oxalate, 3. 4 per cent pure hydroxy apatite and 34 per cent were mixtures of calcium oxalate and hydroxy apatite. Hydroxy apatite is considered to be the main inorganic component of animal bone. The chemical structure of a unit cell is Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2 ^ 34, 9, 4. This crystal is the most common phosphate crystal found in urinary calculi. It is this component of urinary calculi with which this investigation is mainly concerned. EXPERIMENTAL The first series of experiments were designed to find the effect of o-CPG on the dissolution of a urinary tract stone composed chiefly of hydroxy apatite. The degree of dissolution was followed with phosphate determinations, using the colorometric procedure of Fiske and Subbarow. ^ 21 Since uric acid, salicylic acid, salicyluric acid and o-CPG are all found in the urine in increased amounts following ingestion of salicylates, these compounds were examined for their dissolutive effect. The test flask contained 100 mg of a powdered urinary stone composed mainly of hydroxy apatite, and 0. 1 mMoles of the test compound. The mixture was placed in a small dialysis bag along with 4 - 5 glass beads and 10 ml of buffer. This bag was placed in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 30 ml of the buffer and a few glass beads. Several drops of toluene were added to prevent bacterial contamination. The buffer used was Michaelis universal veronal buffer, pH 7. 8. This pH was chosen because Prien and Walker^ 39 had found it to be optimal for dissolution of calcium phosphate in their early experiments. The o-CPG was synthesized in this laboratory using the method of Lunsford and Murphey. ^ 28 The flasks were placed in a shaking water bath at 38 °C. and aliquots of the external phase in the flasks were analysed at 5 hours and 10 hours. Duplicate flasks were set up for each substance in question and for the control flask which contained hydroxy apatite only. At the end of 5 hours the o-CPG flask showed an increase in the phosphate concentration of 85 per cent over the control. The other substances showed little or no increase. After 10 hours the o-CPG showed an increase of 36 per cent over the control. We conclude that o-CPG increases the dissolution of urinary tract calculi composed mainly of hydroxy apatite. Furthermore, it is suggested from the decreasing per cent of increased dissolution over time that the o-CPG also hastens the equilibrium of dissolution. The experiment was repeated substituting synthetic hydroxy apatite, prepared in this laboratory, for the powdered stone. Estradiol glucuronide was examined as well as o-CPG. After 5. 75 hours both glucuronides increased dissolution; the estradiol glucuronide increased the dissolution by 87 per cent and in this case the o-CPG produced a 555 per cent increase. It can be concluded that o-CPG increases dissolution of hydroxy apatite and that it works better on pure hydroxy apatite than on other forms of calcium and phosphate. Other investigators^ 39, 10 have found an increase of about 40 per cent using calcium phosphate. The first possible explanation for these results, which occurred to us was that o-CPG was complexing calcium ion. In order to determine if complex formation with calcium were taking place, conductometric titrations were performed. The titration curves of sodium hydroxide and of calcium hydroxide with o-CPG, glucuronolactone and salicylic acid, were compared. If the sodium hydroxide titration fits well to the calcium hydroxide titration curve, one concludes that no highly conductive ions are produced and complex formation is absent. The results showed that there is a possibility that a slight amount of complex formation may have occurred with glucuronolactone but certainly not with salicylic acid or o-CPG. Further proof that no complexing of calcium was taking place was obtained by measuring conductivity of separate solutions of calcium lactate and o-CPG at different concentrations. They were then combined, each at one half their original concentration and the resultant conductivity compared with the theoretical conductivity which we calculated. Results show that the combined conductivity is about the same as the theoretical and therefore complex formation is absent. This type of experiment was repeated using calcium chloride instead of calcium lactate and the same results were obtained. The only conclusion we can draw is that o-CPG does not complex calcium. It was thought that perhaps o-CPG complexes calcium and phosphate together. To test this hypothesis another dissolution experiment was designed similar to the first ones reported. However, the o-CPG was incubated in one case with phosphate and in another case with barium and phosphate before being added to the synthetic hydroxy apatite. The only test flask which showed a significant difference from the controls was that one in which o-CPG was incubated first with barium and phosphate. Here, the dissolution effect of o-CPG was decreased by 30 per cent. We conclude that calcium and phosphate may be complexed together by o-CPG. In summary we may state that o-CPG increases the dissolution of urinary tract calculi containing hydroxy apatite; it increases the dissolution of synthetic hydroxy apatite; it does not form a complex with calcium but it may form a complex with calcium and phosphate. The results also suggest that it may increase the dissolution of hydroxy apatite by acting at the surface of the crystal. This question requires further investigation...|$|R
