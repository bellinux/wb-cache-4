Among the various {{amenities}} within the village is a junior/infant school, nursery school (local authority run), medical centre, post office (open 1 hour per day), supermarket, tobacconist/newsagents, hardware <b>store,</b> <b>curtain</b> shop, hairdresser, estate agent/sign shop, printers, bank, pharmacy and various Spanish bars. The village is also well catered with a Spanish restaurant (La Lloma) and an International restaurant (El Cid Restaurant & Bar).|$|E
50|$|YKK AP America Inc. {{manufactures}} entrances, <b>store</b> fronts, <b>curtain</b> wall, window wall, sunshades, {{windows and}} sliding doors for office buildings, residential high-rises, schools, stadiums, shopping centres and institutional structures.|$|R
60|$|At first a <b>store</b> of red <b>curtains,</b> some faded brocades, {{and ancient}} shawls {{comprised}} the stage wardrobe; {{but as the}} fame of the performances spread abroad, contributions {{were made to the}} little stock, and the girls became the proud possessors of a velvet robe, a plumed hat adorned with silver, long yellow boots, and a quantity of mock pearls and tinsel ornaments.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1950s, the 11th Duke and Duchess {{began to}} think about moving into the house. The pre-war house had relied entirely on a large staff for its comforts, and lacked modern facilities. The {{building}} was rewired, the plumbing and heating were overhauled, and six self-contained staff flats were created to replace the small staff bedrooms and communal servants' hall. Including those in the staff flats, 17 bathrooms were added to the existing handful. The 6th Duke's cavernous kitchen was abandoned and a new one was created closer to the family dining room. The family rooms were repainted, carpets were brought out of <b>store,</b> and <b>curtains</b> were repaired or replaced. The Duke and Duchess and their three children moved across the park from Edensor House in 1959.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of manufacture, a {{cryptographic}} key is generated and stored within the TPM. This key is never transmitted to any other component, and the TPM is designed {{in such a way}} that it is extremely difficult to retrieve the stored key by reverse engineering or any other method, even to the owner. Applications can pass data encrypted with this key to be decrypted by the TPM, but the TPM will only do so under certain strict conditions. Specifically, decrypted data will only ever be passed to authenticated, trusted applications, and will only ever be <b>stored</b> in <b>curtained</b> memory, making it inaccessible to other applications and the Operating System. Although the TPM can only store a single cryptographic key securely, secure storage of arbitrary data is by extension possible by encrypting the data such that it may only be decrypted using the securely stored key.|$|R
50|$|Other {{parts of}} the cave were {{discovered}} in 1985 by Elmar Hammerschmidt. The total length of the cave is 6,000 metres {{but it has not}} been completely surveyed. For the show cave section there is a roughly 500 m long circular tour. It is reached through a 90 metre long gallery through which visitors are guided. The original entrance is sealed today with a metal door. In one part of the cave, cheese is <b>stored,</b> a water <b>curtain</b> is supposed to help stop the smell spreading too far.|$|R
30|$|Chanel {{incorporates}} recurring {{colors of}} black and white as brand recognition in all its channels (Chanel Floraison 2014). Since touch increases probabilities of purchase, it places accessories where customers can feel the products. For example, Chanel has LED signage that visually promotes its signature tweed. In New York City, its flagship store lights up {{in the shape of a}} perfume bottle at night. Chanel’s London flagship store has a gravity-defying staircase and hand-blown Venetian glass focal point reminiscent of Gabrielle Chanel’s iconic pearls (Larocca 2013). The London <b>store</b> has <b>curtains</b> with hand-stitched pearls as a means of authenticating the brand. Chanel boutiques have a sitting area that features tweed chairs, plush carpet, fireplaces and coffee tables stacked with Chanel books on each floor for visual consistency (Karmali 2017). In addition, the store sprays Gabrielle Chanel’s classic Chanel No. 5 perfume to enhance the customer olfactory sensory experience (Larocca 2013). Indeed, Chanel is one of the successful brands that have utilized multi-sensory stimuli to intensify their customers’ experiences.|$|R
50|$|Brady leads Don to the {{residence}} of his gun moll, Loretta (Tedi Thurman). While he explains their situation to her, Don leaves unnoticed. When Loretta notices his absence, Brady decides to search for him. The following night, Don wanders the streets until deciding to visit his father's office. He confesses the murder to his father, and the doctor urges him to surrender to the police. The guilt-ridden Don agrees to do so eventually, but wishes for more time to think things through. His father helps him escape the arriving police. While fleeing Don is captured by Brady, who drives him back to Loretta's residence. The three of them listen to the radio, where the case of Paul McKenna (the nightwatchman)'s murder is covered and both their names are announced as murder suspects. Also mentioned in the broadcast is that Don {{is the son of}} a famous plastic surgeon. Don repeatedly expresses his decision to surrender and face the consequences of his actions. Fearing for his own safety, Brady kills his partner. The corpse is temporarily <b>stored</b> behind a <b>curtain.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Air {{curtains}} {{are commonly}} used to cut off air flow between the cold store and hot environment, and reduce heat and mass transfer {{in order to maintain}} the low temperature in the cold store. CFD can be used to predict operation rule of air curtain used in the cold store intuitively and modelling is the most important part of numerical simulation of air curtain used in the cold store. In this study, different numerical models including standard εκ − model (with and without boussinesq approximation) and RSM (with and without boussinesq approximation) were used to simulate the temperature field and air flow field in the cold store and operation rule of air curtain used in the cold <b>store</b> after air <b>curtain</b> opened for 60 s. Meanwhile, the actual operation of air curtain used in the cold store was tested and the simulation values were compared with the experimental values. The results showed that the velocity of the central mainstream decayed slowly, but the velocity of both sides of air curtain decayed fast. The optimal model used to predict the temperature field and air flow field in the cold store and operation rule of air curtain used in the cold store was standard εκ − model with boussinesq approximation, the relative error was within 20 %. The optimal model can be used to predict the temperature field and air flow field in the cold store during different times in the future research...|$|R
