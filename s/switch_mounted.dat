2500|$|Only detail {{changes were}} made for the 1970 {{full-sized}} Oldsmobiles including a new split grille that no longer extended to surround the headlights and a slightly revised rear section. Powertrain selections were carried over from 1969 with both 350 and 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8s now featuring [...] "Positive Valve Rotators" [...] for longer engine life and more efficient operation. A new antenna impregnated into the windshield was introduced this year that replaced the previous fender-mounted unit and was included as standard equipment on all cars equipped with a factory radio. New option this year was a wiper/washer <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> in the shift lever knob. [...] Optional radio was a stereo AM-FM radio and a lower dash mounted eight track tape player.|$|E

50|$|Another type of {{crank sensor}} {{is used on}} {{bicycles}} to monitor {{the position of the}} crankset, usually for the cadence readout of a cyclocomputer. These are usually reed <b>switches</b> <b>mounted</b> on the bicycle frame with a corresponding magnet attached to one of the pedal crankset arms.|$|R
50|$|Other changes {{included}} a new console-mounted shifter for automatic transmissions {{similar to the}} shifter used in Pontiac Firebirds replacing the Buick-like horseshoe shifter of previous Camaros, and the reintroduction of power windows to the option list {{for the first time}} since 1969, with the <b>switches</b> <b>mounted</b> in the console.|$|R
50|$|The {{stepping}} switch transmitted the traction current to the motors which were connected in series circuit. The flat track stepping <b>switch</b> was <b>mounted</b> to the transformer. It consisted of 18 steps with voltages between 230 V and 1300 V. For both motor groups a reverse <b>switch</b> was <b>mounted.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For trucks needing more gears, the {{standard}} [...] "H" [...] pattern can get very complicated, so additional controls {{are used to}} select additional gears. The [...] "H" [...] pattern is retained, then an additional control selects among alternatives. In older trucks, the control is often a separate lever mounted on the floor or more recently a pneumatic <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on the [...] "H" [...] lever; in newer trucks the control is often an electrical <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on the [...] "H" [...] lever. Multi-control transmissions are built in much higher power ratings, but rarely use synchromesh.|$|E
50|$|Like OEM alarms, {{aftermarket}} {{systems are}} usually armed and disarmed via remote. Usually {{they do not}} have provisions for external disarming from the key cylinder, but will typically have an override <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> in a hidden location.|$|E
50|$|A ceiling-mounted {{light fixture}} was {{installed}} in each room, usually controlled by a single <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> near a door. At most, one outlet was installed per room, since plug-connected appliances were expensive and uncommon. Wiring was performed using type NM (nonmetallic sheathed cable), insulated with asbestos-reinforced rubber covered with jute and tar.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} of the controller board was then to carry the support circuits for this serial or, on later boards, USB interface. As a further convenience during development, many boards also had low-cost features like LED monitors of the I/O lines or reset <b>switches</b> <b>mounted</b> on board.|$|R

Bottom, left to right: wall switch (U.S. style), {{miniature}} toggle switch, in‑line switch, push-button switch, rocker switch, microswitch.|$|R
50|$|Major {{changes were}} made to the {{dashboard}} with new instruments, touch <b>switches</b> <b>mounted</b> either side controlling wipers, rear window demister, electric antenna (Berlina/Calais), and the headlight switch moved from the right-hand dash side to the indicator stalk. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning control graphics changed slightly, the center console offered more storage with new transmission shifter and surround.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{selectable}} 4WD {{system is}} {{not to be confused with}} all road conditions [...] "all-wheel-drive" [...] systems; the MPV can be switched into locked 4WD with a <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on the column gear selector. A dash mounted switch controlled the center differential, creating a locked power distributions on the front and rear axles. The 4WD is not for use on dry roads, but can be engaged and disengaged while moving.|$|E
50|$|Several {{modifications}} were made. A toggle <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{the back}} of the amplifier chassis allows switching between tube (the original) and solid-state rectification; in the latter mode, output is boosted to 50 watts. A second toggle switch allows the player to disable the Normal channel and the Vibrato effect; the preamp gain is increased, and more distortion and sustain is available. This version of the amplifier has a fifteen-inch Eminence speaker and point-to-point wiring.|$|E
50|$|The {{starter motor}} is a series, compound, or {{permanent}} magnet type electric motor with a solenoid and solenoid operated <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on it. When low-current {{power from the}} starting battery {{is applied to the}} starter solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch, the solenoid closes high-current contacts for the starter motor and it starts to run. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened and the solenoid opens the contacts to the starter motor.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{characteristic}} of Digifant II equipped vehicles in California is a <b>switch</b> <b>mount</b> {{on the dashboard}} which has a [...] "Check Engine" [...] symbol. Digifant I models in California feature a Check Engine light, with the display of codes done by a special Volkswagen tool under the shift boot, or by a jumper and an LED by the home mechanic.|$|R

50|$|In 2011 Gibson {{released}} the Flying V Melody Maker, Explorer Melody Maker, SG Melody Maker and the Les Paul Melody Maker. All feature a humbucker and 1 volume knob, at a MSRP of $829us. They are limited edition and the colours available are Blue, Satin White and Ebony.A two-pickup model (Melody Maker Special) with P-90s, pots and toggle <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on a large}} vintage-style pickguard was produced in 2011 in satin TV yellow, Cherry, Blue and Black nitrocellulose finish.|$|E
5000|$|One type of {{float switch}} uses a mercury switch inside a hinged float. Another common type is a float that raises a rod to actuates a microswitch. One pattern uses a reed <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> in a tube; a float, {{containing}} a magnet, surrounds {{the tube and}} is guided by it. When the float raises the magnet to the reed switch, it closes. Several reeds can be mounted in the tube for different level indications by one assembly.|$|E
50|$|The Fender J5 Telecaster is John 5's {{signature}} model Telecaster, and {{was designed}} {{in part by}} John 5 himself. The prototype built by Fender Custom Shop Artist Relations representative Alex Perez has served as John 5's main guitar since around 2003. The standard features that differentiate John 5's Telecasters from the traditional Telecaster design include dual volume controls instead of both a volume and tone control, a three-way toggle <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> through the upper bout, chrome pickguard, and a specially shaped headstock.|$|E
5|$|In 1766, {{he started}} <b>switching</b> <b>Mount</b> Vernon's primary cash crop away from tobacco to wheat, a crop {{that could be}} {{processed}} and then sold in various forms in the colonies, and further diversified operations to include flour milling, fishing, horse breeding, hog production, spinning, and weaving, and (in the 1790s) he erected a distillery for whiskey production which yielded more than 1,000 gallons a month.|$|R
50|$|The PCB {{had five}} {{membrane}} <b>switches</b> <b>mounted</b> on top. Four of the switches were {{arranged in a}} cross pattern around {{the hole in the}} middle of the PCB, the fifth was offset near one of the corners. The PCB connected the switches to pins in the 9-pin D-connector that led to the console via a cutout in the upper right corner of the base. The cutout was shaped to grip a moulded strain relief on the cable.|$|R
50|$|The year Shut Out was born, Greentree Stables also {{produced}} top runner Devil Diver, who beat Shut Out in the 1941 Hopeful Stakes for 2-year-olds. Hall of Fame conditioner John Gaver, training for Greentree, gave Eddie Arcaro {{his choice of}} Kentucky Derby mounts: Devil Diver or Shut Out. Arcaro chose Devil Diver, who came in sixth. Shut Out, under jockey Wayne D. Wright, won the race. Arcaro <b>switched</b> <b>mounts</b> for the Belmont Stakes, riding Shut Out to victory.|$|R
5000|$|In {{building}} wiring, a {{light switch}} is a switch, {{most commonly used}} to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets. Portable lamps such as table lamps will have a light <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on the socket, base, or in-line with the cord. Manually operated on/off switches may be substituted by remote control switches, or light dimmers that allow controlling the brightness of lamps as well as turning them on or off. Light switches are also found in flashlights and automobiles and other vehicles.|$|E
50|$|In late 2002, Game Park {{introduced}} the frontlight unit (FLU) as a factory modified (by Hahotech) {{version of the}} NLU. It provides its own illumination via a transparent panel between the LCD display and the plastic screen cover. The extra hardware resulted in a slightly raised display frame {{when compared to the}} NLU and BLU variants. The frontlight could be turned off with a <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the back of the}} GP32 case (to save battery).The GP32 FLU's name was derived from a sticker added to the front of the GP32 packaging differentiating it from the standard non-light versions.|$|E
5000|$|Some guitars {{which have}} humbucking pickups feature [...] "coil splits", which allow the pickups {{to act as}} [...] "pseudo-single" [...] coils by either {{short-circuiting}} or bypassing one coil. The electrical circuit of the pickup is reduced {{to that of a}} true single coil so there is no hum canceling effect. Usually, this feature is activated using a miniature toggle switch or a DPDT push-pull <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on a potentiometer. Some guitars (e.g., the Peavey T-60 and the Fender Classic Player Jaguar HH) make use of a variable coil split circuit that allows the guitarist to dial a variable amount of signal from the second coil, from pure single-coil to full humbucker and everything in-between.|$|E
50|$|Switches are {{available}} in many form factors, including: desktop units not mounted in an enclosure which are typically intended {{to be used in}} a home or office environment outside a wiring closet; rack-mounted switches for use in an equipment rack; large chassis units with swappable module cards; DIN rail mounted for use in industrial environments; and small installation <b>switches,</b> <b>mounted</b> into a cable duct, floor box or communications tower, as found, for example, in FTTO Infrastructures.|$|R
50|$|Most dead man's <b>switches</b> are <b>mounted</b> in {{the control}} handle of a vehicle or machine and engage if the {{operator}} ever loses their grip.|$|R
50|$|In this article, when {{comparing}} different wiring methods or systems {{the focus is}} on the number of wires connecting the switches to each other. Sometimes an additional wire is present in each cable to carry an unswitched neutral or hot wire which passes through the <b>switch</b> <b>mounting</b> box, but is not normally connected to the switch. If the switch has a pilot light or a receptacle, additional hot or neutral connections to the device may be required. Grounding (earthing) wires are not counted.|$|R
50|$|Early 1970 models {{built from}} the {{introduction}} in April until August 1969 {{had a few}} interior features that the later 1970 models built from September 1969 onward did not. The earliest Mavericks featured a two-spoke steering wheel with a partial horn ring that was also found on other 1969 Fords, while the cars built in the 1970 model year had a revised steering wheel with no horn ring. Also, the early models featured the ignition switch in the instrument panel while the cars built after September 1, 1969 had the ignition <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on a locking steering column, as did all other 1970 Fords in compliance with a new federal safety mandate that took effect with the 1970 model year.|$|E

50|$|The 5302 {{essentially}} was a 302 telephone {{under a new}} cover. The new {{shell design}} {{was based on the}} 500 design and accommodated the front-to-back shorter model 302 base. As the model 302 had the dial and hook <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on the phone shell, the 5302 accommodated that design, in contrast to the model 500, which had all components mounted on the phone base. Like the 500, the dial also displayed the numbers and letters {{on the outside of the}} finger dial, however, the dial itself was actually the smaller 5H dial from the model 302, relabeled as 5M, or one of newer 6-series dials (6H). The 5300 type telephone housings were also produced in small quantities in the pastel colors blue, pink, beige, and white, when these became available in ca. 1958.|$|E
50|$|Meyer flew Friedrichshafen FF.33 number 599 with Leutnant zur See Erich Bönisch as his aerial observer. On 17 July 1916, {{they shot}} down a French FBA flying boat. They {{followed}} {{that with a}} twin engine Caudron destroyed north of Ostende, Belgium on 2 August. Three days later, having <b>switched</b> <b>mounts</b> to Brandenburg LW number 571, they were credited with another French FBA over Middelkerke. On 7 September 1916, they drove down a Caudron, but the victory claim was not confirmed.|$|R
