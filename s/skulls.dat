5|$|Scientists have {{suggested}} that the unique skull shape of Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids indicate different predatory habits than other theropods. Whereas most theropods were characterized by long, low <b>skulls</b> of narrow width, abelisaurid <b>skulls</b> were taller and wider, and often shorter in length as well. The narrow <b>skulls</b> of other theropods were well equipped to withstand the vertical stress of a powerful bite, but not as good at withstanding torsion (twisting). In comparison to modern mammalian predators, most theropods may have used a strategy similar in some ways to that of long- and narrow-snouted canids, with the delivery of many bites weakening the prey animal.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method to include <b>skull</b> inhomogeneities in the EEG forward/inverse {{calculation}} by parcellating the <b>skull</b> based on a combination of <b>skull</b> anatomy and thickness.

The validity of the linear relation between <b>skull</b> conductivities and <b>skull</b> thickness is investigated, our results show that this relation applies. The effect of <b>skull</b> inhomogeneities on the conductivity reconstruction of the human head tissues is presented. Our simulation results show here that the models approximating the <b>skull</b> as a homogenous tissue could produce an order of magnitude error in the retrieved conductivities in comparison with the models based on parcellated <b>skull.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Joseph E. Peterson and colleagues {{identified}} lesions in <b>skulls</b> of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. Lesions {{were found on}} 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur <b>skulls</b> (a frequency consistent across genera), but were absent from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), {{which is consistent with}} use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of lesions in these animals tended to concentrate {{at the top of the}} dome, which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides of the dome. These observations were made while comparing the lesions with those on the <b>skulls</b> and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon and willingness to use it can be enough to settle disputes in some animals.|$|E

Two kinds of burials are distinguished; a primary burial intended to transport the dead into the netherworld, and a secondary burial that was intended to transform the deceased into their ultimate form: an ancestor. The royal hypogeum provides hints at the different rituals taking place during a secondary burial; a noticeable character is that skeletons were not complete, and no <b>skulls</b> are found for the majority of secondary burial remains.

5|$|Another {{prominent}} early anthropologist, Thomas Wingate Todd, {{was primarily}} responsible {{for the creation of}} the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912. In total, Todd acquired 3,300 human <b>skulls</b> and skeletons, 600 anthropoid <b>skulls</b> and skeletons, and 3,000 mammalian <b>skulls</b> and skeletons. Todd's contributions to the field of anthropology remain in use in the modern era and include various studies regarding suture closures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the mandible. Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the pubic symphysis. Though the standards have been updated, these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists to narrow down an age range of skeletonized remains. These early pioneers legitimized the field of anthropology, {{but it was not until}} the 1940s, with the help of Todd's student, Wilton M. Krogman, that forensic anthropology gained recognition as a legitimate subdiscipline.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in their skull and teeth, {{it was later}} thought that monkey lemurs (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) were a sister group to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae). However, there was some debate over whether the monkey lemurs or the sloth lemurs were {{more closely related to}} today's indriids. The monkey lemurs had <b>skulls</b> that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized <b>skulls.</b> The matter was settled with the discovery of new skeletons of Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indriid-like <b>skulls</b> and teeth. More recently, postcranial remains of Hadropithecus found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that the monkey lemurs were more closely related to the lemurids. However, DNA sequencing has reaffirmed the sister group status of the monkey lemurs to indriids and sloth lemurs.|$|E

5|$|Edmontosaurus is {{currently}} regarded as having two valid species: type species E. regalis, and E. annectens.

5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} {{is not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware of}} other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes.

In general, male <b>skulls</b> tend to be larger and thicker than female <b>skulls,</b> and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus has a {{complicated}} taxonomic history, beginning in 1902 with Lawrence Lambe's naming of hadrosaurid limb material and other bones (originally GSC 419) from Alberta as Trachodon marginatus.

Lambe assigned two new <b>skulls</b> to T. marginatus, and based on the new information, coined the genus Stephanosaurus for the species in 1914. Unfortunately, there was very little to associate the <b>skulls</b> with the scrappy earlier marginatus material, so in 1923 William Parks proposed a new genus and species for the <b>skulls,</b> with both generic and specific names honoring Lambe: Lambeosaurus lambei (type specimen NMC 2869, originally GSC 2869).|$|E

5|$|Since many {{remains of}} each species of mammoth are known from several localities, it is {{possible}} to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies. Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges (or lamellar plates) on their molars: primitive species had few ridges, and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items. The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the <b>skulls</b> became taller to accommodate this. At the same time, the <b>skulls</b> became shorter from front to back to reduce the weight of the head.
