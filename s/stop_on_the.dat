5|$|Hadspen was an {{important}} <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coach route from Launceston to Deloraine from at least the 1840s. The coach service declined from when rail transport started in Tasmania in the late 1860s. The State Government began operating a school bus from town, to Hagley, in the 1930s.

5|$|Häkkinen {{made his}} pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 26th lap and emerged behind Michael Schumacher, while Verstappen {{retired from the}} race with a {{mechanical}} problem. All of the leaders had taken their stops {{by the start of}} lap 28, the top ten were Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Coulthard, Button, Frentzen, Salo, Zonta and Wurz. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race on the same lap, a 1:24.470 as he started to close the gap to Michael Schumacher, as Ralf Schumacher again became under pressure by Coulthard in fourth. Eleven laps later, Coulthard entered the pit lane, triggering the second round of pit stops. Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following lap and rejoined behind Coulthard. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen both made their pit stops on the 41st lap, with Häkkinen emerging in front because Michael Schumacher's pit stop was problematic. Michael Schumacher's mechanics had started refulling after putting his tyres on causing him to be stationary for ten seconds longer than usual. Salo and Zonta went into the pit lane on lap 45, allowing Button into sixth.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen passed Villeneuve on lap 28 {{although}} {{he went off}} the track in the process. Herbert made his only pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same lap {{although he}} stalled and rejoined in twelfth place.

Häkkinen made a pit stop on lap 35, emerging behind Villeneuve and Irvine. Coulthard managed to close to within 2 seconds of Michael Schumacher {{when he made his}} second pit stop on lap 38. Michael Schumacher made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following lap and remained in the lead. Barrichello became the leader for one lap and made his pit stop on lap 41. This allowed Michael Schumacher to reclaim the first position. By the start of lap 45, Coulthard had closed to within two seconds of Michael Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher was called into his garage by his team to retire on the 45th lap. Zonta pulled off the race track with an blown engine two laps later.|$|E

5|$|In April 2012, state {{officials}} {{released a report}} detailing possible sites for an infill station in East Lyme. Four sites were analyzed – two near downtown Niantic and two at Rocky Neck State Park. Niantic had previously been a <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Clamdigger. As part of a bonding proposal made by Governor Malloy, $750,000 would be allocated for a new station at Niantic. A study will be undertaken to analyze the corridor capacity impacts that the station would bring.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1147, the Pope {{authorized}} {{the expansion of the}} crusade into the Iberian peninsula, {{in the context of the}} Reconquista. He also authorized Alfonso VII of León and Castile to equate his campaigns against the Moors with the rest of the Second Crusade. In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from Dartmouth in England for the Holy Land. Bad weather forced the ships to <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese coast, at the northern city of Porto on 16 June 1147. There they were convinced to meet with King Afonso I of Portugal.|$|E

5|$|SODO Station {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the late 1980s, but was ignored in subsequent light rail proposals until {{the addition of the}} Beacon Hill Tunnel to the Central Link route in 1998. It was built between 2005 and 2006 by Kiewit Pacific and opened to Link service on July 18, 2009. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. SODO Station is also served by several Sound Transit Express and King County Metro buses that <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> SODO Busway adjacent to the platforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} single tracked between Appledore and Ore on 1 October 1979, leaving a passing loop at Rye. At Winchelsea, the down {{platform}} was removed; trains {{in both directions}} now <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> former up platform. Line speed was reduced from 85mph to 60mph, but there are additional long term speed restrictions in place, including 40mph between Doleham and Ore and 20mph across a half barrier level crossing at Winchelsea.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} unstaffed, but {{features}} ticket machines, a waiting room, kisok and taxicab stand. There is parking nearby {{in a parking}} house. The bus station features two sections, one for local buses and one for regional buses. Between them they have six stops. However, because of the design of European Road E18, the station can only serve buses on the E18 which runs westwards—eastbound buses are served by a bus <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of the}} freeway. Ownership and operation of the bus terminal is carried out by Akershus Kollektivterminaler.|$|E
