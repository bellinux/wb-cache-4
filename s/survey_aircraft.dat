25|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirements}} of the Japanese Ministry of Railways for a <b>survey</b> <b>aircraft,</b> Mitsubishi developed a civilian version of the Type 92, the Hato <b>survey</b> <b>aircraft.</b> A single aircraft was ordered in 1935, together with a Fokker Super Universal built by Nakajima. Powered by a 298kW (400hp) Mitsubishi A5 engine, it differed from the military version in having a glazed canopy over the rear cockpit (which accommodated a crew of two), an open forward pilot's cockpit, and spat-type main wheel fairings. It was delivered in March 1936 and registered J-AARA.|$|E

40|$|To combine various {{sensors to}} get a system for {{specific}} use became popular within the last 10 years. Metric mid format cameras meanwhile reach the 100 MPix and entered the mapping market {{to compete with the}} big format sensors. Beside that also other sensors as SLR Cameras provide high resolution and enter the aerial surveying market for orthophoto production or monitoring applications. Flexibility, purchase-costs, size and weight are common aspects to design multi-sensor systems. Some sensors are useful for mapping while others are part of environmental monitoring systems. Beside classical <b>surveying</b> <b>aircrafts</b> also UL Airplanes, Para/Trikes or UAVs make use of multi sensor systems.

2500|$|The first {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight in mid-1935, soon being {{followed by a}} second aircraft, similar to the first.

2500|$|In 1935, Canada {{selected}} the Delta {{for use as}} a photographic <b>survey</b> <b>aircraft</b> for use by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), to be built by Canadian Vickers under license. One aircraft, the last Delta built by Northrop, was supplied as a part assembled pattern to Canadian Vickers, first flying on 16 August 1936 and being delivered to the RCAF on 1 September that year. [...] It was followed by a further 19 aircraft built wholly by Canadian Vickers, production continuing until October 1940. The Northrop Delta was the first all-metal, stressed-skin aircraft built in Canada.|$|E
2500|$|The Deltas, {{which were}} capable of being {{operated}} from wheeled, ski or float undercarriages, proved capable <b>survey</b> <b>aircraft,</b> well suited to operations in the North of Canada, but in August 1939, when {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War loomed, Canada found itself short of coastal patrol aircraft, and the Deltas were diverted to this role, being fitted with floats and carrying out long anti-submarine missions. The Deltas were less successful as patrol floatplanes, as they were damaged by ocean swell and by salt water corrosion, and they were forced to revert to landplane use after two months. [...] The Delta was withdrawn from operations in late 1941, then being used as instructional airframes in training schools.|$|E

2500|$|The Rivet Chip and Rivet Slice {{aircraft}} {{have been}} used by NASA in support of various research programs. NASA first provided funding to modify and operate RB-57F 63-13501 to support the Earth Resources Satellite Program, with modifications taking place at Fort Worth between 26 September 1968 and 14 July 1969 as Project Rivet Rap. Flying as NASA 925 and known as [...] "ESA (Earth <b>Survey</b> <b>Aircraft)</b> No. 3", the WB-57F was used as a flying testbed for the evaluation of multispectral sensors in a [...] "near-space" [...] environment to collect data to be correlated with similar data collected at low altitude and on the ground. The Air Force contracted with NASA to provide the aircraft on the condition that its sensor package be easily removed to reconfigure the aircraft quickly for its national security mission if necessary. The Rivet Rap was therefore modified to carry aerodynamically faired, plug-in pallets developed by General Dynamics to house both NASA and Air Force primary mission equipment. These pallets fit into the bomb bay and connected with existing electrical and cooling outlets, and had removable operating consoles that could be fitted into the back seat station in the cockpit.|$|E
