30|$|From the 9 -point Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale [34], 1 <b>study</b> <b>had</b> {{a quality}} score of 6, 6 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> a quality score of 7, 32 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> a quality score of 8, and 15 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> a quality score of 9 (only peer-reviewed {{articles}} were assessed).

30|$|Nine of the {{analyzed}} studies included well-trained individuals, six of {{the studies}} included moderately trained individuals, and five studies included untrained individuals. The degree of inertia {{in the included studies}} varied between 0.07 and 0.145  kg m 2. The rest times between sets varied between 1 and 5  min (1 <b>study</b> <b>had</b> 1  min, 1 <b>study</b> <b>had</b> 1.5  min, 11 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> 2  min, 5 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> 3  min, and 2 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> 5  min). In four of the studies [37, 44, 52], the intervention period coincided with the competition season and the other 16 studies were performed during pre-season or when there was no other physical activity {{at the time of the}} study period.|$|R

30|$|This <b>study</b> <b>has</b> {{examined}} the SoP genre’s potential disciplinary variations in lexico-grammatical and rhetorical features.

Thus, while this <b>study</b> <b>has</b> provided further empirical evidence to define the SoP as an academic self-promotional genre, it has also offered several valuable insights of the SoP genre’s disciplinary variations in textual regularity.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown {{that people with}} SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.|$|E

5|$|Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, {{has long}} {{been used as a}} model {{organism}} in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory, its small genome, and {{the fact that many of}} its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes. A large number of genetic <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> been undertaken based on this species; these have had a profound impact on the study of gene expression, gene regulatory mechanisms and mutation. Other <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> investigated physiology, microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topics. The studies on dipteran relationships by Willi Hennig helped in the development of cladistics, techniques that he applied to morphological characters but now adapted for use with molecular sequences in phylogenetics.|$|E
