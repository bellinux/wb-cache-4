5|$|Fundamental rights {{primarily}} protect {{individuals from}} any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are enforceable against individuals. For instance, the Constitution abolishes untouchability and also prohibits begar. These provisions {{act as a}} check both on <b>state</b> <b>action</b> {{as well as the}} action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled that all provisions of the Constitution, including fundamental rights can be amended. However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Since the fundamental rights can be altered only by a constitutional amendment, their inclusion is a check not only on the executive branch but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{rational}} nexus test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner. Instead, a modified rational nexus test is used, which requires a court to consider {{whether there is a}} reasonable nexus between the <b>state</b> <b>action</b> taken and the object of the law. Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1).|$|E
5|$|Brentwood Academy {{sued the}} {{association}} over this action. Brentwood {{argued that the}} enforcement of the rule constituted <b>state</b> <b>action</b> which they claimed violated the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The school asserted that their due process rights had been violated because there were no evidentiary hearings to determine the validity of the claim that they inappropriately recruited football players. Further, they argued that the rule violated their freedom of speech because it restricted the ways the Academy could recruit. In July 1998, the District Court agreed with this argument and granted summary judgement to the Academy, while enjoining the association from enforcing the rule. A year later, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that the actions of the association did not constitute 'state action'. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari of the case to review this question.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{analysis}} four major policy {{issues associated with}} <b>state</b> <b>actions</b> for personnel evaluation from 1983 to 1992 and provides descriptive information about <b>state</b> policy <b>actions</b> taken during those years. Twenty states enacted their first requirements for performance evaluation, and states assumed new roles for program development, implementation, and staff development. Twenty-nine states passed legislation for performance pay programs, but only five programs remained viable by 1992. States generally avoided the issue of teacher tenure when enacting legislation for teacher evaluation. Thirty-eight states enacted 67 changes in legislation prescribing specific requirements for personnel evaluation. During {{the early part of}} the reform movement, <b>state</b> <b>actions</b> focused on accountability; toward the end of the reform movement <b>states</b> <b>actions</b> relinquished control and returned responsibility for evaluation to local school districts. Legislation varied across the states in the purpose for evaluation: improvement, continuing employment, and performance pay.

In United States v.

25|$|Decentralization {{is also a}} key ideological idea to technoliberalism, {{sought to}} work though the {{deregulation}} of rules that stop businesses competing with the government services. Decentralization means distributing the power away {{from the center of}} an organization, diffusing authority outwards to workers in the field. The rapid growth of information technology has aided this concept as the likes of the internet have made the distribution of information accessible and cheap. On the other hand, is the ideological idea of free markets. Strongly enforced rules would be needed here as this type of market would be based on supply and demand with little government control. Technoliberalist's believe that knowledge and technology can be geographically transferred without much difficulty or <b>state</b> <b>action,</b> envisaging a completely free market where buyers and sellers are allowed to transact unreservedly, based on a mutual agreement on price without state intervention in the form of taxes, subsidies or regulation.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} an algorithm for solving MDPs with large <b>state</b> and <b>action</b> spaces, represented as factored MDPs with factored action spaces. Classical algorithms for solving MDPs are not effective since they require enumerating all the <b>states</b> and <b>actions.</b> As such, model minimization techniques have been proposed, and specifically, we extend the previous work on model minimization algorithm for MDPs with factored <b>state</b> and <b>action</b> spaces. Using algebraic decision diagrams, we compactly represent blocks of <b>states</b> and <b>actions</b> {{that can be}} regarded equivalent. We describe the model minimization algorithm that uses algebraic decision diagrams, and show that this new algorithm can handle MDPs with millions of <b>states</b> and <b>actions.</b> ...|$|R

500|$|There are however {{instances}} {{where people are}} the victims of civil-rights violations that occur in circumstances involving both government officials and private actors. In the 1960s, the United States Supreme Court adopted an expansive view of <b>state</b> <b>action</b> opening the door to wide-ranging civil-rights litigation against private actors when they act as state actors (i.e., acts done or otherwise [...] "sanctioned in some way" [...] by the state). The Court found that the <b>state</b> <b>action</b> doctrine is equally applicable to denials of privileges or immunities, due process, and equal protection of the laws.|$|E
500|$|Individual liberties {{guaranteed}} by the United States Constitution, other than the Thirteenth Amendment's ban on slavery, protect not against actions by private persons or entities, but only against actions by government officials. [...] Regarding the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court ruled in Shelley v. Kraemer (1948): [...] "he action inhibited by {{the first section of}} the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful." [...] The court added in Civil Rights Cases (1883): [...] "It is <b>State</b> <b>action</b> of a particular character that is prohibited. Individual invasion of individual rights is not {{the subject matter of the}} amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes void all State legislation, and <b>State</b> <b>action</b> of every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the laws." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} factor in determining the existence of <b>state</b> <b>action</b> is not governmental involvement with private persons or private corporations, but [...] "the inquiry must be {{whether there is a}} sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself." [...] "Only by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance." ...|$|E
