40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{investigate}} {{the incidence of}} allergy to laboratory animals (ALA) {{during the first two}} years of employment, and to study the effect on ALA of atopy and sensitisation. METHODS [...] A follow up prospective study of ALA at the Zeneca (formerly ICI) Research Laboratories. RESULTS [...] The incidence of the disease during the first year of employment has remained at about 10 % since the mid- 1980 s. This compares with an incidence of 37 % in the early 1980 s. The reduction in incidence and its maintenance at a lower level is thought to be due to the introduction and management of improved engineering controls, working practices, and educational programmes designed to reduce exposure to allergens from laboratory animals. The underlying incidence of immunological <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> (the presence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to animal allergens) is much higher (40 % after one and 53 % after two years of exposure). Both atopic diathesis and presensitisation to laboratory animals increased the likelihood that a person would develop ALA. CONCLUSION [...] Neither factor predicted the disease accurately so their use should be restricted to the identification of people who may be more susceptible to the development of ALA (and thus who may need to pay particular attention to the use of personal protective equipment) rather than to their exclusion...|$|E

Aims and Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the occurrence of egg allergy in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis at the age 14 years and older and to evaluate the relationship between egg allergy or egg sensitisation and the <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> dust, mites, feather, and animal dander. Materials and Methods: Complete dermatological and allergological examination was performed. These parameters were examined: food allergy and food <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> egg white and yolk, <b>to</b> mites, <b>animal</b> dander (mixture), feather and dust. The statistical evaluation of the relations among egg allergy, egg <b>sensitisation</b> and <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> mites, <b>animal</b> dander (mixture), feather and dust was performed. Two hundred and eighty eight patients were included in the study (90 men, 198 women, with the average age 25. 2).

40|$|The aim was {{to study}} and prospectively follow {{symptoms}} and sensitisation of laboratory animal workers with laboratory animal allergy (LAA) and workers at risk for development of LAA in terms of latency time, incidence, prevalence and possible health selection. Furthermore, the impact of animal positive skin prick tests (SPT) on lung function and individual risk factors for development of LAA was studied. Thirty percent of animal exposed workers had developed LAA symptoms, one third of those had LAA asthma and two thirds were SPT positive <b>to</b> laboratory <b>animals.</b> The retrospective mean latency time before onset of symptoms in SPT positve subjects was about two years. The long-term incidence of LAA symptoms and sensitisation was 2. 1 and 0. 5 cases per 100 person-years respectively. The level of sensitisation, measured as the weal area of SPT reactions and total serum IgE levels, remained unchanged at follow-up. <b>Sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> laboratory <b>animals</b> did not affect baseline lung function but was associated with increased airway responsiveness. The tendency of health selection in the first study was accelerated during the follow-up period and especially LAA asthma cases stopped working with laboratory animals. Risk factors for developing LAA asthma were parental and childhood allergy, raised total serum IgE levels (> 100 kU/L) and positive SPT to environmental allergens. Furthermore, LAA was associated with HLA-DR 4 and particular Gm genes and a possible "protective effect" of HLA-B 16 was found indicating the polygenic inheritance of the immune response in atopy. The short latency time and the low long-term incidence of LAA suggest an early development of LAA in susceptible individuals...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: German {{cockroach}} or Blattella germanica {{is commonly}} found in homes across the inter-tropical region. The contribution of <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> Blattella germanica in people with asthma in sub-Saharan Africa has not received attention. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the prevalence and investigate the predicting factors of <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> Blattella germanica in patients with asthma in Yaounde, Cameroon. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between January 2012 and June 2013. All patients (aged 15 years and above) with asthma, receiving care at the Yaounde Jamot Hospital and the CEDIMER medical practice during the study period and who had received a prick skin testing for perennial aeroallergens were included in the study. RESULTS: The final sample comprised 184 patients including 123 (66. 8 %) women. The median age (25 th- 75 th percentiles) was 38 (24 - 54) years. Prick skin test for Blattella germanica was positive in 47 (25. 5 %) patients. <b>Sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> Blattella germanica was associated with a <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> mite in 41 (87. 2 %) patients, a <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> Alternaria in 18 (38. 3 %) patients, and a <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> cat or dog dander in 7 (14. 9 %) patients. Independent predicting factors of a <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> Blattella germanica were the <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> Blomia tropicalis [adjusted odd ratio (95 % confidence interval) 4. 10 (1. 67 - 10. 04), p= 0. 002] and <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> Alternaria [3. 67 (1. 53 - 7. 46), p= 0. 003].

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out on {{respiratory}} symptoms and skin prick test response to common allergens (atopy), storage mites, and occupational allergens among 226 bakers and pastry makers from 105 small businesses in northern Italy. Atopy was present in 54 workers (23. 4 %); 40 workers (17. 7 %) were skin positive {{to at least one}} storage mite, 27 (11. 9 %) to wheat flour and 17 (7. 5 %) to alpha-amylase. Work related asthma was reported by 11 (4. 9 %) workers and rhinoconjunctivitis by 31 (17. 7 %); 22 workers (10. 2 %) complained of chronic bronchitis. The distribution of skin prick test results among bakers and among 119 white collar workers did not indicate (by logistic analysis) an increased risk for bakers <b>to</b> skin <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> common allergens, storage mite, or to a group of five flours. <b>Sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> wheat flour, on the other hand, was present only among exposed workers. Skin <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> occupational allergens was significantly associated with atopy (p < 0. 001), smoking habit (p = 0. 015), and work seniority (p = 0. 027). The risk of work related symptoms was associated with <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> wheat or alpha-amylase, and with atopy, but not with <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> storage mites, work seniority, or smoking habit. The results of the study indicate that there is still a significant risk of allergic respiratory disease among Italian bakers.

40|$|P>Background: The Forkhead Box P 3 (FOXP 3) gene, {{located on}} the X-chromosome, encodes a {{transcription}} factor that directs T cells toward a regulatory phenotype. Regulatory T cells may suppress development of atopy. We evaluated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FOXP 3 are associated with atopy development in childhood. Methods: Seven SNPs in FOXP 3 were genotyped in 3062 children (51 % boys) participating in the Allergenic study, which consists of three Dutch birth cohorts (PIAMA, PREVASC and KOALA). Association of FOXP 3 SNPs with total serum IgE and sensitisation (presence of specific serum IgE to egg, milk, and indoor, i. e. house-dust mite, cat, and/or dog allergens) was investigated at ages 1, 2, 4, and 8. Analysis of variance and logistic regression were performed, stratified for gender. Results: Our most consistent finding was observed for <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> egg and indoor allergens. In girls, five FOXP 3 SNPs (rs 5906761, rs 2294021, rs 2294019, rs 6609857 and rs 3761548) {{were significantly associated with}} <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> egg at ages 1 and 2 and with <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> indoor allergens at age 2 (P < 0. 05), but not at 4 and 8, a finding that was observed across the three cohorts.

However, {{there is no}} direct evidence linking glucocorticoids and sensitisation achieved by repeated administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK- 801. We tested the hypothesis that co-administration of RU 486, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, prior to repeated daily MK- 801 injections would block the expression of locomotor <b>sensitisation</b> due <b>to</b> its dual effects on corticosterone and dopamine. We employed a repeated MK- 801 administration locomotor sensitisation paradigm in male Sprague Dawley rats. RU 486 or a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle was co-administered with MK- 801 or saline during the induction phase. Subsequent to withdrawal, rats were challenged with MK- 801 alone to test for the expression of sensitisation. In a separate cohort of rats, plasma corticosterone levels were quantified from blood samples taken on the 1 (st), 4 (th) and 7 (th) day of induction and at expression. One day after challenge, nucleus accumbens tissue levels of dopamine and its metabolites DOPAC and HVA were measured. During the induction phase, RU 486 progressively enhanced locomotor <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> MK- 801. RU 486 and MK- 801 both showed stimulatory effects on corticosterone levels and this was further augmented when given in combination. Contrary to our hypothesis, RU 486 did not block the expression of locomotor <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> MK- 801 and actually increased levels of dopamine, DOPAC and HVA in nucleus accumbens tissue. Our results showed that RU 486 has augmentative rather than inhibitory effects on MK- 801 -induced sensitisation.

40|$|RATIONALE: This study {{provides}} information on changes in sensitisation rates in children on the Isle of Wight. METHODS: Three cohorts of children were recruited and underwent skin prick tests to a predefined panel of allergens (milk, egg, peanut, cod, house dust mite, cat and grass) by standard methodology. Wheat sensitisation was not analysed for Groups C and D due to different solutions used. Group A: Children born 1989, tested at four years (1993). Group B: Children born 2001 / 02, tested at three years (2004 / 05). Group C: Children born 1989, tested at ten years (1999). Group D: Children born in 1991 / 92, tested at 11 years (2002). RESULTS: <b>Sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> predefined food allergens increased significantly from 1. 8 % in 1993 (Group A) to 4. 2 % in 2004 (Group B) (p = 0. 008). When wheat-grass cross-reactors were excluded, increase was no longer significant (p = 0. 31). In contrast <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> aeroallergens showed a significant decrease from 14. 8 % to 10. 9 % (p = 0. 006). Notable decreases were seen in HDM (p = 0. 006), and grass, (p = 0. 013). A significant rise, from 2. 2 % in 1999 (Group C) to 4. 6 % in 2002 (Group D), was observed in <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> food allergens (p = 0. 008). Sensitivity to peanut (p = 0. 1023) and grass (p = 0. 0115) rose significantly. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of sensitivity to both food and aeroallergens was seen to be greater amongst older children than younger children.

40|$|Occupationally-related airway diseases, {{including}} {{asthma and}} chronic obstructive lung disease, {{have emerged as}} having substantial public health importance. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the predictors of occupational <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> grain dust allergens and changes in lung function among grain mill workers in Cape Town. There were two major objectives of the study. Firstly, to determine which of the following factors determine the distribution of serum ECP (eosinophilic cationic protein) : age, gender, grain dust exposure, smoking status, atopy and <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> workplace allergens. Secondly, to investigate the risk factors associated with the following outcomes: i) <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> occupational allergens; ii) diagnosis of occupational asthma; iii) diagnosis of chronic obstructive airways disease; and iv) longitudinal changes in lung function. The risk factors studied included age, gender, smoking habits, occupational exposure, lung function status on baseline survey (1989), and allergic sensitisation assessed at follow up (1996). The methods employed involved a repeat measures cross-sectional design including a cohort followed up at different points over a seven year period. Survey instruments included a questionnaire, spirometry and allergy tests (phadiotop, RAST for wheat, rye, Lepidoglyphus destructor, Tyrophagus putrescentiae and Sitophilus granarius). The results indicated an association of grain dust with pulmonary function and allergic <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> grain dust constituents. After adjusting for known confounders such as age, gender and smoking, significant associations were found between employment duration and both decrements in lung function and <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> wheat grain. A decrement of 278 ml in FEY 1 and 328 ml in FYC was associated with occupational <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> wheat (and rye). Increasing employment duration resulted in annual decrements of 18. 3 ml in FEY 1 and 23 ml in FYC for every year employed. The odds for developing occupational asthma was only mildly elevated (OR=l. 35) with increasing employment duration. Age, however, was found to be protective (OR= 0. 85). Although we were unable to demonstrate a relationship between across-week changes in lung function, at inception, and rapid longitudinal lung function decline, our findings suggested that longitudinal change was related to the degree of airway obstruction at inception. <b>Sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> grain dust allergens was also found to be an independent predictor for FEY 1 and FYC. The prevalence of sensitisation was the highest for wheat (26. 4 %), followed by Tyrophagus putrescentiae (22. 6 %), rye (21. 7 %), Lepidoglyphus destructor (15. 1 %) and Sitophilus granarius (15. 1 %). <b>Sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> wheat was highly correlated with <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> rye (r = 0. 92) and so were Lepidoglyphus destructor and Tyrophagus putrescentiae (r = 0. 85). Although a large proportion of the workforce (41. 5 %) were sensitised to occupational allergens, the prevalence of respiratory symptoms was between 15. 6 % and 23. 9 %. There were 16. 7 % of workers with health outcomes which fulfilled our criteria for occupational asthma. Atopic workers in our study had at least a nine-fold increased odds of becoming sensitised to grain dust allergens (OR: 8. 9 - 74. 7) and a two-fold increased odds of developing occupational asthma (OR= 1. 9 - 84. 9). Furthermore, the study found that smokers had a twofold increased odds of becoming atopic, thereby placing them at greater risk of developing respiratory health problems. The mean ECP in this population was 15. 4 ug/ 1 (SD: 2. 5). Although 45. 3 % of the workers were atopic, it was not found to be predictor of elevated ECP levels. We were however able to demonstrate a significant association between ECP and <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> grain allergens. Workers sensitised to wheat (positive RAST) had, on average, 1. 78 ug/ 1 higher ECP levels. The odds of having an elevated ECP (> 15 ug/ 1) increased by 2. 9 for workers sensitised to wheat grain. In conclusion, the results of the study indicate that selection effects are in operation, demonstrating the health worker effect. The findings also suggest that across week reactions may be less sensitive than the across shift changes in predicting rapid longitudinal decline in lung function. While we were able to characterise the distribution of ECP according to exposure, we were however unable to define the temporal relationship between elevated between exposures, ECP and lung function outcomes due to limitations of the study design...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between exposure to acid anhydrides {{and the risk of}} developing immediate skin prick test responses to acid anhydride human serum albumin (AA-HSA) conjugates or work related respiratory symptoms; to assess whether these relations are modified by atopy or smoking. METHODS: A cohort of 506 workers exposed to phthalic (PA), maleic (MA), and trimellitic anhydride (TMA) was defined. Workers completed questionnaires relating to employment history, respiratory symptoms, and smoking habits. Skin prick tests were done with AA-HSA conjugates and common inhalant allergens. Exposure to acid anhydrides was measured {{at the time of the}} survey and a retrospective exposure assessment was done. RESULTS: Information was obtained from 401 (79 %) workers. Thirty four (8. 8 %) had new work related respiratory symptoms that occurred for the first time while working with acid anhydrides and 12 (3. 2 %) were sensitised, with an immediate skin prick test reaction <b>to</b> AA-HSA conjugates. <b>Sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> acid anhydrides was associated with work related respiratory symptoms and with smoking at the time of exposure to acid anhydride. When all subjects were included and all three acid anhydrides were taken into account there was no consistent evidence for an exposure-response relation, but with the analysis restricted to a factory where only TMA was in use there was an increased prevalence of <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> acid anhydrides and work related respiratory symptoms with increasing full shift exposure. This relation was apparent within the current occupational exposure standard of 40 micrograms. m- 3 and was not modified significantly by smoking or atopy.

40|$|AbstractAn {{increasing}} {{volume of}} {{evidence suggests that}} early contact of children with the allergens of furred pets (especially those produced by cats) may determine a lower risk of developing allergic <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> these materials. A possible explanation of this data is that an early inhalation of high levels of the major cat allergen Fel d 1 induces the production of IgG and IgG 4 antibodies with a “protective” effect. Other authors {{have shown that the}} prevalence of allergic <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> cats, in adults, is reduced in those patients exposed to the lowest and highest levels of the allergens. On the contrary, the risk of developing <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> cats is significantly higher when the patients were exposed to intermediate levels of Fel d 1. Moreover, epidemiological studies have demonstrated a relatively low prevalence of cat allergy (about 10 %) in some countries where rates of cat ownership are high. This data confirms the role of indirect exposure to pet allergens in inducing allergic sensitisation. Clothes of pet owners have been indicated as the carriers for the dispersal of these allergens in pet-free environments. However, it is {{important to point out that}} exposure of highly sensitised patients to relevant amounts of pet allergens (such as in a pet shows/shops) may determine a dramatic exacerbation of nasal and/or bronchial symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Background: Veterinary {{medicine}} {{students who}} practice with animals are potentially exposed to many occupational agents, yet sensitisation and allergic symptoms among this group {{have not been}} studied extensively. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the prevalence of sensitisation and allergic symptoms in veterinary medicine students in association with study specialisation over time. Methods: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted. Blood was collected and tested for total and specific serum IgE for 16 different common and study-specific allergens using enzyme immunoassay. Results: New development of self-reported allergic symptoms to various allergens occurred in 8. 7 %, of which 44 % was deducted against animals. Handling farm animals was strongly associated with self-reported allergies to various allergens (OR= 6. 9, 95 % CI 1. 9 <b>to</b> 25) and <b>animal</b> allergens (OR= 12, 95 % CI 1. 4 <b>to</b> 103). <b>Sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> at least one allergen occurred in 33. 1 %. <b>Sensitisation</b> prevalence tended <b>to</b> be elevated in later years of the equine study program. In contrast to self-reported allergies, the prevalence of <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> any allergen decreased with prolonged study duration for those specialising in farm animal health (years 3 e 5 : OR= 0. 5, 95 % CI 0. 3 to 1. 1; year 6 : OR= 0. 2, 95 % CI 0. 1 to 0. 5). This was independent of whether people were raised on a farm, which is in itself a protective factor for allergy and sensitisation.

After 5 days of withdrawal, rats were challenged with their respective dose <b>to</b> test for <b>sensitisation.</b> From this experiment a sensitising dose was obtained. In the second experiment the magnitude of sensitisation was compared between rats that were treated in either a home or test environmental context. Rats treated with 0. 25. mg/kg MK- 801 developed robust sensitisation when challenged after withdrawal. Rats treated with lower (0. 1. mg/kg) or higher (0. 5. mg/kg) doses of MK- 801 did not develop locomotor <b>sensitisation.</b> <b>Sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> 0. 25. mg/kg MK- 801 developed equally between rats treated in the home or test context. The study shows that male Sprague Dawley rats develop behavioural <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> repeated injections of MK- 801. The development of <b>sensitisation</b> is selective <b>to</b> MK- 801 dose in an inverted-U dose response fashion. In this paradigm MK- 801 induced sensitisation was expressed similarly between groups treated in two distinct environmental contexts...|$|R

Differences in seasonal patterns by sensitisation status were assessed using generalised estimating equations. Most young adults with asthma reported periods {{of the year when}} their asthma attacks were more common (range 47 % in Sweden to 86 % in Spain). Seasonal variation in asthma was not modified by <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> house dust mite or cat allergens. Asthmatics sensitised to grass, birch and Alternaria allergens had different seasonal patterns to those not sensitised to each allergen, with some geographical variation. In Southern Europe, those sensitised to grass {{were more likely to report}} attacks occurred in spring or summer than in winter (OR March/April 2. 60, 95 % CI 1. 70 - 3. 97; OR May/June 4. 43, 95 % CI 2. 34 - 8. 39) and smaller later peaks were observed in northern Europe (OR May/June 1. 25, 95 % CI 0. 60 - 2. 64; OR July/August 1. 66, 95 % CI 0. 89 - 3. 10).

40|$|The Fanconi {{gene family}} has a role in DNA repair and {{inactivation}} of FANCF has been proposed as a mechanism of <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> platinum chemotherapy. This study sought to confirm this hypothesis in cell lines and a large series of ovarian cancer samples.

This study confirmed methylation-dependent silencing of FANCF in one out of nine ovarian cancer cell lines. Methylation of FANCF was demonstrated in 13. 2 % of 53 evaluable ovarian tumour samples. Progression-free survival gave an HR of 3. 63 (95 % CI: 1. 54 - 8. 54, P= 0. 0016) in favour of the unmethylated cases. There was no association with overall survival.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} kind and {{frequency}} of <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> aeroallergens (skin prick test - SPT) of asthmatic and non-asthmatic adolescents (13 - 14 years old) {{living in the city}} of Caruaru, Northeast of Brazil, and to analyse their exposure to some environmental factors. Method: A case-control study was conducted with asthmatic (50) and non-asthmatic (150) adolescents diagnosed by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) written questionnaire. All were submitted to SPT with aeroallergens (house dust mites, cat and dog epithelium, cockroaches, moulds and grass) and completed a questionnaire to evaluate their environmental exposure. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} groups regarding gender, age, number of siblings and environmental exposure. Asthmatic subjects exhibited a higher frequency of positive SPTs than non-asthmatic subjects (54. 0 % vs 33. 3 %, p= 0. 009) mainly due to Periplaneta americana (34. 0 % vs 12. 7 %, p= 0. 0007 respectively) and Canis familiaris (20. 0 % vs 8. 7 %, p= 0. 029). Conclusion: Although <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> aeroallergens was high among non-asthmatic adolescents, asthma was associated with parental history of atopic disease and <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> P. americana and Canis familiaris but not to D. pteronyssinus showing that local studies are mandatory for the tailoring of appropriate management of allergic diseases.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between resistance to adriamycin, vincristine, colchicine and etopside, expression of P-glycoprotein and CP 22 (sorcin), and resistance modification by verapamil and cyclosporin A {{have been studied}} in a panel of multidrug-resistant (MDR) mouse tumour cell lines. Whereas there was a generally good correlation between the degree of resistance {{and the amount of}} P-glycoprotein, no relationship between resistance and CP 22 expression was seen. At 3. 3 microM verapamil, the sensitisation of the MDR cell lines was no greater than that of the parent line. At 6. 6 microM verapamil, however, sensitisation of the MDR lines generally exceeded that of the parent line, although the line CR 2. 0, expressing very high levels of P-glycoprotein was an exception. Little <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> etoposide was seen in any of the lines. When cyclosporin A was used as the sensitiser at either 2. 1 or 4. 2 microM, there was a greater effect in lines expressing moderate to high levels of P-glycoprotein than in the parent line, although this tendency was less for adriamycin than for the other cytotoxics. <b>Sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> etoposide was much greater with cyclosporin A than with verapamil. At low levels (less than 1 microM) of CsA, however, <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> colchicine was greater in the parent line than in cell line CR 2. 0.

40|$|In-vitro {{diagnostics}} of Hymenoptera venom allergy Patients with {{a history}} of anaphylactic sting reactions require an allergological work-up (history, in-vitro tests, and skin tests) to clarify indications on venom immunotherapy and on the type of venom to be used. To demonstrate a venom sensitisation, measurement of IgE-antibodies (sIgE) specific to the natural composite venom is the standard in-vitro method. In-vitro tests are performed after a field sting reaction. After a sting, an increase of sIgE concentrations, which is followed by a decrease, indicates a previous exposure, and may help to identify the culprit venom. If the eliciting insect is doubtful, it is recommended to do repeated measurements shortly after a sting. In adults measurement of baseline serum tryptase concentration should be included into routine diagnostics of venom allergy. If a <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> the presumably causative composite venom cannot be demonstrated, one may determine sIgE to recombinant COD-free allergen compounds, thereby possibly demonstrating a <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> molecular venom allergens. In addition, one should consider the involvement of in Germany rare elicitors of insect sting anaphylaxis, such as bumble bees, hornets, Dolichovespula, or Polistes. If these rare elicitors could have been involved into allergic reactions, one should test patients for IgE specific to the respective venom. Moreover, several cellular tests (e. g., basophil activation test) are available <b>to</b> confirm venom <b>sensitisation.</b> Herein basophils, which carry cell-bound sIgE, can be used to confirm the involvement of suspected venoms (e. g., by showing a histamine release or up-regulation of cell surface markers upon incubation with venom allergens). Double <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> both honey bee and vespid venom may either indicate true double sensitisation or cross sensitisation. In double-sensitized patients, inhibition tests and tests using molecular allergens may help to clarify the diagnosis. Results of the above mentioned in-vitro tests, however, do not precisely correlate with the clinical relevance of the putative elicitor. Double <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> both honey bee and vespid venom may either indicate true double sensitisation or cross sensitisation. In double-sensitized patients inhibition tests, and tests with molecular allergens may help to specify the diagnosis. None of the mentioned in-vitro tests, however, allows a precise prognosis with respect to clinical relevance. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atopy {{is known}} to play an {{important}} role in the asthmatic disease. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of <b>sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> common aeroallergens in a cohort of asthmatics with different inflammatory phenotypes and disease severity. METHODS: We have conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study including 772 asthmatics recruited between 2003 and 2014 in our Asthma Clinic. The patients were defined as asthmatics on the basis of respiratory symptoms together with a positive methacholine test (PC 20 M) /= 12 % and 200 ml. <b>Sensitisation</b> <b>to</b> house dust mites, grass and birch pollens, cats, dogs and moulds was assessed by RAST and a specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) > 0. 35 kU/l was considered as significant. Inflammatory phenotypes were subdivided between pauci-granulocytic (n = 309) (40 %), eosinophilic (n = 311) (40 %), neutrophilic (N = 134) (17 %) and mixed-granulocytic (N = 18) (3 %) asthmatics. Severe asthmatics (n = 118) were defined according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS 2000) criteria and compared with mild-to-moderate asthmatics (N = 654). RESULTS: The eosinophilic phenotype was associated with higher levels of total serum IgE compared with neutrophilic and pauci-granulocytic asthma (p < 0. 001 for both). <b>Sensitisation</b> rate <b>to</b> dogs and cats was higher in eosinophilic asthmatics (31 % and 37 %, respectively, p < 0. 01 both) compared with neutrophilic (18 % and 23 % respectively) and pauci-granulocytic asthmatics (20 % and 24 %, respectively), while <b>sensitisation</b> rate <b>to</b> house dust mites and moulds were rather similar between the groups (ranging from 33 % to 40 % and from 10 % to 16 %, respectively). Severe asthmatics had slightly increased total serum IgE compared with mild-to-moderate asthmatics (p < 0. 05) without any difference in the <b>sensitisation</b> rate <b>to</b> common aeroallergens. CONCLUSION: Eosinophilic asthma exhibits higher total serum IgE and sensitisation rate towards animal dander while clinical severity, though also associated with higher total IgE, did not preferentially relate to any type of common aeroallergens.
