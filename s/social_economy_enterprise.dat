This article was written in the year 2016 in the Universidad Internacional de la Rioja. Methodology: This paper focuses on the process necessary to develop a pedagogical model for this game and on explaining the foundations to be observed, i. e., the instructional model, the way the approach is related to the European Qualifications Framework and the specific competencies that a social entrepreneur must develop. Results: As a result of this study, we obtained a didactical basis on which to support the process of game-based learning.

It explores the policy background that encourages the growth of rural tourism in Malaysia. An illustration {{in the form of a}} homestay in Kedah, involved the investigation into regional planning and the establishment of social economy enterprises. Community-based tourism (CBT) is often considered as one component of a broad-based plan to improve rural and urban economies, which intertwines and sometimes overlaps with rural and urban tourism concepts. CBT development is characterised as a form of locally situated development that uses tourism to generate economic, social, and cultural benefits within a community. This process occurs through increased community participation in decision making and the sustainable development of both natural and cultural resources. These objectives of CBT are sometimes parallel to the objectives of rural and urban tourism development in Malaysia. The objective of this paper is to examine work in the field of rural tourism development in the form of a Homestay Programme as a <b>Social</b> <b>Economy</b> <b>Enterprise.</b> It aims to prove that social-economy enterprises can fulfil multiple areas of needs within rural communities as well a...|$|E
