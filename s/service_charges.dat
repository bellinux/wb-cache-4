40|$|As {{certain types}} of {{property}} has become more complex and both customer and occupier expectations have changed; the services provided by the owners have increased in scope. A modern <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> may therefore include provision for the recovery of a multiplicity of services. In Malaysian scenario, the calculation of <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> for PBOs is therefore deceived since <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> {{is embedded in the}} rental charge to tenants. In addition, the existing practice of rental rate for PBO is not transparency enough to educate the tenants in knowing what they could get from the portion of <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> that they are paying. This paper represents an outline on issues in regards to <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> generally and to the commercial property specifically.

40|$|Mass {{customization}} (MC) {{service is}} a pertinent industrial practice in the fashion industry. To foster trust and enhance demand, some brands now allow dissatisfied customers to return the MC fashion product for a full refund minus a <b>service</b> <b>charge.</b> The <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> is a measure to avoid the abuse of the return right and to subsidize the operations cost (e. g., shipping) and loss from the return. Motivated by this observed industrial practice, this paper analytically examines the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> policy. We separate the study into two cases?those of risk-neutral and those of risk-averse MC companies, respectively. For each case, we derive the closed-form expression of the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge,</b> and we conduct analytical sensitivity analysis to illustrate how different important parameters in the model affect the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge.</b> In addition, by comparing the two cases, we reveal how the MC service provider's level of risk aversion affects the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> policy. Finally, we derive {{the conditions under which}} it is optimal to offer a zero return <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> (i. e., free return with a full refund). These conditions provide insight on the real-world practice in which some fashion companies offer free return service to their registered members but not to every customer.

For people in certain situations, (for example, after charging off on other credit cards, or people with a long history of delinquency on various forms of debt), secured cards are almost always more expensive than unsecured credit cards.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{wastewater}} {{construction projects}} {{are needed for}} meeting the environment regulatory and compliance, preserving the sewer system and treatment infrastructure and reducing the sewer spills. However, most business owners {{do not understand the}} fundamental of the sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> program and the current sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> adjustment guideline only provides very basic information for the program. These business owners end up with significant amount of money and time wasted since they often fall short of qualification for sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> adjustment. More importantly, no sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> evaluation or cost benefit analysis is conducted for new construction projects. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate wastewater charge saving strategies through two case studies that include hospital buildings and large residential complex buildings having more than 100 units. Detailed cost comparative analysis is presented to show if the saving strategies are achievable for each case. Lastly, this paper recommends the best property management approach for the review of sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> so that the significant amount of long term sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> saving can be achieved for larger commercial project...|$|R

It was also said that recycling centers related to plastic materials are relatively higher than other recyclable objects like metals, paper, glass among others. Accordingly, the city government allocates an amount of about 785.70 Philippine pesos (approx. US$18 as of April 2011) for every transportation and collection costs of a ton of waste material. In 2003, the city generated about 307.70 tons of waste every day. In 2001, it was reported by ADB that the city has as high as 25% solid waste management cost recovery rate through <b>service</b> <b>charges</b> on households and other enterprises for operational activities associated with waste collection, treatment and disposal. That same year, the city's proposal to implement a community-based solid waste management project in barangay Mapulang Lupa, was approved by the national government, which involves social mobilization, training of personnel, implementation of segregated collection and establishment of materials recovery facility and windows composting operation among others. The city government was granted a maximum of US$25,000 from Asian Development Bank for the operation of the project.|$|E

500|$|After leaving Socialist Fellowship, Bessie moved {{steadily}} {{towards the}} centre and right of her party, distancing herself from colleagues {{with whom she}} had earlier found common cause. She did not support Aneurin Bevan when he resigned from the government in April 1951 over the introduction of National Health <b>Service</b> <b>charges,</b> and later asserted that, by making dissidence fashionable, Bevan had [...] "weakened the [...] National Executive {{to the point where it}} could no longer deal effectively with infiltrating Trotskyists and Communists". In 1955 her opposition to the Bevanite faction was such that she supported efforts by Hugh Gaitskell and Herbert Morrison to have Bevan expelled from the party. She regularly attacked the Labour left at party conferences, and in 1952 was involved in scuffles with other delegates after the unexpected success of Bevanite candidates in the NEC elections.|$|E
500|$|Lady Hale {{was also}} {{concerned}} about the ramifications of the decision. [...] She asked if a doctor treating a patient after an accident and giving evidence about what happened as well as his opinions as to what would happen would be covered or not, or whether only in part. She noted that the ruling in the case would have to apply to experts dealing with cases before tribunals as well as courts, thus including claims for unfair dismissal before employment tribunals and disputes between landlord and tenants about <b>service</b> <b>charges</b> and rent assessments. [...] She queried whether it ought to extend to psychiatrists assessing patients for tribunal proceedings under the Mental Health Act 1983, or educational psychologists giving evidence about children with special educational needs in tribunal proceedings about their future education. In her view, these are [...] "sensitive and often highly fraught cases in which performing the expert's duty to the tribunal may well be perceived by the client patient or parent as a breach of her duty towards him." [...] In family law cases, she said, there would now be some professional witnesses who had immunity from negligence claims for their evidence and others who did not, with some of the distinctions between the two groups appearing to be [...] "arbitrary". She thought that the decision might make experts more likely to confirm their previous views rather than change them, and could lead to higher insurance premiums for experts, increased fees and the use of exemption clauses in contracts – [...] "in which case we shall be back where we started", she said. Overall, she called the decision to change the law [...] "irresponsible" [...] and, like Lord Hope, considered that the topic was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission.|$|E
