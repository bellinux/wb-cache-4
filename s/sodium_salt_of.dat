25|$|At the hospital, the 99mTc {{that forms}} through 99Mo decay is {{chemically}} {{extracted from the}} technetium-99m generator. Most commercial 99Mo/99mTc generators use column chromatography, in which 99Mo {{in the form of}} water-soluble molybdate, MoO42− is adsorbed onto acid alumina (Al2O3). When the 99Mo decays, it forms pertechnetate TcO4−, which, because of its single charge, is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pulling normal saline solution through the column of immobilized 99MoO42− elutes the soluble 99mTcO4−, resulting in a saline solution containing the 99mTc as the dissolved <b>sodium</b> <b>salt</b> <b>of</b> the pertechnetate. One technetium-99m generator, holding only a few micrograms of 99Mo, can potentially diagnose 10,000 patients because it will be producing 99mTc strongly for over a week.|$|E

The anion in this species has the formula −. It has C3v symmetry. It consists of a tetrahedron of iron atoms with sulfide ions on three faces of the tetrahedron. Three iron atoms are bonded to two nitrosyl groups. The iron atom on the threefold symmetry axis has a single nitrosyl group which also lies on that axis.|$|E

50|$|As {{described}} by the Food Chemicals Codex 7th edition, SSL is a cream-colored powder or brittle solid. SSL is currently manufactured by the esterification of stearic acid with lactic acid and partially neutralized with either food-grade soda ash (sodium carbonate) or caustic soda (concentrated sodium hydroxide). Commercial grade SSL is a mixture <b>of</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> stearoyl lactylic acids and minor proportions <b>of</b> other <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> related acids. The HLB for SSL is 10-12. SSL is slightly hygroscopic, soluble in ethanol and in hot oil or fat, and dispersible in warm water. These properties are the reason that SSL is an excellent emulsifier for fat-in-water emulsions and can also function as a humectant.|$|R
500|$|In 1853, Charles Frédéric Gerhardt had {{published}} the first methods to prepare acetylsalicylic acid. [...] In {{the course of}} his work on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides, he mixed acetyl chloride with a <b>sodium</b> <b>salt</b> <b>of</b> salicylic acid (sodium salicylate). A vigorous reaction ensued, and the resulting melt soon solidified. Since no structural theory existed at that time Gerhardt called the compound he obtained [...] "salicylic-acetic anhydride" [...] (wasserfreie Salicylsäure-Essigsäure). When Gerhardt tried to dissolve the solid in a diluted solution of sodium carbonate it immediately decomposed to sodium salts of salicylic and acetic acids. In 1859 an Austrian chemist, Hugo von Gilm, obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid (which he called acetylierte Salicylsäure, acetylated salicylic acid) by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride. In 1869 Schröder, Prinzhorn and Kraut repeated both Gerhardt's (from sodium salicylate) and von Gilm's (from salicylic acid) syntheses and concluded that both reactions gave the same compound—acetylsalicylic acid. (Prinzhorn is credited in the paper with conducting the experiments.) They were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen.|$|E
