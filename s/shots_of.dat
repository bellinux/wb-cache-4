Throughout the clip, there is also <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> a semi-naked man with running black eyeliner crawling on the floor, an Australian born actor and model named Greg Brown who appeared in other Samuel Bayer projects such as videos for David Bowie and Nirvana.|$|E
5|$|Inside: This final segment {{opens with}} <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> Donovan showering, toweling off and {{wandering}} idly around his room, intercut with <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> African-American telephone repairman Tommy Moore checking various poles and lines outside, Donovan spots Moore from his balcony. Moore sees Donovan as well. The {{remainder of the}} segment consists of Donovan's fantasized sexual encounters with Moore throughout the house intercut with <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> Donovan sniffing poppers and penetrating himself with a large black dildo. The segment ends following Donovan's climax with the dildo, with the real Moore coming inside the house and {{closing the door behind}} them.|$|E

50|$|A pickleback {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>shot</b> wherein a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> whiskey is {{chased by}} a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> pickle brine; the term “pickleback” may also refer only to the <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> pickle brine itself. Alternatively, the <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> whiskey can be chased by a bite of a pickle (generally, a whole dill pickle). The pickle brine works to {{neutralize}} both {{the taste of the}} whiskey and the burn of the ethyl alcohol.|$|R

5|$|A common {{complaint}} was the noticeable digital airbrushing on numerous close-up <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> Jovovich's face, for which reviewers were confused at the use of, or found unnecessary. The film won the Golden Trailer Award for Best Action Poster and {{was nominated for}} Best TV Spot.|$|E
5|$|Aguilera {{then takes}} a touch screen Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phone {{from her pocket}} with {{an image of a}} futuristic blue haired character, after {{producing}} a scene of a convertible car, she inputs the character from the phone onto the screen and into the car and the blue haired character is then shown driving. Aguilera then produces silhouettes of a catwoman style figure, until Aguilera as the catwoman character is shown, wearing a leather catsuit with cat ears, lighting bolts shoot from her hands until another scene featuring the same character shows her alongside a black motorbike holding a gun. <b>Shots</b> <b>of</b> both the blue haired character and catwoman lead to a scene featuring a blond Aguilera moving inside of the screens accompanied by multi-colored digital waves, before <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> the catwoman style character on a motorbike, shooting the gun are presented. <b>Shots</b> <b>of</b> the different scenes including one of Aguilera at the desk accompanied by a toy robot are shown finishing as Aguilera turns the screens off.|$|E

5|$|Before {{we see a}} {{full shot}} of Tracy, we see {{individual}} <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> her upraised right and left arms. This is reminiscent of our first views of Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford) in the 1932 film Rain.|$|E
5|$|First Contact was {{the last}} film to feature a {{physical}} model of the Enterprise. For the ship's dramatic introduction, the effects team combined motion control <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> the Enterprise model with a computer-generated background. Sequence supervisor Dennis Turner, who had created Generations energy ribbon and specialized in creating natural phenomena, was charged with creating the star cluster, modeled after the Eagle Nebula. The nebular columns and solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry, with surface shaders applied to make {{the edges of the}} nebula glow. A particle render that ILM had devised for the earlier tornado film Twister was used to create a turbulent look within the nebula. Once the <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> the Enterprise had been captured, Turner inserted the ship into the computer-generated background and altered its position until the images matched up.|$|E
5|$|Hahn {{recalled}} {{some difficulty}} in finding someone {{to host the}} film, so the studio decided to use a group of artists and musicians from various fields of entertainment. The interstitials were filmed in various locations; the orchestra, Jones, Lansbury, and Bronfman were shot in Los Angeles, Perlman and Middler in New York City, and others in Boston, Massachusetts. Each scene was filmed {{in front of a}} green screen to allow <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> the orchestra or the set to be placed behind them. The <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> Levine, the artists, and the orchestra were filmed on October 31, 1998. The piano Grierson plays in his scene with Jones is the same one on which he played Rhapsody in Blue for the soundtrack.|$|E

50|$|The US and English Canadian VHS {{releases}} are cut. Edited {{from the}} film was an additional <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Lep on top of Diane as he attempts to rape her, a more graphic <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Diane slashing Runt's throat, and a longer <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Stanley burning to death. However, both the French Canadian and Spanish VHS versions were released uncut.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, {{the site}} {{was used as a}} {{shooting}} location for the sci-fi horror film Alien 3. Various locations in the North East of England were used in shooting the film, and the power station provided the location for some <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> the planet surface.|$|E
5|$|Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{built an}} eight-foot foam {{model of the}} Zeppelin to {{complement}} <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> Ford and Connery climbing into the biplane. A biplane model with a two-foot wingspan {{was used for the}} shot of the biplane detaching. Stop motion animation was used for the shot of the German fighter's wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The tunnel was a 210 feet model that occupied 14 of ILM's parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against bluescreen; the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen, but to make the integration easier this was removed and later composited into the shot. Dust and shadows were animated onto <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> the plane miniature to make it appear as if it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded. Several hundred tim-birds were used in the background <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> the seagulls striking the other plane; for the closer shots, ILM dropped feather-coated crosses onto the camera. These only looked convincing because the scene's quick cuts merely required shapes that suggested gulls. ILM's Wes Takahashi supervised the film's effects sequences.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's {{style is}} notable {{for the use}} of long shots, such as in the closing {{sequences}} of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> this kind, including distant overhead <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity has been seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] is {{made from}} a light Weißbier (white beer) mixed with a [...] (<b>shot)</b> <b>of</b> sweet syrup instead of soda. It comes in three {{standard}} varieties: the [...] ("green") with Waldmeistersirup, a woodruff-flavoured syrup; the [...] (yellow) with a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> [...] (lemon syrup); and the [...] (red), with a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> [...] (raspberry syrup).|$|R

5|$|Many {{interior}} <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> the 1999 film The Insider were filmed at Manual. Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, {{the subject}} of the film, taught science and Japanese at Manual after he was fired by tobacco company Brown & Williamson in 1993.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> McCrane intercut with <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
5|$|The Rio film unit {{captured}} aerial <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> {{the city}} including Sugarloaf Mountain, Fort Copacabana, Ipanema Beach, the Dona Marta lookout {{point and the}} Christ the Redeemer statue. Establishing <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> the heist team members were taken as each arrived in Rio. Gibson was filmed arriving in character at Galeão International Airport but, when it became publicly known that a scene was being shot at the airport, {{the cast and crew}} were mobbed. A similar situation occurred while Ludacris was shooting a scene in which his character buys a car to drive around the city. A scene where the completed heist team walk down a beach was filmed in Copacabana.|$|E

50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Michael Parks. It begins with the camera panning across the landscape, the song starts to play as the camera pans down {{to the right and}} we see a steer sitting on the ground. The camera pans up to the sky and we see a 3 dimensional steer flying in space, it shows a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the blue Camaro is driving while the duo are playing a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> a girl driving and another <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> a girl and Kix Brooks singing. A close-up <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the Camaro and him {{standing in front of a}} camera, and Ronnie Dunn on a space shuttle, scenes also feature girls dancing. The video ends with a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the steer from the beginning of the video sitting on the ground.|$|R
5|$|The {{ceremony}} {{began at}} 9pm after a one-minute '60 to 1' countdown film {{made up of}} <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> numbers, such as those on house doors, street nameplates, London buses and market labels.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} split {{screening}} came to Nalluri after visiting a pub {{one night after}} filming wrapped up. In the audio commentary for the episode, Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24, which also uses split screen, as he was not yet aware of the show. The news report covering Mary and Paul Kane's past activities were snippets of real-life news from the United States, which were edited together. The music was composed by Jennie Muskett, who spent just {{two to three hours}} putting several pieces of background music together. One part of the episode centred on Zoe posing as target Diane Sullivan. Some publicity <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> Keeley Hawes in the series were <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> her with long brunette hair, though in fact she has short blonde hair.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes a work {{of fiction}} may {{deliberately}} employ continuity errors, usually for comedy. For example, the Marx Brothers' classic film Duck Soup, at the climax of the film, the camera shows a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Groucho Marx speaking a line, followed by a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> something else happening, followed by another <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Groucho. Each time, Groucho's hat changes, usually to something more outrageous than before (a Napoleonic hat, a Prussian hat, etc.).|$|R
25|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>of</b> the Month on four occasions, won WTA <b>Shot</b> <b>Of</b> The Year for {{the third}} year in a row (WTA Finals Championship match against Petra Kvitova), and, for the fifth {{consecutive}} season, won the WTA Award for Fan Favorite Player.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} North American theatrical and VHS {{release of}} the film features a close-up of Sherman as the gate explodes, followed by a <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the sun rising over clouds. The International theatrical release features a much wider <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the gate's explosion, followed by a wormhole/time portal effect. The scene then dissolves into an underwater <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the two main characters swimming from above, followed by {{a view of the}} characters in a nude, Eden-esque embrace.|$|R
