25|$|Watt's Expansion Engine is {{generally}} considered as of historic interest only. There are however some recent developments which {{may lead to a}} renaissance of the technology. Today, there is an enormous amount of waste steam and waste heat with temperatures between 100 and 150°C generated by industry. In addition, solarthermal collectors, geothermal energy sources and biomass reactors produce heat in this temperature range. There are technologies to utilise this energy, in particular the Organic Rankine Cycle. In principle, these are steam turbines which do not use water but a fluid (a refrigerant) which evaporates at temperatures below 100°C. Such systems are however fairly complex. They work with pressures of 6 to 20 bars, so that the whole <b>system</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be completely sealed.|$|E
25|$|The {{city had}} one of the first municipally owned {{streetcar}} systems. The Department of Street Railways had taken over in 1922 since when it had been run by a three-man Detroit Street Railways Commission appointed by the mayor of Detroit. On June 14, 1930, the DSR launched a trolleybus route along Plymouth Road but the route had seen little use by 1936 due to the Great Depression and was discontinued on August 11, 1937. By 1934 the general manager, Fred A. Nolan, said that he wanted to convert the Detroit streetcar system to all buses operation by 1953 and the last streetcar actually ran in 1956. It remained in public ownership until 1974. Some sources claim that the Detroit streetcar system was purchased and dismantled by National City Lines as part of the 'Great American streetcar scandal', however, {{this was not the case}} as the company could not buy into the public system and lack of use of the streetcar <b>system</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be explained by other reasons.|$|E

[...] In March 2008, the Nine Network, along with production company Southern Star, purchased the Hi-5 brand.

[...] He predicts that [...] "f the system succeeds in acquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough, it will probably survive. Otherwise it will break down," [...] and that [...] "the issue will most likely be resolved within the next several decades, say 40 to 100 years." [...] Kaczynski therefore states that the task of those who oppose industrial society is to promote [...] "social stress and instability," [...] and to propagate [...] "an ideology that opposes technology," [...] one that offers the [...] "counter-ideal" [...] of nature [...] "in order to gain enthusiastic support." [...] Thus, when industrial society is sufficiently unstable, [...] "a revolution against technology may be possible." ...|$|E

2500|$|Systemic {{functional}} linguistics is also [...] "functional" [...] {{because it}} considers language to have evolved {{under the pressure}} of the particular functions that the language <b>system</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> serve. Functions are therefore taken to have left their mark on the structure and organisation of language at all levels, which is said to be achieved via metafunctions. The term metafunction is particular to systemic functional linguistics. The organisation of the functional framework around systems, i.e., choices, is a significant difference from other [...] "functional" [...] approaches, such as, for example, Dik's functional grammar (FG, or as now often termed, functional discourse grammar) and lexical functional grammar. Thus, it is important to use the full designation—systemic functional linguistics—rather than just functional grammar or functional linguistics.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, merely having {{a large number}} of {{interactions}} is not enough by itself to guarantee emergent behaviour; many of the interactions may be negligible or irrelevant, or may cancel each other out. [...] In some cases, {{a large number of}} interactions can in fact work against the emergence of interesting behaviour, by creating a lot of [...] "noise" [...] to drown out any emerging [...] "signal"; the emergent behaviour may need to be temporarily isolated from other interactions before it reaches enough critical mass to be self-supporting. Thus {{it is not just the}} sheer number of connections between components which encourages emergence; it is also how these connections are organised. [...] A hierarchical organisation is one example that can generate emergent behaviour (a bureaucracy may behave in a way quite different from that of the individual humans in that bureaucracy); but perhaps more interestingly, emergent behaviour can also arise from more decentralized organisational structures, such as a marketplace. [...] In some cases, the <b>system</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> reach a combined threshold of diversity, organisation, and connectivity before emergent behaviour appears.|$|E
