50|$|A {{spherical roller}} thrust bearing is a rolling-element bearing of thrust type that permits {{rotation}} with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. The bearing is designed to take radial loads, and heavy axial loads in one direction. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of the <b>shaft</b> <b>washer</b> that may be misaligned in respect to the housing washer. The misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape of the house washer.|$|E
