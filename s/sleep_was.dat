5|$|This was {{followed}} in 1936 by How to be a Detective. The early success of How to Sleep prompted MGM to rush two more short films featuring Benchley, How to Train a Dog, a spoof of dog-training techniques, and How to Behave, which lampooned etiquette norms. How to <b>Sleep</b> <b>was</b> named Best Short Subject at the 1935 Academy Awards, {{while the latter}} two shorts were not as well received.|$|E
5|$|Other Undertale {{media and}} {{merchandise}} have been released, including toy figurines and plush toys based on characters from the game. The game's official soundtrack {{was released in}} 2015 simultaneously with the game's release. Additionally, two official Undertale cover albums have been released: the 2015 metal album Determination by RichaadEB and Ace Waters, and the 2016 jazz album Live at Grillby by Carlos Eiene. Another album of jazz duets based on Undertales songs, Prescription for <b>Sleep,</b> <b>was</b> performed and released in 2016 by saxophonist Norihiko Hibino and pianist Ayaki Sato. iam8bit is producing a vinyl edition of the Undertale soundtrack across two discs, expected to be available in Q4 2016.|$|E
5|$|The University of Chicago {{has been}} the site of some {{important}} experiments and academic movements. In economics, the university has {{played an important role}} in shaping ideas about the free market and is the namesake of the Chicago school of economics, the school of economic thought supported by Milton Friedman and other economists. The university's sociology department was the first independent sociology department in the United States and gave birth to the Chicago school of sociology. In physics, the university was the site of the Chicago Pile-1 (the first controlled, self-sustaining man-made nuclear chain reaction, part of the Manhattan Project), of Robert Millikan's oil-drop experiment that calculated the charge of the electron, and of the development of radiocarbon dating by Willard F. Libby in 1947. The chemical experiment that tested how life originated on early Earth, the Miller–Urey experiment, was conducted at the university. REM <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> discovered at the university in 1953 by Nathaniel Kleitman and Eugene Aserinsky.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{distinction}} between sleep states: REM (dreaming) <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> associated with theta; slow-wave <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> associated with LIA.|$|R
6000|$|... [4] First <b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> night-sleep; Second <b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> swoon-sleep; [...] Third <b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> death, or Nōōmanossi. So, too, the [...] Mulgars say, {{the first}} is [...] "Little-go," [...] the second is [...] "Great-go," [...] {{and the third is}} [...] "Come-no-more"; as if their [...] bodies were a lodging, and sleep a kind of out-of-doors.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sleep</b> arousal <b>are</b> active brain {{processes}} medicated {{and associated}} with specific brain regions. Despite {{the fact that}} various stages of <b>sleep</b> <b>are</b> discrete and quantifiable, the exact function of <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> unknown. <b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> controlled both by circadian rhythms and the homeostatic drive produced by wakefulness. Circadian rhythms are produced in the suprachiasmatic nucleus by pacemaker cells which contain transcriptional regulation [...] "clock genes" [...] which have been highly conserved throughout evolution.|$|R
25|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>was</b> {{picked on}} the 1979 tour to India. He {{was one of}} three spinners in the squad, the others being Jim Higgs and Bruce Yardley. This meant he had to break a {{contract}} with the Lancashire League, and <b>Sleep</b> <b>was</b> fined.|$|E
25|$|However <b>Sleep</b> <b>was</b> an {{important}} part of South Australia's Sheffield Shield winning team in 1981–82.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>was</b> also {{a regular}} league {{professional}} in England and {{towards the end}} of his career was captain of Lancashire 2nd XI.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> {{consciousness}} naturally folded back {{to itself}} in the self-come-home-to-self, to find life nourished, renovated, and vitalized, all beyond objective management. <b>Sleep</b> can never <b>be</b> un-derstood with direct conscious approach, but must be approached indirectly, implicatively, and alive coherently, as tried here. <b>Sleep</b> (A) <b>is</b> Spontaneity, (B) Self-Fullness, and so (C) <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> life’s Gospel of Self-ing...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> {{mentioned}} {{numerous times}} in the film Billy Elliot, {{and also in the}} British stage musical version of this film. (On Broadway references to <b>Sleep</b> <b>were</b> changed to Rudolf Nureyev.) ...|$|R
50|$|When sleep-deprived humans sleep {{normally}} again, {{the recovery}} percentage for {{each stage of}} <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> not the same. Only seven percent of stages one and two are regained, but 68 percent of stage-four slow-wave sleep and 53 percent of REM <b>sleep</b> <b>are</b> regained. This suggests that stage-four sleep (known today as the deepest part of stage-three <b>sleep)</b> <b>is</b> {{more important than the}} other stages.|$|R
25|$|The Co-Optimists {{played at}} the theatre after the war as did Noël Coward's The Vortex. In 1932, While Parents <b>Sleep</b> <b>was</b> a hit. The theatre closed in 1938 and was {{demolished}} in 1953.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} years, <b>Sleep</b> <b>was</b> captain-coach of Yahl Cricket Club in the Mount Gambier District Cricket Association, and has {{recently}} transferred to Tea Tree Gully Cricket Club in the South Australian Grade Cricket League.|$|E
25|$|In the R standard, NREM <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> {{divided into}} four stages, with slow-wave sleep {{comprising}} stages 3 and 4. In stage 3, delta waves made up less than 50% of the total wave patterns, while they made up more than 50% in stage 4. Furthermore, REM <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} stage 5. In 2004, the AASM commissioned the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force to review the R scoring system. The review resulted in several changes, the most significant being the combination of stages 3 and 4 into Stage N3. The revised scoring was published in 2007 as The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. Arousals, respiratory, cardiac, and movement events were also added.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{studies of}} KLS show varying results {{based on the}} amount of time the patient is observed. Slow wave <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> often reduced at the {{beginning}} of episodes, and REM <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> reduced near the end. Conversely, REM <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> often normal at the beginning, and slow wave <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> often normal by the conclusion. Stage two non-rapid eye movement <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> often interrupted during KLS. Studies also show that stage one and three non-rapid eye movement sleep become more efficient when the episodes end. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test has yielded inconsistent results when given to KLS patients. In many cases, hours are spent in a withdrawn sleep-like state while awake during episodes. Most <b>sleep</b> studies have <b>been</b> performed while subject are near the end of their episodes. Some patients experience brief insomnia and become very happy and talkative after the episode ends.|$|R
5000|$|The judge, Lord Lane said, [...] "We accept {{of course}} that <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> a normal condition, but the {{evidence}} in the instant case indicates that sleep walking, and particularly violence in <b>sleep,</b> <b>is</b> not normal." ...|$|R
50|$|The Big <b>Sleep</b> <b>are</b> a three piece band {{based in}} Brooklyn, New York. The band {{consists}} of Sonya Balchandani (bass/vocals), Danny Barria (guitar/vocals), and Gabe Rhodes (drums). The Big <b>Sleep</b> <b>are</b> signed to French Kiss Records.|$|R
25|$|On {{his return}} to Australia, <b>Sleep</b> <b>was</b> unable to force himself back into the test side, the {{selectors}} preferring Ray Bright, Jim Higgs and Bruce Yardley as spinner. He was overlooked for the 1981 tour of England, for instance, despite a summer where he scored 663 runs at 41 and took 22 wickets at 34.|$|E
25|$|Chandler's {{treatment}} of the detective novel exhibits an effort to develop the form. His first full-length book, The Big <b>Sleep,</b> <b>was</b> published when Chandler was 51; his last, Playback when he was 70. Seven novels were produced {{in the last two}} decades of his life. An eighth, Poodle Springs, was completed posthumously by Robert B. Parker and published years later.|$|E
25|$|This two {{process model}} was first {{proposed}} in 1982 by Borbely, who called them Process S (homeostatic) and Process C (Circadian) respectively. He showed how the slow wave density increases {{through the night}} and then drops off {{at the beginning of the}} day while the circadian rhythm is like a sinusoid. He proposed that the pressure to <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> the maximum when the difference between the two was highest.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> quickly reversible, {{as opposed}} to {{hibernation}} or coma, and <b>sleep</b> deprivation <b>is</b> followed by longer or deeper rebound sleep.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> {{regulated}} by homeostatic, circadian and ultradian processes. Slow waves and <b>sleep</b> spindles <b>are</b> EEG markers of sleep processes which have counterparts at the cellular level. The interaction of homeostatic and circadian <b>sleep</b> regulation has <b>been</b> formalized in the two-process model and validated in experiments. <b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> {{not only a}} global brain phenomenon but also a regional cerebral process whose intensity {{may be influenced by}} prior activity during waking...|$|R
50|$|They also {{experience}} {{stages of}} <b>sleep</b> that <b>are</b> similar to humans such as {{rapid eye movement}} <b>sleep.</b> It <b>is</b> believed that {{the reason why they}} experience stages of deep <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> because they are subject to less danger than other mammals.|$|R
25|$|Sleep {{deprivation}}, {{whether it}} is total sleep deprivation or partial sleep deprivation, can impair working memory in measures of memory, speed of cognitive processing, attention and task switching. Casement et al. found that when {{subjects were asked to}} recognize digits displayed on a screen by typing them on a keypad, the working memory speed of subjects whose <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> restricted to four hours a night (approximately 50% of their normal sleep amount) were 58% slower than control groups who were allowed their full eight hours of sleep.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{important}} questions in sleep research is clearly defining the sleep state. This problem arises because <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> traditionally defined as a state of consciousness {{and not as a}} physiological state, thus there was no clear definition of what minimum set of events constitute sleep and distinguish it from other states of partial or no consciousness. The problem of making such a definition is complicated because it needs to include a variety of modes of sleep found across different species.|$|E
25|$|Those {{experiencing}} OBEs sometimes report (among {{other types}} of immediate and spontaneous experience) a preceding and initiating lucid-dream state. In many cases, people who claim to have had an OBE report being {{on the verge of}} sleep, or being already asleep shortly before the experience. A large percentage of these cases refer to situations where the <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> not particularly deep (due to illness, noises in other rooms, emotional stress, exhaustion from overworking, frequent re-awakening, etc.). In most of these cases subjects perceive themselves as being awake; about half of them note a feeling of sleep paralysis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> a vital {{physiological}} function and high quality <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> essential {{for maintaining the}} good health. <b>Sleep</b> disorders however <b>are</b> amongst the most common disorders suffered by humans and it is rare for most people to regularly enjoy the amount of quality sleep they need. The behavioural and social causes of <b>sleep</b> disorders <b>are</b> typically the result of modern lifestyle, which are usually linked to Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS). Healthcare professionals and <b>sleep</b> researchers <b>are</b> currently {{looking for ways to}} improve the clinical diagnosis of OSAH sufferers...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to general health and pain, <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> highly relevant to judging {{the well-being of}} an individual. Of these three important outcome variables, however, <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> neglected in most outcome studies. <b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> a very important resource for recovery from daily stresses and strains, and any alteration of sleep will likely affect mental and physical health, especially during disease. Sleep assessment therefore should be standard in all population-based or clinical studies focusing on the locomotor system. Yet current <b>sleep</b> assessment tools <b>are</b> either too long or too specific for general use...|$|R
25|$|The first semi-multiple-systematic {{study of}} the {{connection}} between sleep and memory was conducted in 1924 by Jenkins and Dallenbach, for the purpose of testing Hermann Ebbinghaus' memory decay theory. Their results showed that memory retention was much better after a period of sleep compared to the same time interval spent awake. It was not until 1953, however, when <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> delineated into rapid eye movement sleep and non-rapid eye movement sleep, that studies focusing on the effect of specific sleep stages on memory were conducted. As behavioral characteristics of the effects of sleep and memory are becoming increasingly understood and supported, researchers are turning to the weakly understood neural basis of sleep and memory.|$|E
25|$|The {{sentinel}} {{hypothesis of}} REM <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> {{put forward by}} Frederick Snyder in 1966. It {{is based upon the}} observation that REM sleep in several mammals (the rat, the hedgehog, the rabbit, and the rhesus monkey) is followed by a brief awakening. This does not occur for either cats or humans, although humans are more likely to wake from REM sleep than from NREM sleep. Snyder hypothesized that REM sleep activates an animal periodically, to scan the environment for possible predators. This hypothesis does not explain the muscle paralysis of REM sleep; however, a logical analysis might suggest that the muscle paralysis exists to prevent the animal from fully waking up unnecessarily, and allowing it to return easily to deeper sleep.|$|E
25|$|Dr. David M. Maurice (1922-2002), an eye {{specialist}} and semi-retired adjunct professor at Columbia University, proposed that REM <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> associated with oxygen {{supply to the}} cornea, and that aqueous humor, the liquid between cornea and iris, was stagnant if not stirred. Among the supportive evidences, he calculated that if aqueous humor was stagnant, oxygen from iris had to reach cornea by diffusion through aqueous humor, which was not sufficient. According to the theory, when the animal is awake, eye movement (or cool environmental temperature) enables the aqueous humor to circulate. When the animal is sleeping, REM provides the much-needed stir to aqueous humor. This theory {{is consistent with the}} observation that fetuses, as well as eye-sealed newborn animals, spend much time in REM sleep, and that during a normal sleep, a person's REM sleep episodes become progressively longer deeper into the night. However, owls have REM sleep, but do not move their head more than in non-REM sleep and is well known that owls' eyes are nearly immobile.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{demonstrates}} how <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> {{inextricably linked to}} ‘society’. Part 1 illustrates how sleep and its disorders are historically and culturally divergent and that ‘where’, ‘why’ and ‘how’ we sleep differ depending on the society in which we live. Part 2 focuses in more detail on the ‘private’ nature of Western <b>sleep.</b> <b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> affected by the social context where it occurs, and is thus influenced by household composition, power, gender, social roles and life course position. Finally, we examine sleep in care-giving and institutional contexts, where <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> not only ‘observed’, but may be disturbed by those undertaking care or surveillance at night. <b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> also socially patterned with the socially disadvantaged most likely to report sleep problems...|$|R
