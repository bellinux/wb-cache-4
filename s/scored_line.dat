5000|$|Multiple sets of {{plug and}} {{feathers}} are typically used to split a single, {{large piece of}} stone. The stone is first examined to determine {{the direction of the}} grain. After the location of the intended split is chosen, a line is scored {{on the surface of the}} stone. A number of holes are then cut or drilled into the stone face along the <b>scored</b> <b>line</b> approximately 10 - 20 cm apart. Plug and feather sets are then inserted in the holes with the [...] "ears" [...] of the feathers facing the direction of the desired split. The plugs are then struck with a small stone maul in sequence. An audible tone from the wedges changes to a 'ringing sound' when the wedges are tight. Between each series of strikes, a pause of several minutes allows the stone to react to the pressure. Eventually a crack appears along the line that was scored on the surface and the stone splits apart.|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} and process for sealing fused quartz ampoules housing a semiconductor growth charge under vacuum is described. An elongated fused quartz ampoule having an enlarged diameter open end and a reduced diameter closed end is vertically retained {{in a vacuum}} assembly. A semiconductor charge is disposed within the reduced diameter portion of the ampoule. A quartz plug of substantially the same diameter as the reduced diameter portion is suspended within the open and of the ampoule via a rotary vacuum feed. After evacuation of the ampoule a plug is lowered into the reduced diameter area and sealed therein while maintaining the vacuum on the ampoule. The charged ampoule area is then separated from the remaining structure by breaking along the <b>scored</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Glass is an {{important}} engineering material used {{in the manufacture of}} different components of engineering systems. Sodalime glass is {{the most common form of}} glass whose application includes manufacture of glass plates which are used in modern devices including TFT-LCDs, touch panels, thin-film solar cells, and color filters. For any application, the cutting of glass is the initial step in fabrication. The conventional method of glass cutting involves using a diamond point tool or wheel to mechanically score a line along the desired path. This is followed by application of bending force to break the glass along the <b>scored</b> <b>line.</b> This method has disadvantages that include: microcracks that serve as stress risers of tension and cause the fracture of the glass if loaded, rough edges requiring further machining and material wastage among others. Laser cutting has numerous advantages over the conventional methods regarding quality and is attaining wide acceptance in ma-chining of glass. Laser machining can be achieved through melting and vaporization or thermal stress fracture. The performance and thermal effects of a process must be well understood in order for process control to succeed. This paper gives an overview of current status of research in modeling of laser machining of glass...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Sport Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Video {{analysis}} and more specifically, computer notational analyses (CNA), are {{considered by many}} scientists to be of great value for research purposes. It has also provided proof of the ability and contribution of CNA to evaluate the way match-play in a sport such as rugby has evolved through the years and to determine which performance indicators (PIs) are present in this sport code. CNA can also assist in determining the influence of such PIs on match performance. Based on this research application, rugby union turning professional in 1995 and the regular introduction of new laws in the game brought about the necessity for a more scientific approach in rugby union match analysis. This led the research team to the following objectives: To determine a) The effect of the experimental law variations (ELVs) introduced in rugby during 2008 on the PI-s; b) The frequency of the different PIs during matches played in the 2006 season; and c) The ability to evaluate performance (match outcome) and ranking of the teams. All the Super 14 rugby games (n= 370) in the 2006 and 2008 seasons were recorded on video and analysed. The following PIs were analysed: turn-overs, percentage good scrums, percentage good line-outs, percentage tackles made, drop goals, penalty goals, rucks lost, rucks won, tries <b>scored,</b> <b>line</b> breaks, passes made, turnovers, off-loads in the tackle, meters gained, penalties conceded, kicks from hand and percentage tries converted. Descriptive statistics were calculated of each PI {{for each of the}} rugby teams, followed by independent t-tests to determine significance of differences between the 2006 and 2008 data. Additionally, forward stepwise discriminant {{analysis and}} forward stepwise multiple regression analysis were performed to determine which of the PIs influenced the ranking and performance of the different teams. Due to {{the fact that this was}} an inferential study, significance of differences were reflected by practical significance as determined by means of effect sizes. With regard to the ELVs, the study determined that a large practical significant decrease occurred in the frequency of serums and line-outs from the 2006 to 2008 competition. In contrast to this, the number of tackles made, meters gained and penalties conceded all showed a large practically significant increase over the same compared competition seasons. Meters gained, kicks 'from hand, line breaks and percentage tackles made were identified as the PIs which discriminated most accurately between successful and less successful Super 14 rugby union teams. Furthermore, meters gained, kicks from hand and line breaks were identified as the PIs which emerged as the best predictors (practical significant) of team ranking among the Super 14 rugby union teams during the competition. In conclusion, the results from this study therefore outlined the importance of the different PIs as predictors of performance and the ranking of the Super 14 rugby union teams. The increase in action activities and decrease in static activities between the 2006 and 2008 season suggests that the IRB have succeeded in addressing their objective of increasing the appeal of the game with the introduction of the ELVs.

40|$|The {{literature}} was reviewed regarding advantages, problems and performance indicators of <b>score</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>Scored</b> tablets provide dose flexibility, ease of swallowing and {{may reduce the}} costs of medication. However, many patients are confronted with scored tablets that are broken unequally and with difficulty, reducing compliance and reliance on the drug. Possibilities to reduce breaking difficulties are breaking instructions, tablet-splitters and breaking in advance. Factors influencing the performance of <b>score</b> <b>lines</b> are shape, size, curvature and thickness of the tablet and the form and deepness of the <b>score</b> <b>line.</b> Performance of <b>score</b> <b>lines</b> can be defined by breaking ease, uniformity of mass of subdivided tablets and loss of mass by the subdivision. For breaking case, an in-vivo reference test and a routinely applicable in-vitro test need to be established. For the uniformity of mass of subdivided tablets a requirement has recently been set by the European Pharmacopoeia. Loss of mass upon breaking can be limited to not more than 1 %.
