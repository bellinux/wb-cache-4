40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to present a {{comprehensive}} three-dimensional biomechanical multibody foot model suitable to perform forward dynamic analysis. The proposed approach takes into accounts the different contact phenomena that develop between the foot and ground, namely the geometric, kinetic, dynamic and material properties of the foot-ground interface during the stance phase of the human gait. Furthermore, the system dynamics response during the swing phase is considered {{through the use of}} a linear torsional <b>spring</b> <b>damper</b> <b>element.</b> The biomechanical model used here consists of 3 rigid bodies, corresponding to the shank, main anatomical foot part and toes, which are connected by revolute joints. The anthropometric dimensions of the model correspond to those of a male of 1. 70 m and 70 kg. This biomechanical system encompasses 6 functional degrees of freedom: 3 for the knee/shank translational trajectories, 1 for the knee flexion, 1 for the ankle joint rotation and 1 for the metatarsal-phalangeal joint rotation. The interaction between the foot and ground bodies is provided by the introduction of a set of spheres under the plantar surface of the foot. In the sequel of this process, a general mathematical methodology for contact detection between the foot and ground surfaces is presented. Then, in a simple way, when the foot-ground contact occurs, appropriate constitutive laws for contact phenomena are applied. These laws take into account the vertical ground reaction force as well as the friction phenomena, namely the Coulomb and viscoelastic friction effects. The proposed contact approach is able to compute not only the ground reactions forces but also to evaluate the position of the center of pressure under the foot plantar surface. Finally, the results obtained from computational and experimental analysis are used to discuss the main assumptions and procedures adopted through this work.

At this rate, little excita-tions lead to vibrations, which may lead to loss of contact between the rollers (bouncing). This bouncing results in white stripes, being visible on the printed image.

Three cadaver knees were tested in a dynamic knee simulator. The cadaver knees also underwent manual envelope of motion testing to find their passive range of motion {{in order to determine}} the zero-load lengths for each ligament bundle. Computational multibody knee models were created for each knee and model kinematics were compared to experimental kinematics for a simulated walk cycle.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate the use of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) in the integration of finite element (FE) and multibody system (MBS) algorithms for modeling the rigid body contact and the ligament flexibility in bio-mechanics applications. To this end, a general formulation based on ANCF finite elements for modeling the contact in bio-mechanics applications is presented. Each contact surface is described in a parametric form using two surface parameters that enter into the ANCF finite element geometric description. A set of nonlinear algebraic equations that depend on the surface parameters are developed. These nonlinear algebraic equations are solved iteratively in order to determine the location of the contact points. This formulation is implemented in a general MBS algorithm that allows for modeling rigid and flexible bodies. ANCF finite elements can also be used to describe the large displacement of the ligaments, muscles, and soft tissues (LMST). The computational algorithm developed in this investigation can be demonstrated using a knee joint model in which the ACL and PCL are modeled using linear <b>spring</b> <b>damper</b> <b>elements</b> and the LCL and MCL are modeled using the large displacement ANCF finite elements that allows for using general constitutive models and capture the deformation of the ligament cross sections...|$|R

The system level design involves synthesizing appropriate non-dimensional system parameters of pneumatic <b>spring</b> and MR <b>damper</b> <b>elements</b> based on parameter sensitivity analysis considering requirements for compact and efficient hardware utilization. The component level design involves optimal design of the MR valve by minimizing an objective function in terms of non-dimensional geometric, material and excitation parameters, and guaranteeing required performance in the worst cases.

40|$|Conventional {{vertical}} passenger {{transportation is}} performed by lifts. Conventional traction-drive electrical lifts use ropes {{to transfer the}} rotational motion of an electrical motor into a vertical motion of the cabin. The vertical passenger transportation system discussed in this paper does not use any ropes, the motor directly provides a driving force, which moves the cabin. This new propulsion is realized through an electrical linear motor. The use of the linear motor requires a new design of the passenger transportation system (PTS), which includes reducing {{the weight of the}} car through lightweight construction. The reduced stiffness of the lightweight design renders the construction more vulnerable to vibrations. In order to improve ride quality of the transportation system it is necessary to develop new concepts to damp the vibrations. One way to increase stiffness characteristics of the system is to introduce active damping components to be used alongside passive damping components. It is essential to derive a dynamic model of the system in order to design and also later control these damping components in the best possible way. This paper describes the fundamental steps undertaken to derive a dynamic model for designing and controlling active damping components for the new type of vertical PTS. The model is derived as a Multi-Body System (MBS), where the connections between the bodies are modelled as <b>spring</b> <b>damper</b> <b>elements.</b> The derivation of the MBS is demonstrated on a transportation system, consisting of three main components: a sledge, holding the rotor of the linear motor; a mounting frame, which is used to provide support for the cabin; and the actual cabin.

A new composite material that exhibits high stiffness and high damping might reduce issues with vibration in mechanical systems and structures. The material comprises three constituents: negative springs, positive <b>springs,</b> and <b>damping</b> <b>elements.</b> These components help achieve high stiffness with passive adaptive response over a frequency range. When applying sinusoidal loads on the material, the positive/negative spring interface oscillates, but body is relatively steady.

Stacking LHG layers using Newtonian fluids in the LHG channel or a single layer using non-Newtonian fluids can produce passive adaptive damping through a frequency range. Shear thinning fluids placed in the LHG machine?s channel provide adaptive performance by changing their dynamic viscosity.
