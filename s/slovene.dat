5|$|A French edition, {{translated}} by M. L. Carion (or by Louise Swanton-Belloc? (1796–1881)), appeared by 1853 published in Cambrai and in Paris. By 1857, the novel had {{been translated into}} 20 languages, including two independent translations into <b>Slovene</b> just one year after its original publication, which started the since-then uninterrupted dialogue between American authors and <b>Slovene</b> translators and readers. Later, it was translated into almost every major language, including Chinese (with translator Lin Shu creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel in 1901) and Amharic (with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation). The book was so widely read that Sigmund Freud reported a number of patients with sado-masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Tom's Cabin.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find a {{connection}} between changes in societies and changes in semantic prototypes by examining the prototypes of ‘fruit’ and ‘car’ among <b>Slovenes</b> that reached adulthood in Yugoslavia and <b>Slovenes</b> that that reached adulthood in the Republic of Slovenia and to compare those results with a control group of native English speakers. The results of the study suggests that in some aspects, the prototypes of ‘fruit’ and ‘car’ amongyounger <b>Slovenes</b> have moved closer to what they are in cultures that have a long history of capitalism and consumerism. The opinions about how good an example of a ‘fruit’ a banana is, is the best example of this.

5|$|Even though {{little was}} agreed upon and the {{agreement}} was later interpreted differently by its signatories, the Brioni Agreement established the EC's interest {{in the region and}} the first EC Ministerial Conference on Yugoslavia was held in The Hague on 10 July. The ECMM helped calm several standoffs around military barracks in Slovenia and facilitated negotiations between <b>Slovene</b> authorities and the JNA regarding the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia. In Croatia, armed combat continued and the JNA shelled the city of Osijek the same evening {{the agreement was}} signed. The federal presidency ordered the complete withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia on 18 July in response to <b>Slovene</b> actions in breach of the Brioni Agreement. The ECMM's scope of work was expanded to include Croatia on 1 September. By mid-September, the war had escalated as the Croatian National Guard and police blockaded the JNA barracks and the JNA embarked on a campaign against Croatian forces.|$|E
5|$|Slovenian athletes first competed at the Olympics in Stockholm, at the 1912 Summer Olympics, {{as part of}} the Austrian team. There, Rudolf Cvetko {{became the}} first <b>Slovene</b> to win an Olympic medal, a silver in the men's team sabre. Then, until Slovenia's independence, they competed as part of Yugoslavia.

Leon Štukelj was the most prominent pre-war athlete, winning three gold, one silver, and two bronze medals, and he is still the most decorated Slovenian Olympian. Among post-war Olympians, Miroslav Cerar won two gold and one bronze medals, also in gymnastics. All of Yugoslavia's Winter Olympic medals (three silver and one bronze) were won by Slovenians with the first being the silver medal of Jure Franko in alpine skiing, won at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, when Yugoslavia hosted the Games.|$|E

At 19:30, the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petrović that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the right wing of the 7th Army.

The Yugoslav federal prime minister Ante Marković was also present, as were the Yugoslav federal foreign minister Budimir Lončar, interior minister Petar Gračanin and the deputy defence minister Vice Admiral Stane Brovet. Croatia was represented by President Franjo Tuđman while President Milan Kučan attended on behalf of Slovenia. Serbia was represented by Borisav Jović, a former Serbian member of the federal presidency who had resigned from the position on 15 June, instead of Milošević who refused to attend. Starting at 8am, the EC delegation held separate talks with Kučan and his assistants, then with Tuđman and his assistants, and finally with Jović. In the afternoon, a plenary meeting was held with the federal, <b>Slovene</b> and Croatian delegations in attendance, while Jović reportedly left dissatisfied with the talks.|$|E
