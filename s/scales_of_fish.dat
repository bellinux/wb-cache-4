40|$|The {{ecosystem}} approach to fisheries attempts to define objectives for target species, the wider ecosystem, and critically, the fishery itself. Proposals for implementing the approach often include spatial restrictions on harvesting, {{so it is}} important to understand how these will affect fishery performance. One metric of potential performance is the probability of encountering exploitable densities of a target species at the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> operations. The probability of encountering exploitable densities of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, at the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 1 nautical mile during an acoustic survey was predicted by bathymetry and the mean krill density at the larger scale at which the fishery is managed. This suggests that the risk to fishery performance will increase if management actions relocate the fishery into deeper water. The results also suggest that ecosystem models resolved to the spatial <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> management units could usefully predict effects at the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> operations. However, correct parameterization of these models will require better characterization of threshold densities for efficient exploitation. Finally, the distribution <b>of</b> catch and <b>fishing</b> effort over an entire fishing season reflected the distribution of krill density observed during the survey...|$|R
50|$|Epithelial cells {{adhere to}} one another through tight junctions, desmosomes and adherens junctions, forming sheets of cells that line {{the surface of the}} animal body and {{internal}} cavities (e.g., digestive tract and circulatory system). These cells have an apical-basal polarity defined by the apical membrane facing the outside surface of the body, or the lumen of internal cavities, and the basolateral membrane oriented away from the lumen. The basolateral membrane refers to both the lateral membrane where cell-cell junctions connect neighboring cells and to the basal membrane where cells are attached to the basement membrane, a thin sheet of extracellular matrix proteins that separates the epithelial sheet from underlying cells and connective tissue. Epithelial cells also exhibit planar cell polarity,in which specialized structures are orientated within the plane of the epithelial sheet. Some examples of planar cell polarity include the <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> being oriented in the same direction and similarly the feathers of birds, the fur of mammals, and the cuticular projections (sensory hairs, etc.) on the bodies and appendages of flies and other insects.|$|E

Excessive fishing effort, ongoing declines in {{landings}} and low revenues indicate that 75 years of fishery have not been sustainable in terms of socio-economical and ecological stability or avoidance of over-exploitation, despite measures aiming at reductions in fishing effort throughout the management history. We review the management history with a focus on how responsible fisheries management depends on time scales of management decisions, in comparison to time <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> population dynamics, and ecological changes. Management actions to improve sustainability have been generally implemented with considerable delays and in small steps, to avoid short-term losses in revenues.

At the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> aggregations, however, the impact <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> has received relatively little attention, with most effort devoted to impacts of vessel and gear avoidance on stock size estimates. We used concurrent deployment of a downwards-looking echosounder (Simrad ES 60 system) and an omnidirectional sonar (Simrad SP 90 system) during commercial pairtrawling operations for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) in the Gulf of Maine to examine their potential for studying the impacts <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> on herring aggregations. We compared a number of aggregation metrics to illustrate similarities and differences between the two systems, and then qualitatively examined their properties during and after pairtrawling events to illustrate potential applications. Our results suggest that using both downwards-looking and omnidirectional systems provides complementary information on fish aggregation metrics.

Individual pigment granules can be seen moving radially toward the cell center in aggregation, then back toward the cortices during dispersion. These two motions are different. In aggregation, the granules move smoothly and rapidly (5 - 10 Am/s), reminding one of the behavior of chromosomes during anaphase.

40|$|Animals {{frequently}} {{make use}} of highly reflecting surfaces, as for example in the tapeta of {{the eyes of many}} vertebrates, the iridophores and photophores of many marine animals, and the <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish.</b> Such surfaces raise the question: how are high reflectivities, often comparable with that of polished metal, achieved using biological materials? Highly reflecting surfaces in which metals are not employed have recently been developed industrially. The principle employed is that of the quarter-wavelength film (Text-fig. 1), in which light reflected from the front surface of a transparent thin film is in phase with, and so interferes constructively with, light reflected from the back surface. Light reflected at a low to high refractive index interface (in this case the upper surface of the film) undergoes a phase change of £ wavelength. So, for construc-tive interference, light reflected from the lower interface must be retarded by wave-length. The optical thickness of the fihn (refractive index, n, x actual thickness, t) must therefore be J wavelength for maximum constructive interference to occur when light is reflected normally...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Age {{data are}} {{routinely}} used in fish population studies today. While various works have touched upon {{aspects of the}} history of fish aging techniques, there {{does not appear to be}} a single source that attempts to summarize the earliest literature on age determination of fishes in a broad historical context. The Fisheries Management Section formed the ad hoc Assessment of Fish Aging Techniques Committee in 2006, with development of such a review as a goal. The earliest references to rings on the hard structures of fish by Leeuwenhoek and Hederström date to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Scientific validation of annuli on the <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> did not take place until the late 1800 s, with the work of Hintze and Hoffbauer. The work of Reibisch on otoliths and Heincke with other hard structures quickly followed. These later studies on fish aging techniques came at a time when large-scale studies of fish populations were gaining momentum. While the new aging methods were adopted rapidly by many fisheries workers, debates about their validity were not uncommon. A notable example took place between Hjort and Thompson, centering on Thompson’s doubts concerning the validity of scale-based ages i...|$|E

Clay, aluminium and iron were reported to be the dominant contaminants that could possibly {{come into contact with}} and accumulate on the surface of local fish and initiate alteration in scale microstructure. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the extent of water body contamination in the Sidoarjo mud by evaluating the chromatophore density and microstructure deformation of fish scales that act as biomarkers. Scale samples were obtained from caged Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) fish that were placed downstream and upstream of the Sidoarjo mud spillway pipes. With respect to melanophore density, it was found that the <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> exposed in the downstream section were significantly lower in chromatophores (100 chr/mm²). This study suggested that the density of chromatophores was closely related to the concentration of total suspended solids (r = 0. 69), which was possibly enhanced by iron (r = 0. 56).

The three- and four-week periods produced the best growth checks for that time of year, but were generally of inferior quality to those produced in 1962. Mortality was low and post-starvation growth recovery was rapid. In June and July 1962, six lots (each with a replication) of 410 juvenile silver salmon each, underwent one, two, and three weeks of complete starvation and two lots of 410 fish were subjected to three and six weeks of partial starvation. Two lots, each with a replication, were used as controls. The best growth checks that were developed during the 1961 or 1962 experiments occurred with the six week partially starved group.

40|$|Information about {{dispersal}} <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> {{at various}} life history stages {{is critical for}} successful design of networks of marine protected areas, but is lacking for most species and regions. Otolith chemistry provides an opportunity to investigate dispersal patterns {{at a number of}} life history stages. Our aim was to assess patterns of larval and post-settlement (i. e. between settlement and recruitment) dispersal at two different spatial scales in a Mediterranean coastal fish (i. e. white sea bream, Diplodus sargus sargus) using otolith chemistry. At a large spatial scale (, 200 km) we investigated natal origin of fish and at a smaller scale (, 30 km) we assessed ‘‘site fidelity’ ’ (i. e. post-settlement dispersal until recruitment). Larvae dispersed from three spawning areas, and a single spawning area supplied post-settlers (proxy of larval supply) to sites spread from 100 to 200 km of coastline. Post-settlement dispersal occurred within the scale examined of, 30 km, although about a third of post-settlers were recruits in the same sites where they settled. Connectivity was recorded both from a MPA to unprotected areas and vice versa. The approach adopted in the present study provides some of the first quantitative evidence of dispersal at both larval and post-settlement stages of a key species in Mediterranean rocky reefs. Similar data taken from a number of species are needed to effectively design both single marine protected areas and networks of marin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Estimating a {{maturation}} {{schedule for}} an anadromous fish {{based solely on}} in-river sampling is not feasible without some method of inferring the composition of fish still at sea. We developed a model to estimate the maturation schedule for American shad Alosa sapidissima in the York River, Virginia, based on the analysis of spawning marks on the <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> sampled from the mature population. The spawning histories of older fish are utilized to infer patterns at younger ages. The method of maximum likelihood was used to estimate the probabilities of American shad maturing at given ages. American shad collected in this study matured between ages 3 and 7. The proportions maturing at these ages were 1. 8, 26. 3, 52. 4, 19. 5, and 0 %, respec-tively, for data collected during 1998; 5. 4, 41. 0, 31. 6, 13. 3, and 8. 7 % for data collected during 1999; and 0. 3, 27. 3, 49. 6, 18. 0, and 4. 8 % for data collected during 2000. They averaged 2. 1, 32. 5, 44. 5, 16. 8, and 4. 1 % for all 3 years. Maturity schedules were constructed by cumulating the maximum likelihood estimates and were found to generally overlap for the 3 years of data. Several assumptions underlie the model, but various analyses support these assumptions.
