500|$|The novel {{depicts a}} younger {{generation}} of Indonesians (...) as being [...] "those who understand Dutch". Maier writes that this understanding {{is not limited to}} the language used, but also actions; this includes holding hands in public and drinking lemonade, activities which traditional Indonesian society does not involve. Student Hidjo also contrasts Dutch and Javanese peoples. Maier finds that, through its alternating events, the novel shows that the Dutch and Javanese are incompatible; Maeir <b>sums</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as [...] "Javanese do not feel at ease in Holland, [...] Dutch do not feel at ease in Java." [...] According to Maier, the novel views the gap between the two cultures as [...] "unbridgeable".|$|E

In a September 2010 interview, Seppälä defines their music: [...] "Amberian Dawn's music is melodic metal, and the roots lie in the Metal and Rock music of the 70s and 80s and maybe {{a little bit of the}} '90s. There are a lot of technical skills within the band, so everyone who's not scared of serious guitar and keyboard shredding should listen to our music." ...|$|E

[...] I think that rather <b>sums</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> The best way, one would think, of freeing oneself from a museum would be not to go there. Mr. Marinetti's fathers and grandfathers freed Italy from prisons and torture chambers, places where people were held by force. They, being in the bondage of [...] "moralism," [...] attacked Governments as unjust, real Governments, with real guns. Such was their utilitarian cowardice that they would die in hundreds upon the bayonets of Austria. I can well imagine why Mr. Marinetti in his motor-car {{does not wish to}} look back at the past. If there was one thing that could make him look smaller even than before it is that roll of dead men's drums and that dream of Garibaldi going by. The old Radical ghosts go by, more real than the living men, to assault I know not what ramparted city in hell. And meanwhile the Futurist stands outside a museum in a warlike attitude, and defiantly tells the official at the turnstile that he will never, never come in.|$|E

6000|$|And on {{the whole}} this is {{justified}} by the facts. Some men are greater than their work. Their work only represents one facet of their character, {{and there may be}} a dozen others, all remarkable, and uniting to make one complex and unique creature. It was not so with Gibbon. He was a cold-blooded man, with a brain which seemed to have grown at the expense of his heart. I cannot recall in his life one generous impulse, one ardent enthusiasm, save for the Classics. His excellent judgment was never clouded by the haze of human emotion--or, at least, it was such an emotion as was well under the control of his will. Could anything be more laudable--or less lovable? He abandons his girl at the order of his father, and <b>sums</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> that he [...] "sighs as a lover but obeys as a son." [...] The father dies, and he records the fact with the remark that [...] "the tears of a son are seldom lasting." [...] The terrible spectacle of the French Revolution excited in his mind only a feeling of self-pity because his retreat in Switzerland was invaded by the unhappy refugees, just as a grumpy country gentleman in England might complain that he was annoyed by the trippers. There is a touch of dislike in all the allusions which Boswell makes to Gibbon--often without even mentioning his name--and one cannot read the great historian's life without understanding why.|$|E
