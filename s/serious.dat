5|$|All of Rossen's playscripts were adaptions except Marked Woman, Racket Buster and Alexander the Great, {{which were}} based on real events. Before he was blacklisted in 1951, only two of Rossen's adaptions were of <b>serious</b> novels, and Rossen's early drafts of the script for All the King's Men {{received}} <b>serious</b> criticisms within Columbia.|$|E
5|$|American {{football}} {{in the early}} 1900s had become increasingly violent; with no forward pass, the ball carrier would be typically pushed and pulled up the field by his own players in massive formations that often resulted in <b>serious</b> injuries. In 1905, 18 deaths, three at the college level, were attributed to football; 159 <b>serious</b> injuries were also reported, 88 at the college level.|$|E
5|$|Anaphylaxis is a <b>serious</b> {{allergic}} reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, {{a number}} of <b>serious</b> {{concerns}} confronted the company. Enron had recently faced several <b>serious</b> operational challenges, namely logistical difficulties in operating a new broadband communications trading unit, and the losses from constructing the Dabhol Power project, a large power plant in India. There was also increasing criticism of the company for the role that its subsidiary Enron Energy Services had in the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001.|$|E

5|$|Definitive {{criteria}} include histopathologic {{evidence of}} endometritis, thickened filled Fallopian tubes, or laparoscopic findings. Gram stain/smear becomes definitive {{in the identification}} of rare, atypical and possibly more <b>serious</b> organisms. Two thirds of patients with laparoscopic evidence of previous PID were not aware they had PID, but even asymptomatic PID can cause <b>serious</b> harm.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the force}} of impact, jumpers {{occasionally}} survive the fall from the bridge, though not without sustaining <b>serious</b> injuries.|$|E
5|$|Evidence is {{mounting}} {{that there is}} <b>serious</b> competition for food between larval/early juvenile introduced carp and larval/early juvenile native fish. Introduced carp dominate the fish faunas of lowland Murray-Darling rivers; the sheer amount of biomass carp now take up, and {{the large numbers of}} larvae carp produce, causes <b>serious</b> negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish. Carp are the main vector of the introduced Lernaea parasite (Lernaea cyprincea) and <b>serious</b> vectors of the introduced Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi).|$|E

5|$|It seems hardly {{likely that}} we are even to-day so lukewarm in our {{interest}} in letters or <b>serious</b> discussion as to be content to reduce our treatment of sex to the standard of a child's library in the supposed interest of a salacious few, or that shame will for long prevent us from adequate portrayal {{of some of the}} most <b>serious</b> and beautiful sides of human nature.|$|E

5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some of the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the <b>serious</b> effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything <b>serious</b> enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} <b>serious</b> public health problem.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 2011, Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz {{were arrested}} in London by the UK's <b>Serious</b> Fraud Office {{as part of their}} ongoing {{investigation}} in conjunction with Iceland's Special Prosecutor's Office into the collapse of Icelandic Bank Kaupthing. Neither was, however, indicted, and in fact they sued the <b>Serious</b> Fraud Office for wrongful arrest, receiving large sums in compensation.|$|E

5|$|Owen was to {{be re-elected}} in 1912, after {{defeating}} a <b>serious</b> primary challenge from former Governor Charles Haskell, and again (without <b>serious</b> challenge) in 1918. He served all told from December 11, 1907 to March 4, 1925. Owen reportedly maintained a mailing list of 300,000 names.|$|E

5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained <b>serious</b> injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more <b>serious,</b> accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were <b>serious.</b>|$|E

5|$|Even in {{the first}} couple of years of his company, Goldfaden did not shy away from <b>serious</b> themes: his rained-out {{vaudeville}} in Botoşani had been Di Rekruten (The Recruits), playing with the theme of the press gangs working the streets of that town to conscript young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated Desolate Island by August von Kotzebue; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although Shmendrik and The Two Kuni-Lemls were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many <b>serious</b> Yiddish-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being Shulamith, also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly <b>serious</b> turn became possible because he had educated his audience. Nahma Sandrow suggests that it may have had equally {{as much to do with}} the arrival in Romania, at the time of the Russo-Turkish War, of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated Russian language theater. Goldfaden's strong turn toward almost uniformly <b>serious</b> subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to Odessa.|$|E

5|$|In Liao custom betrothal {{was seen}} as being equally <b>serious</b> to, if not more <b>serious</b> than, {{marriage}} itself, and was difficult to annul. The groom would pledge to work for three years for the bride's family, pay a bride price, and lavish the bride's family with gifts. After the three years, the groom {{would be allowed to}} take the bride back to his home, and the bride would usually cut off all ties with her family.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with {{religious}} matters. The question of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant and Catholic law, her retroactively declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a <b>serious</b> bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in <b>serious</b> doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.|$|E
