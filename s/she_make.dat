5|$|In 1714, {{with the}} {{accession}} of George I, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Hanover both {{came to be}} ruled in personal union by the House of Hanover. Early Hanoverian monarchs were careful to keep the heirlooms of the two realms separate. George III gave half the British heirlooms to his bride, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, as a wedding present. In her will, Charlotte left the jewels to the 'House of Hanover'. The Kingdom of Hanover followed the Salic Law, whereby the line of succession went through male heirs. Thus, when Queen Victoria acceded to the throne of the United Kingdom, her uncle Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale became King of Hanover. King Ernest demanded {{a portion of the}} jewellery, not only as the monarch of Hanover but also as the son of Queen Charlotte. Victoria flatly declined to hand over any of the jewels, claiming they had been bought with British money. Ernest's son, George V of Hanover, continued to press the claim. Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, suggested that <b>she</b> <b>make</b> a financial settlement with the Hanoverian monarch to keep the jewels, but Parliament informed the Queen they would neither purchase the jewels nor loan funds for the purpose. A parliamentary commission was set up to investigate the matter and in 1857 they found in favour of the House of Hanover. On 28 January 1858, 10 years after Ernest's death, the jewels were handed to the Hanoverian Ambassador, Count Kielmansegg. Victoria did manage to hang on to one of her favourite pieces of jewellery: a fine rope of pearls.|$|E

In 1949, Bergman wrote to Rossellini, expressing this admiration and suggesting that <b>she</b> <b>make</b> a film with him. This led to her being cast in his film Stromboli (1950). During production, Bergman fell in love with Rossellini, and they began an affair. Bergman became pregnant with their son, Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe ("Robin") Rossellini (born 2 February 1950).|$|E
25|$|Bligh then {{resumed his}} station with the Channel Fleet, patrolling off the French ports. On 3 February 1810 {{he came across}} the French ship Confiance, a former frigate that had been {{purchased}} by the merchants of the Île de France to transport their goods back to France. At the time Bligh had been sailing in company with the 74-gun , and under the orders of her captain, Henry Hotham. On 1 February Hotham had ordered Bligh to follow him into Quiberon Bay, but Valiant was unable to weather the point, nor could <b>she</b> <b>make</b> progress in the light winds the following day. She was therefore still off Belle Île on 3 February, when the Confiance came in sight. Confiance had evaded British blockaders and cruisers during the entirety of her voyage, having escaped pursuit fourteen times in her 93-day passage from the Indian Ocean. Hampered by light winds, {{she was unable to}} escape the Valiant, and finally surrendered to her just a few hours away from reaching safety in a French port. Her cargo was valued at £800,000, of which Bligh received £14,041.|$|E

500|$|Since Elsa is {{introduced}} {{as a young}} child {{at the beginning of the}} film, animators wanted the first glimpse of her powers to reflect her innocent and fanciful state of mind at the time. This included giving her first snowflakes a simple design. Her snow and ice patterns later become more intricate and complex when she is an adult. Co-effects supervisor Marlon West elaborated, [...] "When Elsa finally lets go and really starts owning her cryokinetic abilities, we wanted the ice and snow that <b>she</b> <b>make</b> to get across the idea that Elsa has now grown up and become this beautiful, elegant, confident and powerful young woman." ...|$|E

The song demanded <b>she</b> <b>make</b> use of her upper register and hold notes longer than she ever had before. It really is a techno gem that is always a standout at her concerts.

A horrified Elgin suggested instead that <b>she</b> <b>make</b> Karim a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO), which was in her personal gift, bestowed no title, and would have little political implication in India. Privy Purse Sir Fleetwood Edwards and Prime Minister Lord Salisbury advised against even the lower honour. Nevertheless in 1899, on the occasion of her 80th birthday, Victoria appointed Karim a commander of the order (CVO), a rank intermediate between member and knight.|$|E

2500|$|Cristal {{arranges}} for Nomi {{to audition}} for the chorus line of Goddess. Tony Moss, the show's director, humiliates Nomi by asking her to put ice on her nipples to make them hard. Furious, Nomi leaves the audition and again runs into James, {{who says he has}} written a dance number for her and contends that Nomi is too talented to be a stripper or showgirl. Despite her outburst at the audition, Nomi gets the job and quits Cheetah's.

2500|$|Theodora was {{followed}} by two failures. In 1885, in homage to Victor Hugo, who had died a few months earlier, she staged one of his older plays, Marion Delorme, written in 1831, but the play was outdated and her role did not {{give her a chance}} to show her talents. She next put on Hamlet, with her lover Philippe Garnier in the leading role and Bernhardt in the relatively minor role of Ophelia. The critics and audiences were not impressed, and the play was unsuccessful. Bernhardt had built up large expenses, which included a 10,000 francs a month allowance paid to her son Maurice, a passionate gambler. Bernhardt was forced to sell her chalet in Saint-Addresse and her mansion on rue Fortuny, and part of her collection of animals. Her impresario, Edouard Jarrett, immediately proposed <b>she</b> <b>make</b> another world tour, this time to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chili, Peru, Panama, Cuba, and Mexico, then on to Texas, New York, England, Ireland, and Scotland. She was on tour for 15 months, from early 1886 until late 1887. On the eve of departure, she told a French reporter: [...] "I passionately love this life of adventures. I detest knowing in advance {{what they are going to}} serve at my dinner, and I detest a hundred thousand times more knowing what will happen to me, for better or worse. I adore the unexpected." ...|$|E

[...] The article notes that Tiffany Stanley's [...] "reporting on this story was partially subsidized {{by a grant from}} the Fund for Investigative Journalism. The website for the Fund for Investigative Journalism notes, [...] "With FIJ grants, journalists investigate abuse of power in the public and private sectors. The financial support helps freelancers and reporters working for nonprofit news organizations cover the necessary costs of document retrieval, travel to develop and interview sources, and rental fees for equipment used for multi-media story-telling. A typical grant is $5,000." [...] The article does not mention that there were no charges or arrests following a police investigation of the child sex abuse allegations. It also does not mention that an independent investigator found that most of the charges in the child sex abuse lawsuit [...] "likely never happened at all", except for the three cases which already had been criminally prosecuted - two of them several decades ago (none of which involved church employees or church property). Stanley also does not mention that one of the plaintiffs has recanted her charges as false, nor does <b>she</b> <b>make</b> mention of why the Palmer family sued the ministry.
