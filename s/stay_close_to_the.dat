The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them to <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the man.|$|E

Nevertheless, the easily spooked Kent issues orders for the military, led by General Shannon Rogard, to move into town.|$|E
5|$|Extra-pair {{copulation}} with neighbouring birds {{has been}} recorded and may be a reason for adult males to <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> female {{before and during the}} egg laying period. Females may sometimes associate with two males and all three help in raising the brood. The typical clutch consists of two eggs which are incubated in turns by both parents. The eggs are brick red with the broad end covered more densely with blotches of red, brown, and black. The parents begin incubating soon after the first egg is laid leading to asynchronous hatching. The first egg hatches after about 42 days. The second chick may hatch three to five days later and a longer delay increases the likelihood that it will die of starvation. In cliffs where the nests are located close to each other, young birds have been known to clamber over to neighbouring nests to obtain food. In the Spanish population, young fledge and leave the nest after 90 to 110 days. Fledged birds continue to remain dependent on their parents for at least a month.|$|E

25|$|In California, Spanish {{settlement}} {{began in}} 1769 {{with the establishment}} of the Presidio and Catholic mission of San Diego. 20 more missions were established along the California coast by 1823, along with military Presidios and civilian communities. Settlers in California tended to <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast and outside of the California interior. The California economy was based on agriculture and livestock. In contrast to central New Spain, coastal colonists found little mineral wealth. Some became farmers or ranchers, working for themselves on their own land or for other colonists. Government officials, priests, soldiers, and artisans settled in towns, missions, and presidios.|$|E
25|$|Most toothed {{whales are}} adapted for diving to great depths, {{porpoises}} are one exception. In {{addition to their}} streamlined bodies, they can slow their heart rate to conserve oxygen; blood is rerouted from tissue tolerant of water pressure to the heart and brain among other organs; haemoglobin and myoglobin store oxygen in body tissue; and they have twice the concentration of myoglobin than haemoglobin. Before going on long dives, many toothed whales exhibit a behaviour known as sounding; they <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface {{for a series of}} short, shallow dives while building their oxygen reserves, and then make a sounding dive.|$|E
25|$|When a baby {{chimpanzee}} or gorilla dies, {{the mother}} {{will carry the}} body around for several days before it may finally {{be able to move}} on without it; this behavior has been observed in other primates, as well.

And they will often continue grooming it and <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carcass until the group must move on without it. Another notable example is Koko, a gorilla that uses sign language, who expressed sadness and even described sadness about the death of her pet cat, All Ball.|$|E

25|$|The hen lays {{a clutch}} of 8–16 white eggs, usually in a tree hole or hollow, which are {{incubated}} for 35 days. The sitting hen will leave the nest once a day from 20 minutes to {{one and a half}} hours, and will then defecate, drink water, eat and sometimes bathe. Once the eggs begin to hatch it may take 24 hours for all the chicks to break through their shells. When feral chicks are born they usually stay with their mother for about 10–12 weeks. Their bodies cannot produce all the heat they need, especially in temperate regions, so they will <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mother especially at night.|$|E
25|$|In 1264, Kublai Khan {{established}} the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs.

25|$|The F-82E had a {{range of}} over , which meant that with {{external}} fuel tanks it could fly from London to Moscow, loiter for 30 minutes over the target, and return, the only American fighter which could do so. It also had an operational ceiling of , where it could <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bombers {{it was designed to}} protect. The first production F-82Es reached the 27th in early 1948, and almost immediately the group was deployed to McChord AFB, Washington, in June, where its squadrons stood on alert on a secondary air defense mission due to heightened tensions over the Berlin Airlift. It was also believed that the 27th would launch an escort mission, presumably to the Soviet Union, if conflict broke out in Europe. From McChord, the group flew its Twin Mustangs on weather reconnaissance missions over the northwest Pacific, but problems were encountered with their fuel tanks. Decommissioned F-61 Black Widow external tanks were found at Hamilton AFB, California, which could be modified for the F-82; fitted on the pylons of the Twin Mustang, these solved the problem. With a reduction in tension, the 27th returned to its home base in Nebraska during September, where the unit settled down to transition flying with their aircraft.|$|E

25|$|On 10 January 1816 {{the three}} vessels met again near the {{fortress}} of El Callao. The ships formed a blockade and bombarded Guayaquil and its nearby the fortification. The following day the group seized the brigantine San Pablo, {{which was used}} to transport sick and injured sailors {{as well as the}} liberated prisoners. On the 13th the frigate Gobernadora was captured, and Lt. Colonel Vicente Banegas, officer of the Republican Army of Nueva Granada, joined the fleet. Four more ships were commandeered on the 18th, including the schooner Carmen and the brig Místico along with two other ships, one of which was sacked and sunk. On 21 January the Argentine fleet again attacked the fortress, sinking the frigate Fuente Hermosa in the process. Seven days later two more vessels were captured, the frigates Candelaria and Consecuencia. The next day the expanded fleet sailed north in the search of the Guayas River. On 7 February the Argentine contingent arrived at Puná Island, near Guayaquil. As they arrived, William Brown ordered Bouchard and his brother to <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seven ships they had captured. Brown took the command of the Santísima Trinidad, with which he wanted to attack Guayaquil. The next day his attack demolished the fort of Punta de Piedras, located some five leagues from Guayaquil. However, on 9 February Brown failed in his attempt to take the castle of San Carlos, and was instead captured by the royalist forces. After a long negotiation, the Argentine corsairs traded Brown for the Candelaria, three brigantines and five correspondence chests that had been taken from the Consecuencia.|$|E
25|$|Porpoising, {{also known}} as running, is a high speed surface {{behaviour}} of small cetaceans where long jumps are alternated with swimming close to the surface. Despite the name, porpoising behaviour is seen in dolphins and porpoises, {{as well as other}} marine species such as penguins and pinnipeds. When marine mammals are travelling at speed they are forced to <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface in order to maintain respiration for the energetic exercise. At leisurely cruising speeds below 4.6m/s, dolphins swim below the water's surface and only briefly expose their blowholes along with up to one third of their body at any one time. This results in little splashing as they have a very streamlined shape. Porpoising occurs mainly when dolphins and porpoises are swimming at speeds greater than 4.6m/s. Here, jump length is roughly equal to distance traveled when the cetaceans are submerged. This exposes the blowhole for longer which is needed to get enough oxygen to maintain metabolism and therefore high speeds over long periods of time. Studies have also shown that leaping is more energetically efficient than swimming above a certain threshold speed. This is due to the reduction in friction when travelling in air compared to water which saves more energy than is needed to produce the leap. These benefits also outweigh the energy wasted due to the large amount of splashing often seen when groups are porpoising. Porpoising is therefore a result of high speed swimming which cetaceans use for important pursuit and escape activities. For example, dolphins may be seen porpoising away from their main predator, sharks or the direction of incoming boats to avoid collision.|$|E
