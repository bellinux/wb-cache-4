George Mitchell when we made that deal [...] I'll never forget Bob Dole turning to Pat Moynihan and saying, 'we all got to jump in this boat at the same time.'

500|$|In an {{interview}} by Neil Bennett from Digital Arts Magazine, Kricfalusi {{revealed that he}} would have taken a different approach to the animation if he were to animate the entire episode. Primarily, the animation would be slower paced {{than it was in the}} 35-second-long segment. The couch gag was done at a faster pace so he was able to include all of his ideas. Kricfalusi explains that [...] ", I would definitely keep on experimenting with the way they move and the acting. I'm sure I would do of my trademark long scenes of two characters interacting with each other without a cut. I would [...] want to do more stuff with Marge. I loved animating her and was inspired by the way the Fleischers animated Olive Oyl.

500|$|Peart's {{drumming}} {{skill and}} technique are well-regarded by fans, fellow musicians, and music journalists. His influences are eclectic, ranging from Pete Thomas, John Bonham, Michael Giles, Ginger Baker, Phil Collins, Steve Gadd, Stewart Copeland, Michael Shrieve and Keith Moon, to fusion and jazz drummers Billy Cobham, Buddy Rich, Bill Bruford and Gene Krupa. The Who {{was the first}} group that inspired him to write songs and play the drums. Peart is distinguished for playing [...] "butt-end out", reversing stick orientation for greater impact and increased rimshot capacity. [...] "When I was starting out", Peart said, [...] "if I broke the tips off my sticks I couldn't afford to buy new ones, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> just turn them around and use the other end. I got used to it, and continue to use the heavy end of lighter sticks – {{it gives me a}} solid impact, but with less 'dead weight' to sling around." ...|$|E
500|$|A Green Lantern and Hal Jordan's mentor. Strong {{affirmed that}} the film will follow the origin story, [...] "the film closely follows the early comics. Sinestro starts out as Hal Jordan’s mentor, {{slightly}} suspicious and not sure of him because obviously Hal is the first human being who’s made into a Green Lantern. He's certainly very strict and unsure of the wisdom of Hal becoming a Green Lantern". Strong said, the character [...] "is a military guy but isn't immediately bad. It's {{the kind of person}} that lends himself to becoming bad over the course of the comics being written, but initially he’s quite a heroic figure." [...] He also revealed that the outfit and other aspects of the character very closely follow the character's early days, [...] "That widow's peak and thin mustache was for some reason originally based on David Niven... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to do justice to the Sinestro that was conceived for the comic books".|$|E
500|$|Johnson opposes {{federal and}} state gun control {{legislation}}, saying: [...] "I'm {{a firm believer in}} the Second Amendment and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have signed legislation banning assault weapons or automatic weapons." [...] Johnson says that the Second Amendment [...] "was designed to protect us against a government that could be very intrusive. And in this country, we have a growing police state - if people can own assault rifles or automatic rifles, I think leads to a more civil government." [...] Johnson would, however, limit weapons such as rocket launchers. Johnson believes that allowing concealed carrying of guns reduces crime and gun violence. He opposes barring gun sales to individuals on the no-fly list, because he claims that such lists have a high error rate. Johnson has called for a [...] "thousand-person taskforce" [...] or [...] "hot line" [...] to prevent terrorists from obtaining guns, and has questioned why the perpetrator of the Orlando nightclub shooting was not [...] "deprived of his guns" [...] after being interviewed three times.|$|E

There were 13 songs recorded for the album, but only 11 appear on the album.

[...] The band had recorded thirteen songs for the album, seven written by lead guitarist Jeff Hanneman and six by King, although not all of them were included. King later confirmed the album's release date was pushed back to late summer 2009. An article on Slayer's website confirmed the album's name.

500|$|... {{the cruel}} oppressions of this kingdom by England {{are not to}} be borne. You send what books you please hither, and the booksellers here can send nothing to you that is written here.

But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E

[...] Fear of Flying disbanded in October 2007 with a MySpace bulletin stating [...] "Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!", before introducing a darker sound and a new name that reflected their maturity. Cave stated that the band deleted their MySpace account [...] "without any token farewell gigs". McVeigh said that the current musical climate {{had an effect on}} the split, stating that [...] "Maybe a few years ago, we would have signed a deal and had a chance to make three albums [...] In the current climate...we’d have been dropped".

500|$|Giving {{evidence}} [...] to the tribunal, S. O. Davies said he {{had long}} suspected that the Aberfan tips were unstable, but had kept quiet for fear that if tipping was stopped on the mountainside the Coal Board would close the colliery. Davies added: [...] "But if I {{had been asked to}} do <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have done it". His testimony was strongly challenged by the NUM, whose counsel Brian Gibbens QC said that [...] "f Mr Davies is to be accepted as truthful and accurate in his recollection... then he bears what must be one of the largest personal burdens of responsibility for the disaster". However, Gibbens found it incredible that a man in Davies's unique local position of authority and influence would not have mentioned his fears to any of the formal bodies—borough council, Coal Board, union or local Labour Party: [...] "If anyone could have exercised influence to overcome an obdurate or ignorant monolith like the Coal Board, [...] was well placed to do so." [...] Gibbens submitted that Davies's testimony should be rejected, on the grounds that he [...] "never appreciated what in fact was the import of his words". The tribunal concurred, accepting that Davies had not fully understood the gravity of his admission, and adding that had they been convinced otherwise, he could not have escaped censure. The tribunal's findings, published in July 1967, placed responsibility for the disaster firmly on the National Coal Board, specifically on the absence of any tipping policy.|$|E
500|$|Her {{marriage}} to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897, when Victoria {{returned home from}} a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst {{in bed with a}} male servant. She did not make her accusation public, but told a niece that [...] "no boy was safe, from the stable hands to the kitchen help. He slept quite openly with them all." [...] Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan, her chargé d'affaires, but refused to consider permitting her grandchildren to divorce because of their daughter, Elisabeth. Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and, when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, significant opposition {{to the end of the}} marriage was removed. The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901. Ernst, who had at first resisted the divorce, came to believe it was the only possible step. [...] "Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad," [...] Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg. [...] "For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless. I only tried for her sake. If I had not loved her <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have given it up long ago." [...] Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was. [...] "Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage, it had been a failure ...heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart." [...] The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe. Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than [...] "the general disgrace of a divorce." ...|$|E
