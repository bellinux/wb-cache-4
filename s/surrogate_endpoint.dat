25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a <b>surrogate</b> <b>endpoint</b> for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered circumferential stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E
2500|$|Imaging {{techniques}} such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are routinely used in oncology and neuroscience areas,. For example, measurement of tumour shrinkage is a commonly used <b>surrogate</b> <b>endpoint</b> in solid tumour response evaluation. [...] This allows for faster and more objective assessment {{of the effects of}} anticancer drugs. [...] In Alzheimer's disease, MRI scans of the entire brain can accurately assess the rate of hippocampal atrophy, while PET scans can measure the brain's metabolic activity by measuring regional glucose metabolism, and beta-amyloid plaques using tracers such as Pittsburgh compound B (PiB). [...] Historically less use has been made of quantitative medical imaging in other areas of drug development although interest is growing.|$|E
2500|$|IMT is used {{to detect}} the {{presence}} of atherosclerotic disease in humans and, more contentiously, to track the regression, arrest or progression of atherosclerosis. [...] Ultrasound IMT measurements were first proposed and validated in vitro by Paolo Pignoli in 1984 and later publicized in a 'most cited' article. The use of IMT as a non-invasive tool to track changes in arterial walls has increased substantially [...] since the mid-1990s. Although IMT is predictive of future cardiovascular events, the usefulness of measuring change in IMT over time is disputed, as meta-analyses have found that change in IMT is not predictive of cardiovascular events. As such, the use of change in IMT as a <b>surrogate</b> <b>endpoint</b> measure of drug efficacy in clinical trials, or in clinical management of cardiovascular disease, is debated.|$|E

50|$|Developing an {{understanding}} of clinical significance for specific biomarkers can be a difficult process. There are two steps of certification for a <b>surrogate</b> <b>endpoint</b> to be fully established: Qualification and Validation. For a biomarker to become qualified it must go through a somewhat formal qualification process. A request must be submitted to IPRG to qualify an imaging biomarker for a specific use. The Biomarker Qualification Review Team, recruited from nonclinical and clinical review divisions, assesses the context and available data regarding the biomarker. They also evaluate the qualification study strategy methods and results and ultimately {{make a decision to}} accept or reject. After qualification, a biomarker may have limited use as a <b>surrogate</b> <b>endpoint.</b> They may be used in phase I and II clinical trials, but can only be used in phase III trials for early futility analyses.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Over 95 % of rare {{diseases}} lack treatments despite many successful treatment studies in animal models. To improve access to treatments, the Accelerated Approval (AA) regulations were implemented allowing {{the use of}} <b>surrogate</b> <b>endpoints</b> to achieve drug approval and accelerate development of life-saving therapies. Many {{rare diseases}} have not utilized AA due to the difficulty in gaining acceptance of novel <b>surrogate</b> <b>endpoints</b> in untreated rare diseases. Methods To assess {{the potential impact of}} improved AA accessibility, we devised clinical development programs using proposed clinical or <b>surrogate</b> <b>endpoints</b> for fifteen rare disease treatments. Results We demonstrate that better AA access could reduce development costs by approximately 60 %, increase investment value, and foster development of three times as many rare disease drugs for the same investment. Conclusion Our research brings attention to the need for well-defined and practical qualification criteria for the use of <b>surrogate</b> <b>endpoints</b> to allow more access to the AA approval pathway in clinical trials for rare diseases. </p...|$|R

In the present work, we discuss the conceptual framework underlying both approaches and study the relationship between them using theoretical elements and the analysis of a real case study. Furthermore, we show that the meta-analytic approach can be embedded within a causal-inference framework {{on the one hand and}} that it can be heuristically justified why <b>surrogate</b> <b>endpoints</b> successfully evaluated using this approach will often be appealing from a causal-inference perspective as well, on the other.
