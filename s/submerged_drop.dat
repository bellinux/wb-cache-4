50|$|On 27 July, the two destroyers cleared Pearl Harbor escorting four Army troopships {{bound for}} Australia and reached Sydney on 8 August. She got {{underway}} {{the next day}} and arrived at Nouméa, New Caledonia, on 12 August 1943. During the following months, Sampson alternately based her operations at Nouméa and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides Islands, and made frequent escort voyages to Guadalcanal, or Purvis Bay, Florida, Solomon Islands. On the night of 2 and 3 October, while escorting a convoy from Nouméa to Espiritu Santo, she fired at an enemy submarine and, after that vessel <b>submerged,</b> <b>dropped</b> depth charges that produced a heavy oil slick.|$|R

50|$|During {{the attack}} on Sydney Harbour by the Imperial Japanese Navy on 31 May 1942, the Sea Mist, {{together}} with Steady Hour and Yarroma, spotted the conning tower of midget submarine M-21 in Taylors Bay. The patrol boats had set their depth charge fuses to 15 m, and when Sea Mist passed over {{the place where the}} submarine had just <b>submerged</b> and <b>dropped</b> a depth charge, she had only five seconds to clear the area. The blast damaged M-21, which inverted and rose to the surface before sinking again. Sea Mist then dropped a second depth charge, which damaged one of her two propellers and prevented her from making further attacks.|$|R
5000|$|Departing {{again with}} her escorts on 7 March, Guadalcanal sailed with newly {{assigned}} air group VC-58 to Casablanca and got underway from that port on 30 March with a convoy {{bound for the}} United States. After three weeks of daylight flights finding no U-boats, Guadalcanal attempted night flight operations under the full moon of 8 April 1944. Four fully armed Avengers were launched just before sunset with recovery scheduled for 22:30. One of the Avengers found [...] recharging batteries on the surface northwest of Madeira, and forced the U-boat to <b>submerge</b> by <b>dropping</b> a stick of depth charges with U-515 silhouetted in a down-moon approach. Guadalcanal kept four Avengers aloft at all times through the night, and when U-515 attempted to surface to recharge batteries, she was repeatedly forced to submerge. Each sighting gave another fix on U-515's position; and , , , and [...] detected the U-boat with sonar at 07:00. The ships made coordinated attacks until U-515 was forced to the surface with depleted batteries and foul air at 14:00, and Kapitaenleutenant Werner Henke scuttled his ship.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{there were}} four {{friendly}} submarines {{in the vicinity of}} this attack, they were directed to give their positions and the other three did, but Seawolf was not heard from. On 4 October, Seawolf again was directed to report her position, and again she failed to do so. One of two planes from the aircraft carrier [...] sighted a submarine <b>submerging</b> and <b>dropped</b> two bombs on it even though it was in a safety zone for American submarines. The site was marked by dye. Richard M. Rowells commanding officer knew he was in a safety lane, but, having failed to get word Seawolf was behind schedule, believed there was no U.S. submarine nearby and chose to attack. Richard M. Rowell established sonar contact on the submarine, which then sent a series of dashes and dots which Richard M. Rowell stated bore no resemblance to the existing recognition signals. Believing this an attempt to jam her sonar, Richard M. Rowell attacked with Hedgehogs. The second attack was followed by underwater explosions, and debris rose to the surface.|$|R
50|$|In April 1917, the United States entered World War I, and by 9 June, Sterett was in Queenstown, Ireland. Throughout the {{remainder}} of the war, she operated from Queenstown to meet convoys and conduct them to either Berehaven, Ireland, or to Devonport, England. At these points, British and French destroyers assumed responsibility for the last leg of the voyage. A little {{less than a year after}} her arrival at Queenstown, on 31 May 1918, Sterett was herding a convoy toward the rendezvous point when she came upon a surfaced U-boat. As Sterett closed, the submarine rapidly <b>submerged.</b> Sterett began <b>dropping</b> depth charges furiously, and air bubbles and oil soon appeared on the surface, indicating damage to the German raider.|$|R
500|$|Just before 03:00, as Chicago {{was leaving}} the harbour, the lookouts spotted a {{submarine}} periscope passing alongside the cruiser. At 03:01, the indicator loop registered an inbound signal; M-21 was re-entering Sydney Harbour after recovering from the attack four hours previously. [...] fired on M-21 in Neutral Bay at 03:50, and at 05:00, three auxiliary patrol boats—HMAS Steady Hour, Sea Mist, and Yarroma—spotted the submarine's conning tower in Taylors Bay. The patrol boats had set their depth charge fuses to , and when Sea Mist passed over where the submarine had just <b>submerged</b> and <b>dropped</b> a depth charge, she had only five seconds to clear the area. The blast damaged M-21, which inverted and rose to the surface before sinking again. Sea Mist dropped a second depth charge, which damaged one of her two engines {{in the process and}} prevented her from making further attacks. Steady Hour and Yarroma continued the attack, dropping seventeen depth charges on believed visual sightings and instrument contacts of the midget over the next three and a half hours. At some point during the night, the crew of M-21 killed themselves.|$|R
5|$|When local {{fishermen}} catch a large tiger shark, {{the mayor}} proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes it being the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable great white shark's tooth {{embedded in the}} <b>submerged</b> hull. He <b>drops</b> it after finding a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists fill the beaches. Following a juvenile prank, the real shark enters a nearby estuary, killing a boater and causing Brody's son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody finally convinces a devastated Vaughn to hire Quint.|$|R

2500|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the Royal Navy had five sets for different surface ship classes, and others for submarines, incorporated into a complete anti-submarine attack system. The effectiveness of early ASDIC was hamstrung {{by the use of}} the depth charge as an anti-submarine weapon. This required an attacking vessel to pass over a <b>submerged</b> contact before <b>dropping</b> charges over the stern, resulting in a loss of ASDIC contact in the moments leading up to attack. The hunter was effectively firing blind, during which time a submarine commander could take evasive action. This situation was remedied by using several ships cooperating and by the adoption of [...] "ahead-throwing weapons", such as Hedgehog and later Squid, which projected warheads at a target ahead of the attacker and thus still in ASDIC contact. Developments during the war resulted in British ASDIC sets that used several different shapes of beam, continuously covering blind spots. Later, acoustic torpedoes were used.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 February, Spot {{began her}} second war patrol which took her, , and [...] into the East China Sea.

Spot manned her guns and returned the fire {{even though she was}} wallowing heavily in the rough seas. A lucky hit by her 5 in gun knocked out the escort's forward gun and saved the submarine from almost certain disaster.

5000|$|The {{fighting}} {{capability of}} the Loch class was a great jump forward, being based around the new Squid ahead-throwing A/S mortar. Previously, escorts had attacked with depth charges, requiring the attacking vessel to pass over the <b>submerged</b> submarine and <b>drop</b> warheads over the stern. Consequently, the ahead-looking ASDIC (sonar) set lost contact at the vital moment before the weapons were launched, allowing a skilled submarine commander to take successful evasive action. Squid, however, lobbed three 12 in, 390 pound warheads up to 600 yd ahead of the launching vessel falling in a triangular pattern with sides of 40 yd. As the clockwork fuses detonated the warheads at a depth determined by the ships' ASDIC set, the Squid therefore attacked in full ASDIC contact for greater accuracy and lethality. Two mortars were carried, with the bombs set to explode at different depths {{in order to create}} a convergent pressure wave to crush the hull of a submarine. The first successful [...] "kill" [...] was by [...] on 31 July 1944, sinking the [...] Such was the utility of Squid that depth charge carriage was reduced to only 15, with a single rack and a pair of throwers being carried at the stern, resulting in a clear quarterdeck compared to the eight throwers, two racks and stowage for 100 plus charges in the Rivers.|$|R
50|$|Ikatan Bay, on {{the north}} side of Ikatan Peninsula, is about 3.75 miles wide and 5 miles long in a {{southwest}} direction, and is free from surf except with winds from north to east. Sankin Island, lying 1 mile from the north side of the bay, is high, with a rounded, grassy summit; a reef extends from the island toward the nearest point of the peninsula. Sankin Bay is northwest of Sankin Island. The southwest end of Ikatan Bay is separated from Otter Cove by an isthmus, 20 to 30 feet high; a river enters Ikatan Bay at the middle of this lowland, and a <b>submerged</b> spit, which <b>drops</b> off abruptly to over 20 fathoms, makes off from its mouth. Approaching Ikatan Bay from southwestward the only known danger is Pankof Breaker, lying a little over 2 miles from the southeast point at the entrance to East Anchor Cove. There is a good anchorage in the bight on the west side of Ikatan Point. The south point at the entrance to the bay in about 9 fathoms, sand and mud bottom, with protection from winds from southeast to southwest. The best anchorage in Ikatan Bay from all southerly winds is on its south side off the low divide loading to Dora Harbor. Anchorage can also be made {{on the north}} side of the bay, 2.25 miles westward of Sankin Island, in 10 fathoms, sandy bottom, sheltered from ordinary northerly winds, but badly exposed to easterly and southerly winds. Isanotski Strait has its southerly entrance at the northwest end of Ikatan Bay. Traders Cove, on the eastern side of Isanotski Strait about 7 miles above its entrance from Ikatan Bay, is a good anchorage. Morzhovoi, a mission and native village, is on the south side. The mean rise and fall of tides in Ikatan Bay is 4.5 feet. In the narrow southern part of Isanotski Strait the tidal currents have a velocity of 7 to 9 miles or more, and it is said that there is practically no slack and that the current turns about three hours after high or low water in Ikatan Bay.|$|R
