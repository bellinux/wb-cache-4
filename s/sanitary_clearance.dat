40|$|The {{poultry red mite}} Dermanyssus gallinae is a major pest and {{widespread}} ectoparasite oflaying hens and other domestic and wild birds. Under optimal conditions, D. gallinae cancomplete its lifecycle in less than 10 days, leading to rapid proliferation of populationsin poultry systems. This paper focuses on developing a theoretical model framework todescribe the population dynamics of D. gallinae. This model is then {{used to test the}} efficacyand residual effect of different control options for managing D. gallinae. As well as allowingcomparison between treatment options, the model also allows comparison of treatmentefficacies to different D. gallinae life stages. Three different means for controlling D. gallinaepopulations were subjected to the model using computer simulations: mechanical cleaning(killing once at a given time all accessible population stages), <b>sanitary</b> <b>clearance</b> (starvingthe mite population for a given duration, e. g. between flocks) and acaricide treatment(killing a proportion of nymphs and adults during the persistence of the treatment). Simulationsshowed that mechanical cleaning and <b>sanitary</b> <b>clearance</b> alone could not eradicate themodel D. gallinae population, although these methods did delay population establishment. In contrast, the complete eradication of the model D. gallinae population was achieved byseveral successive acaricide treatments in close succession, even when a relatively lowtreatment level was used.

40|$|The Blue Path (CA-e) is an {{document}} {{created and}} transmitted electronically that contains all necessary data {{to allow the}} sanitary authority to analyze the requirement of exportation that will result on the <b>sanitary</b> <b>clearance</b> of the animal protein for exportation. Actually it is in use in Brazil. However, even though the data exists electronically, when it is send to the importer country some must be sent on paper, because the bilateral agreements do not allow the exchange of electronic documents. The present work proposals {{the extension of the}} CA-e, as an element of integration and traceability, that will allow the automation of the communication between private and public systems not only at Brazil, the country of the origin of the animal protein exported, but also between and at the country of destiny. Based on the number presented by the adoption of the CA-e at Brazil, it is fair to conclude that this communication machine/machine would bring great economy and optimization for the supply chain...|$|E
5000|$|Significant {{improvements}} {{were made}} in Māori housing and <b>sanitary</b> conditions. Slum <b>clearances</b> took place, thousands of new houses and privies were built, and whole villages were transferred to better sites. These measures led {{to a reduction in}} Māori infant mortality rates while increasing Māori life expectancy by 15 to 20 years.|$|R
