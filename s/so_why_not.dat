25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lord's Taverners and the involvement of early members can be broadly summarised by the following:"We've all got professional and sporting interests in common. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. We can talk about our work and watch the cricket. And {{we can try to}} put a few bob back into the game at the same time."Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money all going to cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, the Falcon Picture Group {{produced}} {{a series of}} radio dramas based on the series—stating, [...] "In the 1950s many radio series were turned into television series – <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> the reverse?"—which were broadcast on about 200 stations through the USA; [...] "Time Enough at Last" [...] was included in volume six.|$|E
500|$|Both {{managers}} {{approached the}} match {{with a view}} to win, in spite of the Shield's friendly feel. Arsenal manager George Graham opined [...] "Winning is a good habit, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> start early?" [...] Graham lambasted those who found his team's playing style tedious: [...] "The criticism that we don't pass the ball and we don't have flair is overdone. We won two championships and in the second lost one game out of 38." [...] However, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said [...] "Winning means keeping your job, and it can be a delicate situation. But I tell myself I'm not going to fail in this game." [...] Ferguson spoke in glowing terms of new signing Roy Keane, a midfielder who gave United [...] "unbelievable options, a real edge to the squad".|$|E

500|$|Composer Jeff Russo {{felt that}} [...] "the {{important}} part is allowing {{the humanity of}} these characters to really shine through", {{and in addition to}} an orchestra he used [...] "a bunch of old synthesizers" [...] and [...] "a lot of interesting sound design" [...] to represent the [...] "otherworldly" [...] elements of the series. Russo specifically found a Synthi AKS synthesizer for the show, as that instrument was used during the making of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, one of Hawley's favorite albums and what Russo described as [...] "the sound of schizophrenia, the sound of mental illness in the ’70s. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> use that as the touchstone for what the sound of this score might be?" [...] Russo experimented with the instrument, and began [...] "recording and writing melodies around its unusual sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 November 2012, Novakovic {{confirmed}} {{that she would}} be leaving Neighbours to pursue acting opportunities in the United States. Of her decision to leave the serial, Novakovic stated [...] "Australia is small compared to what else is out there, especially in Los Angeles. I love acting and it's what I want to do, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> be in the thick of it all? I certainly love to do more Aussie things but, being realistic, there is nowhere near as much opportunity here." [...] During her first interview since announcing her departure, Novakovic explained that her main reasons for leaving Neighbours were to try other things and explore different characters. The actress said that she had wanted to do two years with the show, but when the time came, she decided to stay for another year to prepare herself to leave.|$|E
500|$|Following the magazine's publication, Blatter's would-be {{opponent}} for the FIFA Presidency, UEFA President Michel Platini {{responded that}} he intended to extend the World Cup to 40 national associations, increasing the number of participants by eight. Platini said that he would allocate an additional berth to UEFA, two to Asia Football Confederation and Confederation of African Football, two shared between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL, and a guaranteed place for the Oceania Football Confederation. Platini was clear about why he wanted to expand the World Cup. He said: [...] " [...] not based {{on the quality of the}} teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup... but it's a good compromise.... It's a political matter <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1980s Gielgud {{appeared}} {{in more than}} twenty films. Morley singles out as noteworthy The Elephant Man (1980), {{as the chairman of}} the Royal London Hospital, Chariots of Fire (1981), as the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, Gandhi (1982), as Lord Irwin (the latter two winning Academy Awards as Best Picture), The Shooting Party (1984) and Plenty (1985), directed by David Lynch, Hugh Hudson, Richard Attenborough, Alan Bridges and Fred Schepisi respectively. Tony Palmer's Wagner (1983) was the only film in which Gielgud, Richardson, and Olivier played scenes together. Gielgud made cameo appearances in films of little merit, lending distinction while not damaging his own reputation. He told an interviewer, [...] "They pay me very well for two or three days' work a month, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>not?</b> It's nice at my age to be able to travel all over the world at other people's expense." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Khan's {{enthusiasm for}} the idea of a sequel, the film {{industry}} expressed mixed opinions regarding it. Filmmaker Rajkumar Gupta commented, [...] "It would be challenging to take forward a story that has not worked earlier." [...] Producer Ramesh Taurani responded negatively to the idea, saying, [...] "It is important for the film to be appreciated so that a sequel can be made." [...] Trade analyst Atul Mohan called the sequel [...] "a bad idea." [...] Conversely, others were supportive of the sequel. Producer Goldie Behl brushed aside arguments about the success of the first film, saying, [...] "If the people think that they can earn some more, then it doesn't matter how big or small the hit was." [...] Director Kunal Kohli also reacted positively, saying, [...] "Certain ideas naturally lend themselves to sequels. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> use that investment of your time and effort to make a sequel that will take the brand further?" ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} {{prominent}} aspects of Nikita's character development {{since the beginning of}} the series is her relationship with Michael, and has been dubbed by fans as [...] "Mikita". Unlike other works on film and television, Silverstein did not play the traditional [...] "Will They/Won't They?" [...] game between the two characters. Co-star Shane West stated [...] "It's not hard to bring Michael and Nikita together," [...] but it is [...] "really hard to keep them apart...We're barely into the season yet, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> keep teasing?" [...] When the first season started airing, West also expected that their romance would come, citing Michael and Nikita's past relationship while she was working with Division. Now that the two are together by the end of the first season, in the second season Silverstein wanted something to happen to get in their way, saying that no new tension would make the relationship boring, adding [...] "I don't think you can just have them happy and in love, kicking ass together forever." ...|$|E

500|$|Tom Young from BBC Music {{said that}} he did not see the actual {{performances}} on the tour and felt that [...] "some of the magnitude of the performance is lost and the track/scene changes appear needlessly long-winded. [...] As far as live albums go, this is a job well done." [...] Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork gave a negative review for the album, stating [...] "Madonna herself is mostly to blame. On stage, she draws from a deep well of amazing pop songs and has the money and power to reinvent this sort of traveling circus. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> try to break down the wall between performance and audience and hold a gigantic rave? [...] Åkerlund gives you everything you don't want from a concert film: incessant quick cuts that you give you no sense of space or stage, overdubbed music and vocals that give you no sense of performance, and only a few shots of the audience to gauge their excitement." [...] Mini Anthikad-Chhibber The Hindu commented that [...] "Madonna pulls out all stops in this effort turn the world into a dance floor and one just has to doff one's hat to her energy." [...] At the 50th Grammy Awards held on February 10, 2008 at Staples Center in Los Angeles, The Confessions Tour won in the category of Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{also came}} up with the idea to have a {{crossover}} with the show , which also takes place in Baltimore. He later recalled, [...] "I realized that the whole episode was framed around Byers telling his story to a Baltimore homicide detective. So I figured 'what the heck? Homicides a great show, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> try to get Richard Belzer to play his Detective [...] character?'" [...] Despite some hesitancy from Fox's lawyers, the show got in contact with NBC executive producer Tom Fontana, who was more than willing to allow the use of Belzer: Gilligan later described Fontana as a [...] "great guy" [...] for assistance in the matter. The episode also features the first reappearance of X, who had been murdered in the season four opener [...] "Herrenvolk". The idea to bring back X was thought up by executive producer John Shiban, who helped Gilligan storyboard the episode. He noted, [...] "we had the board set up and [...] and there was a piece missing and we just couldn't come up with a how to get out of this situation, why doesn't this assassin just kill The Lone Gunmen? It was a flashback story and it was in 1989 and we were pacing around in my backyard, and [...] I just turned to him and said, 'X! [...] X has another agenda! X is the assassin, it's not some other character, it's our X. [...] He wouldn't kill the Gunmen, 'cause he's trying to help Mulder.'" ...|$|E

30|$|For {{the present}} study, we {{considered}} {{the data collected}} in the major project’s fourth collection stage (with mothers of children aged 2 – 3) regarding the mothers’ perceptions of their own diets and those of their children, which were specifically collected at this time. More specifically, the following questions were used to analyze maternal perceptions: (1) “Do you believe that your diet is healthy? If <b>so,</b> <b>why?</b> If <b>not,</b> <b>why</b> not?” and (2) “Do you believe that your child’s diet is healthy? If <b>so,</b> <b>why?</b> If <b>not,</b> <b>why</b> not?” The mothers were not specifically asked about their diets or the diets of their children (such as the types and quantities of foods consumed) or about what they {{believed to be a}} healthy diet. They responded to these two questions freely and only mentioned foods or concepts about a healthy diet when they wanted to.|$|R

2500|$|Planning for {{the third}} series began in November 1978. Gareth Thomas' {{departure}} meant the series would continue without Blake. According to David Maloney, [...] "...a decision {{had to be made}} to go with a third series or stop it completely. Terry Nation, naturally, was for going on with it, and I think Ronnie Marsh was too, because of the viewing figures.

Or in Minsky (1961) and Hopcroft and Ullman (1979, p.171ff) the tape is always blank except for a mark at the left end—at no time does a head ever print or erase.|$|E
