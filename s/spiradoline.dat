50|$|<b>Spiradoline</b> (U-62066) {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a highly {{selective}} κ-opioid agonist. It has analgesic, diuretic and antitussive effects, and produces subjective effects in animals {{similar to those of}} ketazocine and alazocine. The main effect in humans is sedation, along with analgesic and diuretic effects, but significant side effects such as dysphoria and hallucinations have stopped it from being used clinically. Kappa-agonists have been shown to react negatively with the mu receptor, instead of having an assumed synergy since they are both opioid receptors, such as with the mu (μ) receptors and delta (δ) receptors (which both mediate pain-relief, euphoria and overall potency of opioid effects).|$|E
40|$|<b>Spiradoline</b> (a {{congener}} of the kappa opioid agonist, U- 50488 H) {{was evaluated}} for analgesic and related activities in rodents. In nine antinociceptive assays utilizing various thermal, pressure and chemical and physical irritants, {{the potency of}} <b>spiradoline</b> ranges from 4. 7 to 23 (mean = 1 3) times that of U- 50488 H. Naloxone blocks the analgesic effect of <b>spiradoline.</b> The in vivo naloxone pA 2 for this antagonism is much lower than that for the antagonism of morphine and approximates that of U- 50488 H. The analgesic potency of <b>spiradoline</b> is greatly reduced in mice made tolerant to U- 50488 H but not in those made tolerant to morphine. Repeated treatment with <b>spiradoline</b> does not induce physical dependence as evidenced {{by a lack of}} naloxone-precip-itated jumping and withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia.

40|$|<b>Spiradoline</b> (U- 62, 066 E), a {{selective}} kappa ([kappa]) receptor agonist, was examined for {{actions on the}} cardiovascular system and on myocardial ionic currents in rats. We initially characterized cardiac, hemodynamic, and antiarrhythmic actions of <b>spiradoline</b> in isolated perfused rat hearts and pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Electrophysiologic studies in isolated myocytes were used to elucidate the mechanism for changes observed in vivo in the ECG, {{as well as for}} antiarrhythmic actions against electrical and ischemia-induced arrhythmias. In isolated rat hearts, <b>spiradoline</b> reduced heart rate and cardiac contractility and increased the PR interval and QRS width of the ECG in a concentration-dependent manner. In anesthetized rats, <b>spiradoline</b> dose-dependently reduced blood pressure and heart rate and prolonged the PR interval and QRS width. At slightly higher doses, it increased the QaT interval of the ECG. RSh, an index of sodium channel blockade in the rat, also was dose-dependently increased. Electrical stimulation of the left ventricle suggested that <b>spiradoline</b> may exert its antiarrhythmic action by blockade of myocardial sodium currents. The electrophysiologic actions of <b>spiradoline</b> on sodium currents, the transient outward (ito) and sustained plateau potassium (iksus) currents were studied in isolated cardiac rat myocytes by whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. <b>Spiradoline</b> (15 - 500 µM) reduced peak sodium current in a rapid, reversible, and concentration-dependent manner; it also increased the rate of decay of Ito and reduced the amplitude of Iksus. At a concentration of 150 µM, <b>spiradoline</b> produced a 24 ± 2 mV hyperpolarizing shift in sodium current inactivation kinetics but did not alter activation processes. <b>Spiradoline</b> showed both tonic and frequency-dependent components of sodium current block. Thus <b>spiradoline</b> produced its antiarrhythmic actions via sodium channel blockade in myocardial tissue, although higher doses also block potassium currents. This combined ion channel-blocking property may be of added clinical benefit in the setting of myocardial ischemia...|$|E

In Phase 1, groups of rats received various doses of mu or kappa agonists, or placebo, testing for preference or aversion. Group A always received saline SC before 15 -minute sessions. Group B received fentanyl SC (0. 003, 0. 006, 0. 012 mg/kg), Group C received low and medium doses of agonists SC, and Group D received <b>spiradoline</b> (0. 3, 0. 6, 1. 2 mg/kg) SC during Training Sessions 1 - 4, rats being {{restricted to the}} drug-associated compartment.

We have assessed the neuroendocrine effects of <b>spiradoline</b> in healthy volunteers with two doses (1. 6 and 4. 0 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. m.) of the compound. Six male non-smokers aged 19 – 27 years were studied by use of a randomized, double-blind three-limb placebo-controlled cross-over design. Blood was taken from an in-dwelling venous cannula basally and at 15 [*]min intervals for 2 [*]h for determination of serum cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone (GH) and catecholamines. Psychological function was assessed by the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and the Addiction Research Centre Inventory (ARCI) administered before the medication and at 35 [*]min, 1 [*]h 25 [*]min and 2 [*]h afterwards. Cardiovascular variables were recorded at 10 [*]min intervals. Results were analysed by analysis of variance. <b>Spiradoline</b> showed a significant (P< 0. 05) dose-dependent increase in free water clearance, as predicted for a κ-opioid agonist.

There were no significant drug-related changes in plasma catecholamines, blood pressure, pulse or psychological variables.

Cross-sensitization has been observed between drugs from different pharmacological classes and may play a role in the escalation of drug use in polydrug-abusing populations. The purpose of this study was to examine cross-sensitization between opioids and cocaine and to determine the extent to which cross-sensitization is mediated by an opioid's selectivity for μ, κ, and δ receptors. Separate groups of rats were treated with opioid receptor agonists and antagonists every other day for 10 days, and the locomotor effects of cocaine were tested 8 days later. The μ agonists, morphine and buprenorphine, and the δ agonist, BW 373 U 86 [(±) - 4 -[(R*) -[(2 S*, 5 R*) - 2, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -(2 -propenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]-(3 -hydroxyphenyl) methyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide hydrochloride], produced cross-sensitization to cocaine, such that repeated administration of these drugs over a 10 -day period significantly enhanced cocaine's locomotor effects when tested later. Coadministration of the opioid antagonist naltrexone prevented morphine and buprenorphine from producing cross-sensitization. Coadministration of naltrexone, but not the δ antagonist naltrindole, also prevented BW 373 U 86 from producing cross-sensitization. The κ agonist <b>spiradoline</b> failed to produce cross-sensitization, but coadministration of <b>spiradoline</b> prevented morphine and buprenorphine from producing cross-sensitization. The ability of <b>spiradoline</b> to block cross-sensitization was itself blocked by the κ antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. The mixed μ/κ opioids butorphanol, nalbuphine, and nalorphine did not produce cross-sensitization under any condition examined.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a system to control G protein signaling in vivo to regulate {{a broad range of}} physiologic responses. Our system utilizes G protein-coupled peptide receptors engineered to respond exclusively to synthetic small molecule ligands and not to their natural ligand(s). These engineered receptors are designated RASSLs (receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand). We have made two prototype RASSLs that are based on the human κ opioid receptor. Small molecule drugs that activate the κ receptor are nonaddictive and safe to administer in vivo. Binding and signaling assays reveal 200 – 2000 -fold reductions in the ability of our RASSLs to bind or be activated by dynorphin, an endogenous peptide ligand of the κ opioid receptor. In a high-throughput signaling assay, these prototype RASSLs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary K 1 cells showed little or no response to a panel of 21 opioid peptides but still signaled normally in response to small molecule drugs such as <b>spiradoline.</b> Activation of a RASSL by <b>spiradoline</b> also caused proliferation of rat- 1 a tissue culture cells.

The potential in vivo applications for RASSLs include the positive enrichment of transfected cells and the development of new animal models of disease...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{administration}} of many addictive drugs {{leads to a}} progressive increase in their locomotor effects. This increase in locomotor activity often develops concomitantly with increases in their positive-reinforcing effects, which are believed {{to contribute to the}} etiology of substance use disorders. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine changes in sensitivity to the locomotor effects of opioids after their repeated administration and to determine the role of μ and κ receptors in mediating these effects. Separate groups of rats were treated with opioid receptor agonists and antagonists every other day for 10 days, and changes in locomotor activity were measured. Repeated {{administration of}} the μ agonists, morphine and buprenorphine, produced a progressive increase in locomotor activity during the treatment period, and this effect was blocked by coadministration of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. The κ agonist <b>spiradoline</b> decreased locomotor activity when administered alone and blocked the progressive increase in locomotor activity produced by morphine. The ability of <b>spiradoline</b> to block morphine-induced increases in locomotor activity was itself blocked by pretreatment with the κ antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. Repeated administration of high doses, but not low or moderate doses, of the mixed μ/κ agonists butorphanol, nalbuphine, and nalorphine produced a progressive increase in locomotor activity during the treatment period. Doses of butorphanol, nalbuphine, and nalorphine that failed to produce a progressive increase in locomotor activity when administered alone did so when subjects were pretreated with nor-binaltorphimine. These findings suggest that μ and κ receptors have functionally opposing effects on opioid-mediated locomotor activity and sensitization-related processes...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{characterize}} {{the effects of}} circadian rhythm, feeding time, age, general anesthesia, and ocular hypotensive compounds on intraocular pressure (IOP) of the Tibetan monkey (Macaca thibetana). Methods: Tibetan monkeys were trained for IOP measurement with the TonoVet ® rebound tonometer without sedation or anesthesia. Their circadian IOP fluctuation was monitored every 3 h. Effects of changing the feeding time, general anesthesia, age (2 – 3 year-old versus 8 – 15 year-old animals), and various pharmacological agents, such as travoprost, timolol, naphazoline and <b>spiradoline,</b> on IOP were also evaluated. Results: After behavioral training, conscious Tibetan monkeys were receptive to IOP measurement. The lowest and highest IOP values in a circadian cycle were recorded at 3 : 00 AM (19. 8 ± 0. 4 mmHg, mean±SEM, n= 12) and noon (29. 3 ± 0. 9 mmHg), respectively. Changing the feeding time from 11 : 30 AM to 12 : 30 PM lowered the noon IOP to 25. 1 ± 1. 2 mmHg. General anesthesia lowered IOP in these monkeys, while IOP of young and mature animals were similar. Three hours after topical ocular administration, travoprost reduced IOP by 5. 2 ± 0. 6 mmHg (n= 6, p< 0. 001), and timolol reduced IOP by 2. 8 ± 0. 7 mmHg (p< 0. 05). Naphazoline and <b>spiradoline</b> lowered IOP by 4. 8 mmHg and 2. 5 mmHg (both p< 0. 001), respectively, 2 h after drug administration.

The present study expanded these initial tests to include other traditional KOPr agonists, U 50488 H, <b>spiradoline</b> (SPR), and salvinorin A (Sal A), an active constituent of the plant Salvia divinorum. Following acquisition and stabilization of cocaine self-administration, cocaine-produced drug-seeking was measured. This test was conducted {{in a single day}} and comprised an initial phase of self-administration, followed by a phase of extinguished responding. The final phase examined reinstatement of extinguished cocaine self-administration followed by a priming injection of cocaine (20. 0 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (I.

Seven days after ischemia and reperfusion the brains were perfusion-fixed, and hippocampal CA, cells were counted in a blind fashion. In ischemic gerbils that received only vehicle, there was a 78. 9 % loss of CA, neurons compared with sham-occluded gerbils. In contrast, in U 50488 H-treated gerbils, mean cell loss was reduced to 33. 9 % (/K 0. 01 vs. vehicle-treated group).

40|$|Cocaethylene is a psychoactive {{metabolite}} formed {{during the}} combined consumption {{of cocaine and}} ethanol. As this metabolite has many properties in common with cocaine, {{it is conceivable that}} cocaethylene administration may induce the activity of nuclear transcription factors that regulate the expression of late-response genes. Therefore, the temporal induction of FOS-like protein in rat brain was examined following IP administration of 60 mmol/kg cocaethylene. Immunoreactivity for the protein was detectable at 1 h in striatal neurons and had virtually disappeared 6 h after drug treatment. Administration of specific dopaminergic (SCH- 23390; 0. 5 mg/kg) and glutamatergic (MK- 801; 1 mg/kg) receptor antagonists prior to cocaethylene indicated a significant role for dopamine (D 1) and Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor subtypes in mediating the nuclear induction of the aforementioned transcription factor protein. In contrast, no significant effects on FOS-like protein in discrete neurons of the caudate putamen were found when <b>spiradoline</b> (U- 62066), a kappa opioid-receptor agonist, was administered either IP (10 mg/kg) or directly (50 nmol) into the brain parenchyma. In addition, we uncovered a differential sensitivity of Long–Evans rats to the behavioral effects of cocaethylene, with the psychoactive metabolite producing significantly less behavioral activity (e. g., locomotion, rearing, and continuous sniffing) than that produced by cocaine (molar equivalent of 60 mmol/kg cocaethylene). These findings indicate both common and disparate effects of cocaethylene and its parent compound, cocaine, on receptor pathways that regulate target alterations in gene expression and drug-induced motor behavior...|$|E
40|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder {{characterized by}} multiple motor/phonic tics {{and a wide}} spectrum of behavioral problems (e. g., complex tic-like symptoms, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder). TS can be a challenging condition even for the specialists, because of the complexity of the clinical picture and the potential adverse effects of the most commonly prescribed medications. Expert opinions and consensus guidelines on the assessment and treatment of tic disorders have recently been published in Europe and Canada. All pharmacological treatment options are mere symptomatic treatments that alleviate, but do not cure, the tics. We still lack evidence of their effects on the natural long-term course and on the prognosis of TS and how these treatments may influence the natural course of brain development. The most commonly prescribed drugs are dopamine antagonists, such as typical (e. g., haloperidol, pimozide) and atypical neuroleptics (e. g., risperidone, aripiprazole), and α- 2 -adrenoreceptor agonists (e. g., clonidine). However, several studies have investigated the efficacy and tolerability of alternative pharmacological agents that may be efficacious, including the newest atypical antipsychotic agents (e. g., paliperidone, sertindole), tetrabenazine, drugs that modulate acetylcholine (e. g., nicotine) and GABA (e. g., baclofen, levetiracetam), tetrahydrocannabinol, botulinum toxin injections, anticonvulsant drugs (e. g., topiramate, carbamazepine), naloxone, lithium, norepinephrine, steroid 5 α reductase, and other neuroactive agents (buspirone, metoclopramide, phytostigmine, and <b>spiradoline</b> mesylate). As regards nonpharmacological interventions, some of the more recent treatments that have been studied include electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Drug discrimination proce-dures in animals {{have proven to}} be useful models for investi-gating pharmacological mechanisms underlying the subjective effects of drugs in humans. However, surprisingly little informa-tion exists concerning the mechanisms underlying the discrim-inative stimulus (DS) effects of heroin. This study characterized the DS effects of heroin in rhesus monkeys trained to discrim-inate i. v. heroin from saline. In drug substitution experiments, heroin, its metabolites 6 -monoacetylmorphine, morphine, mor-phine- 6 -glucuronide, and morphine- 3 -glucuronide, and the -agonists fentanyl and methadone engendered dose-depen-dent increases in heroin-lever responding, reaching average maximums of 80 % (full substitution) at doses that did not appreciably suppress response rate. In contrast, the -agonist SNC 80, the -agonist <b>spiradoline,</b> and the dopamine uptake blockers/releasers cocaine, methamphetamine, and GBR 12909 did not engender heroin-like DS effects regardless of dose. In antagonism studies, in vivo apparent pA 2 and pKB values for naltrexone combined with heroin, morphine, and 6 -monoacetylmorphine (8. 0 – 8. 7) were comparable with those reported previously for naltrexone antagonism of prototypical -agonists. The results show that the DS effects of heroin are pharmacologically specific and mediated primarily at -opioid receptors. Moreover, the acetylated and glucuronated metab-olites of heroin appear to play significant roles in these effects. Despite previous speculation that morphine- 3 -glucuronide lacks significant opioid activity, it substituted fully for heroin in our study, suggesting that it can exhibit prominent -agonist effects in vivo.

40|$|Although opioids {{have been}} used for centuries in the {{management}} of pain, the opioid receptor family has only recently been cloned, thus allowing detailed studies on opioid receptor mediated signal transduction pathways to be performed. In addition, two novel opioid peptides, endomorphin- 1 and - 2, were identified in 1997, and it is believed that these represent new endogenous u-opioid receptor ligands. This thesis represents a study into opioid receptor mediated increases in Ca 2 + j and provides an investigation into the cellular signaling pathways of endomorphin- 1 and - 2. Activation of the recombinant 6 -opioid receptor expressed in CHO cells (CH 05) by D- Pen 2 ' 5 -enkephalin produced a concentration dependent, pertussis toxin and thapsigargin sensitive increase in Ca 2 + i in whole cell suspensions. Truncation of this receptor by the 37 C-terminal amino acids produced a rightward shift in the concentration response curve for Ca j release. In single adherent CHOu, CHOk (CHO cells expressing recombinant u- or K-opioid receptors respectively) or CH 05 cells, application of fentanyl, <b>spiradoline</b> or D-Pen 2 ' -enkephalin respectively produced an increase in Ca i in some cells. The putative u. -opioid receptor endogenous ligands endomorphin- 1 and endomorphin- 2 bound with high affinity and selectivity to u-opioid receptors from CHOu, and SH-SY 5 Y cells. Endomorphin- 1 and - 2 concentration-dependently inhibited forskolin stimulated cAMP formation in CHOp. and SH-SY 5 Y cells and endomorphin- 1 and - 2 produced an increase in Ca 2 + j in CHOji cells. Prolonged endomorphin- 1 pretreatment desensitized the -opioid receptor in CHO cells, characterized by a reduction in maximal endomorphin- 1 mediated cAMP inhibition, an up-regulation of cAMP formation and was due to receptor - G protein uncoupling. Endomorphin- 1 pre-treatment produced a rapid loss of cell surface receptors from CHOp. cells, which was possibly accompanied by receptor degradation.

CCh in Ca 2 + free buffer increased cAMP and when Ca 2 + was re-introduced to the buffer there was a further increase in cAMP. These studies suggest that SH-SY 5 Y cells express type 1 AC.;The previously characterised SH-SY 5 Y ([3 H]Diprenorphine (DPN) Bmax (an estimate of opioid receptor density) = 98 fmol/mg protein) and NG 108 - 15 ([3 H]DPN Bmax= 280 fmol/mg protein) cells were used as a model system for the study of endogenous mu- and delta- opioid receptors respectively. In SH-SY 5 Y membranes, fentanyl, DAMGO and in NG 108 - 15 membranes, DPDPE, DADLE displaced [3 H]DPN revealing high affinity binding sites. Fentanyl, DAMGO (SH-SY 5 Y) and DPDPE, DADLE (NG 108 - 15) dose dependency inhibited forskolin stimulated cAMP formation with IC 50 values of 18, 202 nM and 0. 8, 0. 5 nM respectively. Maximal inhibition (Imax) in both cell lines with all agonists were relatively constant, 47 - 65 %. The ORL- 1 receptor agonist, nociceptin also inhibited forskolin stimulated cAMP formation in SHSY 5 Y cells with IC 50 and Imax values of 72 nM and 47 % respectively. These studies in SH-SY 5 Y cells, report the regulation by opioid and OR 1 - 1 receptors of type 1 AC.;Endogenous opioid receptors in SH-SY 5 Y and NG 108 - 15 cells were then compared with recombinant receptors expressed in CHO cells. Opioid receptor subtypes (mu-, delta-, and kappa-) bound [3 H]DPN in a dose dependent and saturable manner, (Bmax, range= 35 - 561 fmol/mc protein).
