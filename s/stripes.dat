5|$|Coloration of the {{insignia}} for E-4 through E-9 {{depends upon}} the uniform worn. Black cloth with red or gold embroidered <b>stripes</b> is used on the winter uniforms, while white cloth with black embroidered <b>stripes</b> is used on the summer uniforms, and medium blue cloth with red or gold embroidered <b>stripes</b> is used on the working coverall.|$|E
5|$|Another {{hardware}} quirk produced one of {{the most}} distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display – during loading or saving, moving zigzag <b>stripes</b> appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output, producing the <b>stripes</b> as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag <b>stripes.</b>|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 2017, the Devils {{revealed}} {{their new}} uniforms for the 2017–18 season. Made by Adidas, the new sweaters {{are the first}} major change to the team's look since they replaced green with black. They feature {{the removal of the}} <b>stripes</b> {{on the bottom of the}} sweater, and also thicker sleeve <b>stripes</b> with equal width bands of white and black.|$|E

5|$|One of Ipswich Town's nicknames is The Blues, {{stemming}} from their traditional kit, which is predominantly blue. Since turning professional, Ipswich {{have used a}} number of away colours, including white, orange, red and black vertical <b>stripes,</b> claret and green, cream and black vertical <b>stripes</b> and dark blue and claret.|$|E
5|$|Some prey {{animals such as}} zebra {{are marked}} with high-contrast {{patterns}} which possibly help to confuse their predators, such as lions, during a chase. The bold <b>stripes</b> of a herd of running Zebra have been claimed {{make it difficult for}} predators to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, or to identify individual animals, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Since dazzle patterns (such as the Zebra's <b>stripes)</b> make animals harder to catch when moving, but easier to detect when stationary, there is an evolutionary trade-off between dazzle and camouflage. Another theory is that the zebra's <b>stripes</b> could provide some protection from flies and biting insects.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{played in}} an all blue strip from their {{formation}} until 1884, when they adopted {{a red and}} white halved strip. They assumed the current strip of red and white <b>stripes</b> in the 1887–88 season. Their badge included a ship, {{the upper part of}} the Sunderland coat of arms, a black cat, and a football in front of Sunderland's red and white <b>stripes.</b> In 1977 the badge was changed, but still included the ship, football and the background of red and white <b>stripes.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Allied navies of France and Italy {{essentially}} followed Admiralty camouflage practice. In 1913, American camouflage experiments included a submarine painted in a three-color pattern of broad vertical <b>stripes</b> designed by William Mackay, using white <b>stripes</b> to separate {{green and blue}} <b>stripes.</b> Wilkinson visited the United States to advise the U.S. Navy on ship camouflage. Dazzle schemes were used on merchant ships, naval transports, and smaller warships. Battleships were camouflaged {{in a variety of}} patterns.|$|E
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown <b>stripes</b> on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face <b>stripes.</b> The <b>stripes</b> on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior <b>stripes</b> are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face <b>stripes.</b> The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the light <b>stripe</b> image enhancement algorithms based on image matching. For the linear light <b>stripe,</b> the grayscale {{distribution of the}} normal section {{is used as a}} matching template in <b>stripe</b> image with good quality. For arc light <b>stripe,</b> the light <b>stripe</b> centers are located on the arc, and grayscale distribution of the corresponding point is used as a template in the normal section of <b>stripe</b> image with good quality. In order to verify the effectiveness of the enhancement algorithms, the paper separately proposes two methods to evaluate the consistency of the light <b>stripe</b> centers for the linear light <b>stripe</b> and the arc light <b>stripe.</b> Finally, the experimental results show that the image enhancement algorithms have a certain effect on the improving light <b>stripe</b> images quality.|$|R
5000|$|The ribbon {{consists}} of a red centre band flanked immediately on each side by a white <b>stripe,</b> followed by a grey <b>stripe</b> with a thin red <b>stripe</b> in the centre, then a white band, a thin grey <b>stripe,</b> a thin red <b>stripe</b> and finally, a grey band, in that order.|$|R

5|$|Andover's {{traditional}} {{strip of}} red and black <b>stripes</b> was worn {{for the vast majority}} of their history. This was changed to red and black quarters in 1950 and remained so until 1957 when the club reverted to the traditional <b>stripes.</b> When promotion to the Southern League was gained in 1972, the team's colours were changed, this time to red with a single white stripe. This kit was worn until 1988, when the familiar red and black <b>stripes</b> were re-introduced. For the 2008–09 season, a plain red kit was introduced to commemorate the club's 125th anniversary—this was worn for the first time in the pre-season friendly against Salisbury City. The last away kit worn by the team was yellow and black shirts with white shorts. However, various combinations have been worn in recent years, such as white shirts with blue sleeves and blue shorts, and tangerine shirts with white shorts.|$|E

5|$|During {{their early}} years, West Bromwich Albion {{had played in}} {{whatever}} coloured kit was available locally. However, at a committee meeting held in September 1885, the club decreed that blue and white striped jerseys should be adopted on a permanent basis. With {{the exception of a}} brief trial of scarlet and blue broad <b>stripes</b> early in the 1889–90 season, the team have worn these colours ever since, although initially the blue was of a lighter shade; the navy blue <b>stripes</b> were not introduced until after the First World War.|$|E
