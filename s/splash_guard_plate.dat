5000|$|A shower <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> is a {{permanently}} installed, fixed, rigid fitting made {{of plastic}} or glass that prevent water from a shower from splashing out of the bathtub and onto the floor. [...] Typically, the shower <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> is a small triangular piece of plastic that is used in combination with a shower curtain, to prevent water escaping at the corners, {{but it may be}} a much larger piece that is used by itself.|$|R
50|$|Dealer {{installed}} {{options for}} the third generation Integra included: security system, alloy wheels, trunk mat, <b>splash</b> <b>guards,</b> fog lights, and CD changer.|$|R
50|$|The shower <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> is {{designed}} {{to solve the problem}} of containing water, mostly at the shower head end of the bathtub. Like the shower curtain, it dates back to the early 1900s.|$|R
50|$|An underbone cycle may share its {{fuel tank}} {{position}} and tube framing, along with fitted bodywork and <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> with a scooter while the wheel size, engine position, and power transmission are {{like those of}} conventional motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|SuperFabric is a cut and {{abrasion}} resistant material, and {{a registered}} trademark of Higher Dimension Materials, Inc. As a technical fabric, SuperFabric is created with a base fabric such as nylon, polyester, neoprene, crepe, etc. and is overlaid with tiny, hard <b>guard</b> <b>plates</b> {{in a specific}} pattern. Spacings between the <b>guard</b> <b>plates</b> allow a degree of flexibility, breathability and are small enough to keep most sharp objects from penetrating. This <b>guard</b> <b>plate</b> technology protects the base fabric and contributes to the durability of the material. The geometry, thickness, {{and size of the}} <b>guard</b> <b>plates,</b> as well as the base fabric, vary depending on industry requirements. Customized and optional properties include flame resistance and specialized grip.|$|R
50|$|Generally, shower <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> {{are made}} from plastic and {{function}} as a dam to prevent water from escaping the bathtub and pooling on the floor. These devices are installed to fill the intersecting void between the top ledge of the bathtub and the perpendicular wall.|$|R
25|$|Safer {{cutting fluid}} {{formulations}} provide a resistance to tramp oils, allowing improved filtration separation without removing the base additive package. Room ventilation, <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> on machines, and {{personal protective equipment}} (PPE) (such as safety glasses, respirator masks, and gloves) can mitigate hazards related to cutting fluids.|$|R
50|$|SuperFabric {{materials}} have tiny raised <b>guard</b> <b>plates</b> to deflect sharp objects {{that would otherwise}} tear the underlying base fabric. These <b>guard</b> <b>plates</b> are advertised {{to act as a}} protective barrier contributing to the overall longevity of the material by reducing the likelihood that a sharp object will damage the fibers.|$|R
50|$|Most shower <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> {{designs are}} based on a right triangle, where the 90 degree legs are {{attached}} to the wall and tub ledge. The right triangle design functions well when the bathtub and walls are installed perfectly square with each other. Some extend as much as 4 feet up the wall, and are held in position using adhesive foam tapes or glues.|$|R
5000|$|SuperFabric's {{manufacturer}} {{claims that}} its <b>guard</b> <b>plates</b> provide a flexible armor that resists abrasion and protects the underlying base fabric ...|$|R
50|$|Desert Blue and Alpine White paintwork, Black and Rally Grey seat, {{aluminium}} engine <b>guard</b> <b>plate</b> {{and hand}} protectors with large spoilers.|$|R
50|$|Sun Yellow and Black Silk Gloss paintwork, Granite Grey fork tubes, {{wheels and}} frame, Nürburg Silver swing arm, plastic engine <b>guard</b> <b>plate</b> and high windscreen.|$|R
50|$|Cypriot National <b>Guard</b> <b>plates</b> uses prefix ΕΦ {{followed}} by four digits.President's car {{does not have}} number on its plate, and bears the coat of arms of Cyprus instead.|$|R
50|$|The wood then {{needs to}} be transported to the {{building}} site. It is convenient to have the source of cordwood and construction site nearby. Once a proper foundation has been poured which rises 12-24 inches above ground level with a <b>splash</b> <b>guard,</b> construction of the walls can begin. Temporary shelters {{can be used to}} cover the worksite and cordwood from rain. A post and beam frame supplies this shelter for subsequent cordwood mortaring.|$|R
50|$|Alpine White {{paintwork}} with white/blue/red decals, red {{seat with}} embossed GS logo, white direction indicators, Magnesium painted wheels, plastic engine <b>guard</b> <b>plate,</b> hand protectors with large spoilers, and tinted high windscreen.|$|R
2500|$|In 1944, Piaggio {{engineers}} Renzo Spolti and Vittorio Casini {{designed a}} motorcycle with bodywork fully enclosing the drivetrain and forming a tall <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> at the front. In {{addition to the}} bodywork, the design included handlebar-mounted controls, forced air cooling, wheels of small diameter, and a tall central section {{that had to be}} straddled. [...] Officially known as the MP5 ("Moto Piaggio no. 5"), the prototype was nicknamed [...] "Paperino" [...] (either [...] "duckling" [...] or [...] "Donald Duck" [...] in Italian).|$|R
50|$|An underbone {{motorcycle}} {{is a small}} motorcycle {{built around}} a single tube frame called the underbone. This ‘underbone’ supports the whole vehicle and runs low all across {{the length of the}} motorcycle. There is a similarity in appearance to the scooter, largely due to the fuel tank position, the open-frame design which the fuel tank position allows and the <b>splash</b> <b>guards.</b> However, the entire power train, namely the engine position, power transmission and wheels are based on the design of conventional motorcycles.|$|R
5000|$|Karren {{labelled}} Sterling's <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> as {{arguably the}} worst product {{she had seen}} on the show, saying that in an emergency it {{would prove to be}} an obstacle with assisting a baby in the bath. On Why I Fired Them, Lord Sugar felt that the product was [...] "absolute garbage" [...] and had left the team [...] "dead in the water" [...] the moment it was selected, yet expressed surprise that Amazon had placed an order, let alone a larger one than they did from Phoenix.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{about half}} of all burns were deemed preventable. Burn {{prevention}} programs have significantly decreased rates of serious burns. Preventive measures include: limiting hot water temperatures, smoke alarms, sprinkler systems, proper construction of buildings, and fire-resistant clothing. Experts recommend setting water heaters below 48.8 C. Other measures to prevent scalds include using a thermometer to measure bath water temperatures, and <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> on stoves. While the effect of the regulation of fireworks is unclear, there is tentative evidence of benefit with recommendations including the limitation of the sale of fireworks to children.|$|R
40|$|Liquids, such as juices, milk, {{molten metal}} {{and the like}} are {{concentrated}} by forming uniformly-sized, small droplets in a precision droplet forming assembly and deploying the droplets in free fall downwardly as a central column within an evacuated column with cool walls. A portion of the solvent evaporates. The vapor flows to the wall, condenses, and usually flows down the wall as a film to condensate collector and drain. The vertical column of freely falling droplets enters the <b>splash</b> <b>guard.</b> The condensate can be collected, sent to other towers or recycled...|$|R
25|$|The small tent, {{available}} in either red/white or blue/gray stripes, was less popular {{and thus is}} less often seen today. It consists of {{a single piece of}} heavy canvas, with a strip of vinyl along the bottom acting as a reinforcement and <b>splash</b> <b>guard.</b> It fits over the side-door opening (and has a gap for one leg of the roof rack) as a sort of foyer or vestibule. It's big enough for two adults to stand inside, but little else, and was probably intended as a means of getting {{in and out of the}} camper in cold or wet weather.|$|R
50|$|Corvette Stingray Convertible Atlantic {{concept is}} {{a version of}} 2014 Corvette Stingray Convertible with Blade Silver body colour, carbon flash {{metallic}} front splitter, rocker extensions and rear lower diffuser, fusion gray headlamp housings and hood accents, a sueded-wrapped interior package, Chevrolet accessories parts (19x8.5-inch front and 20x10-inch rear chrome five-spoke wheels, wheel center caps with the Stingray script, under-hood liner with the Stingray logo, carbon flash metallic rear license <b>plate</b> holder, molded <b>splash</b> <b>guards,</b> windscreen mounted behind the seats, custom luggage, premium carpet floor mats, sill plates, embroidered center armrest with the Stingray logo), and six-speed automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|An open-topped turret {{was fitted}} as {{standard}} to the BA-64 series, with a 7.62mm light machine gun mounted on a pintle to the right. The machine gun mount was designed for maximum elevation so it could engage low-flying aircraft or infantry in the upper floors of a building during urban combat. A {{very small number of}} BA-64s were fitted with a 12.7mm heavy machine gun in a larger, open-topped turret. This model included <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> and armoured fillets on the hull roofline. Personal crew weapons, such as hand grenades, were also stored inside the vehicle's hull.|$|R

5000|$|Personal hygiene {{products}} that aid women in urinating while standing up are not new. [...] The GoGirl product {{is based on}} a 20-year-old design by a doctor. It was rebranded and relaunched in January 2009 at the Minnesota State Fair in St. Paul, Minnesota by FemMed, a company based in Minnetonka, Minnesota. [...] It is a vessel made of flexible pink or purple medical-grade silicone with a <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> on one end which the operator presses against her body. It has a spout on the other side, out of which the urine streams by pressure from a woman's natural flow.|$|R
50|$|A few {{minor changes}} {{were made to the}} Model 69A after World War II. The bolt handle was changed from a {{straight}} to a slightly swept-back shape, a grooved trigger was introduced, and the receiver became available with grooves for aftermarket scope mounts. Late in the production run, chromed bolts, trigger guards, and magazine <b>guard</b> <b>plates</b> were introduced.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} of {{a highly}} porous thermal insulation material was measured by two different methods – <b>guarded</b> hot <b>plate</b> method and pulse transient method. The application of different measurement methodologies and interpretation of results enabled to obtain more complex information on the parameters of tested material. Key words: thermal conductivity, <b>guarded</b> hot <b>plate</b> method, pulse transient method, highly porous materials...|$|R
2500|$|D'Ascanio's MP6 {{prototype}} had {{its engine}} mounted beside the rear wheel. [...] The wheel was driven {{directly from the}} transmission, eliminating the drive chain and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit spar frame with stress-bearing steel outer panels. [...] These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design without a centre section {{like that of the}} MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a single sided front suspension, interchangeable front and rear wheels mounted on stub axles, and a spare wheel. Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front <b>splash</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 2015 Corvette Stingray Pacific Design Package is {{inspired}} by West Coast drivers who attend weekend track events. Based on the Z51-equipped Corvette Stingray coupe, with 2LT and 3LT trims, changes include choices of 5 body colours (Torch Red, Black, Arctic White, Blade Silver and Shark Gray), satin black full-length racing stripes, satin black Z51 wheels with red stripe and Stingray center caps, [...] "CFZ" [...] carbon fiber ground effects package and visible carbon fiber roof panel, Carbon Flash rear spoiler, outside mirrors and exterior badges; red brake calipers, Competition Sport Seats in red or black, carbon fiber interior trim, Stingray sill plates and Stingray floor mats; custom <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> and rear license plate frame, indoor car cover (gray).|$|R

50|$|Some gas griddles come {{equipped}} with a flame-failure safety device, but like many pieces of kitchen equipment, griddles can pose a fire hazard if not properly maintained. Care {{needs to be taken}} to keep the griddle and the area around it free of grease buildup. <b>Splash</b> <b>guards</b> {{at the edges of the}} griddle can help prevent grease from escaping to the surrounding workspace, and emptying the grease trough often helps prevent grease overflow. Additionally, because portable griddles are easily moved from one location to another, care must always be used to ensure that there is sufficient clearance between the griddle location and combustible materials. Also, common household griddles should not be located in a place where the heat control of the appliance would be accessible to children and others unfamiliar with the griddle's operation.|$|R

Officially known as the MP5 ("Moto Piaggio no. 5"), the prototype was nicknamed [...] "Paperino" [...] (either [...] "duckling" [...] or [...] "Donald Duck" [...] in Italian).Piaggio was displeased with the MP5, especially the tall central section. He contracted aeronautical engineer Corradino D'Ascanio, to redesign the scooter. [...] D'Ascanio, who had earlier been consulted by Ferdinando Innocenti about scooter design and manufacture, made it immediately known that he hated motorcycles, believing them to be bulky, dirty, and unreliable.|$|R
2500|$|The Huns used {{a type of}} spatha in the Iranic or Sassanid style, with a long, {{straight}} approximately 83cm blade, {{usually with}} a diamond shaped iron <b>guard</b> <b>plate.</b> Swords of this style have been found at sites such as Altlussheim, Szirmabesenyo, Volnikovka, Novo-Ivanovka, and Tsibilium 61. They typically had gold foil hilts, gold sheet scabbards, and scabbard fittings decorated in the polychrome style. The sword was carried in the [...] "Iranian style" [...] attached to a swordbelt, rather than on a baldric.|$|R
