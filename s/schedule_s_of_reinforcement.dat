40|$|College {{students}} chose between reinforcement schedules {{in which}} a key press produced a cartoon video followed by nonreinforcement. The experimenter introduced a demand characteristic by stating a preference for choosing one schedule while indicating that the other schedule was also acceptable. With identical <b>schedules</b> (25 <b>s</b> <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> 5 <b>s</b> <b>of</b> nonreinforcement), compliant choices approached 100 %. When the designated schedule presented a 5 -s reinforcer followed by a 25 -s timeout, participants complied initially, and then chose the other schedule on most trials. The aversiveness of the timeout, combined with the predominantly reinforcing alternative, deterred compliance. Elaborating the instructional context by stating that choosing the designated schedule would “help us with the data analysis” significantly increased compliant choices but did not alter the rise-and-decline pattern found with the simpler instructions. A salient relation between an experimenter’s preference and a scientific benefit thus promotes compliance with demand cues but does not insulate it from attenuation by relatively mild aversive consequences. Demand characteristics are not a uniquely powerful source of behavioral control...|$|R

Its effects in different animal models of anxiety are also variable. The present experiments investigated the effects of buspirone on a fixed interval 60 <b>s</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> (FI). In experiment 1, four doses of buspirone (10, 3. 3, 1. 1 and 0. 3 mg/kg, i. p.) and two doses of chlordiazepoxide (5 and 20 mg/kg, i. p.) were administered to separate groups of rats throughout acquisition of the FI task. In experiment 2, four doses of buspirone (1. 1, 0. 3, 0. 1 and 0. 03 mg/kg, i. p.) and a single dose of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, i. p.) were used. Chlordiazepoxide generally released responding. At higher doses (1. 1 mg/kg and above) buspirone suppressed responding in the later parts of the FI interval. The effects of lower doses were variable but included some response release in the later parts of the FI interval. At no dose did buspirone release responding {{at the beginning of}} the FI interval. The experiments show that buspirone differs qualitatively as well as quantitatively from chlordiazepoxide and that current animal models based on behavioural inhibition may need to be used with considerable care if detection of novel anxiolytics is to be ensured...|$|R

However, operant conditioning techniques {{are not as}} extensively used in this field as they should be, given {{the effectiveness of the}} methodology of the experimental analysis of behavior. In the present study, male C 57 Bl/ 6 mice, widely used as background for transgenic studies, were trained to lever press on discrete-trial fixed-ratio 5 or fixed-interval (11  s or 31  <b>s)</b> <b>schedules</b> <b>of</b> food <b>reinforcement</b> and then exposed to 15 extinction sessions following vehicle or chlordiazepoxide injections (15  mg/kg i. p., administered either prior to all extinction sessions, or prior to the final 10 extinction sessions). Extinction of operant behavior was facilitated by drug administration following training on either schedule, but this facilitation only occurred once a number of extinction sessions had taken place. The extinction process proceeded more rapidly following fixed-interval training. Resistance to extinction was equally high following training with either schedule type, and was reduced by drug administration in both cases. These phenomena were evident in individual cumulative records and in analyses of group data. Results are interpreted in terms of phenomena of operant extinction identified in Skinner's (1938) Behavior of Organisms, and by behavioral momentum theory. These procedures could be used to extend the contribution of operant conditioning to contemporary behavioral neuroscience...|$|R
40|$|Aggression {{is closely}} related to {{impulsive}} behavior both in humans and in animals. To avoid potential negative consequences, aggressive behavior is kept in control by strong inhibitory mechanisms. Failure of these inhibitory mechanisms results in violent behavior. In the present experiments, we investigated whether aggressive behavior is related to impulsive behavior. Furthermore, we investigated if violent behavior can be distinguished from normal aggressive behavior in terms of impulsivity levels. We used rats of the wild-type Groningen strain, rats of this strain differ widely in their level of offensive aggression expressed toward an unfamiliar intruder male, ranging from no aggression at all to very high levels of intense and sometimes violent behavior. Violent behavior was displayed by some of the animals that were given repeated winning experience. We used behavioral performance in an unpredictable operant conditioning paradigm for food reinforcement (variable interval 15) and performance in a differential-reinforcement of low rate (DRL- 60 s) responding as determinants for impulsivity. We predicted that offensive aggression is correlated with behavioral flexibility measured by the VI- 15 procedure and that aggressive behavior is characterized by low behavioral inhibition on the DRL task. In addition we expected that violent animals would be characterized by extremely low levels of behavioral inhibition on the DRL task. We showed that the level of offensive aggression indeed positively correlated with VI- 15 performance. In addition, we showed that behavioral performance on the DRL procedure is similar in low and high aggressive rats. However, violent animals can be dissociated by a lower efficiency of lever pressing on a DRL- 60 <b>s</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Aggr. Behav. 40 : 300 - 308, 2014.

40|$|Six hen's {{preferences}} between 5 -min {{access to}} each of two litter substrates, sand and sawdust, were measured using dependent concurrent VI 60 s VI 60 <b>s</b> <b>schedules</b> <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The obtained preferences were small and idiosyncratic. Demand functions were generated separately {{for each of the}} two substrates by requiring the hens to perform under increasing FR schedules. The demand functions were disorderly, some were linear, some were of mixed elasticity, and others curved upwards. No clear relation between the individual hens' preference and demand measures was found. The overall response rates, running response rates and average post-reinforcement pause durations were atypical compared to previous demand research, possibly due to low levels of reinforcer collection, but were similar for individual subjects in both demand conditions. During the demand assessment, dustbathing took place in a similar proportion of reinforcers for each substrate. During the preference assessment, a greater proportion of dustbathing took place during sand reinforcers. Individual hens did not consistently dustbathe more in their preferred substrate. It was argued that the inconclusive results were a product of the substrates used. The atypical demand functions, response rates and average PRP durations may have been due to behaviour that was not schedule related occurring during key time (i. e., the subjects may have been continuing a dustbathing bout). It is possible, that the two substrates were too similar, and thus the subjects did not have a clear preference for one over the other. In future research preference should be assessed prior to demand, to ensure a clear preference can be obtained, with reinforcers that are qualitatively more different than those used in the present experiment...|$|R

The effect <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> magnitude on response rates inclusive of the postreinforcement pause, however, was less pronounced. Increases in the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> were also found to increase {{the length of the}} postreinforcement pause. Rats in Experiment 2 {{were trained to}} respond on a chained differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate variable-ratio schedule, and were exposed to increasing magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> as in Experiment 1. Response running rates increased in the variable-ratio component but decreased in the other component of the schedule. The results are discussed with reference to incentive accounts <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and the action <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> on the response units generated by the operative contingencies...|$|R
