5|$|The Australians seized {{their good}} fortune and set their fastest time to date with 11.0seconds (s). Having been beaten twice after leading out, the Australians <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> before {{sweeping}} past the Germans and Americans {{in the final}} lap. Australia were again drawn against South Africa in their quarter-final, who had defeated them easily in the heats. This time they equalled the fastest team in the competition over the final 200m, clocking 10.8s to progress to the final, where they faced the Italy. Giuseppe Ogna and Cesare Pinarello {{appeared to be in}} control {{at the start of the}} final lap. They had moved alongside the Australians with one and a half laps to go, but the Australians surprised them at the start of the final lap. The Italians came back to pull level at the start of the back straight, but the Australians held them off and pulled away to win by a length and a half. The Italians lodged a protest for interference but it was dismissed. The Australians finished in a time of 10.8s and Browne later claimed that he was convinced by the performance that they would win the gold medal.|$|E

25|$|I {{have often}} <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and thought just {{how nice it}} would be if you could relive your life based on the {{experience}} gained. For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things. On the two occasions I have tried to do this , I have failed, not because I lack followers, or because of the opposition of opposing bodies, but because of the activities of anarchists and those who are envious of your success and popularity.|$|E

25|$|The {{event was}} held under a one-night tournament format. In the first round, Shamrock was pitted against taekwondo stylist Patrick Smith, who he made short work of by {{throwing}} Smith {{to the mat}} and submitting him with a heel hook. His next opponent would be Brazilian jiu-jitsu exponent and eventual tournament winner Royce Gracie. Shamrock sprawled a takedown attempt and maneuvered on top of Gracie, and then grabbed his ankle and <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> to attempt another heel hook. According to Shamrock, however, his arm had gotten tangled in Gracie's gi, and when Shamrock <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> it pulled Gracie on top of him, which allowed Gracie to secure a choke and submit Shamrock. While the move is often listed as a rear naked choke, Shamrock later stated it to be actually a gi choke, in which Royce would have wrapped the cloth of his gi around Ken's neck. The ending of the fight was also source of controversy because the referee {{did not see the}} tap and ordered the two fighters to continue fighting after Gracie had let go of the hold. Shamrock paused for a few seconds but declined, admitting to the ref that he tapped out and {{that it would not be}} fair for him to continue fighting.|$|E

In fact, I'm starting to speak too much like Darren Gough... In fact, I'm going to get one of Gough's tattoos with three lions and my number underneath...No one can say I'm not English.|$|E

500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E
500|$|By this time, Mutual {{was little}} more than a brand name for certain news and sports {{programming}} provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main Mutual facility in Crystal City, Virginia. In early 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radio, which it began distributing through a deal with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System. A former member of the news team described the end: [...] "Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast ... it just died." [...] The Crystal City facility [...] was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.|$|E
500|$|In February 1927, an {{agreement}} {{was signed by}} five leading Hollywood movie companies: [...] Famous Players-Lasky (soon {{to be part of}} Paramount), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal, First National, and Cecil B. DeMille's small but prestigious Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC). The five studios agreed to collectively select just one provider for sound conversion. The alliance then <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and waited to see what sort of results the forerunners came up with. In May, Warner Bros. sold back its exclusivity rights to ERPI (along with the Fox-Case sublicense) and signed a new royalty contract similar to Fox's for use of Western Electric technology. As Fox and Warners pressed forward with sound cinema in different directions, both technologically and commercially—Fox with newsreels and then scored dramas, Warners with talking features—so did ERPI, which sought to corner the market by signing up the five allied studios.|$|E

500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and thought about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinter {{strongly}} opposed the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War, the United States' 2001 War in Afghanistan, and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. [...] Among his provocative political statements, Pinter called Prime Minister Tony Blair a [...] "deluded idiot" [...] and compared {{the administration of}} President George W. Bush to Nazi Germany. [...] He stated that the United States [...] "was charging towards world domination while the American public and Britain's 'mass-murdering' prime minister <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and watched." [...] He was very active in the antiwar movement in the United Kingdom, speaking at rallies held by the Stop the War Coalition and frequently criticising American aggression, as when he asked rhetorically, in his acceptance speech for the Wilfred Owen Award for Poetry on 18 March 2007: [...] "What would Wilfred Owen make of the invasion of Iraq? A bandit act, an act of blatant state terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the conception of international law." ...|$|E
500|$|According to sportswriter Joseph Durso, [...] "on {{days when}} [...] amazing Mets were, for some reason, amazing, he [...] simply <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> {{and let the}} writers swarm over the heroes of the diamond. On days when the Mets were less than amazing—and there were [...] many more days like that—he stepped into the vacuum and {{diverted}} the writers' attention, and typewriters, to his own flamboyance... the perfect link with the public was formed, and it grew stronger as the team grew zanier". The Mets became {{an alternative to the}} stuffy Yankees that appealed to the younger generation of fans. As the losing continued, a particular fan favorite was [...] "Marvelous" [...] Marv Throneberry, who was a [...] "lightning-rod for disaster" [...] in the 1962 season, striking out to kill rallies, or dropping pop flies and routine throws to first base. During one game, Throneberry hit a massive shot to right, winding up on third base, only to be called out for missing first. Stengel came from the dugout to argue, only to be told that Throneberry had missed second base as well.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the album's release, Manson made {{a series}} of disparaging {{comments}} regarding Interscope and its artistic censorship; as well as its then-CEO Jimmy Iovine, who Manson said [...] "wasn't smart enough to understand what [...] do." [...] He also accused the label of caring more about Vitamin Water [...] than music. Several days after the album's release, Trent Reznor – who, as of 2015, remains friends and business partners with Iovine – called Manson a [...] "dopey clown", and said that [...] "He is a malicious guy and will step on anybodies face to succeed and cross any line of decency." [...] Manson responded by accusing Reznor of professional jealousy, saying: [...] "Since I've known Trent, he's always let his jealousy and bitterness for other people get in the way. I'm not talking about me—I <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and watched him be jealous of Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan {{and a lot of other}} musicians in the past. I just don't find time to do that. I stopped thinking about him a while back." ...|$|E
500|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! {{completed}} recording House of Music in September 1996, and {{the album}} was then mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. House of Music was named after a record store in the band's native Oakland, which had closed several {{years prior to the}} album's release. In an interview for Billboard, Wiggins said, [...] "We title all our albums {{at the end of the}} project. We <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and listened to everything, and it reminded us of this mom-and-pop store around our way in Oakland." [...] "We grew up in a house of music," [...] Wiggins continued, remarking how their father was a blue guitarist and music had a unifying effect on people. According to Billboards Shawnee Smith, the album's title described a varied, complete work distinct from a contemporary music market oversaturated by [...] "retro-soul groups". The cover and booklet photos were taken by photographer William Claxton, who captured Tony! Toni! Toné! dressed in casual and formal, retro clothing. This departure from the more outré wardrobe of the band's past was interpreted by journalist Brandon Ousley as an effort to promote [...] "the elegance of 1960s-era Black America and legendary soul acts to a modern generation".|$|E
500|$|During {{the game}} of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao, the former was {{returning}} from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices. Short did not heed the request, and <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> down to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning. Short discussed the incident extensively after the event, indicating {{that he did not}} think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit had in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device). Initially Short also mentioned the fact that he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations). Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters [...] "ask him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search" [...] while in time trouble and playing a [...] "do-or-die" [...] position, though these details now seem discredited.|$|E
60|$|A sudden thought flashed into Maggie's mind. She {{began to}} see light. She obeyed at once. The two women <b>sat</b> well <b>back</b> {{and out of sight}} of the house. La Belle Nita held the handle of the door in her hand while she spoke, as though to prevent any one entering.|$|R
60|$|She {{was wearing}} a maize-coloured muslin to which the {{sunlight}} gave a sort of transparency, and <b>sat,</b> leaning <b>back,</b> her knees crossed, one hand resting on the knob of her furled sunshade, her face half hidden by her shady hat.

60|$|And {{she turned}} to the impassive, silent figure of her husband. He <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back,</b> with folded arms, and face a little uptilted. His knees were {{straight}} and massive.

500|$|Smith {{says that}} his reply [...] "provoked a flood of rhetoric"; the nationalists evaded his words and, one by one, gave passionate speeches about being [...] "a {{suppressed}} people... denied freedom in their own country" [...] who only wanted to [...] "return home and live normal, peaceful lives". Smith <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and waited for them to finish, then responded {{that there was nothing}} stopping them from going home at any time and living peacefully if they so wished, and that they were in this situation by their own hand. They themselves, he said, had refused the Anglo-Rhodesian accord agreed four years previously, which he said had offered Rhodesian blacks [...] "preferential franchise facilities", and they themselves had chosen to use [...] "unconstitutional means and terrorism in order to overthrow the legal government of our country." [...] The UANC delegates countered by railing against Smith even more strongly than before, repeating their previous arguments and rejecting the right of Britain to negotiate on their behalf. This argument went on for nine and a half hours before the conference broke up, Smith refusing outright to grant diplomatic immunity to the UANC's [...] "terrorist leaders who bear responsibility for... murders and other atrocities". Muzorewa said that he doubted Smith's sincerity in seeking a resolution if he was unwilling to grant such a [...] "very small thing" [...] as immunity to the nationalist leaders. The conference broke up without any agreement or progress having been made.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Relation in Time" [...] (1977) they <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> to back, tied {{together}} by their ponytails for sixteen hours. They then allowed {{the public to}} enter the room {{to see if they}} could use the energy of the public to push their limits even further.|$|E
