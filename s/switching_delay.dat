Commutation time of less than 1 nanosecond can be achieved, with a delay between {{the application of the}} trigger pulse and switching as low as about 30 nanoseconds.

40|$|ICT systems, {{especially}} data centers, {{consume a}} significant amount of energy in our daily life. With the rapidly increasing number and size of data centers, energy management is becoming essential. Thus, it is beneficial if the used energy in data centers can be utilized more efficiently. In this thesis, we analyze the energy-aware performance of queueing systems from the traffic point of view. The focus will be on using queueing theory to model and analyze a single processor in data centers. In data centers, the energy consumed by a processor depends on the processing speed. With higher speed, more energy is consumed, while with lower speed, the performance will be decreased. Thus, we consider the trade-off between the performance and energy consumption of processors. Based on this, we introduce a speed scaling method, which adjusts the processing speed of processors according to the traffic load of the queueing system. We mainly analyze and compare three optimized speed scaling methods, which are static, gated and linear speed scaling. In the gated and linear schemes, there is a <b>switching</b> <b>delay</b> when the processor is switched from the idle state to the busy state. The results demonstrate that the <b>switching</b> <b>delay</b> has a great impact on the optimized trade-off. In our scenario, without <b>switching</b> <b>delay,</b> gated and linear schemes have the same performance, and they are better than the static scheme. With <b>switching</b> <b>delay,</b> however, the linear scheme is always better than the gated scheme. With a long <b>switching</b> <b>delay,</b> even the static scheme can be better.

30|$|The {{cumulative}} delay metric of SORP and DORP introduces <b>switching</b> <b>delay,</b> which is later referred by many other works. <b>Switching</b> <b>delay</b> {{is defined as}} the delay caused by switching among frequency bands. Another consideration is backoff delay that is caused by multi-flow interference within a frequency band. Cumulative delay is the sum of <b>switching</b> <b>delay</b> and backoff delay. DORP adds queuing delay caused by the transmission of other flows on the node to the {{cumulative delay}} calculation. Since SORP and DORP focus on delays, they are suitable for delay-sensitive application. They result in fairly low cumulative delay and smooth cumulative delay change in handling intersecting flows. On the other hand, WHAT metric claims to be able to capture the overall quality of a path to have multiple considerations and to enhance the network throughput. However, WHAT metric requires a tuning parameter in determining the metric value and path selection. This static, predefined tuning parameter would reduce the cognitive learning capability.|$|E
