Coils sold in China and Malaysia were found to produce as much smoke PM2.5 as 75-137 burning cigarettes and formaldehyde emission levels in line with 51 burning cigarettes. Other studies in rats conclude that mosquito coils are not a significant health risk, although some organisms may experience temporary sensory irritation like that caused by smoke from the combustion of organic materials such as logs. In one study, rats were directly exposed to a coil's smoke for six hours a day, five days a week for thirteen weeks. They showed signs of sensory irritation from the high smoke concentration, but there were no adverse effects on other parts of the body. The study concluded that, with normal use, mosquito coils are unlikely to be a health risk.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to {{describe}} the main theoretical findings and research conclusions about obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in the perinatal period.

On the other hand, regarding OCD pathogenesis in this period, there is indirect evidence to suggest the participation of neuroendocrine (e. g. female gonadal steroids and oxytocin) and cognitive behavioural variables (e. g. hyper-responsibility, threat overestimation, and mental control). In terms of research, more empirical studies are needed to contrast these specific vulnerability factors.

In some contexts the intervention is even seen {{as a model for}} future {{military intervention}}s, despite <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlighting</b> circumstances that makes the conflict in Libya unique. This thesis analyses the underlying dynamics that might be able to explain the NATO-coalition’s success in Libya.

This in turn, may have made the regime vulnerable to coercion. Using a case study-approach and a qualitative method, the purpose of this thesis is to give military decision-makers further basis for decision-making in terms of when a similar concept might be effective in the future.   Conclusions drawn from the analysis show that the Libyan armed forces might have been a weakened organisation even before the conflict began, due to elements relating to domestic legitimacy. Further conclusions show that despite the intervention being a coercive failure, the use of aerial denial might have enabled the rebel victory on the ground. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This {{systematic}} {{literature review}} investigated the inter-rater and test–retest reliability of case formulations. We considered {{the reliability of}} case formulations {{across a range of}} theoretical modalities and the general quality of the primary research studies. Methods: A systematic search of five electronic databases was conducted in addition to reference list trawling to find studies that assessed the reliability of case formulation. This yielded 18 studies for review. A methodological quality assessment tool was developed to assess the quality of studies, which informed interpretation of the findings. Results: Results indicated inter-rater reliability mainly ranging from slight (. 1 –. 4) to substantial (. 81 – 1. 0). <b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlighted</b> that training and increased experience led to higher levels of agreement. In general, psychodynamic formulations appeared to generate somewhat increased levels of reliability than cognitive or behavioural formulations; however, these studies also included methods that may have served to inflate reliability, for example, pooling the scores of judges. Only one study investigated the test–retest reliability of case formulations yielding support for the stability of formulations over a 3 -month period.

However, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlight</b> teachers’ difficulties to integrate it in a classroom context.

The purpose of this article is to present links, essentially theoretical, made by researchers between creativity and other 21 st-century skills (e. g., critical thinking, metacognition, and collaboration). We considered that if creativity shares some characteristics with other competencies, it can be possible that, by applying only a teaching-for-creativity approach in classroom, we can also contribute to developing the other “C” as well.

In this retrospective study, we report various neurological complications observed during the last 2 years in patients of dengue fever. Materials and Methods: The patients presenting with neurological complications with positive serology (IgM antibody) for dengue infection were consecutively recruited from the Department of Neurology/Medicine from a tertiary center of Lucknow, India. These patients were subjected to a detailed clinical evaluation, laboratory assessment including blood count, hematocrit, coagulation parameters, biochemical assays, serology for dengue fever, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human immunodeficiency virus and other relevant investigations. Results: Twenty-six patients with neurological complications associated with confirmed dengue infection were observed during the last 2 years. Eighteen of these patients were male. Of the 26 patients, 10 patients were suffering from brachial neuritis, four patients had encephalopathy, three patients were consistent with the diagnosis of Guillain Barre syndrome, three patients had hypokalemic paralysis associated with dengue fever and two patients had acute viral myositis.

40|$|Cocaine {{has been}} a popular illicit drug among drug-using {{pregnant}} women {{over the last three}} decades. Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) has significant effects on children’s development throughout early childhood. Very few human studies, however, report the effects of PCE on adolescent or early-adult devel-opment. As knowledge about early childhood effects in human children was informed by animal studies, this review considers the effects of PCE on behavioral outcomes in adolescent and young adult animals and provides potential guidance for research in human children. Animal models prenatally exposed to cocaine manifest play deficits, decreased social interaction, and increased aggression during competition in ado-lescence and young adulthood. Altered behavioral adaptation after stress exposure, including hormonal response change, is also evident. Attention deficits are reported in adult offspring with PCE, not only in a novel environment, but also in a final task session, indicating effects of PCE on transition and mainte-nance of attention. Animal studies support that PCE effects may extend beyond early childhood and con-tinue to adolescence and adulthood. Additionally, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlight</b> that behavioral changes in off-spring with PCE born without teratogenesis remain latent and reveal themselves during adulthood when animals are under stress conditions. Based on the evi-dence from animal models, well-designed human stud-ies are needed to elucidate the effects of PCE on older human children. Research models that combine beha-vioral measures with stressful challenges may hold potential in discerning a longer term influence of PCE...|$|E
40|$|<b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlight</b> {{similarities}} between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and healthy aging. Indeed, {{the decline in}} older individuals’ ability to create a unified representation of the individual features of an event is thought to arise from a disruption of integration within the episodic buffer of working memory as {{the same way as}} observed in ASD. In both cases, this deficit may result from an abnormal engagement of a frontohippocampal network. The objective of the present study is to identify both cognitive processes and neural substrates associated to the deficit of integration in healthy aging. We studied the capacity of integration and the cognitive processes that might mediate its decline in 72 healthy participants aged 18 - 84 years. We confronted the behavioral data to the changes in brain metabolism associated with the age-related decline in a subgroup of 34 healthy participants aged 20 - 77 years using the resting-state [18 F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18 F-FDG PET). Forward stepwise regression analyses showed that the age-related decline in binding was partially explained by a decline in inhibition and processing speed. PET correlation analyses indicated that metabolism of the medial frontal regions, anterior and middle cingulate cortices is implicated in this phenomenon. These data suggest that executive functions and processing speed may play a crucial rule in the capacity to integrate unified representations in memory in aging. Possible implications are discussed in ASD...|$|E
40|$|The judicialization {{of health}} generates debate in various areas of knowledge, with {{particular}} contri-butions from legal experts, doctors, and policymakers. Because {{of the diversity}} of those involved, several topics are considered. <b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlight</b> positive arguments for the judicialization of health, whereas others defend the need for establishing criteria for or limitations to judicial action. Furthermore, others still report concerns over the possible negative consequences of this process. In order to offer an analysis on this topic, this study provides {{a review of the literature}} and adopts the theoretical instrument by Norman Daniels, who proposes a reflection on the needs for health and the ways in which these needs can be met, the moral importance of health and the inequalities in health to be an injustice. In conclusion, it can be affirmed that some of these studies defended in the Brazilian national debate cannot be sustained in light of the data presented herein. Throughout Norman Daniels’ thoughts on the Theory of Justice in terms of questions of health, it can be deduced that, in the Brazilian debate, there are few conflicts over the moral importance of the topic; in addition, not much is known about the second aspect of the theory, which is the reflection when inequality in health can be considered unjust. It is therefore proposed that Daniels’ theory adds two important points to the national debate. The first involves the need to place health problems within a greater reflection in public policy. The second, which involves the need to establish limits to meeting health demands, fits into a public policy that seeks to better meet the needs of the population, which is not a simple cost-benefit assessment...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, the {{knowledge}} of the marine ecological quality status of an environment is essential and soft-bottom macrobenthos is one of the indicators used. Studies of soft-bottom macrobenthos are time consuming and need expertise for organisms’ identification. Simplifications of these studies are tried and Taxonomic Sufficiency (TS) proposed by Ellis (1985) is one of research axes. For example, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlight</b> that family level identification could be sufficient to identify perturbed area (e. g: Bacci et al., 2009; De-La-Ossa-Carretero et al., 2012; Forde et al., 2013). Nevertheless, identification at species level could be recommended to have more precise information about the existing situation (Ajmal Khan, 2006) or to complete information from others levels (Conde et al., 2013). In Corsican waters where human impacts are less important than in main land waters, we present TS based on STARESO research studies between 2006 and 2012. This work is within the frameworks of the STARE-CAPMED program dedicated to STAtion of Reference and rEsearch on Change of local and global Anthropogenic Pressures on Mediterranean Ecosystem Drifts. After Permanova analysis and Canonical analysis of principal coordinates, eight habitat types have been identified along Corsican coastal water. Their own reference conditions and ecological class boundaries have been evaluated. Those reference conditions and ecological status have been identified for species, genus and family level. A highly significant correlation of calculated values between species and genus levels (R²= 0. 93) has been determined and a significant correlation between species and family level (R²= 0. 75). Genus and family levels have a significant Spearman correlation with species level (p< 0. 05). An application of these reference conditions on the macrobenthos assemblages sampling on 14 stations in spring 2011 and late summer 2012 in Calvi Bay highlights areas with high, good or moderate ecological status.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{patients}} with prostate cancer and their partners experience higher levels of distress. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network defines distress as ‘a multifactorial unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological (cognitive, behavioral, emotional), social, and/or spiritual nature that may interfere with the ability to cope with cancer. ’ Yet, it remains unclear to what extent (1) partners are aware of the distress of the patient and (2) physicians are aware of the distress of patients and partners. This study, supported by the Flemish League against Cancer, aims to examine differences in perceptions between patients, partners and physicians. Methods: 193 patients, 134 partners and 99 physicians of five Flemish hospitals completed a questionnaire on the psychosocial needs and support of men with prostate cancer and their partner. Distress was measured by the Distress Thermometer, i. e. a visual scale measuring ‘the degree of difficulty one experienced during the last week’ on an 11 ‐point Likert scale (0 = completely not difficult, 10 = extremely difficult). Analyses were performed by unpaired t‐tests. Results: The results indicate that the judgments of patients about their own distress (3, 0 / 10) are significantly lower than the amount of distress experienced by the partners (3, 7 / 10). Yet, the judgments by partners of the distress of their man (5, 2 / 10) are significantly higher than the estimations by patients of their own distress (3, 0 / 10). Moreover, physicians significantly underestimate the distress of both patients (1, 2 / 10) and partners (0, 9 / 10). Discussion: First, we conclude that not only patients, but also partners require sufficient attention of professionals in coping with distress. Second, this study shows that physicians not always detect the emotional needs of patients and partners. Yet, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlight</b> the importance of their role in reassuring the patients and partners by offering information and support.

40|$|Background: There is {{a growing}} body of {{research}} highlighting the potential benefits of integrated care as a way of addressing the needs of people with alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems, given the broad range of other issues clients often experience. However, there has been little academic attention on the strategies that treatment systems, agencies and clinicians could implement to facilitate integrated care. Methods: We synthesised the existing evidence on strategies to improve integrated care in an AOD treatment context by conducting a systematic review of the literature. We searched major academic databases for peer-reviewed articles that evaluated strategies that contribute to integrated care in an AOD context between 1990 and 2014. Over 2600 articles were identified, of which 14 met the study inclusion criteria of reporting on an empirical study to evaluate the implementation of integrated care strategies. The types of strategies utilised in included articles were then synthesised. Results: We identified a number of interconnected strategies at the funding, organisational, service delivery and clinical levels. Ensuring that integrated care is included within service specifications of commissioning bodies and is adequately funded was found to be critical in effective integration. Cultivating positive inter-agency relationships underpinned and enabled the implementation of most strategies identified. Staff training in identifying and responding to needs beyond clinicians' primary area of expertise was considered important at a service level. However, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlight</b> the need to move beyond discrete training events and towards longer term coaching-type activities focussed on implementation and capacity building. Sharing of client information (subject to informed consent) was critical for most integrated care strategies. Case-management was found to be a particularly good approach to responding to the needs of clients with multiple and complex needs. At the clinical level, screening in areas beyond a clinician's primary area of practice was a common strategy for facilitating referral and integrated care, as was joint care planning. Conclusion: Despite considerable limitations and gaps in the literature in terms of the evaluation of integrated care strategies, particularly between AOD services, our review highlights several strategies that could be useful at multiple levels. Given the interconnectedness of integrated care strategies identified, implementation of multi-level strategies rather than single strategies is likely to be preferable...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{developmental}} plasticity {{has received}} increasing attention. Specifically, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlighted</b> a possible association between shell shape and growth rates in intertidal gastropods. We use a growth vector model {{to study how}} hypothetical growth processes could underlie developmental plasticity in molluscs. It illustrates that variation in instantaneous shell growth rate can induce variability in allometric curves. Consequently, morphological variation is time-dependent. Basing our model parameters on a study documenting the results of transplants experiments of three gastropods ecomorphs, we reproduce the main aspects {{of the variation in}} size, shape, and growth rates among populations when bred in their own habitat or transplanted to another ecotype habitat. In agreement with empirical results, our simulation shows that a flatter growth profile corresponds to conditions of rapid growth. The model also allows the comparison of allometric slopes using different subdata sets that correspond to static and ontogenetic allometry. Our model highlights that depending on subdata sets, the "main effects" could be attributed to source population or environment. In addition, convergence or divergence of allometric slopes is observed depending on the subdata sets. Although there is evidence that shell shape in gastropods is to some extent growth rate dependent, gaining a general overview of the issue is challenging, in particular because of the scarcity of studies referring to allometry. We argue that the dynamics of development at the "phenotypic level" constitute a non-reducible level of investigation if one seeks to relate the observed amount of phenotypic variation to variability in the underlying factors...|$|R

This data is said to hold {{a large amount of}} valuable knowledge {{that could be used to}} design customer-focused products, a key factor for maintaining market-share. Information overload hinders the search for knowledge and, therefore, it is a challenge for companies to identify what is relevant to analyse. Different approaches based on data mining tools of web-based customer data have been shown to be useful for gaining customer insight. However, this information is not properly factored into the target setting process. Many improvements in modelling the relation between product performance and customer satisfaction during the target setting have been presented. However, these still rely on customer information obtained from traditional gathering techniques such as questionnaires, which do not provide enough valuable and deep customer information; therefore, designers are forced to make assumptions. While <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlight</b> the potential of customer data as an aid to designing future product generations, they do not provide enough details on how such information should be processed to generate valuable information for the designers.   By taking advantage of the generated customer data, this work aims to increase the reliability of the design decisions on product specifications by reducing the existing gap between the customer and the designer world. To do so, customer information from different sources such as surveys and usage data have been combined to model customer satisfaction as a function of design requirements. In this process, customer needs are defined at a detailed level to be able to link customer satisfaction with a clear interface to the design requirements. By means of usage data, customer-product interaction in the customer environment is investigated, and differences between designer assumptions and customer picture are calculated towards the target fulfilment indicator. Results show that the work presented helps designers to set targets towards a higher customer focus, since customer needs and way of using the product become visible in the process. This allows the design team not only to identify differences among customers but also the possibility to detect changes in customer needs. The target fulfilment indicator acts as a feedback channel for continuous product improvement, allowing designers to validate their decisions. Since the voice of the customer drives the process, the presented approaches guide the design team towards the most relevant customer data, thus streamlining the design process in a situation where the amount of information rapidly increases. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of chemical speciation {{has an important}} role in environmental protection since availability, fate and toxicity of a number of potentially toxic elements depend on their chemical form. In particular, thallium has been identified as an environmental significant element, being more toxic to humans than many heavy metals including Hg, Pb and Cd. Thallium can occur in the aqueous phase and sediments in the state of oxidation Tl(I) and Tl(III). Tl(I) is the more thermodynamically stable species under the typical conditions for natural waters. Italian Regulations pose a concentration limit of 2 µg/l for total Tl in groundwater, and do not distinguish among the different Tl species, although <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlight</b> a higher toxicity for Tl(III). Thallium concentrations limits are 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (on a dry basis) in soils for residential and industrial use, respectively. This Thesis is focused on the study of occurrence and oxidation state of thallium in waters and sediments sampled in a watershed impacted by past mining, characterized by high thallium concentrations in orebodies. Thallium concentration and speciation were determined at the Hydro Sciences Laboratory of CNRS of Montpellier (France) by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography coupled with Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). In addition, major ion and trace elements analysis on waters samples were obtained by Ion Chromatography (IC) and ICP-MS at the Department of Earth Sciences of the University of Pisa. Thallium speciation analysis and some trace element abundance were also done at the Institute for Chemistry of OrganoMetallic Compounds (CNR) of Pisa, for a comparison. The results indicate a Tl concentration in the range between 375 and 923 μg/l in acid mine drainages, 9. 11 - 157 μg/l in spring and surface waters, and 58. 6 - 570 μg/g in sediments at the drainages outflow and stream. It was found that in waters thallium occurs mainly in the monovalent form Tl(I), even if in some cases a significant amount of Tl(III) was detected. In particular, Tl(I) characterizes acid mine drainages, while Tl(III) with a maximum concentration of 91. 7 μg/l (up to the 40 % of the total amount) has been measured in surface waters in two different stations along the stream course. This observation poses the question of the possible mechanisms for Tl(I) oxidation processes in these settings. This point requires additional investigations. Satisfactory results for Tl speciation in sediments were not obtained, since {{only a small fraction of}} the total Tl was actually extracted by both DTPA and H 3 PO 4 for speciation analysis. However, despite not quantitative, speciation results seem to indicate the occurrence of Tl(I) and Tl(III) in different amounts in sediments. Possible oxidation reactions involve the role of manganese oxides. Finally, the role of changing the oxygenation state of waters on thallium speciation was preliminary investigated by microcosm experiments on samples consisting of sediment and water. The results indicate that, in both oxic and anoxic conditions, Tl(I) and Tl(III) concentrations increased as a function of incubation time, although Tl(III) presents a slight increase. The observed increase of Tl(I) and Tl(III) concentrations probably indicates the migration of species from sediment to the aqueous phase...|$|E
40|$|A temática da judicialização da saúde gera discussão em várias áreas de conhecimento, com contribuições, em especial, de juristas, médicos e gestores públicos. Pela diversidade dos atores envolvidos, a gama de temas tratados é farta. Algumas teses destacam os argumentos positivos da judicialização da saúde, outras defendem a necessidade de se estabelecerem critérios ou limitações à atuação judicial. Outros estudos, ainda, ressaltam preocupações com as possíveis consequências negativas desse processo. No intuito de fundamentar uma análise sobre o tema, este artigo pretende realizar uma revisão bibliográfica e adota o {{instrumental}} teórico de Norman Daniels, que propõe uma reflexão sobre as necessidades de saúde e o modo como podemos atendê-las, a importância moral da saúde e a desigualdade de saúde considerada como injusta. Conclusivamente, verifica-se que algumas das teses defendidas no debate nacional não se sustentam perante os dados apresentados. A partir do pensamento de Daniels sobre a Teoria de Justiça voltada às questões de saúde, extrai-se do debate brasileiro que não há muitos conflitos quanto à importância moral especial do tema; além disso, há um silêncio quanto ao segundo aspecto da teoria, que se refere à reflexão sobre quando uma desigualdade de saúde pode ser considerada injusta. Propõe-se conclusivamente que a teoria de Daniels acrescente dois importantes pontos ao debate nacional. O primeiro relaciona-se à necessidade de situar os problemas de saúde dentro de uma reflexão maior sobre políticas públicas. E o segundo, quanto à necessidade de que a fixação de limites para o atendimento de demandas de saúde, encaixa-se em uma política pública que vise a melhor atender às necessidades da população, não sendo uma simples avaliação de custo-benefício.  The judicialization {{of health}} generates debate in various areas of knowledge, with particular contributions from legal experts, doctors, and policymakers. Because {{of the diversity}} of those involved, several topics are considered. <b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlight</b> positive arguments for the judicialization of health, whereas others defend the need for establishing criteria for or limitations to judicial action. Furthermore, others still report concerns over the possible negative consequences of this process. In order to offer an analysis on this topic, this study provides {{a review of the literature}} and adopts the theoretical instrument by Norman Daniels, who proposes a reflection on the needs for health and the ways in which these needs can be met, the moral importance of health and the inequalities in health to be an injustice. In conclusion, it can be affirmed that some of these studies defended in the Brazilian national debate cannot be sustained in light of the data presented herein. Throughout Norman Daniels’ thoughts on the Theory of Justice in terms of questions of health, it can be deduced that, in the Brazilian debate, there are few conflicts over the moral importance of the topic; in addition, not much is known about the second aspect of the theory, which is the reflection when inequality in health can be considered unjust. It is therefore proposed that Daniels’ theory adds two important points to the national debate. The first involves the need to place health problems within a greater reflection in public policy. The second, which involves the need to establish limits to meeting health demands, fits into a public policy that seeks to better meet the needs of the population, which is not a simple cost-benefit assessmen...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{developmental}} plasticity {{has received}} increasing attention. Specifically, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> <b>highlighted</b> a possible association between shell shape and growth rates in intertidal gastropods. We use a growth vector model {{to study how}} hypothetical growth processes could underlie developmental plasticity in molluscs. It illustrates that variation in instantaneous shell growth rate can induce variability in allometric curves. Consequently, morphological variation is time-dependent. Basing our model parameters on a study documenting the results of transplants experiments of three gastropods ecomorphs, we reproduce the main aspects {{of the variation in}} size, shape, and growth rates among populations when bred in their own habitat or transplanted to another ecotype habitat. In agreement with empirical results, our simulation shows that a flatter growth profile corresponds to conditions of rapid growth. The model also allows the comparison of allometric slopes using different subdata sets that correspond to static and ontogenetic allometry. Our model highlights that depending on subdata sets, the main effects could be attributed to source population or environment. In addition, convergence or divergence of allometric slopes is observed depending on the subdata sets. Although there is evidence that shell shape in gastropods is to some extent growth rate dependent, gaining a general overview of the issue is challenging, in particular because of the scarcity of studies referring to allometry. We argue that the dynamics of development at the phenotypic level constitute a non-reducible level of investigation if one seeks to relate the observed amount of phenotypic variation to variability in the underlying factors...|$|R
