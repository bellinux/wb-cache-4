2500|$|The {{church is}} one of the finest later works of H.H. Richardson. The simple design gives {{vitality}} via the delicate brick detailing and the laminated truss system. The building is a one-story, simple rectangle with semicircular apse at one end with over-all dimensions of 49' 4" [...] x 100' 0". The walls are of red brick with several subtle patterns, the richest being on the gable end. The semicircular apse continues around the exterior wall {{at the other end of}} the building.

A metal port-cochere extends across the access lane where incoming traffic is processed.

50|$|The {{boundary}} {{wall at the}} eastern end of the house has a low stepped plinth consistent in height with that of the house. Above the plinth there are approximately 12 courses of wall laid in English bond albeit with some evidence of patching and repair. A <b>soldier</b> <b>course</b> of over-fired headers separates the lower (earlier) fabric and the remaining courses that are laid in a variation of Flemish garden wall bond. The eastern end of the wall curves round towards the gated entrance.|$|E
50|$|Monastery Marist Brothers' Monastery is sited above Fernberg Road, {{adjacent}} to the College on the westward downhill slope. The monastery is a symmetrical, two-storeyed timber building clad in chamferboards with encircling verandahs. It is elevated on a tuck-pointed glazed dark brown face-brick base formed in English bond which supports rough-cast rendered masonry verandah columns on three sides. The columns, with a dark brown brick <b>soldier</b> <b>course</b> below moulded capitals, support the hipped terracotta tiled roof which has a pitch break {{at the line of}} the verandah.|$|E
50|$|The fabric {{above and}} below the <b>soldier</b> <b>course</b> on the curve is {{predominantly}} of brick laid in header bond for strength and ease of curved construction. The present gate-way is within a wall of much later brickwork, the gate surmounted by a segmental arched soffit with tiled springing points. The top of the wall is stepped and the capping courses have a tiled finish. The gate is of wrought iron made to fit exactly the arched opening within the 20th century brickwork of the entrance.|$|E

50|$|The core's facade {{addressing}} New Street is symmetrical and employs painted cement-render {{in making}} its various classical motifs. It features twin garage {{doors on the}} ground floor flanked by rendered pilasters. On the first floor these pilasters flank a 1.8 metre wide balcony, the long opening to which is decorated by four tapered ionic columns and a wrought iron balustrade. The name of the building is displayed in raised lettering across the entablature and the date of construction, 1935, is featured in the parapet above. The exposed stretcher bond brickwork to the balcony is tuck pointed, while above the two French windows and single glazed door are <b>soldier</b> <b>courses</b> of glazed brick. Its floor is unpainted concrete. The central single-leaf door has twelve lights, while those either side of it have eight lights in each leaf. All these feature textured and semi-transparent glass, while the rectangular fanlights are clear glass.|$|R

50|$|An {{architectural}} anomaly in {{an otherwise}} rural townscape, the church stands as a very austere composition of four simple architectural forms, each accommodating {{one of the principal}} interior areas of the church: the entry/bell tower; nave; chancel and vestry. The cavity brick wall construction is exceptional and features pale, sandy coloured cavity face bricks, with flush vertical and recessed horizontal mustard coloured mortar joints, skilfully laid in a combination of English bond and Flemish garden wall bond with brick- on-edge and <b>soldier</b> <b>course</b> detailing. All openings feature stepped reveals externally and stepped mitred reveals internally.|$|E

50|$|Alonso de Ojeda {{also took}} part in the battle of Vega Real (also called the battle of Jáquimo), in which, under his command, the Spanish were victorious. An account of the battle written by Father Bartolomé de las Casas states that the native army {{comprised}} ten thousand warriors, while there were only some four hundred Spanish <b>soldiers.</b> Of <b>course</b> it is possible that these figures have been exaggerated. Ojeda returned to Spain in 1496.|$|R
5000|$|The Kelly Brothers and Rowe Building is a {{historic}} warehouse in Huntsville, Alabama. Built in 1928, the façade is nearly free of ornamentation, except for a raised central parapet, with a plaque reading [...] "Kelly Bros. & Rowe", and <b>soldier</b> <b>course</b> brick outlining the building and openings. Originally, the front featured two large warehouse doors, each with an entry door and a multi-pane window towards {{the center of the}} building. The warehouse doors have each been replaced with a twin-pane fixed window and transom, and the multi-pane windows have been replaced with a single pane and transom.|$|E
50|$|The rear (eastern) {{elevation}} of the Bateman Hotel is a plain brick facade resting on a random ashlar limestone base. Perpendicular to the main block on its north end is a three-story 4x3 bay brick wing with one-story covered wood porch. Adjacent to the porch on the north end is a one-story, wood frame enclosed section. Windows in the rear elevation contain 1/1 sash with plain stone sills and <b>soldier</b> <b>course</b> brick lintels. To meet current day building code requirements, a four-story brick, 3x1 bay elevator shaft/stairtower addition has recently been added (part of the tax credit project) {{to the rear of}} the building.|$|E
50|$|Exterior {{walls are}} {{finished}} in a face brick ranging in colour but predominantly red-brown. Brickwork is generally stretcher bond but incorporates header bricks where {{required to make}} sections of curved wall. English garden wall bond {{has been used to}} make the portion of parapet wall above the line of the roof and a <b>soldier</b> <b>course</b> terminates the top of the parapet. Windows are steel framed strip or corner windows. A dynamic asymmetric composition is created by the contrast between different building elements; curved corners are juxtaposed against right angles, horizontal proportions against the verticality of the staircase and carefully composed windows, emphasized by the fine horizontal planes of projecting concrete awnings, highlight the planar qualities of walls.|$|E

As patients seek to avoid the barrage of malpractice reforms and the spoliation of managed care, one of their key refuges-the fiduciary duty of health care professionals-is being assailed from a number of directions. This Article describes these attacks and suggests how best to thwart them...|$|R

In this human-machine interactive system, a systematic design and mechatronic approach {{is used to}} construct the overall system structure. The Kinect detects soldiers’ positions and postures, situating them in interactive combat <b>soldier</b> training <b>courses.</b> Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method...|$|R
50|$|The Fallen is a 2004 American-German-Italian war film {{directed}} by Ari Taub. The World War II film depicts {{the confusion of}} both sides in wartime Italy. The film portrays partisans and regular <b>soldiers</b> ineffectively <b>coursing</b> through the difficult mountainous terrain. The suggestive dialogue is seen with a minute portrayal of dark humor during combat where both sides are hesitant {{to win over the}} other side due to the chaotic nature of discord, disorganization and the conflicts of war in general.|$|R
