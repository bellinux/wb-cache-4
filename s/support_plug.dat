5000|$|One of the {{revisions}} of the Mwave card was the Mwave Dolphin. The card was an ISA legacy card that did not <b>support</b> <b>plug</b> and play and natively supported Windows through its software. It featured a 28.8k/second fax/modem and a Sound Blaster-compatible audio solution. One of the card's most publicized features was its software upgradeability: {{a version of the}} Mwave software upgraded the modem function to 33.6k. In addition, the card was key in the support of some of the Aptiva's Rapid Resume features, including Wake-up On Ring. There were various consumer complaints with users reporting problems involving either the sound or modem features separately, or using both at the same time. Some consumers were offered a check for the purchase of hardware to replace the Mwave card, while others were offered a replacement modem, sound card or both. At one point, a class action lawsuit was filed; it was finally settled in 2001.|$|E

Dan then meets Clay who he shakes up (throws him in the ocean) and basically tells him not to give up on being an agent. On the eve of Nathan and Haley's departure, Rachel gets Dan to do a live broadcast from the school hallway where he killed Keith. Dan then runs into Jimmy's mom who tells him she {{will never be able to}} forgive him. So instead of reading his script, Dan talks about his life and tells his audience that there is no forgiveness for him, only what comes next. He gives everything that he has to charity as well as divorce papers to Rachel. As he is preparing to leave Tree Hill, Nathan meets up with him to tell him that he's back with the Bobcats, and says thank you. He then says goodbye to Jamie.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} some recent efforts for {{credible}} {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulations in China are reviewed. The most important effort is that, following similar activities in the West such as ECARP and AIAA Drag Prediction Workshops, a series of workshops on credible CFD simulations had been initiated. These workshops were with ambitions to assess the status of CFD in China. Another major effort is an ongoing project to establish a software platform for studying the credibility of CFD solvers and performing credible CFD simulations. The platform, named WiseCFD, was designed to implement a seamless CFD process and to circumvent tedious repeating manual operations. It had also been a powerful job manager for CFD with capabilities to <b>support</b> <b>plug</b> and play (PnP) solver integration as well as distributed or parallel computations.

40|$|The Responsive Space {{initiative}} {{has several}} implications for flight software {{that need to}} be addressed not only within the run-time element, but the development infrastructure and software life-cycle process elements as well. The runtime element must at a minimum <b>support</b> <b>Plug</b> & Play, while the development and process elements need to incorporate methods to quickly generate the needed documentation, code, tests, and all of the artifacts required of flight quality software. Very rapid response times go even further, and imply little or no new software development, requiring instead, using only predeveloped and certified software modules that can be integrated and tested through automated methods. These elements have typically been addressed individually with significant benefits, but it is when they are combined that they can have the greatest impact to Responsive Space. The Flight Software Branch at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center has been developing the runtime, infrastructure and process elements needed for rapid integration with the Core Flight software System (CFS) architecture. The CFS architecture consists of three main components; the core Flight Executive (cFE), the component catalog, and the Integrated Development Environment (DE). This paper will discuss the design of the components, how they facilitate rapid integration, and lessons learned as the architecture is utilized for an upcoming spacecraft...|$|E

But none of these offer features like interoperability and portability that is of very high importance (in certain situations like on the battlefield). It is to provide these features amongst many others, that we consider the Personal Computer (PC) based ultrasound system. This system holds great promise {{for the next generation of}} diagnosis as it can make the ultrasound almost as affordable as a desktop PC. In this thesis, I propose to design and analyze the requirements for a system where hard-wired instruments like the ultrasound interact with the software in a PC instrument. The system should perform predictably i. e., the measurement of accuracy, display of resolution; data processing rates etc. should be consistent and predictable. The system should <b>support</b> <b>Plug</b> & Play (PnP) i. e., different devices are identified and verified by the system during installation. Different components of the system should be interchangeable between different vendors. The system should have the capability to support ultrasound as well as other instruments like Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroretinography (ERG) etc. The ultrasound Graphical User Interface (GUI) should have strong multimedia capabilities as well as the ability to interact with the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) ...|$|E
30|$|Related {{studies are}} {{explained}} in the two perspectives: development of ubiquitous sensor network (USN) simulator and coverage and connectivity of mobile sensor network. First, existing USN simulators focus on the verification of packets, protocol, and the network. Through such a method, a simulation can be run on the network lifetime on some simulators. TOSSIM, an open source TinyOS-based simulator from UC Berkeley, can simulate Mica 2 series simulation from CrossBow. Main features are packet loss calculation and CRC sensing. However, it can only work with Mica 2 series. GloMoSim, a PARSEC (C-based parallel simulation language)-based discrete event simulator, is a simulation environment for wireless mobile network. Like OSI 7 -hierarchical model, GloMoSim is composed of number of layers. It monitors packet transmission status, and verifies network model or transmission scenario; however, it cannot work as sensor network. GloMoSim's next version, QualNet is a massive wireless network simulator. It uses IEEE 802.11 MAC and Physical Layer standard, and like GloMoSim it has several layers. When modules for layer are developed by different designers, the scenarios and models are being tested. Packet flow statistics can be checked through automatically collected data from each layer. Features for sensor network are designed as well; nevertheless, visualization of sensed objects. NS 2 is most widely used network simulator, and many wired and wireless network simulators have been developed based on this system. It is a discrete event simulator, it can simulate various network protocols; however, it has too many nodes and is difficult to adapt to complex massive system. It also has too much unnecessary interdependency. J-Sim is a JAVA-based open source WSN simulator. Each component uses autonomous component architecture, and imitates software with IC chips. It is designed in loosely coupled structure so that is can <b>support</b> <b>plug</b> & play. It can calculate memory usage, number of events, and running time according to size of given network. It also simulates transmission status of transmitted event from target node being transmitted to sink nodes in packet form. Nevertheless J-Sim is difficult to visualize target node sensor. SWANS is an expansion of Jist, a PARSEC-based scattered event simulator. It is an open source simulator, and compared to NS 2 or GloMoSim, it can carry out massive network simulation; nevertheless, like other simulators it can only carry out protocol verification [4, 5].|$|E

40|$|Scheduling is a {{fundamental}} activity in modern shop floors. It is also {{known to be a}} highly complex problem which has motivated several sub-formulations and the subsequent models. Traditional approaches, typically enumerative or heuristic, struggle to contain the computation complexity and often present solutions for restricted cases that feature unrealistic assumptions in respect to the system size, flow of products and the system logistics/behaviour. The multiagent-based architecture presented in this paper is aligned with a set of emerging architectures that seek to explore more heterarchical decision and control models to circumvent the limitations of the traditional approaches. The main distinguishing factor of the proposed architecture is that it directly addresses (re) routing/local scheduling of products in plug and produce systems. It does not make any assumptions on the alignment of the orders and, instead, it dynamically handles the potential rescheduling of the orders already on the system based on the available resources, and their state, in a time efficient way. The architecture was tested under a simulation environment, that is geometrically accurate and that <b>supports</b> <b>plug</b> and produce in runtime, to characterize its performance under dynamic conditions...|$|R

40|$|Radio {{astronomy}} {{has traditionally}} depended on observatories allocating time to observers for exclusive {{use of their}} telescopes. The disadvantage of this scheme is that the data thus collected is rarely used for other astronomy applications, and in many cases, is unsuitable. For example, properly calibrated pulsar search data can, with some reduction, be used for spectral line surveys. A backend that <b>supports</b> <b>plugging</b> in multiple applications to a telescope to perform commensal data analysis will vastly increase the science throughput of the facility. In this paper, we present "SETIBURST," a robotic, commensal, realtime multi-science backend for the 305 m Arecibo Telescope. The system uses the 1. 4 GHz, seven-beam Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver whenever it is operated. SETIBURST currently supports two applications: SERENDIP VI, a SETI spectrometer that is conducting a search for signs of technological life, and ALFABURST, a fast transient search system that is conducting a survey of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Based on the FRB event rate and the expected usage of ALFA, we expect 0 - 5 FRB detections over the coming year. SETIBURST also provides the option of plugging in more applications. We outline the motivation for our instrumentation scheme and the scientific motivation of the two surveys, along with their descriptions and related discussions...|$|R

We have studied different existing control protocols, and developed a new protocol focusing on textbased menus. Our protocol is scaleable, easy to implement, and platform- and media independent. Since our protocol <b>supports</b> <b>Plug</b> and Play with dynamically allocated id’s, {{it does not require}} a unique id in the hardware. To test the protocol we have developed a prototype system, consisting of a mobile phone connected to a server, which in turn is connected to two slave units, controlling peripheral equipment on 220 Volt. The phone is an Ericsson T 28, equipped with a Bluetooth unit. The server is runningthe real-time OS eCos on an ARM 7 TDMI Evaluation Kit, and the slave units consist of two developer boards equipped with PIC-processors. Communication between the phone and the server is done over Bluetooth. However we did not find a working Bluetooth protocol stack ported to eCos, so a serial cable was used instead. Communication between the server and the slaves is done over a RS- 485 serial network which simulates the traffic over a radio-network. The results show that our protocol is working, and that our system would be easy to implement, cheap to produce and very scalable...|$|R
