Eutectoid steels {{present a}} wide range of {{interesting}} mechanical properties (high strength, wear resistance, ductility and toughness) and could be a cheaper alternative to high strength low-alloyed steels (HSLA) in applications where weldability is not a critical requirement. The mechanical properties of pearlite are mainly dictated by the interlamellar spacing and the <b>spheroidization</b> of cementite.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, sub beta-transus static {{annealing}} {{was carried out}} on a (alpha+beta) -warm-rolled (700 degrees C, 90 % thickness reduction) Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy at 900 degrees C for various durations (15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 min). The key observation was that the <b>spheroidization</b> response of the constituent a -colonies from the starting warm-rolled material differs significantly during subsequent (alpha+beta) -annealing treatment. While some of the a -colonies underwent an early morphological conversion from lamellar to equiaxed, some others stayed stable for prolonged durations. This unique phenomenon has been examined, for the first time, from an orientation perspective by coupling slip activation, boundary formation, and interfacial energy anisotropy of individual alpha-colonies with their response to static <b>spheroidization.</b> Orientation of the a colonies {{in reference to the}} loading directions dictate the nature of slip activation (single versus multiple slip; basal or prism slip plus pyramidal `c+a' slip) during prior (alpha+beta) -rolling. During subsequent static (alpha+beta) -annealing, this factor translates into the relative ease of boundary splitting and thermal grooving for them. Formation of longitudinal boundaries, then set the order of <b>spheroidization</b> for diffusion based coarsening processes during long term annealing. Anisotropy in interfacial energy, owing to the loss of coherency during prior deformation (warm -rolling), creates further orientation dependency in the <b>spheroidization</b> sequence. An immediate consequence of this orientation dependent <b>spheroidization</b> response is realized {{in the formation of the}} macro-zones for two-phase Titanium alloys after secondary thermomechanical processing.

Grain boundary etching {{was carried out}} using a water based, picric-acid etchant. Generally, 100 CrMnMoSi 8 - 4 - 6 was harder to etch than 100 Cr 6. Therefore, a precipitation heattreatment was performed {{in order to facilitate}} etching of prior austenite grain boundaries in 100 CrMnMoSi 8 - 4 - 6. The precipitation treatment was found to be effective. However, theprecipitation heat treatment was not suitable for 100 Cr 6 as the grain size increased duringthe precipitation heat treatment. Light optical microscope equipped with a camera was utilized to take micrographs for grainsize evaluation. Jeffries' standard procedure according to ASTM E 112 - 96 was used tomeasure the grain size. The results shows that the austenite grain size increases withtemperature and time as expected. The experimental data was fitted to a well-known graingrowth model. The model only worked for the temperatures investigated and could not bemade to fit different temperatures. Local grain size variation was studied and its influence on fatigue properties was evaluated. The result showed that variation in local grain size can significantly alter the fatigueproperties. The findings are only theoretical and have not been tested practically. Two different <b>spheroidization</b> heat treatments and one homogenization heat treatmentwere performed. Both <b>spheroidization</b> heat treatments investigated exhibited similar grainsize. The homogenization heat treatment reduced the local grain size variation. Homogenization treatment prior to the <b>spheroidization</b> treatments did not increase ordecrease the grain size. The long heating, holding and cooling times in the secondspheroidization heat treatment is probably the reason for the lack of grain refinementcompared to the first <b>spheroidization</b> heat treatment. The grains had time to grow to theinitial austenite grain size during each cycle...|$|E
