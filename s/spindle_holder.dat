40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the development of}} a hydraulic motor driven spindle system to be employed for high speed machining of composite materials and metals. The spindle system is conceived to be easily retrofitted into conventional milling machines. The need for the hydraulic spindle arises because of the limitations placed on conventional electric motor driven spindles by the low cutting power and the presence of vibrational phenomena associated with voltage frequency at high rotational speeds. Also, the electric motors are usually large and expensive when power requirements are moderately high. In contrast, hydraulic motor driven spindles promise a distinct increase in spindle life over the conventional electric motor driven spindles. In this report, existing technologies applicable to <b>spindle</b> <b>holder</b> for severe operating conditions were reviewed, conceptual designs of <b>spindle</b> <b>holder</b> system were developed and evaluated, and a detailed design of an acceptable concept was conducted. Finally, a rapid prototype of the design was produced for design evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Five axis {{micromachining}} has, due to {{many different}} tools and materials, {{a demand for}} a very broad spectrum of revolution speeds. Due to this, several types of tool spindles with varying tool holding systems have to be mounted on the high precision machine tool. With this, severe positioning errors are incorporated. In this work the occurring geometrical positioning errors are analysed and their effects on microcutting are shown. To compensate the errors, different models have been investigated and two promising principles have been established. For a fast tool spindle change a fixed position loading system with very precise <b>spindle</b> <b>holders,</b> without the need to use fine adjustment elements, is proposed. The second alternative is a precision adjustment system using flexures that are frictionless and free from backlash. Here, the spindle is adjusted after every installation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{quality of}} {{machined}} surfaces is significantly influenced by machine vibrations {{caused by the}} cutting process. Whereas most publications ignore {{the influence of the}} tool holder, this paper considers the dynamic behaviour of the whole cutting system consisting of <b>spindle,</b> tool <b>holder,</b> tool and workpiece. Therefore modal and operational vibration analyses were performed to describe the damping and operational characteristics of two competing tool holder technologies, namely heatshrink (HS) and hydraulic expansion (HE). It is shown that HE has higher damping rates than HS. Therefore, HE showed mainly better surface qualities, a 10 % higher productivity and an up to 300 % higher achievable life time of tools...|$|R
40|$|Regenerative chatter is a {{well-known}} machining problem that results in unstable cutting process, poor surface quality and reduced material removal rate. This undesired self-excited vibration problem {{is one of the}} main obstacles in utilizing the total capacity of a machine tool in production. In order to obtain a chatter-free process on a machining center, stability diagrams can be used. Numerically or analytically, constructing the stability lobe diagram for a certain spindleholdertool combination implies knowing the system dynamics at the tool tip; i. e., the point frequency response function (FRF) that relates the dynamic displacement and force at that point. This study presents an analytical method that uses Timoshenko beam theory for calculating the tool point FRF of a given combination by using the receptance coupling and structural modication methods. The objective of the study is two fold. Firstly, it is aimed to develop a reliable mathematical model to predict tool point FRF in a machining center so that chatter stability analysis can be done, and secondly to make use of this model in studying the effects of individual bearing and contact parameters on tool point FRF so that better approaches can be found in predicting contact parameters from experimental measurements. The model can also be used to study the effects of several <b>spindle,</b> <b>holder</b> and tool parameters on chatter stability. In this paper, the mathematical model, as well as the details of obtaining the system component (<b>spindle,</b> <b>holder</b> and tool) dynamics and coupling them to obtain the tool point FRF are given. The model suggested is veried by comparing the natural frequencies of an example spindleholdertool assembly obtained from the model with those obtained from a nite element software...|$|E
40|$|Chatter is an {{important}} problem in machining operations, and can be avoided by utilizing stability diagrams which are generated using frequency response functions (FRF) at the tool tip. In general, tool point FRF is obtained experimentally or analytically for the idle state of the machine. However, during high speed cutting operations, gyroscopic effects and changes of contact stiffness and damping at the interfaces {{as well as the}} changes in the bearing properties may lead to variations in the tool point FRF. Thus, stability diagrams obtained using the idle state FRFs may not provide accurate predictions in such cases. <b>Spindle,</b> <b>holder</b> and tool can be modeled analytically; however variations under operational conditions must be included in order to have accurate predictions. In authors previous works Timoshenko beam model was employed and subassembly FRFs were coupled by using receptance coupling method. In this paper, extension of the model to the prediction of operational FRFs is presented. In order to include the rotational effects on the system dynamics, gyroscopic terms are added to the Timoshenko beam model. Variations of the bearing parameters are included by structural modification techniques. Thus, for various spindle speeds, and holder and tool combinations, the tool point FRFs can be predicted and used in stability diagrams...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} high {{productivity}} and quality {{combined with the}} need for decreasing energy consumption will substantially affect machine tool design in the future. This development is driven by a modification of process chains which is focused on resource conservation. One important contribution for that purpose is the transition towards complete machining. This approach calls for a configuration targeting major process stability as well as a structure geared towards accuracy and dynamism. The compromise between potential dynamism and machine size can be improved by using redundant drives. The realisable effects can reach from the pure increase of machine dynamic parameters to the integration of additional technology options such as micro structuring of surfaces. The advantageous use of redundancy requires the specialization on partitioning of the complete motion. With the presented algorithm the reactive sectioning of a multidimensional motion into two components with different dynamic characteristics succeeds. This provides a useful basis for the application of the principle of dynamic sectioning for a suitable design of drive redundant machine structures. This paper describes models, simulation tools and the method of the development process for redundant kinematics. Furthermore the realisation of such machine tool structures is demonstrated on the basis of complete machining for tool- and die making and an adaptive <b>spindle</b> <b>holder</b> for micro contouring and -structuring...|$|E

The used ribbon is rewound by a take-up spindle forming {{a roll of}} ‘used’ ribbon.

The main benefit of using a one-trip thermal transfer ribbon is that providing the correct settings are applied prior to printing, an 100% density of printed image is guaranteed; compare this with a pre-inked ribbon on a dot matrix impact printer ribbon which gradually fades with usage.|$|R

40|$|The {{material}} {{flow in the}} combined extrusion/forging process is an important phenomenon which controls the mechanical and metallurgical properties of any manufactured component. Collet chuck holder is a tool holding device used in different types of CNC milling machines. The chuck holder is described by a flange at the middle {{to fit into the}} machine, taper portion which is conical shaped area present at the bottom which enters the <b>spindle</b> for changing <b>holder</b> and collet pocket which fits the collet for holding the cutting tool. For manufacturing the tool holder an enormous amount of material is being wasted by the machining process which is almost equal to the volume of the product. Some manufacturer use casting, subsequently by machining to get the final shape. Both the used processes have their limitations as discussed earlier. To secure our material resources and to get better mechanical properties it is proposed to adopt the combined extrusion/forging and/or multi-stage processes for the production of different types of collet chuck holders. In general, it is found challenging to predict the metal flow by 3 D combined extrusion/forging process of complicated sections, collet chuck holder in particular, due to its complexity nature of analysis. From experiments it is observed that the complete process to get the first three components can be assumed to compose of four stages and fourth one of two stages with regard to forward/backward extrusion, forging, die corner filling, and flash formation. The mechanical, microscopic, micro hardness and residual stress analyses are performed for all the four components manufactured under different frictional conditions and ram velocities. The results confirm the advantage of the proposed processes to manufacture collet chuck holder. In the present investigation, upper bound method is used to analyze the combined extrusion/forging process of different types of collet chuck holders. A set of kinematically admissible velocity field is proposed to predict the metal flow pattern and the forging load. This work also employed 3 D finite element formulation to simulate the combined extrusion/forging process for axisymmetric collet chuck holders. The forming loads obtained by proposed upper bound technique is in good agreement with the numerical and experimental results and lies in the range of 0 - 15...|$|R
