40|$|Abstract: In principle, dynamic events (e. g. foreign-object {{impact and}} damage-induced {{acoustic}} emission) in a structure can be monitored by using piezoelectric transducers {{to receive the}} induced wave propagation signals in the structure. However, whether the dynamic events can be correctly identified from the signals depends strongly on signal analysis and interpretation techniques. Conventional techniques use sensor signals in the time domain or frequency domains. They may miss certain important temporal and spectral patterns in a signal that constitute the signatures of the dynamic events and {{are the key to}} their effective and reliable interpretation. Impact monitoring and fault detection methods using piezoelectric transducers and wavelet analysis techniques are being developed in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of South Carolina. In these methods, wave propagation signals are collected using arrays of piezoelectric transducers placed on, or embedded in a structure. The collected signals are analyzed using appropriate wavelet transforms. The final interpretation of the sensor signals is based on signal patterns uncovered by the wavelet transforms in correlation with elastic-wave propagation theory. A number of impact tests have been performed on <b>specimens</b> <b>instrumented</b> with piezoelectric transducers. They include simple steel beams and actual composite aircraft panels. The impact tests are used to illustrate the wavelet analysis technique and show how it permits the interpretation of sensor signals into quantitative descriptions of the dynamic events and/or evaluation of the damage and health status of the host structure. Implications of this research to machinery health monitoring and fault detection will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|In a fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{structure}} designed {{using the}} emerging damage toler-ance and structural health monitoring philosophy, sensors and models that describe crack propagation will enable a structure to operate {{despite the presence}} of damage by fully exploiting the material’s mechanical properties. When applying this concept to different structures, sensor systems and damage types, a combination of damage mechanics, moni-toring technology, and modelling is required. The primary objective {{of this article is to}} dem-onstrate such a combination. This article is divided in three main topics: the damage mechanism (delamination of FRP), the structural health monitoring technology (fibre Bragg gratings to detect delamination), and the finite element method model of the structure that incorporates these concepts into a final and integrated damage-monitoring concept. A novel method for assessing a crack growth/damage event in fibre-reinforced polymer or structural adhesive-bonded structures using embedded fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors is presented by combining conventional measured parameters, such as wavelength shift, with parameters associated with measurement errors, typically ignored by the end-user. Conjointly, a novel model for sensor output prediction (virtual sensor) was developed using this FBG sensor crack monitoring concept and implemented in a finite element method code. The monitoring method was demonstrated and validated using glass fibre double cantilever beam <b>specimens</b> <b>instrumented</b> with an array of FBG sensors embedded in the material and tested using an experimental fracture procedure.

40|$|Fifteen splice {{specimens}} {{reinforced with}} plain steel bars, including three <b>specimens</b> <b>instrumented</b> with both steel and concrete strain gauges, were tested under monotonically applied four-point loading {{to develop a}} database of reliable bond test results {{and contribute to the}} development of a reliability based bond provision for plain steel bars to evaluate historical concrete structures. The maximum applied load for the specimens and their observed failure behaviour are reported. In addition to that, a strain compatibility analysis, average bond stress distribution, and flexural section analysis within the lap splice length of the <b>instrumented</b> <b>specimens</b> are also reported. All of the specimens failed in bond within the lap splice length. The load capacity of two specimens reinforced with plain steel bars was 60 % of the reported load resistance of specimens with identical geometry and reinforced with deformed bars. The CEB-FIP Model Code provisions for average bond stress of plain steel bars underestimated the maximum applied load recorded for the tested specimens by 16 % on average. An empirically derived equation to predict the bond capacity of plain steel bars was determined to be proportional to both the splice length and the nominal bar diameter. Observed cracks in the shear spans remained vertical and suggest the development of arch action within this region. The formation of a large crack at one end of the lap splice length and a review of the load versus deflection behaviour indicated a sudden bond failure of the specimens. Removal of concrete cover at the ends of the lap splice length following testing of the specimens showed evidence of slip of the lapped bars. <b>Instrumented</b> splice <b>specimens</b> provided evidence of bond loss within the lap splice region. As-measured steel strains were higher than those measured for the surrounding concrete due to a loss of strain compatibility. The average bond stress distribution within the lap splice length became more uniform as the applied load approached the maximum applied load.
