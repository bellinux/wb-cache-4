40|$|Aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the study}} of the {{physicochemical}} properties of photocatalytic <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> construction materials with Titania (TiO 2). The work is focused on the production and study of (a) mortars and pastes made of white cement and titania, (b) masonry mortars produced with white cement and titania and (c) restoration mortars produced with lime and titania. Initially, paste and mortar samples of white cement mixed with titania (in powder form) were produced and studied according to standard EN 196. Consequently, paste hydration and evolution of pore size distribution were determined with NMR, SEM and Mercury Porosimetry, while a tribological study on paste surface was also realized. According to the study, titania exhibits a similar behaviour to that of a filler as it improves cohesion and homogeneity of pastes and mortars. However, {{due to the lack of}} hydraulic properties, cement hydration does not benefit from titania, neither do strength development and porosity evolution. It was proven that titania’s hydrophilic properties play a major role on the matter, as TiO 2 particles adsorb water molecules needed for hydration. Because of this, cement grains hydrate with a slower rate when titania is present. In addition, the tribological study revealed the evolution of surfacial roughness, as defined through the hydration process. Moreover, <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> masonry mortars were produced with white cement, lime, sand, perlite and titania. Limited application of titania lead to the creation of mortars with satisfactory properties as defined by standard EN 1015. Titania’s effect was observed in this case as well, yet in a lesser degree. Finally, <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> restoration mortars were produced with lime and titania. Combination of the two materials lead to the creation of improved <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> construction materials, as it was proven that carbonation benefits greatly from the photocatalytic process and in specific from the production of CO 2 due to decomposition of organic pollutants. Hence, the materials produced exhibit <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> properties as well as improved physicochemical characteristics and can contribute greatly in the effective protection both of built heritage and of our environment. ...|$|R

Anatase TiO 2 is used for self-cleaning and rutile TiO 2 for ultraviolet protection. Mud and dye were used as pollutant for <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> test. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was employed for evaluating TiO 2 distribution. Image J was used to calculate area of pollutant and distribution of TiO 2.

FTIR characterizations show absorbance peak at 1080 cm- 1 wave numbers indicating characteristic peaks of PEG. The increase of peaks at around that wave number indicates maximum TiO 2 aggregation. It was found that 2 % TiO 2 with ratio of anatase : rutile 90 : 10 has the minimum peak at that particular wave number.

40|$|Finishing using TiO 2 -nanosol {{treatment}} {{of cellulose acetate}} (CA) fabrics {{before and after the}} latter were pretreated with H 2 O 2 was undertaken with a view to impart unique properties to CA fabrics, notably, self-cleaning. Finishing was performed as per the pad-dry-cure method. The finishing treatment involved dispersing the nano-sized TiO 2 particles in a mixture of water and ethylene glycol (1 : 1) and application of the dispersions to CA fabrics was made under a variety of conditions. <b>Self</b> <b>cleaning</b> ability of the fabrics is favored by 1) increasing the concentration of TiO 2 -nanosol to certain limit; 2) prolongation of curing time up to 15 second; 3) raising the microwave power from 80 % to 100 % but with the certainty that power of 90 % is the most proper. Besides, exposure time-to UV radiation-up to 90 minutes is essential to have remarkable <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> properties while keeping other technical properties, namely, strength, roughness and wettability practically unaltered.
