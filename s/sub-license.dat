25|$|Following the {{continental}} European tradition of author's rights, the law recognized moral and economic (patrimonial) rights. A special {{right of the}} author to remuneration was no longer mentioned: it was not needed anymore since the author's rights were exclusive and authors could freely negotiate contracts. On contracts, the law provided that only the rights explicitly mentioned in a contract were transferred, and that the new rights holder could <b>sub-license</b> these rights to a third party only if the contract explicitly provided for this. Furthermore, contracts {{were not allowed to}} cover the future works of an author.|$|E

25|$|In January 2014, it was {{reported}} that the NFL was planning to <b>sub-license</b> a package of up to eight Thursday Night Football games to another broadcaster for the 2014 NFL season. The league had negotiated with its existing broadcast partners, along with Turner Sports. These eight games were to be simulcast by NFL Network, and reports indicated that ESPN planned to place the games on ABC in the event it won the rights, bringing the NFL back to the network {{for the first time since}} Super Bowl XL and the move of Monday Night Football to ESPN in 2006. The remaining games would remain exclusive to NFL Network, due to carriage contracts with TV providers requiring at least eight NFL games to air exclusively on the channel per-season. The decision came as the league wished to heighten the profile of its Thursday night games, which had suffered from relatively lower viewership and advertising revenue in comparison to other games.|$|E

2500|$|The StarzPlay {{name was}} {{borrowed}} from a prior service offered {{in conjunction with}} Netflix. It was created in 2008 after the subscription streaming service struck an agreement with Starz Entertainment to allow Netflix to <b>sub-license</b> rights to films from distributors that maintain output deals with the linear Starz channel for online viewing – in lieu of acquiring the digital distribution rights on its own, due to the expense of acquiring newer film titles – as Netflix {{is considered to be}} merely a [...] "content aggregator". Because Netflix chose to <b>sub-license</b> digital rights through Starz instead of negotiating with the studios, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures threatened not to renew its output deal with Starz unless it either discontinued its deal with Netflix or paid Disney a licensing fee for digital streaming rights to its films (Netflix ended up assuming rights to most film releases by Walt Disney Studios from Starz in 2016).|$|E
