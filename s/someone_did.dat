5|$|At least 802 prisoners {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp. 144 were successful. The fates of 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If <b>someone</b> <b>did</b> manage to escape, the SS picked ten people at random from the prisoner's block and starved them to death.|$|E
5|$|Laurence succeeded Augustine to the see of Canterbury {{in about}} 604, and ruled {{until his death}} on 2February 619. To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even though that was {{prohibited}} by canon law. Augustine was afraid though that if <b>someone</b> <b>did</b> not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain. However, Laurence never received a pallium from Rome, so {{he may have been}} considered uncanonical by the papacy. Bede makes a point of comparing Augustine's action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter's action of consecrating Clement as Bishop of Rome during Peter's lifetime, which the theologian J. Robert Wright believes may be Bede's way of criticising the practices of the church in his day.|$|E
25|$|When {{actuality}} deviates from capability, because <b>someone</b> <b>did</b> something well {{or something}} badly, an algedonic alert {{is sent to}} management. If corrective action, adoption of a good technique or correction of an error, is not taken {{in a timely manner}} the alert is escalated. Because the criteria are applied in an ordered hierarchy the management itself need not be, but the routine response functions must be ordered to reflect best known heuristic practice. These heuristics are constantly monitored for improvement by the organization's System 4s.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{this time}} Genie's father almost never {{permitted}} {{anyone else to}} leave the house, only allowing his son to go {{to and from school}} and requiring him to prove his identity through various means before entering, and to discourage disobedience he frequently sat in the living room with a shotgun in his lap. He did not allow anyone else in or near the house, and kept his gun nearby in case <b>someone</b> <b>did</b> come. No one in the neighborhood knew about the abuse Genie's father carried out on his family, or was aware that Genie's parents ever had a child besides their son. Throughout this time, Genie's father kept detailed notes chronicling his mistreatment of his family and his efforts to conceal it.|$|E

500|$|Involuntary and {{pathological}} intoxication are affirmative defenses to all criminal offenses in New Jersey, {{but are not}} defenses to regulatory law {{and traffic}} law offenses that are considered strict liability violations (e.g. environmental regulations, DUI). Involuntary intoxication relates to cases where <b>someone</b> <b>did</b> not know that they had consumed alcohol (e.g. a spiked drink). Pathological intoxication is applicable where, for medical reasons, a person had an exaggerated response to alcohol. To {{be used as a}} defense, the person being charged must show that [...] "at the time of his conduct did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, {{that he did not know}} what he was doing was wrong." [...] Contracts made with an intoxicated person may be voided by courts if [...] "the defendant was so intoxicated" [...] that he or she [...] "could not realize and appreciate the nature and consequences of what defendant was doing." ...|$|E

[...] Cameron Matthews of AOL Music commented that the video gives [...] "a kaleidoscopic view" [...] between Derulo's beachfront paradise, an assortment of [...] "edgy suits" [...] and [...] "a little bit of pillow talk with his new 'It Girl'."

500|$|In {{a review}} of the first six episodes, Dan Martin of The Guardian thought that they were strong and it was [...] "generally funnier [...] appears to have rewritten the rule that said Doctor Who had to out-epic itself every year". However, he was {{critical}} of the lack of emotion that had previously inhibited the show, and did not yet empathise with Amy. When reviewing the first eleven episodes, Martin noted that the series had been put at a high expectation due to the quality of Moffat's previous Doctor Who episodes, which may have caused disappointment to those who expected [...] "dark, adult versions of Who every week" [...] as Moffat took more of a fairy-tale approach and his dialogue was [...] "less soapy and more spiky" [...] than that of Davies. Revisiting previous issues, he noted that there was less emotion but [...] "when <b>someone</b> <b>did</b> die ... it ploughed heavy into the heart" [...] and Amy was [...] "a revelation", though she sometimes [...] "felt a little one-note".|$|E

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. <b>Someone</b> <b>did</b> something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I {{could do it in}} a way that also sent a message to the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all it takes is to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ... This is a man with amazing instincts." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{curse of}} Cain and {{the mark of}} Cain are phrases that {{originated}} {{in the story of}} Adam and Eve in the Jewish and Christian Bibles.

2500|$|Charles Saatchi, who {{was best}} known as the most high-profile, high-spending {{collector}} of contemporary British art, bought My Bed (1998) for £150,000 ($248,000) from Lehmann Maupin's [...] "Every Part of Me's Bleeding," [...] the exhibition that won the artist a nomination for the 1999 Turner Prize. In 2013, on the occasion of a Christie's London sale that raised a total of 3.1million pounds ($5million) in aid of the Saatchi Gallery's policy of free entry, To Meet My Past (2002) sold for $778,900, establishing a new record for the artist. At another Christie's auction in 2014, My Bed was sold to White Cube founding director Jay Jopling for 2.5million pounds, including buyer's commission, once again to benefit the Saatchi Gallery's foundation. It was estimated that the price of My Bed would sell between 800,000 and 1.2 million pounds.
