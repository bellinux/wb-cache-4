5000|$|Prices of {{production}} {{is a concept}} in Karl Marx's critique of political economy, defined as [...] "cost-price + average profit". A production price {{can be thought of}} as a type of <b>supply</b> <b>price</b> for products; it refers to the price levels at which newly produced goods and services would have to be sold by the producers, in order to reach a normal, average profit rate on the capital invested to produce the products (not the same as the profit on the turnover).

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of Capital, Volume III, Marx provides a clue to how he thinks the [...] "transformation problem" [...] is solved in reality. He implies {{that it can be}} solved only by examining capital and profit distributions as a dynamic process, rather than statically. His argument is, that what industrial competition really revolves around, is principally the difference between the value of the new commodities produced, and their cost-prices, i.e. the potential surplus-value which can be realized from them. There are constant disparities in space and time between labour-expenditures and capital returns, but also just as constant attempts to overcome or take advantage of those disparities. Thus, unrestricted economic competition has the result that the law of value regulates the trade in newly produced commodities: the ultimate limits of what products will trade for, i.e. their <b>supply</b> <b>price,</b> are set by comparative costs in labour-time.|$|E

50|$|The long-run price {{elasticity}} of supply is quite high. George Fallis (1985) estimates it as 8.2, but in the short run, supply tends to be very price inelastic. <b>Supply</b> <b>price</b> elasticity depends on the elasticity of substitution and supply restrictions. There is significant substitutability, both between land and materials and between labour and materials. In high-value locations, multi-story concrete buildings are typically built {{to reduce the amount}} of expensive land used. As labour costs have increased since the 1950s, new materials and capital-intensive techniques have been employed {{to reduce the amount of}} labour used. However, supply restrictions can significantly affect substitutability. In particular, the lack of supply of skilled labour (and labour union requirements) can constrain the substitution from capital to labour. Land availability can also constrain substitutability if the area of interest is delineated (i.e., the larger the area, the more suppliers of land, and the more substitution that is possible). Land-use controls such as zoning bylaws can also reduce land substitutability.|$|E
