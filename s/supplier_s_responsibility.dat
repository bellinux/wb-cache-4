But, at the same time, his administration suffered from the tensions incident to a changing relationship between the faculty and the dean.

This contrasts with Emmanuel Levinas 2 ̆ 7 s view that the self has an infinite responsibility for the other, a responsibility that derives from the self 2 ̆ 7 s questioning {{of the impact of}} his freedom on others. From a Levinasian perspective, cosmopolitanism 2 ̆ 7 s restriction of the self 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>responsibility</b> for others creates a sphere of rightful indifference {{to the needs of the}} other; lends legitimacy to a disregard of the other; forestalls an ethical awakening to the other; constrains the achievement of a more just global order, given that, from a Levinasian perspective, a better justice is built on the self 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> open-ended <b>responsibility</b> for the other; and points to a tension at the heart of cosmopolitanism, considering the coexistence of elements that both frustrate and aspire to the achievement of global justice.

The sellers who offered the laptop via internet give the description or the picture of laptop and information about laptop, so there is a warranty from the seller towards the trade agreement in the laptop via internet.

Our experimental treatments vary market competitiveness and consumers information on social responsibility in production. We show that irrespective of consumers information SR production reduces monopolistic <b>supplier</b> <b>s</b> profit and is therefore unlikely to emerge. With supplier competition, SR production positively influences consumers buying decisions and suppliers offering SR products achieve significantly higher profits, as long their price is not too high.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{identify}} a novel query type, the top-K assignment query (αTop-K). Consider {{a set of}} objects P {{and a set of}} <b>suppliers</b> <b>S,</b> where each object pi ∈ P must be assigned to one <b>supplier</b> sj ∈ <b>S.</b> Assume that there is a cost cij associated with every object-supplier pair 〈pi, sj〉. The matching with the smallest total cost would assign each object pi to the supplier sj with the minimum cij value. In many scenarios, however, runner-up assignments may be required too, like for example when a decision maker needs to make additional considerations, not captured by cij values. In this case, it is necessary to examine several short-listed assignments before choosing one. This motivates the αTop-K query, which computes the K best assignments, i. e., those achieving the K smallest total costs. Algorithms for the traditional assignment ranking problem could be adapted to process the query, but thei...|$|R

This study examines the determinants and contents of corporate voluntary disclosure of management 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>responsibilities</b> during the five-year period preceding the S-O Act. We predict that the voluntary disclosure of management 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for financial information signals certain incentives and characteristics of the reporting firm that are relevant to financial statement users and regulators.

An empirical analysis of the contents of these assertions also reveals different areas of emphasis and selectivity by management, which represents an informative link to existing disclosure mandates.

The first {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{consensus}} or difference of perceptions among the architects, clients and experts on the functions of architects and clients in analytical design process. The second objective was to examine participation at various stages of programming. A third {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the mission of programming from the perceptions of practicing architects and experts. ^ Procedures. The procedures of the study were: (1) review of literature on programming, and role of architects, clients in programming; (2) design of questionnaire; (3) identification of subjects; (4) interview with practicing architects; (5) data collected from experts and clients; (6) presentation and analysis of data; (7) conclusions and implications. ^ Findings. ^ Statistically. A significant difference was found between the experts, clients and architects on: (1) architect 2 ̆ 7 s advocacy role; (2) client 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>responsibility</b> to provide information in respect of initial budget; (3) client 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>responsibility</b> to clarify user needs, functional requirements, and space relationships; (4) client 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>responsibility</b> to examine architect 2 ̆ 7 s ideas about form, function and economy; (5) who should participate at the six stages of programming viz; goal identification; fact findings; development of concept; needs identifications; problem identifications; and review stage.

Because managers believe that corporate fraud is a growing problem, an important skill for all employees should be the ability to recognize the risk factors that are frequently associated with fraud. A number of instructional cases have been developed {{that focus on the}} problems of employee fraud and unethical management practices. Training materials and professional standards now include more detailed information on the subject of fraud and the auditor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>responsibility,</b> as well as management 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>responsibility,</b> with respect to the detection of fraud. The next logical step is to assess employee training on this topic. In particular, can employees recognize risk factors when they are embedded in an actual instance of misappropriation of assets? We offer a case, based on an actual instance of misappropriation of assets, that may be used as a corporate training assessment technique (CTAT). Since training dollars are an important resource allocation decision, assessment of the training that is provided to employees is essential. Further, since effective teaching produces learning, then evaluation of learning is critical to assessing teaching effectiveness. We also include instructions for using the CTAT, teaching notes, and suggestions for developing additional instructional cases...|$|R

In wholesale electricity markets, we predict that the bid price of the most expensive production unit can change by 1 - 10 % due to price instability. The price instability is reduced when suppliers have more steps in their supply functions for a given production technology. In the limit, as the number of steps increases and the cost uncertainty decreases, the Bayesian equilibrium converges to a pure-strategy NE without price instability, the Supply Function Equilibrium (SFE) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an industry {{where one of}} the manufacturers and its <b>supplier</b> (<b>S)</b> have engaged in some specific investment in the past. We assume that this has three consequences: S has lower expected production costs than other suppliers, supplier-switching costs exist, and the manufacturer may limit its rivals’ access to S. In the case when only S knows its true production costs, we compare alternative mechanisms to induce S to reveal its private information, namely, paying informational rents, using threats of switching suppliers, and most importantly, permitting S to serve other firms. We prove that the presence of asymmetric information mitigates the manufacturer’s incentives to engage in vertical restraints. We derive several policy implications from this result. Adapting to more efficient suppliers, supplier switching costs, sharing suppliers, vertical restraints, asymmetric information...|$|R
