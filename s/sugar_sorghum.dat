40|$|Purpose. To {{assess the}} demand for sorghum seed {{material}} and sufficiency of domestic seeds. Results. The analysis of the State register {{for the period of}} 2002 – 2012 showed that there was the tendency not only towards increasing quantity of sorghum crops in general but their substitution by hybrids of foreign breeding. During the period from 2002 to 2017, 72 sorghum varieties were entered on the State register in total, among them only 12 varieties were of domestic breeding, the rest 60 was presented by foreign breeding institutions. Investigation results allowed to determine that the production of base and prebase seeds of sorghum in 2010 amounted to 1, 3 t, in 2016 was 43 t. During the same period the production of <b>sugar</b> <b>sorghum</b> increased from 0, 2 to 12, 0 t, grass sorghum – from 4, 0 to 83 t. In 2017, requirements of acreage of such crops as grass sorghum and broomcorn were completely satisfied by the amount of grown seeds. At the same time, the need for seeds of sorghum and <b>sugar</b> <b>sorghum</b> can not be covered completely at the expense of domestic varieties reproduction. In 2017, general demand for sorghum seeds was 400, 5 t, among which only 42, 0 t was of domestic production. The rest demand for seeds will be met at the expense of import of foreign breeding seeds into the country to be grown and prepared for sowing abroad. Conclusions. In the Register of plant varieties suitable for dissemination in Ukraine, there are 72 sorghum varieties among them only 12 varieties were of domestic breeding, that is 17 %, as compared to 83 % of recommended great sorghum varieties of foreign breeding. In Ukraine, the area occupied by sorghum cultivation was 22, 8 thou ha in 2005, up to 2017 it increased to 89, 0 thou ha, and accordingly {{the demand for}} seeds run up from 102, 6 to 400, 5 t.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} during germination {{is a major}} {{limiting factor}} affecting growth of <b>sugar</b> <b>sorghum</b> in the Czech Republic. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the ability of stimulated seeds germinate in slightly adverse conditions (less optimal temperatures) and evaluate the impact of biologically active compounds to faster germination of sorghum seeds and next plant growth. Two sorghum seed lots were treated by auxinous preparations Lexin and M Sunagreen. Germination was tested in germination chamber at temperatures 12, 15, 18 and 21 °C in the dark for 14 days. The results confirm stimulation of <b>sugar</b> <b>sorghum</b> seeds and increase of the germination speed at lower temperatures. Top acting biologically active agent (for faster germination) was Lexin. This product has a significant impact on increasing of the seed vigour. In less favorable conditions (12 ° C) application of Lexin increase germination speed of sorghum seeds by a full five days. Shortening of mean germination time was detected after M-Sunagreen application too. 25 cm row spacing on sorghum sugar and 50 cm on the grain sorghum were the best in our experiments.

Other sources include sugar plants such as sugar beet, sugar cane or <b>sugar</b> <b>sorghum.</b> Sugar and starch processing industries also produce large amount of solid residues of starch containing wastewater. The high fiber content of the solid residue makes them a good source for paper and packaging industries. While the carbohydrates rich wastewater are a suitable substrate for production of microbial products. Biological wastes rich in starchy materials are suitable for biosurfactant production. These substrates have been feedstock for production of industrial enzymes and other related chemicals (Maneerat 2005 a, b). One such substrate is potato {{which is one of}} the important staple food and a lucrative cash crop in many countries. Processing of potatoes, results in starch rich waste water, potatoes peels, un- consumable potatoes, which are rich substrates for the microbes. It is estimated that only 59 % of the potato crop are processed into consumable products and most what remains represent a starchy rich wastes which can be difficult to dispose of. Conventional disposal methods include using as an irrigation source, as animal feed, or as a substrate for alcohol production (Fox and Bala 2000; Natu et al. 1991). (Fox and Bala 2000) attempted to produce biosurfactants utilizing potato associated waste. They evaluated potato substrate as a carbon source for biosurfactant production using B. subtilis ATCC 21332. They compared growth, surface activity and carbohydrate utilization of B. subtilis ATCC 21332 on an established potato medium, simulated liquid and solid potato waste media and a commercially prepared potato starch in a mineral salts medium. The results obtained indicated the utilization of potato substrate and production of surfactant as indicated by high surface tension reduction.|$|E
