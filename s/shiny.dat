5|$|Development of <b>Shiny</b> Festa {{began as}} a result of series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami's desire to create a video game that has a lighter feel and makes use of the franchise's songs that had not been featured in video game form. <b>Shiny</b> Festa original releases sold a total of 119,132 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and together ranked as the best-selling video game in Japan that week. The games were described by reviewers as accessible to the franchise's new and existing fans, but the iOS releases were criticized by journalists for their prohibitive pricing. The mechanics of <b>Shiny</b> Festa later reappear in The Idolmaster <b>Shiny</b> TV, a high-definition remastered version for the PlayStation 3.|$|E

5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache <b>shiny</b> objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard <b>shiny</b> objects to impress other ravens. Other {{research}} indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.|$|E
5000|$|Atlas: Atlas {{is a pure}} satin body. Relative {{to other}} fabrics, Atlas is thicker, heavier and is <b>shinier</b> than other fabrics because of the extra use of zari. It {{is also known as}} gilt, because it is even <b>shinier</b> than the katan.|$|R

5|$|Starting on January 3 {{and lasting}} until January 9, 2011, in the United States, players of Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver {{were able to}} visit GameStop stores to {{download}} the special <b>shiny</b> Raikou that was previously given out for Phantom Ruler: Zoroark pre-order ticket holders in Japan. Similar downloads would be available for the <b>shiny</b> Entei (January 17 to 23) and <b>shiny</b> Suicune (January 31 to February 6). All three of these Pokémon still enabled the event for Zoroark in the North American Black and White versions. These three Pokémon were later distributed via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for European, Australian, and North American markets (for a second time) starting February 7 to 13 with Raikou, again, with subsequent staggered releases for Entei and Suicune throughout February.|$|E
5|$|To help {{avoid an}} unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is <b>shiny</b> and refrain from {{splashing}} around too much.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, Banksia aemula {{was one of}} {{the first}} banksias to be {{cultivated}} in England, where it was illustrated in Curtis's Botanical Magazine and its rival, The Botanical Register. Its <b>shiny</b> green leaves, showy flower spikes, huge follicles, and wrinkled bark are attractive horticultural features. It is also a bird- and insect-attracting plant.|$|E
5000|$|External imagesWing length: [...]The face is {{narrower}} and <b>shinier</b> than in Melangyna labiatarum. In males, {{the sides}} of the face are almost parallel and the eyes are very slightly hairy. The thorax is <b>shinier</b> than in M. labiatarum male. See references for determination. [...] The male terminalia are figured by Hippa (1968) [...] ). The larva is undescribed.|$|R

"He {{actually}} went off an’ got his razor, but, o’ course, we jumped out o’ our bunks and got between ’em {{and told him}} plainly {{that it was not}} to be, and then we set ’em down and tried everything we could think of, from butter and linseed oil to cold tea-leaves used as a poultice, and all it did was to make ’em <b>shinier</b> an’ <b>shinier.</b>|$|R
50|$|Silk: More {{expensive}} than plain velvet, this type is usually <b>shinier</b> and softer than the cotton variety.|$|R
5|$|The post-War period saw {{changes in}} the {{production}} of Christmas tree ornaments. <b>Shiny</b> Brite and other ornament companies began mass-producing inexpensive glass ornaments. Bubble lights were introduced during the period, and inexpensive, lit-from-within tree toppers were another option for the tree.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally <b>shiny,</b> highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the tip of}} {{the abdomen}} is a pair of long cerci (paired {{appendages}} on rearmost segment), and in females, the ovipositor is cylindrical, long and narrow, smooth and <b>shiny.</b> The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.|$|E
50|$|Uncirculated coins are vapor blasted after minting, {{giving them}} a matte finish, while bullion coins have a <b>shinier</b> finish.|$|R

50|$|This {{species is}} only known from Taiwan. It {{is similar to}} Strumigenys godeffroyi but is smaller and <b>shinier,</b> with smaller eyes.|$|R
5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the <b>shiny</b> zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies are {{attracted}} to <b>shiny</b> surfaces that produce polarization which they can mistake for water, {{and they have been}} known to aggregate close to polished gravestones, solar panels, automobiles, and other such structures on which they attempt to lay eggs. These can have a local impact on dragonfly populations; methods of reducing the attractiveness of structures such as solar panels are under experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is a <b>shiny</b> grey-white solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.323 g/cm3 and is hard and brittle. It is mostly unreactive at room {{temperature}} but is slowly attacked by hot concentrated sulfuric or nitric acid. Germanium also reacts with molten caustic soda to yield sodium germanate Na2GeO3 and hydrogen gas. It melts at 938°C. Germanium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 2 × 10−2S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.67eV. Liquid germanium is a metallic conductor, with an electrical conductivity {{similar to that of}} liquid mercury.|$|E
50|$|E. prostrata {{is similar}} to Eumorphia sericea, but is shorter, flatter, has shorter heads and rays, and a <b>shinier</b> and {{flattened}} coverage.|$|R
50|$|Austroboletus betula is {{somewhat}} similar in stature {{and also has}} a deeply reticulate stem, but can be distinguished by its smooth, <b>shinier</b> cap and spores with pits.|$|R
50|$|Digital perms {{thermally}} recondition the hair, {{though the}} chemicals and processing {{are similar to}} a straight perm. The hair often feels softer, smoother, and <b>shinier</b> after a digital perm.|$|R
5|$|Hafnium is a <b>shiny,</b> silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, being in the same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
5|$|Laying {{takes place}} in September and October. A clutch {{of four or five}} white and {{slightly}} <b>shiny</b> eggs, measuring 30 x 24mm, is laid. The incubation period has been recorded as anywhere from 19 to 23 days, with the female performing this duty alone. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down, and are largely helpless (nidicolous). They leave the nest four to five weeks after hatching and join up with other young birds in flocks, though rely on their parents for food for another fortnight after fledging.|$|E
5|$|Max Eckhardt's <b>Shiny</b> Brite company {{manufactured}} colorful glass ornaments in {{a variety}} of sizes and shapes through the era. Packed in boxes by the dozen or half dozen, glimpses of the ornaments could be caught through the cellophane windows of the boxes' covers. The reds and greens of the past were supplemented with turquoise, chartreuse, orange, purple, and other vibrant colors.|$|E
5000|$|The wing uppersides are {{uniform light}} blue or purplish-blue, <b>shinier</b> in females than in males, with white fringes. The wing undersides are light gray or white with dull black spots.|$|R
50|$|A xaren is {{slightly}} {{smaller than a}} xorn, with a <b>shinier,</b> metallic hide. While xorn feed on minerals and stone, a xaren prefers enchanted metal, such as magic weapons and armor.|$|R
5|$|The coin {{has been}} counterfeited {{from time to}} time. Various {{techniques}} have also been used to make genuine specimens <b>shinier</b> to deceive collectors, including polishing, a process that damages their surfaces and patina.|$|R
5|$|Metalloids usually {{look like}} metals but behave largely like nonmetals. Physically, they are <b>shiny,</b> brittle solids with {{intermediate}} to relatively good electrical conductivity and the electronic band {{structure of a}} semimetal or semiconductor. Chemically, they mostly behave as (weak) nonmetals, have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values, and amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature.|$|E
5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be <b>shiny,</b> especially when viewed from above. Patterns are designed {{to make it more}} difficult to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied with straight lines.|$|E
5|$|Poison {{was given}} a {{secondary}} outfit for Capcom Fighting All-Stars alongside her primary classic attire. Made of <b>shiny,</b> silvery material it consisted of boots that extended halfway up her thighs and a combined sleeveless shirt/short skirt with a plunging neckline. Gloves and a small hairband were also added, {{as well as a}} belt, with the handcuffs hanging off of it. Her arm straps were removed, though the strap around her neck remained.|$|E
50|$|Compared to cadmium plating, {{nickel plating}} offers a <b>shinier</b> and harder finish, but lower {{corrosion}} resistance, lubricity, and malleability, {{resulting in a}} tendency to crack or flake if the piece is further processed.|$|R
50|$|The coin {{has been}} counterfeited {{from time to}} time. Various {{techniques}} have also been used to make genuine specimens <b>shinier</b> to deceive collectors, including polishing, a process that damages their surfaces and patina.|$|R
50|$|Another {{creature}} {{related to}} the xorn is the xaren. They are slightly smaller with <b>shinier,</b> metallic hides. While xorn feed on minerals and stone, xaren prefer enchanted metal, such as magic weapons and armor.|$|R
