2500|$|Cohen was {{described}} as a Sabbath-observant Jew in an article in The New York Times:Mr. Cohen keeps the Sabbath even while on tour and performed for Israeli troops during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> he square that faith with his continued practice of Zen? [...] "Allen Ginsberg asked me the same question many years ago", he said. [...] "Well, for one thing, in the tradition of Zen that I've practiced, there is no prayerful worship and there is no affirmation of a deity. So theologically there is no challenge to any Jewish belief." [...] In his concert in Ramat Gan, Israel, on September 24, 2009, Cohen spoke Jewish prayers and blessings to the audience in Hebrew. He opened the show with the first sentence of Ma Tovu. At the middle he used Baruch Hashem, and he ended the concert reciting the blessing of Birkat Cohanim.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Deeley, on {{the other}} hand, was quick to defend Cimino's {{comments}} on the nature and motives of the film: [...] "The Deer Hunter wasn't really 'about' Vietnam. It was something very different. It wasn't about drugs or {{the collapse of the}} morale of the soldiers. It was about how individuals respond to pressure: different men reacting quite differently. The film was about three steel workers in extraordinary circumstances. Apocalypse Now is surreal. The Deer Hunter is a parable... Men who fight and lose an unworthy war face some obvious and unpalatable choices. They can blame their leaders.. or they can blame themselves. Self-blame has been a great burden for many war veterans. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> a soldier come to terms with his defeat and yet still retain his self-respect? One way is to present the conquering enemy as so inhuman, and the battle between the good guys (us) and the bad guys (them) so uneven, as to render defeat irrelevant. Inhumanity was the theme of The Deer Hunter's portrayal of the North Vietnamese prison guards forcing American POWs to play Russian roulette. The audience's sympathy with prisoners who (quite understandably) cracked thus completes the chain. Accordingly, some veterans who suffered in that war found the Russian roulette a valid allegory." ...|$|E

6000|$|In the Revue des Deux Mondes, for 1856, tome i., M. Littre {{published}} an article on table-turning and 'rapping spirits'. M. Littre was a savant whom nobody accused of superstition, and France possessed no clearer intellect. Yet his attitude towards the popular marvels of the day, an attitude at once singular and natural, shows how easily the greatest minds can pay themselves with words. A curious reader, in that period of excitement about 'spiritualism,' would turn to the Revue, attracted by M. Littre's name. He would ask: 'Does M. Littre accept the alleged facts; if <b>so,</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> he explain them?' And he would find that this guide of human thought did not, at least, reject the facts; {{that he did not}} (as he well might have done) offer imposture as the general explanation; that he regarded the topic as very obscure, and eminently worthy of study,--and that he pooh-poohed the whole affair! ...|$|E

5000|$|So, {{by working}} on {{materials}} during {{the production process}} the worker both preserves {{the value of the}} material and adds new value to the material.

It is because [...] "Man himself, viewed merely as the physical existence of labor power, is a natural object, a thing, although a living, conscious thing, and labor is the physical manifestation of that power." [...] In order for commodities to be produced with surplus value two things must be true.

5000|$|Adolescence {{was once}} {{believed}} to be a time of stress and turmoil. Although this is sometimes the case, research has shown that most adolescents rate their experiences as enjoyable and that the storm and stress of adolescence actually occurs at a fairly low rate and discontinuously. Nonetheless, adolescence is still a time of significant change and development on all levels (psychological, social and biological). Along with all these changes adolescents are faced with situations in which they must make important choices and decisions. Namely, decisions made regarding risky behaviours become more prevalent at this time. Adolescents are faced with decisions on whether to make an effort to have safe sex and how to react to peer pressure regarding substance abuse for example. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> the personal fable, a form of egocentrism usually considered to be characteristic of adolescence, relate to adolescents’ risk-taking behaviours? ...|$|E
