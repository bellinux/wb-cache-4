25|$|In {{the second}} chapter of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy visit Snape {{at his home}} in Spinner's End. Narcissa's son Draco has been given a {{difficult}} task by Voldemort, and Narcissa swears Snape to an Unbreakable Vow that he will protect Draco, help him complete Voldemort's task, and finish the task himself if Draco fails. When questioned by Bellatrix about his loyalties, Snape <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> working for Voldemort ever since Voldemort's return, and explains his actions in the previous books in that light. He points out that gaining Dumbledore's trust and protection has kept him out of Azkaban and free to operate on Voldemort's behalf.|$|E

Sugar chooses Rory as her date.|$|E
500|$|Hamilton Nolan of Gawker {{described}} the book's design as [...] "featuring a dramatic, action-scene-type cover", {{and called the}} work [...] "a new tell-all book". Star described Blown for Good as an [...] "explosive new book". Pete Samson of The Sun called the book [...] "a revealing account of goings-on within the church". The Flemish daily newspaper published in Belgium, De Standaard, noted the book discusses [...] "remarkable experiences" [...] the author underwent as a Scientology staff member. In a 2010 article in New Humanist, Paul Sims noted, [...] "Since its release {{at the end of}} last year, Blown for Good has made the kind of impact its author hoped. Having built up an online buzz courtesy of Anonymous, and sold thousands of copies in the US, Headley <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> receiving letters and emails from Scientologists, many of whom have said the revelations in his book have confirmed their suspicions about the inner workings of the Church." ...|$|E

500|$|... {{the latest}} update was version 0.43.05, with it {{completing}} 14 years in development despite being an alpha version. Adams {{and his brother}} have a to-do list of features the game should have before version 1.0 and the version number is the percentage progress of its completion. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> able to maintain focus by shifting his attention to {{different aspects of the}} game, given its large coverage. While regular game development aim to perfect their work for release, he considers that a drawback since he continues exploring and learning while adding new features. Wired and Rock, Paper, Shotgun called some of its bug fixes unintentional and funny, with PC Gamer saying it makes an entertaining RSS feed to subscribe to. Adams has two favorite bugs. One is about a farmer dwarf planting his own bed. The other involves a dwarven executioner, with broken arms unable to use his hammer, delivering punishments by biting his victims and tearing off their limbs, keeping one in his mouth for years.|$|E
500|$|Wordplay is a {{key element}} in Wodehouse's writing. This can take the form of puns, such as in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, when Bertie is {{released}} after a night in the police cells, and says that he has [...] "a pinched look" [...] about him. Linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism, such as in Uncle Dynamite when Constable Potter <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> [...] "assaulted by the duck pond." [...] In reply, Sir Aylmer, confusing the two meanings of the word [...] "by", asks: [...] "How the devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond?" [...] Wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour. Some come through exaggeration, such as Bingo Little's infant child who [...] "not only has the aspect of a mass murderer, but that of a mass murderer suffering from an ingrown toenail", or Wooster's complaint that [...] "the rumpuses that Bobbie Wickham is already starting may be amusing to her, but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup." [...] Bertie Wooster's half-forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device. In Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit Bertie asks Jeeves [...] "Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disaster and... what's the word? Something about cats." [...] Jeeves replies, [...] "Cataclysms, sir?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} flag {{is very similar}} to the flag of Australia and the two are often confused. While this is not unique among world flags, it is exacerbated by Australia and New Zealand's close ties and geographic proximity. For instance, in 1984 the Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke was greeted by New Zealand flags when visiting Ottawa, and the former New Zealand prime minister John Key <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> seated under the Australian flag in several international meetings.|$|E

2500|$|Called a [...] "cheerful muse" [...] by New York Magazine, Andre J. {{says his}} {{positive}} {{outlook on life}} has influenced his style: [...] "I want {{people to look at}} me and feel inspired, to feel hope, to smile. I want to surge positive energy in your body, confirm that you too can be yourself." [...] He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> affirmed by strangers telling him that they were glad he was alive, and believe that he were put on the earth [...] "to be a bodhisattva, to just glow, emanate love, respect, peace, pizzazz".|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, {{after the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, {{widespread}} protests {{took place in}} Kuantan over the Lynas refinery and radioactive waste from it. The ore to be processed has very low levels of thorium, and Lynas founder and chief executive Nicholas Curtis said [...] "There is absolutely no risk to public health." [...] T. Jayabalan, a doctor who <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> monitoring and treating patients affected by the Mitsubishi plant, [...] "is wary of Lynas's assurances. The argument that low levels of thorium in the ore make it safer doesn't make sense, he says, because radiation exposure is cumulative." [...] Construction of the facility has been halted until an independent United Nations IAEA panel investigation is completed, which is expected {{by the end of}} June 2011. New restrictions were announced by the Malaysian government in late June.|$|E
2500|$|Since the [...] "repentance broadcasts," [...] Haggard and {{his wife}} have {{traveled}} to churches and appeared on radio and television broadcasts.

[...] The couple has been writing, traveling, and speaking about {{the events of the past}} several years. In November 2009, Haggard began holding prayer meetings in his Colorado Springs basement. One hundred ten people attended the first prayer meeting. By the next meeting, the large number of attendees forced him to move the prayer meeting to his barn. Haggard also <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> named an overseer at a church, someone who counsels and advises church leaders on moral, ethical, and religious issues. In May 2010, Haggard announced he was incorporating a new church for accounting purposes, And by June 2010, Haggard said he would operate a full-blown church.
