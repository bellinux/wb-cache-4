5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as <b>smooth</b> <b>as</b> possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as <b>smooth</b> <b>as</b> possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E

5|$|M.challengeri is {{considered}} {{to have the most}} primitive morphology of any species of Metanephrops, having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species, M.rossensis. Its rostrum is longer than that of other species in the thomsoni species group, and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of Metanephrops, the carapace is <b>smooth,</b> <b>as</b> are the abdominal tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules.|$|E
5|$|Some {{features}} of the accessory glands in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines. In Transandinomys talamancae, {{a single pair of}} preputial glands is present at the penis. As is usual for sigmodontines, there are two pairs of ventral prostate glands and a single pair of anterior and dorsal prostate glands. Part {{of the end of the}} vesicular gland is irregularly folded, not <b>smooth</b> <b>as</b> in most oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse has a {{large and}} robust skull with {{well-developed}} zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region of the skull (between the eyes) is <b>smooth,</b> <b>as</b> in greater big-footed mouse, and lacks the shelves characteristic of the bastard big-footed mouse. The palate is broad and the incisive foramina (openings in the front portion of the palate) are long and broad. In the mandible (lower jaw), {{the root of the}} lower incisor is housed in a distinct capsular process, a protuberance {{at the back of the}} jawbone. The lower masseteric ridge (a crest on the outer side of the mandible) is prominent. As is typical of Macrotarsomys, the molars are cuspidate and low-crowned.|$|E

5|$|The King, {{weakened}} by illness, became progressively less {{active in the}} last years of his reign, devoting an increasing amount of time to prayer, as did his aging mother, who had returned from Poland in 1374. These circumstances allowed Elizabeth to assume a more prominent role at court. Her influence had grown steadily since she had given her husband heirs. It appeared probable that the crowns would pass to one of Elizabeth's underage daughters and by 1374, their rights were confirmed. Behind the scenes, Elizabeth began ensuring that the succession would be as <b>smooth</b> <b>as</b> possible by encouraging a slow but decisive change in the personnel of the government. Warlike and illiterate barons were gradually replaced by a small group of noblemen who excelled in their professional skills but were not distinguished by birth or military ability. Palatine Nicholas I Garai led the movement and enjoyed the full support of the Queen, and their power eventually became virtually unrestricted.|$|E
5|$|In the female, the pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the {{chelicera}} (mouthpart), is serrate, not <b>smooth</b> <b>as</b> in A.gymnuromys. The idiosoma (main {{part of the}} body) is 630 to 670μm {{long and}} 370 to 435μm wide and the dorsal shield (covering the upper side) is 620 to 655μm long and 360 to 370μm wide. The dorsal setae (bristles) are long relative to A.gymnuromys. The sternal shield (on the lower {{side of the body}}) is 115 to 125μm long and 184 to 200μm wide and is more ornamented than in A.gymnuromys. Unlike A.eliurus, A.voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between the lyrifissures (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 on the lower side of the body. The other shields on the lower side of the body are the genitoventral shield (232 to 253 by 170 to 182μm), the peritrematic shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm), and the anal shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm). On the soft part of the cuticle, there are nine pairs of setae. The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks. On the coxae of the third pair of legs, the setae at the back are spur-like.|$|E
5|$|The Sûreté's {{indirect}} {{penetration of}} military affairs involved linking the military intelligence service (SRM) to the Sûreté {{and the information}} provided by it, thereby making itself dependent on the political information and even political judgement and agenda of the civilian authorities. The central SRM then relayed this information to its local branches {{as part of its}} SRM Bulletin. As a result of the uprising, the SRM became more closely linked to the Sûreté and its methodology and philosophy in of analysing Vietnamese anti-colonial activity. It was further resolved to have all officers involved in studying revolutionary parties. The focus widened from observing only internal army activities to include developments among Vietnamese anti-colonial organisations at large. General Aubert cited complacency and laziness as a factor in the ineffectiveness of the officers in implement French intelligence strategy. He further asserted that the flow of intelligence between French officers and Vietnamese warrant officers was not as <b>smooth</b> <b>as</b> desired. He felt that his men were often not tactful and discreet enough; citing a lack of language skills or interest in talking to their Vietnamese colleagues in an attempt to extricate information. Aubert also believed that the Vietnamese troops were effective in hiding their anti-colonial sentiments from their French colleagues.|$|E
40|$|The {{permanent}} income hypothesis {{posits that}} rational agents <b>smooth</b> consumption <b>as</b> transitory income fluctuates. Empirical {{evidence of this}} behavior among the poor has been mixed, but often suggests very limited consumption smoothing tendencies. We contend that much of this evidence pools agents that pursue different smoothing strategies and consequently produce muddled tests of consumption smoothing. In this paper, we use dynamic asset <b>smoothing</b> <b>as</b> a theoretical structure to justify wealth-differentiated smoothing tendencies. We test this theory by allowing the smoothing target to shift from assets and consumption as livestock wealth increases. We find evidence {{for the existence of}} a threshold that divides asset and consumption smoothers and document behavioral differences between these groups that are consistent with asset <b>smoothing</b> <b>as</b> a response to the presence of a dynamic asset threshold. These results suggest that failing to carefully distinguish between asset and consumption smoothers may be responsible for the muddled consumption smoothing evidence common in previous analyses. ...|$|R

25|$|The inside facing of {{the tunnel}} is {{typically}} as <b>smooth</b> <b>as</b> possible, to reduce surface drag and turbulence that could impact {{the accuracy of the}} testing. Even smooth walls induce some drag into the airflow, and so the object being tested is usually kept near the center {{of the tunnel}}, with an empty buffer zone between the object and the tunnel walls. There are correction factors to relate wind tunnel test results to open-air results.|$|E

25|$|Spinning reels {{have two}} types of drag: front or rear. Front drags, which have the {{adjustment}} located on the spool itself, are mechanically simpler, usually more consistent in performance and capable of higher drag forces. Rear drags, with the adjustment screw {{on the back of}} the reel, are more complicated mechanically and usually not as precise or <b>smooth</b> <b>as</b> front drags since the drag itself is often part of the drive shaft and not the spool. They are however, easier to adjust in mid-fight.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{provide some}} {{preliminary}} {{evidence on the}} costs and profitability of relationship lending by commercial banks. Drawing on recent research that has identified loan rate <b>smoothing</b> <b>as</b> a significant element in lending relationships between banks and firms, the authors carry out a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, the authors derive bank-specific measures {{of the extent to}} which the banks in their sample engage in loan rate smoothing for small business borrowers in response to exogenous shocks to their credit risk. In the second stage, the authors estimate cost and (alternative) profit functions to examine how loan rate smoothing affects a banks' costs and profits. On the whole, the authors' evidence says that loan rate smoothing is associated with lower costs and lower profits. These results do not support the hypothesis that loan rate <b>smoothing</b> arises <b>as</b> part of an optimal long-term contract between a bank and its borrower. However, we do find so me limited support for <b>smoothing</b> <b>as</b> part of an optimal contract for small banks early in our sample period. Bank loans...|$|R

25|$|Different atlases {{can give}} rise to, in essence, the same manifold.

These different atlases can be combined into a bigger atlas. It can happen that the transition maps of such a combined atlas are not as <b>smooth</b> <b>as</b> those of the constituent atlases. If Ck atlases can be combined to form a Ck atlas, then they are called compatible.
