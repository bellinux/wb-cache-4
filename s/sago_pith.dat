50|$|Sago starch is {{prepared}} as a gooey and sticky paste by the Bisaya and Kedayan communities called ambuyat, and is called linut by the Melanau. It is eaten by rolling the paste around the prongs of a bamboo fork, and dipped it into soup, sambal, or other varieties of gravies and dipping sauces. Aside {{from being the}} source for <b>sago</b> <b>pith,</b> the sago palm {{is a source of}} another delicacy for the indigenous peoples of Borneo: the sago grub.

50|$|Papeda is {{made from}} sago starch. The Moluccans and Papuans acquire the starch by felling {{the trunk of a}} sago palm tree, cutting it in half, and {{scraping}} the soft inner parts of the trunk, the pith, producing a crude <b>sago</b> <b>pith</b> flour. This flour is then mixed with water and squeezed to leach the starch from the flour. The still moist sago starch is usually stored in a container made of sago palm leaflets, called tumang in which it will keep for several months before spontaneous fermentation will turn it too acidic and unsuitable for making papeda. Depending on the variety and the growing conditions, it may take a sago tree five to fifteen years to accumulate enough starch in its trunk to make the effort of extracting it worthwhile.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSago palm is {{considered}} to be an ideal crop for starch-based sweetener and alcohol fuel feedstock since there is negligible competition between food and fuel in Indonesia and land resources were under-utilized. Starch accumulates in the pith of the sago trunk. Composition of dried <b>sago</b> <b>pith</b> is mainly starch and fiber components. Direct conversion of <b>sago</b> <b>pith</b> into fermentable sugar will reserve the water and save the energy for starch extraction and drying. This research investigated the effects of <b>sago</b> <b>pith</b> pretreatment as heating in water and in dilute sulfuric acid using microwave heating and autoclaving. Liquefaction of starch was conducted using α-amylase on 95 °C, and enzyme consortium between dextrozyme (amyloglucosidase and pullunase), cellulase dan xylanase on 50 °C for saccharification process. Changes on structures were monitored by microscopy examination, and filtrate characteristics. Conversion process which included the pretreatment was carried out by microwave heating in water or in dilute acid, starch, and fiber hydrolysis into fermentable sugar. The results shows that direct heating of <b>sago</b> <b>pith</b> in water by microwave treatment can swell and gelatinize the starch, make the fiber more amorphous and more susceptible for enzyme reaction. Heating in dilute acid directly converted the starch and fiber into depolymerized products and gave more simple sugars (DP of 1. 11 - 2. 56) compared to autoclaved heating of <b>sago</b> <b>pith</b> (DP of 2. 00 - 2. 11).

60|$|Such was {{the fate}} of the poor gentle folk who for unknown ages had swung their hammocks to the stems of these Moriches, {{spinning}} the skin of the young leaves into twine, and making <b>sago</b> from the <b>pith,</b> and thin wine from the sap and fruit, while they warned their children not to touch the nests of the humming-birds, which even till lately swarmed around the lake.

The sea swarmed with shellfish and turtle, and the land with pine- apples; the springs were haunted by countless flocks of flamingoes and horned screamers, pajuis and blue ramiers; and, above all, by humming-birds. But the foolish Chaymas were blind to the mystery and the beauty of the humming-birds, and would not understand how they were no other than the souls of dead Indians, translated into living jewels; and so they killed them in wantonness, and angered 'The Good Spirit.' But one morning, when the Guaraons came by, the Chayma village had sunk deep into the earth, and in its place had risen this lake of pitch. So runs the tale, told some forty years since to M.

40|$|Almost all {{crop and}} {{livestock}} products require {{some form of}} processing after harvest. This maybe in order to extend storage life or to facilitate cooking. Rural based processing offers opportunities in terms of employment, adds value to products, reduces waste due to spoilage and encourages development of technical and marketing skills in villages. Increased processing of agricultural products could result in substantial benefits for national economies. Communities in subsistence economies rely on local - resources and skills to survive. Processing of traditional crops and livestock products into foods, beverages, oils, hides and fibres is well developed and most adults acquire a range of skills from de-husking and grinding cereals, washing cassava or extracting <b>sago</b> (the edible <b>pith</b> extracted from <b>sago</b> palms), to expressing oil from nuts and seeds or rendering animal fat to make tallow. Skins are cured and yarn spun from cotton, wool, goat hair and sisal. These skills are easily and quickly lost {{with the introduction of}} cash economies and the opportunity-to purchase ready-processed products. Centralized large-scale or industrial processing appears to offer economies of scale, uniformity of production and release from physical drudgery. But the cost to small rural communities is high: producers may be too far from a large processing centre to bear the cost of transport; roads may be bad and transport scarce; and villages may lose the opportunity for developing rural industries and offering employment. Processed products, transported back to remote villages, are expensive to buy and this, combined with the lack of employment opportunity, drives many people to seek work elsewhere. This rural exodus is deplored by governments which recognize its dangers, yet policy makers too often favour centralized rather than dispersed industrial development. Employment from processing Agriculture is a seasonal activity and even where there are two seasons annually there are peaks and troughs in labour demand. After harvesting labour may not be fully employed if crops are sold and transported to a distant centre for processing, whereas local processing at village level will offer employment to many of those not immediately required to cultivate the land. In Senegal rice has been transported increasingly to large regional mills and rural people have subsequently lost employment income and the value of the rice-bran by-product. In addition, when they have to buy rice in future, they will contribute to the transport costs of taking rice to the mill and then re-distributing the milled rice throughout the region. A similar situation developed in Malawi, where the maize, groundnut and soya used to manufacture the national weaning food, Likuni Phala, was transported to Blantyre and then transported back {{to the rest of the}} country in its processed form. Now the UN World Food Programme and the Netherlands Government are assisting the setting up of several small Phala processing plants throughout the country, which will utilize locally grown ingredients and distribute them locally. Farmers throughout the country will have the opportunity to sell produce, employment will be created and unnecessary transport costs eliminated. Processing activities vary in their demands for skills and strength: some require the strength of adult male physiques but in the main most processing activities can be done by women, thus supplementing family incomes, and by youth of both sexes, who then have an alternative to migrating to towns. Other forms of processing that can provide employment opportunities are tanning of leather, spinning and weaving fibres, pressing nuts and seeds for oil, and making tallow from animal fat. Further opportunities exist where oil and tallow may be converted into soap and candles. Various estimates have been made of the losses incurred between harvest and end-use of agricultural products: poorly dried grain becomes mouldy, as do roots and tubers; in the absence of refrigeration Drying cashew a' milk, meat and fish spoil rapidly unless dried or smoked or, in the case of milk, converted to cheese; fruit and vegetables must be eaten fresh or converted into some form of juice, pulp, pickle, chutney, jam or dried product. Some authorities estimate that up to 50 % of production may be lost due to lack of, or inadequate, processing; losses are particularly high when yields are high, yet the major thrust of research and development is to increase yields rather than to make optimum use of what i already available. Improving food self-sufficiency Processing can also extend the period of availability of food products, reducing the 'hungry gap' between harvests and mitigating the seasonal rise in food costs a these times, which puts so many people a nutritional risk. Several new technologies and refinements of traditional procedure are now available for rural people to use at village level. Few require more than cement, wire, equipment that can be made by a blacksmith, water and sun, salt, sugar 0 smoke. Simple innovations are also transforming some traditional crops into novel food products. Root crops are highly perishable yet can be processed relatively easily. Techniques developed in Latin America at the Centre Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) have not only made long-life, sun-dried cassava chips and cassava flour available to rural and urban consumers throughout the year, but have also provided a source of easily stored and low-cost feed for cattle, pigs, poultry and prawns. This in turn has led to an expansion in livestock production and aquaculture with the double benefit of further increasing employment and animal protein for human diets. Cassava tubers are sliced into chips, which are then dried first on a concrete floor and later on wire drying trays, which helps to keep the chips clean. Sago is now being made into tasty sago biscuits by village women in Indonesia, while sago 'pearls' are produced by villagers in Sarawak for local and export markets. Other sago products being developed include bread, cereals, and snack foods such as 'sago pops'; these resemble prawn crackers which are based on cassava starch. Some other crops in ACP countries can be processed along similar lines. Sweet potato is another valuable tuber and Britain's Natural Resources Institute (NRI) has been working with the Centro Internacional de la Papa (CIP) on processes whereby villagers can extract starch and produce noodles. The starch is extracted by first wet-grinding the fresh roots using a cylindrical rasper. Water is poured continuously onto the rasper to produce a slurry comprising a fibrous residue and a suspension of starch. The fibre is separated using a nylon screen and the starch allowed to sediment for about five hours, after which it is sun-dried and stored. Noodles are made by preparing a dough and forcing this manually through holes in a metal 'former'. The threads of starch fall directly into boiling water where they gel and are later washed and sun-dried. Every stage of the process is within the limits of village technology. Cereal crops that could offer greater food security where rains are erratic include sorghum and millet. Although of equal nutritional value to maize, they have been displaced by maize because they have been associated with bitter tastes due to the presence of tannins, and because they are laborious to process. Now promising processing techniques have been developed which are suitable for village-scale technology and these could help sorghum and millet regain lost ground and so provide both more food and employment in drought-prone parts of Africa. (See Spore 29, October 1990, page 6). New products, new [asses Increasing urbanization, and a trend for men and women to work some distance from their homes, is leading to a demand for ready-to-eat snack foods. These may be savoury or sweet. In the Philippines the National Science and Technology Authority has produced a series of leaflets to promote guava juice, banana sweets, soya sauce, dried fish, pickled mango, coconut oil and tomato sauce. The ingredients and equipment required are listed and the process is clearly illustrated step by step. The text is available in English or Tagalog, the national language. In Bangladesh soya milk is being used as a substitute for cows' milk to make a wide range of traditional sweetmeats, which play an important part in the national diet. Again, processing of soya to make soya milk and the manufacture of sweetmeats is within the capacity of village processors using the most basic implements and utensils, and the marketing of sweets and sweetmeats develops the entrepreneurial sector in village economies. Cows' milk and soya milk can also be used to make a wide range of cheeses, which have a much longer shelf-life than milk and are more easily transported. Smoking of cheeses can extend shelf-life even further and provide alternative flavours that will reflect the wood used and the smoking process. Even by-products may find a place among village processed products. In Honduras the cashew apple has been developed into a crystalized fruit, which has a substantial market, whereas in the past this false-fruit of the cashew was discarded because of its bitter taste. The bitterness is removed by washing the fruit in 1 % sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) for three minutes and then rinsing in clean water. The fruit is pressed between boards, simmered in a strong hot sugar syrup and drained and dried. The product now brings additional income to cashew nut producers and supports a thriving processing industry. Future possibilities Many of the now-familiar brand names of food products in Europe and the United States originated in cottage industry and village bakehouse enterprises started by individual entrepreneurs, both men and women, during the past century or more. Local resources were matched with local skills and enterprise to meet, and even create, local demand. Large investment and complex technology were not needed and were, in any event, either not available or not affordable. Initially, growth was slow and was financed largely by re-investment of profits. A similar pattern is emerging in a growing number of countries with agriculture-based economies. If the trend car be encouraged by government policies appropriate extension, and availability of modest levels of credit, the variety of benefits that would result at both local and national level could be very considerable.

The percentage of water absorbed of the pPVA/pSPW biocomposites was higher than either the pPVA or pSPW alone while pSPW showed better water resistance compared to pPVA because of the restricted mobility exerted by the cellulose fibers.

This study shows that the new isolate C. butyricum A 1 together {{with the use of}} sago biomass as substrate is a promising technology for future biohydrogen production...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} Solid State Fermentation (SSF) {{parameters}} {{on the production}} of extracellular α-amylase and cellulase (endoglucanases) by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens UMAS 1002 using <b>sago</b> <b>pith</b> residue hampas in shaker flasks was investigated in this study. The appropriate incubation period, temperature, pH, agitation speed, inoculum concentration, hampas concentration and additive substrate effect were optimized for enzyme production. The activity of α-amylase and cellulase was at 14. 19 and 13. 15 IU mL - 1, respectively in optimal culture medium. Maximum yield for both enzymes were achieved by employing 4 % w/v hampas in 0. 2 M citrate buffer at pH 6 and incubated at 40 °C for 6 h with agitation speed of 100 rpm. Inoculum concentrations {{were found to be}} optimum at 3 % v/v and 4 % v/v for α-amylase and cellulase, respectively. Enzyme activity was 2. 8 (10. 80 IU mL - 1) and 3. 2 (9. 38 IU mL - 1) fold higher for α-amylase and cellulase respectively when 1 % w/v soluble starch was applied as additive substrates with 0. 5 % hampas. However in optimal media that consist of 4 %w/v of hampas, addition of 1 % w/v soluble starch intend to inhibit both enzyme productions. Result revealed that temperature, pH and shaking condition were the most significant factors for the production of α-amylase and cellulase enzyme. Temperature influenced enzyme production by affecting the other parameters including bacterial growth, pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and reducing sugars. Nevertheless, shaking condition could affect DO concentration that in turn affected bacterial growth and enzymes production too...|$|E
