Male rats were given daily doses of either 0, 0. 1, 1 or 50 mg/kg; females were given either 0, 1, 50 or 500 mg/kg. Body weights, food consumption and clinical signs were monitored daily; clinical pathology was conducted at designated intervals and animals were given a complete pathological evaluation after 12 months and 24 months of dosing. Normal survival was seen in all groups, no abnormal clinical signs were seen, and body weight gain was reduced only in female rats at 500 mg/kg. Both sexes at the high dose had mild decreases in red cell mass which were somewhat more pronounced in females. Clinical pathology indicative of liver injury was present in males that received 50 mg/kg and correlated with histomorphological liver changes that included both hypertrophic and degenerative/necrotic lesions.

Preoperative and postoperative radiation further decreases the local regional recurrence (LRR) rate in patients with rectal cancer but the reduction in risk is counterbalanced by increased <b>short</b> and long <b>term</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Lower LRR rates have not uniformly translated into more favorable overall survival. In addition, advances in imaging have resulted in more accurate pretreatment staging and have improved the ability to stratify patients based on risk of recurrence.

Methods: Two chelators (CHX-A"-DTPA and cDTPA) were used for preparation of the (213) Bi-PAI 2 conjugate, for intraperitoneal administration in mice and ear vein injection in rabbits. The mice were sacrificed at different time points for pharmacokinetic studies. Blood and organs were collected for toxicity studies for all groups.

Mice and rabbits did not show any <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>toxicity</b> over 13 weeks at 1420 MBq/kg and 120 MBq/kg (213) Bi-PAI 2 respectively. Kidney uptake was decreased three fold by lysine.

The calculated sodium adsorption capacity of Ngakuru zeolites under flow-through conditions ranged from 11 to 42 meq/ 100 g depending on the strength of the solution being treated and on w hether the zeolites had been previously regenerated. The slow kinetics and low cost of the zeolities, coupled with potentially remote sites for gas extraction, could make semi-batch operational processes without regeneration more favourable than in more industrial ion exchange situations...|$|E
40|$|Environmental risk {{assessment}} of chemical substances produced or imported in amounts higher than 10 tons/year require a <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>toxicity</b> test on fish. This master thesis analyses {{whether it is}} possible to use in vitro data from experiments with fish cell lines as a regulatory tool in the aquatic {{risk assessment}}. The thesis thus seeks to answer the following question: How can alternative methods like in vitro experiments supplement or replace the current in vivo methods, and if so how can they be integrated in the ecotoxicological risk assessment methods in REACH? Since environmental regulation is based on natural science it is important to reach a scientific consensus regarding whether or not in vitro methods are suitable for ecotoxicological risk assessment. I have produced experimental data using in vitro methods in an ecotoxicological setting in order to discuss this issue from an empirical angle. In order to test an in vitro assay two fish cell lines from carp, namely Cyprinus carpio brain (CCB) and Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) were exposed to the inorganic compound potassium dichromate and the organic compound acrylamide. The cytotoxicity was observed with the MTT viability assay. The EC 50 values obtained in the experiment were compared to LC 50 values for Cyprinus carpio (C. carpio) found in the literature. The experiments were divided in a <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>toxicity</b> test (24 h) and a time-experiment (96 h) where measurements were taken every 24 hours. My results indicated no signs of correlation between in vitro data and in vivo data, which is in accordance with some other authors. Fish cell lines were more sensitive to potassium dichromate than fish, but for acrylamide the opposite was observed. Because the obtained experimental data is conflicting it is only possible to conclude {{that it is difficult to}} draw general conclusions on that issue. However there are some advantages with in vitro assays that should not be overlooked. They are cost effective, produce less waste and are able to screen a large amount of chemicals in a short time. Based on these assumptions it can be concluded that in vitro methods do have serious limitations, that need further investigation, but as a screening tool for the tonnage band 1 - 10 tons/year it could be useful due to its ability to handle many contaminants in a short time. Therefore in vitro methods should be supplemented by the “Threshold approach” method, which focus on test with algae and daphnia, because they are often reported to be more sensitive than fish. In addition to the scientific possibilities it is important that the legislative foundation for implementation of in vitro methods in REACH is present. The second analysis of this thesis concerns whether {{it is possible to}} implement in vitro methods in REACH. Furthermore the analysis includes a qualitative scientific interview. This aspect is important in regard to the evaluation of the usefulness of a regulatory tool. This thesis concludes that there needs to be consensus among the scientific researchers before in vitro methods can be implemented in the aquatic risk assessment. Due to in vitro methods acceptance in the human health risk assessment of chemicals, there should be no regulatory obstacles to implement in vitro methods in environmental risk assessment of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{identifying}} voiced and unvoiced speech region is proposed. Voiced/unvoiced speech detection {{is needed to}} extract information from the speech signal {{and it is important}} in the area of speech analysis. Voiced and unvoiced speech region has been identified using <b>Short</b> <b>Term</b> Processing (STP) in this paper. <b>Short</b> <b>Term</b> Processing of speech has been performed by viewing the speech signal in frames, which has a size of 10 - 30 ms. <b>Short</b> <b>Term</b> Processing has been performed in both time domain and frequency domain. <b>Short</b> <b>Term</b> Energy (STE), <b>Short</b> <b>Term</b> Zero Crossing Rate (STZCR) and <b>Short</b> <b>Term</b> Autocorrelation (STA) are computed from the time domain processing of speech. The spectral components in the speech signal are not apparent in the time domain. Hence, frequency domain representation is needed which is achieved using fourier transform. Conventional fourier representation is inadequate to provide information about the time varying nature of spectral components present in speech. So, <b>short</b> <b>term</b> version of fourier transform is needed, which is named as <b>Short</b> <b>Term</b> Fourier Transform (STFT) ...|$|R
