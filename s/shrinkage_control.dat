40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{problems associated}} with surface quality measurement and residual volatile organic compounds for composite laminates intended for use as cosmetic body parts based on unsaturated polyester resin containing <b>shrinkage</b> <b>control</b> additives. Surface quality measurement techniques were compared for composite laminates allowing for rapid characterisation and benchmarked to industrial standards. Thermal desorption and solvent elution techniques {{were used for the}} detection of residual volatiles with styrene and benzaldehyde being the main focus. The degree of conversion and residual volatiles were monitored for three peroxide initiators via a series of statistically developed experiments. This work highlighted the need for alternative <b>shrinkage</b> <b>control</b> methods. A novel approach was studied through the use of nano-scale silicates. An exfoliation process was developed with subsequent characterisation of thermal and mechanical properties for the nanocomposite. Finally, a series of hybrid matrices consisting of nanocomposite and low profile additive blends were monitored for effects on surface roughness, residual volatile levels and mechanical performance.

The experimental work of which was performed according to design of experiments techniques, aims to understand the influence of composition and process factors, with the ultimate objective of mastering <b>shrinkage</b> <b>control</b> to a satisfactory degree. In the case of compression molding, the polymer of choice was a reducing agent additive.

For the compression molding process, expanding and reducing agents and its blends with EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer) were used. Here also, the process conditions were fixed; shrinkage was controlled by an appropriate formulation of polymer compound and allowing shrinkage to be predicted. As all this work was based on shop floor polymer specimens, setting up rules for real-world shoe sole manufacture is beyond its scope.

Different low cure temperatures from 25 to 70 oC {{have been used}} to cure the specimens. Within limits of this study, it was found that shrink-age increases as the curing temperature increases. In addition, our studies show that there are two phase transitions for UP resins containing PVAc and PMMA cured at low temperatures. Adding LPAs to the neat UP resins can decrease the volume shrinkage to different extents, depending on the types of LPAs added and the kind of UP resin used. Results show that the nature of UP resin has a significant effect on the amount of volume shrinkage but, the trend is similar for each kind of LPAs.

40|$|Purpose– The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a new method to predict the {{potential}} shrinkage of plain‐knitted fabric. Design/methodology/approach– The presented method is based on deformable curve. The delivered plain‐knitted fabric is represented as a deformable parametric curve, and the relaxed fabric can be reached by minimizing the energy of the curve. Compared to the delivered‐knitted fabric, the length and width shrinkage percentages can be calculated accordingly. Findings– The new method is more convenient than the traditional trial and error method, and need less‐input parameters than the STARFISH technique. Experimental results show that this method is feasible. Originality/value– This paper presents a new method for shrinkage prediction of plain‐knitted fabric based on deformable curve and energy minimum.

40|$|Abstract. The cure of {{unsaturated}} polyester resins (UPR) is accompanied {{with a high}} degree of polymerization shrinkage of about 7 - 10 %, which can generally be reduced by adding thermoplastics as low profile additive (LPA). Here the design of a dilatometer was presented for the measurement of the volume change of {{unsaturated polyester}} resin system containing low profile additives. According to experimental results, the shrinkage of the UPR system used during cure was not only related to temperature, LPA type, the molecular weight and the concentration of LPA, but also linked strongly with the competition between the shrinkage induced by resin polymerization and the volume compensation by LPA. PVAc was more effective for volume compensation than other LPAs (Polystyrene, Polymethyl methacrylate) and there existed an optimal concentration of LPA for <b>shrinkage</b> <b>control,</b> as were demonstrated in the paper...|$|E

40|$|A recent {{application}} for nanometric CaO powder is its {{use as a}} spallation target material {{for the production of}} isotope beams at CERN. The stability of the nanostructure at high operation temperatures is a crucial feature to provide stable and improved isotope release rates. Prior to operation, sintering studies under thermal conditions {{similar to those of the}} target operation are required to establish the microstructural evolution due to coarsening and densification processes. This knowledge enables the identification of the limiting temperatures for the target operation, ensuring a stable nanostructure for higher and constant isotope release rates. In this study, nanometric CaO powder with 58 m(2) g(- 1) of specific surface area was obtained from vacuum decomposition of calcium carbonate at 800 degrees C. The microstructure evolution of porous powder compacts was investigated under vacuum atmosphere, from 1000 to 1250 degrees C, for holding times from 3 to 600 min. For temperatures higher than 1000 degrees C, a significant surface area reduction was observed, accompanied by porosity decrease. The morphological analysis of the pore evolution revealed a differential sintering of the porous compacts, mainly occuning inside the aggregates. The kinetic analysis of the surface area reduction pointed to aggregate <b>shrinkage</b> <b>controlled</b> by volume diffusion with surface diffusion as an underlying mechanism for lower temperatures.

50|$|The {{gating system}} serves many purposes, the most {{important}} being conveying the liquid material to the mold, but also <b>controlling</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> {{the speed of the}} liquid, turbulence, and trapping dross. The gates are usually attached to the thickest part of the casting to assist in <b>controlling</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> In especially large castings multiple gates or runners may be required to introduce metal to more than one point in the mold cavity. The speed of the material is important because if the material is traveling too slowly it can cool before completely filling, leading to misruns and cold shuts. If the material is moving too fast then the liquid material can erode the mold and contaminate the final casting. The shape and length of the gating system can also control how quickly the material cools; short round or square channels minimize heat loss.|$|R
40|$|Unsaturated Polyester (UP) resins are {{extensively}} used as {{a matrix}} {{for the production of}} composites due to their low cost and versatility. Their significant polymerization shrinkage has however a negative impact on the dimensional stability of the molded parts and on their surface quality. Low-Profile Additives (LPAs), that are thermoplastics, are usually added to the formulation of these materials to reduce shrinkage during curing. However, the exact role of the LPA is still controversial. The goal of this thesis is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the mechanism of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>control,</b> also called Low-Profile Effect. The approach used in the study consists of correlating the different stages observed during curing of the system UP/LPA/Styrene to the low-profile effect. The results obtained with the blend are compared to those obtained with the neat UP resin in order to highlight the role of the additive. Two types of system are investigated: incompatible, based on Poly(dimethyl siloxane) and Poly(methyl methacrylate), and compatible, based on Poly (vinyl acetate). Emphasis is placed on the blend containing PVAc. The study considers the changes taking place in the systems in the bulk, in the absence of inorganic materials, and at the surface of glass fibers. It has been shown that phase separation, which occurs during the crosslinking reaction, plays a determinant role in the mechanism of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>control.</b> Phase separation leads to the formation of two phases, a polyester-rich phase and an LPA-rich phase. Gelation that occurs early in these systems locks the morphology. Depending on the type of additive, its concentration and the cure temperature, different kinds of morphology have been observed. The low-profile effect is intimately linked to the morphology composed of interconnected globules of polyester. The formation of this particular structure strongly modifies the cure kinetics and the rheokinetics of the blends, compared to those of the neat UP resin. The most significant effects that have been observed are an increase in the gel conversion and in the gel time, and a slow down in the cure kinetics. An increase of the gel time up to 50 % has been reported in the presence of PVAc depending on the cure temperature. Work was then carried out in order to check whether the surface treatment of the glass fibers could modify the adjacent morphology of the two-phase matrix. The surface treatment showed a spectacular influence under specific conditions only, i. e. for a low temperature and a low concentration in LPA. The conditions leading to the formation of interconnected globules of polyester are, however, different and in this case, the morphology remains unchanged at the surface of the fibers. It is to be noted that in these reactive systems, the morphology at the surface of the fiber can be correlated to the surface tension of the phases in the case of incompatible additives only. Regarding the low-profile effect, the role of glass fibers is thus not so effective on the morphology. On the other hand, it has been shown that depending on the composition of their sizing, glass fibers can strongly affect the cure kinetics. By the end of the study, it was possible to identify the main points associated with the mechanism of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>control.</b> This mechanism is based on an increase in the gel conversion in presence of an LPA, and expansion of the LPA at the early stages of curing. At the later stages of curing, the mechanism is based on the formation of microvoids that develop in the LPA-rich phase and compensate for further shrinkage. Until now, the low-profile effect has been almost entirely attributed to the formation of these microvoids. Furthermore, it was shown that microvoiding could be associated with the formation of macroscopic voids that can be present at the surface of the parts in the form of pinholes. The entire course of reaction has thus to be considered to explain the low-profile effect...|$|E
40|$|Cure {{shrinkage}} is {{an inherent}} property of polymerizing systems {{due to the}} conversion of secondary bonds between monomer (or prepolymer) molecules to primary bonds, which have smaller interatomic distances. Cure shrinkage is highly undesirable: it impairs dimensional control and causes poor surface finish in molded polymers; it also generates setting stresses in highly filled systems. Previous methods for cure <b>shrinkage</b> <b>control</b> require special materials and conditions or entail the formation of voids. In this investigation, two processes were developed for producing polymer systems with zero shrinkage or slight expansion: (a) use of ammonia-modified montomorillonite as additive; and (b) microphase separation. The first method utilizes the dilatation of specially-modified montmorillonite (MMT) particles to counteract resin polymerization shrinkage. The MMT particles are first processed by replacing part of their hydration water with ammonia (which forms coordination bonds with SiO 2 in the mineral crystal) then dispersed into the resin. During cure at ambient temperatures the polymerization exotherm raises the temperature to 60 - 80 ∘C, breaking the SiO 2 -NH 3 bonds; however the liberated gaseous ammonia cannot escape outside the resin-embedded MMT particles and forces them to dilate to more than twice their original size. By controlling the amount of ammonia-modified MMT added to the resin (in amounts of 6 - 10...|$|E
40|$|Commercially {{available}} extractors and dryers {{are equipped}} with spreading and overfeeding devices to regain width and return the stretched loops to a more normal state. Spreading must be accompanied with overfeed {{in order to be}} effective ’ Relaxation drying allows those excessive tensions to be released since the fabric is dried under little or no restraints. Most relaxation dryers are based on the belt principle, where the fabric is placed between two belts and then passed through the drying zone. The bottom belt supports the fabric but allows for shrinkage, while the top belt prevents any stretching. In some cases, the bottom belt can be vibrated for additional mechanical action. Air flow is normally directed down and up through the fabric to give a ripple/wave effect. Once the drying is completed under relaxed condtions, those excessive tensions which have occurred during prior processing, have been released. If the fabric has been spread with overfeed prior to relax drying, width shrinkage occurs first. This may prevent the length from shrinking initially, but as the drying progresses, both width and length shrinkage occurs. At the exit of the relaxation dryer, the fabric width will be inconsistent and may not be completely wrinkle-free. Thus, calendering or compacting is necessary to provide a uniform, finished roll for cut and sew 3.
