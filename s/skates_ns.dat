40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{reliability}} of the preliminary Spanish version of the Sport Imagery Questionnaire (SIQ). The SIQ was developed to examine five cognitive and motivational functions of imagery use. Participants were 81 athletes competing in soccer (n = 43) and roller <b>skating</b> (<b>n</b> = 38), ranging in age from 14 to 29 years (M = 18. 10, SD = 3. 16). Reliability was evaluated through internal consistency analyses of the scale. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were high indicating that the scale is a reliable instrument for the measurement of imagery use in Spanish athletes. Further psychometric research should now examine factor structure and imagery use across competitive level and type of sport in a larger sample of Spanish athletes...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} a strength profile in young female athletes practising different sports and to use allometry to evaluate muscular strength with respect to body mass. The study included 42 women who practised taekwondo (n = 10), weightlifting (n = 10), canoeing (n = 14) and speed <b>skating</b> (<b>n</b> = 8). Measurements of maximal muscle torques under static conditions in 10 groups of flexors and extensors of the elbow, shoulder, hip, knee and trunk were carried out. The MANCOVA procedure was employed to compare means between the groups. A logarithm of body mass was adopted as a covariate. Relationships between body mass and muscle torques in each muscle group were determined using a procedure of linear regression. The analysis of residuals was employed for the evaluation of maximal muscle torques. Mean values of logarithms of maximal muscle torques were significantly different for the representatives of individual sports and they depended on the logarithm of body mass. It was proposed to use a mean of residuals normalized for individual muscle groups as a synthetic strength index (mean of the strength profile). The women practising canoeing were characterized by the highest strength index. Its lowest values were obtained by weightlifting and taekwondo athletes. Differences in strength profiles in the tested athletes were attributed to the specific nature of their sports. It is suggested to use an allometric relationship scaled by body mass for strength assessment...|$|R

5000|$|Among the {{different}} costume sets and themes for Charmin Chatty were [...] "Lets Play Together", [...] "Lets Go Shopping", [...] "Lets Play Nurse", [...] "Lets Play Cinderella", [...] "Lets Play Birthday Party", [...] "Lets Play Pajama Party", and [...] "Lets Play Tea Party". One outfit called [...] "Lets Talk n Travel in Foreign Lands" [...] came with 4 double-sided records {{and allowed the}} doll to speak in English and 6 other languages. Sometimes referred to as Charmin Chattys travel set, {{this is the most}} sought-after outfit by collectors. It included a navy blue coat, red straw hat, and blue shoes for the doll, plus a flight bag and stewardess hat for the child to wear (the idea being Charmin Chatty was going on an around-the-world airplane trip and the child was the stewardess). Phrases included on the travel set records were, [...] "The Queen lives in Buckingham Palace", [...] "Garçon means boy in French", and [...] "In German, Shule means school". Included in each set were props for the child to wear or use. One of the phrases on the record accompanying Charmin Chattys shopping outfit was, [...] "Shall we buy a Barbie doll?" [...] There were also four [...] "Chatty Games" [...] available, packaged in sets of two games each, which came with a record that allowed the doll to call out game moves when its string was pulled. Because you never knew what phrase the doll would say, Charmin Chatty could call out a move, and using the specially designed game board... she could win the game herself! The game titles were, [...] "Chatty at the Fair/Chatty <b>Skate</b> <b>N</b> Slide" [...] and [...] "Chatty Animal Round-up/Chatty Animal Friends".|$|R

40|$|Background: Australia’s {{interest}} {{and participation in}} ice hockey is increasing, however a {{lack of access to}} facilities means familiarity with this sport is limited, and so too is the facilitation of skill development within an ecologically valid context. Objective: While numerous methods may be employed to address this, one resource which remains relatively unexplored is the StrideDeck Treadmill, therefore {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effectiveness of this equipment with specific reference to the biomechanical changes for <b>skating</b> ability. Methods: <b>N</b> = 16 male athletes (Mage = 15. 0 ± 0. 76 yrs) from a junior league competition participated in this intervention based study. n = 9 were assigned to the training intervention (StrideDeck) once a week, while the control group (n = 7) continued their normal training routines. Further, monthly sprint tests both on the StrideDeck and an on-ice protocol were conducted to track progress via kinematic analysis. Results: Data analysis revealed no significant overall effects for on-ice sprint skating performance after StrideDeck training; however there were significant kinematic differences between StrideDeck and ice conditions. Conclusions: Therefore while the StrideDeck may have merit in regard to physiological paramters, the results of this study do not support its use as a skill acquisition tool in regard to increasing skating ability.
