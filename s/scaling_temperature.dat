These results confirm the entropy ramp as an explanation of the observed scaling relations. We observe a mild evolution in the entropy of clusters.

The study of the evolution in the pressure scaling imposes strong requirements in the definition of the average temperature of the cluster.

40|$|The {{effect of}} flow rate and {{temperature}} {{are believed to}} contribute in corrosion rate of carbon steel with presence of CO 2 in oil and gas environment. The aim of the study are to investigate the effect of temperature and fluid flow rate on corrosion rate which focus on the formation of protective layer (FeCO 3) on carbon steel. In this experiment, the specimen used is carbon steel (AISI 1045) and it is grinded with sand paper of 180, 280 and 400 grit {{on the surface of}} carbon steel. The specimen was tested with 3. 5 % NaCl and pH 4 with different temperature of 250 C, 500 C and 800 C. The fluid flow rate is varied by different rate of rotation which is 0 rpm, 500 rpm, 1000 rpm and 2000 rpm with the injection of saturated CO 2. Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR) is used to measure the corrosion rate and the formation of protective layer is observed under Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). The effect of flow rate and temperature seems influence the corrosion rate significantly. While the flow rate 2000 rpm shows the highest corrosion rate due to its turbulence pattern of the fluid flowing and enhanced the corrosion to occur. The <b>scaling</b> <b>temperature</b> obtain in this investigation is 500 C since at this point the corrosion rate seems to be the highest. This is due to the formation of porous and non-protective FeCO 3 layer on the wall of carbon steel. While, at 800 C the corrosion rate drops due to the formation of a dense protective layer. It is can be concluded that the <b>scaling</b> <b>temperature</b> is occurred at 500 C and started to decrease at 800 C. This finding shows that corrosion at maximum rate will occur faster than reported by previous study which the maximum corrosion rate occurred only at above 600 C...|$|E

Because the Martian atmosphere is so thin the majority of the solar radiance is converted to heat at the surface. The difference between surface and atmospheric temperature can also constraint surface albedo, thermal inertia, and infrared emissivity. The Mars Pathfinder Atmospheric Structure Instrument/Meteorological package (ASI/MET) was the most capable weather monitoring system ever sent to the surface of another planet to date.

40|$|Abstract—The {{supply voltage}} to {{threshold}} voltage ratio is re-duced with each new technology generation. The gate overdrive variation with temperature plays an increasingly important {{role in determining the}} speed characteristics of CMOS integrated circuits. The temperature-dependent propagation delay characteristics, as shown in this brief, will experience a complete reversal in the near future. Contrary to the older technology generations, the speed of circuits in a 45 -nm CMOS technology is enhanced when the tem-perature is increased at the nominal supply voltage. Operating an integrated circuit at the prescribed nominal supply voltage is not preferable for reliable operation under temperature fluctuations. A design methodology based on optimizing the supply voltage for temperature-variation-insensitive circuit performance is proposed in this brief. The optimum supply voltage is 45 % to 53 % lower than the nominal supply voltage in a 180 -nm CMOS technology. Alternatively, the optimum supply voltage is 15 % to 35 % higher than the nominal supply voltage in a 45 -nm CMOS technology.

The NFM state, which occurs in the 0. 4 > x > 0. 08 composition range, freezes into a cluster-spin-glass (CSG) phase at low temperatures [Z. Qu et al., Phys. Rev. B 78, 180407 (R) (2008) ]. In this article, we present the scaling analyses of magnetization and the specific heat for (Sr 1 -xCax) 3 Ru 2 O 7 in the 0. 4 > x > 0. 08 composition range. We find that in a temperature region immediately above the spin freezing temperature T_f, the isothermal magnetization M(H) and the temperature dependence of electronic specific heat C_e(T) exhibit anomalous power-law singularities; both quantities are controlled by a single exponent. The temperature dependence of magnetization M(T) also displays a power-law behavior, but its exponent differs remarkably from that derived from M(H) and C_e(T). Our analyses further reveal that the magnetization data M(H,T) obey a phenomenological scaling law of M(H,T) ∝ H^α f(H/T^δ) in a temperature region between the spin freezing temperature T_f and the <b>scaling</b> <b>temperature</b> T_scaling. T_scaling systematically decreases with the decease of Ca content. This scaling law breaks down near the critical concentration x = 0. 1 where a CSG-to-IMM phase transition occurs.

40|$|International audienceExpected {{changes to}} future extreme {{precipitation}} remain a key uncertainty associated with anthropogenic climate change. Extreme precipitation {{has been proposed}} to scale with the precipitable water content in the atmosphere. Assuming constant relative humidity, this implies an increase of precipitation extremes {{at a rate of}} about 7 % °C− 1 globally as indicated by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Increases faster and slower than Clausius-Clapeyron have also been reported. In this work, we examine the scaling between precipitation extremes and temperature in the present climate using simulations and measurements from surface weather stations collected in the frame of the HyMeX and MED-CORDEX programs in Southern France. Of particular interest are departures from the Clausius-Clapeyron thermodynamic expectation, their spatial and temporal distribution, and their origin. Looking at the scaling of precipitation extreme with temperature, two regimes emerge which form a hook shape: one at low temperatures (cooler than around 15 °C) with rates of increase close to the Clausius-Clapeyron rate and one at high temperatures (warmer than about 15 °C) with sub-Clausius-Clapeyron rates and most often negative rates. On average, the region of focus does not seem to exhibit super Clausius-Clapeyron behavior except at some stations, in contrast to earlier studies. Many factors can contribute to departure from Clausius-Clapeyron scaling: time and spatial averaging, choice of <b>scaling</b> <b>temperature</b> (surface versus condensation level), and precipitation efficiency and vertical velocity in updrafts that are not necessarily constant with temperature. But most importantly, the dynamical contribution of orography to precipitation in the fall over this area during the so-called “Cevenoles” events, explains the hook shape of the scaling of precipitation extremes...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for estimating thermal variance dissipation rate χ[subscript]T by scaling the inertial-convective subrange of temperature gradient spectra from thermistor measurements on a Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) equatorial mooring, maintained by NOAA’s National Data Buoy Center, is demonstrated. The inertial-convective subrange of wavenumbers/frequencies is contaminated by the vertical motion {{induced by the}} pumping of the surface float by surface gravity waves through the local vertical temperature gradient. The uncontaminated signal can be retrieved by removing {{the part of the}} measured signal that is coherent with the signal induced by surface gravity waves, which must be measured independently. An estimate of χ[subscript]T is then obtained by fitting corrected spectra to theoretical temperature gradient spectra over the inertial-convective subrange (0. 05 < ƒ < 0. 5 Hz); this estimate is referred to as χ[subscript]T[superscript]IC. Here χ[subscript]T[superscript]IC was calculated over 120 -min intervals and compared with estimates of χ[subscript]T[superscript]o determined by <b>scaling</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient spectra at high wavenumbers (viscous-convective and viscous-diffusive subranges). Large differences up to a factor of 20 and of unknown origin occur infrequently, especially when both background currents and vertical temperature gradients are weak, but the results herein indicate that 75 % of the data pairs are within a factor of 3 of each other. Tests on 15 -, 30 -, 60 -, 120 -min intervals demonstrate that differences between the two methods are nearly random, unbiased, and less than estimates of natural variability determined from unrelated experiments at the same location. Because the inertial-convective subrange occupies a lower-frequency range than is typically used for turbulence measurements, the potential for more routine measurements of χ[subscript]T exists. The evaluation of degraded signals (resampled from original measurements) indicates that a particularly important component of such a measurement is the independent resolution of the surface wave–induced signal...|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} focused on the study of {{concentration}} of desalination brines, specifically those generated on the desalination of brackish waters using reverse osmosis. When concentrating brines two different objectives are pursued. The first one is to concentrate the brine up to reach the maximum salts concentration, close to saturation, to facilitate the subsequent recovery by a crystallization step. This option is recognized as Zero Liquid Discharge as all the water is evaporated and the solids dissolved are recovered. The second possible objective is the so-called near-ZLD (near Zero Liquid Discharge), consisting in reducing considerably the volume of brine achieving a partial evaporation of the water. The second one is the objective aimed in this project. As concentration step Membrane Distillation (abbreviated hereafter as MD), an emerging technology integrating membrane and thermal technology will be evaluated. Specifically, the technology to be used is Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (abbreviated as DCMD), in which a hot feed concentrated solution is put in contact with one side of a hydrophobic membrane, on the other side a cold pure water stream is circulated. The main two advantages of MD are the possibility to operate at low temperatures (e. g. 40 to 60 oC) and the capability of working with high concentrations in the feed solution. From the possible problems facing MD three of them have been studied: <b>scaling,</b> <b>temperature</b> polarization and concentration polarization. Scaling consists in the deposition of solid salts on the membrane layer; blocking it and thus decreasing the flow of permeate. In order to avoid the early precipitation of salts different pre-treatments of the brine have been studied and experimented with. To study polarization effects, experiments of distillation modifying operational parameters have been carried out. The experimental set-up consisted in a membrane module connected in the hot-side to a heated bath, where the feed solution is submerged, and on the cold- side to a refrigerated bath where the distilled solution is cooled down. The mass of distilled water and the temperature in the inlets and outlets of the module have been continuously measured. To study the influence of the brine pre-treatments an aeration column was built. Brine was treated with different combinations of aeration and acidification. Concentration of the feed solution along the distillation experiments has been analyzed to identify the optimum brine pretreatment. Experimental data collected in the different experiments have been evaluated according existing theoretical models, being able to evaluate the DCMD method effectiveness to concentrate RO brine, determinate the concentration factors achievable for each pre-treatment, study polarization effects and estimate membrane transport parameters, as well as efficiency indicators...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to make clear {{influences}} of light and temperature conditions towards bolting and emergence of scaly leaf in lily scale bulblets during the scaling, especially the first 6 months after the beginning of scaling. Easter lily ‘Hinomoto’ was scaled in peatmoss nursery beds of various depths, 0, 0 - 3 and 3 - 12 cm, under the conditions of 25 and 15 ℃ constant temperature in a phytotron, Biotron Institute, Kyushu University, and under natural outdoor environment. Scales set at depths of 0 and 0 - 3 cm became to be exposed daily to sun light. When scaled under light condition, bulblets showed a much earlier expansion of their scaly leaves {{as compared to the}} slow bolting (stem leaf expansion) in others. Such a rapid emergence of scaly leaves was observed with a still larger frequency as compared to the bolting in darkness. The lower the <b>scaling</b> <b>temperature</b> became, the more remarkable the situation was to appear. Bolting was more frequent at 25 ℃ than that at 15 ℃ about 5 months after the beginning of scaling. During the following 3 months bolting did not increase at 25 ℃, but increased at 15 ℃, with the result that bolting at 15 ℃ became more frequent than that at 25 ℃. In darkness, most bulblets showed more frequent bolting than scaly leaf emergence at any temperatures. This bolting was accelerated when scale bulblets were transferred into the high temperature conditions. One month after the beginning of scaling in darkness at 25 and 15 ℃, scales with bulblets were transplanted and kept scaling in darkness at 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 ℃ for the following 5 months. At 25, 20 and 15 ℃, the lower the temperature was, the higher the bolting was. When scaled at 25 ℃ for the first one month, the bolting ratio was higher than that when scaled at 15 ℃. At 10 and 5 ℃, however, no leaf expanded regardless of the scaling temperatures of the first one month. One month after the acceleration of leaf expansion at 25 ℃, only scaly leaves emerged on these bulblets. The scaly leaf ratio was higher when scaled at 15 ℃ than at 25 ℃ of the first one month. The results are as follows: The light which is irradiated on scales during the scaling acts to promote the emergence of scaly leaves to suppress bolting. Such effect of light is accelerated by low temperature. Primary growth response of scale bulblets in darkness is to bolt, being induced by low temperature. Scale bulblets developed at higher temperature are induced more easily than those at lower ones. After the induction of bolting, the elongation of the stem is accelerated by high temperature. テッポウユリのscaling中,主としてscaling開始後約 6 カ月間における光や温度条件が仔球のりん片葉形成や抽台(茎出葉形成) に及ぼす影響について調べた. 形成された仔球に光をあてた場合には,抽台とりん片葉発生とはほぼ同時か,前者がやや早く起るのに対して,scaling中の母りん片に光をあてた場合には後者が早く起り,相対的に前者(抽台) を抑制した. この傾向は低温ほど顕著であつた.
