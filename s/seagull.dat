5|$|The Vought XSO2U was an American {{observation}} floatplane {{developed by}} Vought-Sikorsky for the United States Navy {{during the late}} 1930s. Intended to replace the Curtiss SOC <b>Seagull</b> in service as a scout aboard cruisers, it proved superior to the Curtiss SO3C in evaluation, but failed to win a production contract due to Vought's lack of manufacturing capacity.|$|E

5|$|Carey Hannah Mulligan (born 28 May 1985) is an English {{actress and}} singer. She made her acting debut {{on stage in}} London in the Kevin Elyot play Forty Winks in 2004. Her feature film debut was as Kitty Bennet in the 2005 film {{adaptation}} of Pride & Prejudice. She had early roles on British television in such programmes as Bleak House, and Doctor Who. In 2008, she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Chekhov's The <b>Seagull</b> to critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the engine}} issues, the SO2U-1 was {{considered}} overall {{to be superior}} to the competing Curtiss XSO3C-1; however, Vought's production capacity was already taken up by manufacture of the OS2U Kingfisher scout and F4U Corsair fighter. As a result, the XSO3C was declared {{the winner of the}} contract, and was ordered into production. Named <b>Seagull</b> by the U.S. Navy, and Seamew by the Royal Navy, the SO3C developed a disastrous reputation in service, and was retired before the SOC biplane which it was intended to replace.|$|E
50|$|<b>Seagulls</b> tend {{to sleep}} on the water. However, <b>seagulls,</b> like people, find gusty, {{turbulent}} wind difficult to contend with, and under such circumstances, the water is also choppy and unpleasant. <b>Seagulls</b> huddled on the ground may be a sign that the weather is already bad.|$|R

5|$|Eagle was {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet on 7June 1924 after she commissioned on 26 February and finished working up. She was the largest aircraft carrier in the world at the time and embarked 24 aircraft in four six-aircraft flights of the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force. These consisted of No. 402 Flight with Fairey Flycatchers, No. 422 Flight with Blackburn Blackburn reconnaissance aircraft, No. 440 Flight (Supermarine <b>Seagull</b> flying boats) and No. 460 Flight with Blackburn Dart torpedo bombers.|$|E
5|$|Filming was {{scheduled}} to start in December 1983, but was postponed for six months to accommodate Modine's shooting schedule for Mrs. Soffel (1984). Principal photography began in Philadelphia on May 15, 1984, with a budget of $12 million. The script required that a total of 24 locations be used for filming in Philadelphia and Santa Clara, California. Animal trainer Gary Gero employed the use of 80 different canaries for various scenes in the film, as well as pigeons, a hornbill, a cat, eighteen dogs and a <b>seagull.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his film work, Hawke has appeared in many theater productions.

The Walrus was operated by Royal Australian Air Force personnel from No. 5 Squadron RAAF (which was redesignated No. 9 Squadron RAAF in 1939). The 7-ton electric crane used to recover the aircraft also served to deploy most of the ship's boats.|$|E
5|$|Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is {{dissatisfied}} with underwater {{life in the}} kingdom of Atlantica, and is curious about the human world. With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes {{to the surface of the}} ocean to visit Scuttle, a <b>seagull</b> who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Hewitt's {{transfer}} to the Air Force had been made permanent in 1928. He became commanding officer of No. 101 Flight in February 1931, and supervised embarkation of the <b>Seagull</b> aboard the cruiser HMAS Australia in September–October 1932, by which time he had been promoted to squadron leader.

5|$|The {{first night}} of The <b>Seagull,</b> at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on 17 October 1896, was a fiasco, as the play was booed by the audience, {{stinging}} Chekhov into renouncing the theatre. But the play so impressed the theatre director Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko that he convinced his colleague Konstantin Stanislavski to direct a new production for the innovative Moscow Art Theatre in 1898. Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried subtleties from the text, and restored Chekhov's interest in playwriting. The Art Theatre commissioned more plays from Chekhov and the following year staged Uncle Vanya, which Chekhov had completed in 1896.|$|E
5|$|The flora of {{the island}} {{is typical of the}} Outer Hebrides with heather, {{sphagnum}} moss, sedges, grass and bracken predominating. There is but a single tree– a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff overlooking Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has grown on Mingulay since at least the late nineteenth century, and sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and <b>seagull</b> manure. In spring and summer there are profusions of wild flowers around the deserted Village.|$|E

5|$|Ariel first {{appears in}} The Little Mermaid (1989), {{in which she}} is shown as being adventurous and curious about the world of humans, a fascination which angers both her father King Triton and his court {{composer}} Sebastian, as merfolk {{are not allowed to}} make contact with the human world. She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they take to a <b>seagull</b> named Scuttle for appraisal. Ariel {{falls in love with a}} human prince named Prince Eric after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, Ursula, who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric fall in love with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.|$|E
5|$|Gulls {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen seabirds, given their use of human-made habitats (such as cities and dumps) and their often fearless nature. They therefore also have made it into the popular consciousness – they have been used metaphorically, as in Jonathan Livingston <b>Seagull</b> by Richard Bach, or to denote a closeness to the sea, such as their use in The Lord of the Rings both in the insignia of Gondor and therefore Númenor (used in the design of the films), and to call Legolas to (and across) the sea. Other species have also made an impact; pelicans have long been associated with mercy and altruism because of an early Western Christian myth that they split open their breast to feed their starving chicks.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Chastain {{made her}} {{professional}} stage debut as Juliet in {{a production of}} Romeo and Juliet staged by TheatreWorks, a company in the San Francisco Bay Area. The production led her to audition for the Juilliard School in New York City, where she was soon accepted and granted a scholarship funded by the actor Robin Williams. In her first year at the school, Chastain suffered from anxiety and was worried about being dropped from the program, spending {{most of her time}} reading and watching movies. She later remarked that her participation in a successful production of The <b>Seagull</b> during her second year helped build her confidence. She graduated from the school with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 2003.|$|E

The club played their home games at <b>Seagulls</b> Stadium. In 1990, the <b>Seagulls</b> pulled off a major coup when they signed future Rugby League Immortal Wally Lewis. In 1995 the club sold its licence to businessmen Jeff Muller, who changed the club's name to Gold Coast Gladiators.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} make <b>seagulls</b> act on cue and perform aerobatics, {{radio-controlled}} model aviation pioneer Mark Smith built radio-controlled gliders that looked remarkably like real <b>seagulls</b> from a few feet away.|$|R
50|$|In {{their first}} eight seasons, the Giants/Seagulls played their matches at <b>Seagulls</b> Stadium. When the <b>Seagulls</b> Leagues Club {{purchased}} the Giants franchise in 1990, {{the team was}} renamed Gold Coast <b>Seagulls</b> to reflect their home stadium. The club's on field record {{on the field and}} the Super League war forced the club to sell the stadium and fold the team after the 1995 season.|$|R
