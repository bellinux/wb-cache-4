40|$|It is {{expected}} that {{the next generation of}} helicopters will incorporate active control devices to suppress noise and vibration, One of the most advanced active control techniques to attenuate noise and vibration in helicopters is called individual blade control (IBC). Each blade is individually commanded independently of its azimuth angle. In the past, IBC was not fully developed, {{due to the lack of}} actuators able to withstand the loads that characterize the helicopter rotor environment. Among the new solutions to achieve efficient IBC, the ones that involve solid-state actuators or "smart" structures, are seen as the most promising. The Smart Hybrid Active Rotor Control System (SHARCS) project {{is expected}} to demonstrate the ability of smart structure systems, employing multiple active material actuators, sensors and closed-loop controllers, to reduce both vibration and noise in rotorcraft. To assess the capabilities of the smart <b>spring</b> <b>actuator</b> to attenuate vibrations, a prototype of the system is investigated. Before testing the SHARCS system in operative conditions, the characterization of the dynamic properties of the Smart Spring installed on a non rotating helicopter blade are analyzed. The effects of the Smart <b>Spring</b> <b>actuator</b> on the modal properties are studied through experimental investigations carried out at Carleton University. The capability of the Smart Spring to change the dynamic behavior of an actual helicopter blade is demonstrated by analyzing the shifts in the modal parameters.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ferromagnetic {{shape memory}} alloy (FSMA) {{composites}} composed of a ferromagnetic material and a {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) are key material systems for fast-responsive and compact actuators. The function of ferromagnetic material is to induce magnetic force which is then used to induce the stress in the SMA, resulting in the stress-induced martensite transformation (SIM), i. e. change in the Young’s modulus, stiff (austenite) to soft (martensite). This SIM-induced phase change causes larger deformation in the SMA, which is often termed as ‘‘superelastic’’. This paper discusses a simple model by which the stress and strain field in the FSMA composites subjected to bending and torsion loading are computed {{with the aim of}} identifying the optimum geometry of FSMA composites.

40|$|Spring {{actuators}} {{are essential}} components in vehicles {{as they are}} used for climate control, braking ventilation, engine control and fuel management. However, commercially available spring actuators are heavy and expensive {{and need to be}} replaced by lower-weight SMA spring actuators. Potential applications of the particularly promising NiTi shape memory alloys (SMA) in automotive spring actuators is currently limited due to low awareness. Recently, laser processing has been used to make processing monolithic NiTi wires more flexible than ever by locally changing the wire composition to achieve multiple functional properties. Using laser-processing to add multiple memories in a monolithic NiTi spring wire would allow for the fabrication of a novel self-biasing <b>spring</b> <b>actuator</b> which would lead to lower equipment costs, reduced weight and enhanced flexibility. To obtain a successful self-biasing spring, processing and spring fabrication techniques for NiTi wires need to be studied. The first part of the study involved investigating the effect of incrementing the number of laser pulses per spot and post-processing heat treatment temperatures on the composition of Ni- 49. 2 at. % Ti SMA wires. This was achieved by performing Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis and observing the shift in phase transformation temperatures. Results revealed that increasing the number of laser pulses increased the transformation temperatures up to a point at which the samples become Ti-rich and there is negligible effect on composition. Heat treatment study showed that heat treatment temperature {{had a significant impact on}} the transformation temperature peaks resulting in distinct peaks for base material and laser-processed samples. Mechanical properties of different heat-treated samples were examined using tensile test plots to determine the optimal heat treatment temperature for shape-setting springs.

A unique spring-shape setting fixture was used to fabricate springs with consistent spring pitch and diameter.

The test simulates the full-scale (chord, Reynolds and Mach numbers) conditions of rotorcraft retreating blade stall.

At the same time, SMA devices are typically characterized by complex multi-axial stress states as well as non-homogeneous and non-isothermal conditions both in space and time.

While a Mars transit habitat would be parked in High-Mars Orbit (HMO), crew members would visit the surface of Phobos multiple times for up to 14 days duration (up to 50 {{days at a time}} with logistics support). This paper describes a small body surface mobility concept that is capable of transporting a small, two-person Pressurized Exploration Vehicle (PEV) cabin to various sites of interest in the low-gravity environment.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} effect of hamstrings and quadriceps contractions on hip and knee joint motion was investigated using a dynamic {{model of the}} musculoskeletal system. The model consisted of 13 anatomically linked segments. The geometry of bones, joints, and muscle attachments was derived from magnetic resonance imaging of a healthy adult. The knee joint was represented by a crossing bars linkage to simulate cruciate ligament function, and muscles were represented by <b>spring</b> <b>actuators.</b> The effects of hamstring and quadriceps contractions, in various combinations, were tested on different configurations of hip and knee joint position {{in the absence of}} gravity. In the standing posture, with the foot free to move and the pelvis fixed in space, the effect of semimembranosus (SM) contraction was hip and knee flexion. If the foot was fixed to the ground, SM contraction produced hip extension and knee flexion. The addition of quadriceps contraction reduced or abolished the knee flexion and enhanced hip extension. In all other simulations, SM alone produced knee flexion and hip extension and the combination of SM with vastus (VA) and rectus femoris (RF) contractions resulted in knee extension and enhanced hip extension. Our findings suggest that co-contraction of quadriceps and hamstrings may be a strategy to increase the hip extension function of the hamstrings. Copyright © 2009 Elsevier B. V.
