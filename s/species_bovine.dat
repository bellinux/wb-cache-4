40|$|Monolayer {{cultures}} of thyroid cells lose their iodide organification capacity {{a few days}} before the disappearance of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activity. The present studies were performed in order to clarify this point. The above mentioned difference was due to the presence of an inhibitor in the monolayer thyroid cells culture, given that total homogenate prepared from confluent cells caused a significant inhibition of activity of TPO from fresh tissue. The inhibitor was localized in the 105 000 g supernatant of the homogenate of the cell culture, but not in a similar preparation obtained from fresh thyroid. It is thermostable, dialyzable and has a molecular weight of less than 2 kDa. Addition of the inhibitor at the end of the reaction of tyrosine iodination failed to alter the results. This fact suggests that the compound does not destroy the iodinated product.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the ability of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to accurately identify CoNS species in dairy cow IMI. In addition, the study aimed to determine the frequency of CoNS <b>species</b> causing <b>bovine</b> IMI. A total of 108 bacterial isolates were diagnosed as CoNS by microbiological cultures from two milk samples collected from 21 dairy herds; the first sample was collected at the cow level (i. e., 1, 242 composite samples from all quarters), while the second sample was collected at the mammary quarter level (i. e., 1, 140 mammary samples collected from 285 cows). After CoNS isolation was confirmed by microbiological culture for both samples, all CoNS isolates (n = 108) were genotypically differentiated by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of a partial groEL gene sequence and subjected to the MALDI-TOF MS identification procedure. MALDI-TOF MS correctly identified 103 (95. 4 %) of the CoNS isolates identified by PCR-RFLP at the species level. Eleven CoNS <b>species</b> isolated from <b>bovine</b> IMI were identified by PCR-RFLP, and the most prevalent species was Staphylococcus chromogenes (n = 80; 74. 1 %).

40|$|Extraction {{of serial}} {{sections}} of cattle hoof epidermis with solutions of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, guanidine hydrochloride, ammonium sulfate, and potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0) at varying salt concentrations demonstrates that keratohyalin (KH) is extracted by these salts at certain molarities. Under given conditions {{of time and}} temperature, each salt has a specific extraction pattern, and similar salts have similar extraction patterns. Dialysis of the salt extracts of hoof epidermis against distilled water results in the macroaggregation of KH, as assayed by histochemical methods. Although the various macroaggregates appear identical at the histochemical level, they display different ultrastructural characteristics. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the sodium decyl sulfate-solubilized macroaggregates results in the fractionation of a 20 (or more) member homologous series of oligomers. Isolation of the various oligomeric <b>species</b> of <b>bovine</b> keratohyalin and re-electrophoresis indicate that the various KH species can undergo depolymerization.

40|$|Summary: We {{measured}} the in situ biomechanical properties of knee joint cartilage from five <b>species</b> (<b>bovine,</b> canine, human, monkey, and rabbit) {{to examine the}} biomechanical relevance of animal models of human knee joint injuries and osteoarthritis. In situ biphasic creep indentation experiments were performed to simultaneously determine all three intrinsic material coefficients (aggregate modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and permeability) of the cartilage as rep-resented by the linear KLM biphasic model. In addition, we also assessed the effects of load bearing on these intrinsic properties at “high ” and “low” weight-bearing regions on the distal femur. Our results indicate that significant differences exist {{in some of these}} material properties among species and sites. The aggregate modulus of the anterior patellar groove within each species is the lowest among all sites tested, and the permeability of the patellar groove cartilage is the highest and does not vary among species.

Thirty-seven mucins, from the reproductive and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of six <b>species</b> (<b>bovine,</b> ovine, equine, porcine, chicken, and deer) and from two human-derived cell lines, were purified. Following optimization of mucin printing and construction of a novel mucin microarray, the glycoprofiles of the whole mucins on the microarray were compared using a panel of lectins and one antibody. Accessible glyco-motifs of GI mucins varied according to species and localization of mucin origin, with terminal fucose, the sialyl T-antigen, and N-linked oligosaccharides identified as potentially important. The occurrence of T- and sialyl T-antigen varied in bovine and ovine reproductive tract mucins, and terminal N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and sulfated carbohydrates were detected.

40|$|AbstractThe {{complete}} Npro coding sequences {{were determined}} for 16 pestiviruses isolated from cattle, pig, and several wild ruminant species including reindeer, bison, deer, and bongo. Phylogenetic analysis enabled the segregation of pestiviruses into the established <b>species</b> <b>bovine</b> viral diarrhea virus- 1 (BVDV- 1), BVDV- 2, border disease virus (BDV), and {{classical swine fever}} virus (CSFV). For BVDV- 1 five distinct subgroups were identified, while BVDV- 2, BDV, and CSFV were each subdivided into two subgroups. The virus isolates from bongo and deer {{as well as one}} porcine virus isolate belong to BVDV- 1. Interestingly, the isolates from reindeer and bison are distinct from the established pestivirus species. The Npro sequences from these two viruses are more similar to BDV than to the other pestivirus species. Calculation of the pairwise evolutionary distances allowed a clear separation of the categories species, subgroup, and isolate only when the reindeer/bison viruses were considered as members of an additional pestivirus species. Furthermore, the entire E 2 coding sequences of a representative set of virus isolates covering all recognized species and subgroups were studied. Segregation of pestiviruses based on the E 2 region was identical with that obtained with the Npro sequences...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that consumption of beef may correlate with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. One hypothesis to explain this proposed link might be the presence of a carcinogenic infectious agent capable of withstanding cooking. Polyomaviruses are a ubiquitous family of thermostable non-enveloped DNA viruses that are known to be carcinogenic. Using virion enrichment, rolling circle amplification (RCA) and next-generation sequencing, we searched for polyomaviruses in meat samples purchased from several supermarkets. Ground beef samples were found to contain three polyomavirus species. One <b>species,</b> <b>bovine</b> polyomavirus 1 (BoPyV 1), was originally discovered as a contaminant in laboratory FCS. A previously unknown species, BoPyV 2, occupies the same clade as human Merkel cell polyomavirus and raccoon polyomavirus, both of which are carcinogenic in their native hosts. A third species, BoPyV 3, is related to human polyomaviruses 6 and 7. Examples of additional DNA virus families, including herpesviruses, adenoviruses, circoviruses and gyroviruses were also detected either in ground beef samples or in comparison samples of ground pork and ground chicken. The results suggest that the virion enrichment/RCA approach is suitable for random detection of essentially any DNA virus with a detergent-stable capsid. It will be important for future studies to address the possibility that animal viruses commonly found in food might be associated with disease...|$|E

During an investigation into whether SeIPLP was a bovine substitute for SeIP or uniquely bovine, its mRNA was found to consist of multiple variants with different length tandem repeat, namely p(0) with (CAYYCC) 11, p(− 4) lacking (CAYYCC) 4, p(− 8) lacking (CAYYCC) 8, and p(− 9) lacking (CAYYCC) 9. Although they were encoded on a single gene locus, neither classicalGT-AG nor minor classAT-AC donator-acceptor sequences for alternative splicing were identified. A subsequent S 1 protection assay using oligonucleotides, whose sequence may occur as variants, performed against bovine poly(A) +RNA identified a total of nine variants. Judging from the sequence of these variants and the branch point mapping, the consensus sequence for recognition of the donator was CACCCCCAC and of the acceptor and the branch point A nucleotide,ACCCCCAT orACCCCCATCCCCAT. Furthermore, when the p(0) insert mRNA was expressed in COS- 7 cells derived from an African green monkey kidney, cDNAs corresponding to p(− 8) and p(− 9) could be isolated. Therefore, the bovine SeIPLP mRNAs consisted of multiple variants probably due to a novel splicing mechanism which was not bovine-specific but common to other mammals...|$|E
