50|$|When the two NSDs were ignited at each hold down, the {{hold-down}} bolt traveled downward {{because of the}} release of tension in the bolt (pretensioned before launch), NSD gas pressure and gravity. The bolt was <b>stopped</b> by the <b>stud</b> deceleration stand, which contained sand. The SRB bolt was 28 in long and 3.5 in in diameter. The frangible nut was captured in a blast container.|$|R
5000|$|In some organs, {{a wooden}} panel called a [...] "kickboard" [...] or [...] "kneeboard" [...] is {{installed}} above the pedalboard, between the pedals {{and the lowest}} manual keyboard. Expression pedals, coupler controls and toe <b>studs</b> (to activate <b>stops</b> or stop combinations) may be located on or set into the kickboard. Expression pedals are used to open and close shades or shutters that enclose the pipes of a given division. Combination pistons are used to make rapid stop changes from the console on organs with electric <b>stop</b> action. Toe <b>studs</b> are pistons that can be operated by the feet which change either the pedal stops or the entire organ.|$|R
2500|$|A {{horse was}} killed after it {{stepped on a}} live stud during {{construction}} of the tramway in Torquay. Each tram car was then fitted with a bell connected to a special contact arm to warn the driver if a stud remained live after it had passed. The conductor of the tram then had to reset the crank using an insulated mallet. During the Board of Trade inspection of the tramway four such studs were detected during about [...] of tests. There were also frequent problems with trams being <b>stopped</b> when a <b>stud</b> failed to be made live when needed. On 27 January 1910 a snow storm stopped all the trams as they couldn't {{make contact with the}} studs.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} camera has a black {{shutter speed}} dial with a finely milled pattern at the edge, {{and the two}} black plastic covers either side at top of the mirror housing are glued in place. All visible screw heads are single slotted. At the back, {{either side of the}} viewfinder window two screws hold the top cover, which are situated at equal distance from viewfinder window either side. The take-up film spool is plain black with one slot. The accessory shoe has a small metal <b>stud</b> <b>stop</b> pin. The standard lens has an intermittent milled focusing ring without scalloping recesses. The lens cap is black anodised stamped aluminium with [...] "Minolta" [...] in brushed metal finish.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: For the {{surgical}} treatment of gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD), laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication has largely replaced the open procedure. Retrospective and prospective non-randomised {{studies have shown}} similar results after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication compared with the open procedure. METHODS: In a multicentre randomised trial candidates for surgical treatment of GORD {{were randomly assigned to}} either laparoscopic or open 360 degrees Nissen fundoplication. Primary endpoints were dysphagia, recurrent GORD, and intrathoracic hernia. Secondary endpoints were effectiveness and quality of life. This planned interim analysis focuses on endpoints and complications and in-hospital costs. FINDINGS: At the time of interim analysis, 11 patients in the laparoscopic group and one in the conventional group had reached a primary endpoint (p= 0. 01; relative risk= 8. 8, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 66. 3). This difference was caused mainly by whether or not patients had dysphagia (seven patients in the laparoscopic group and none in the conventional group, p= 0. 016). INTERPRETATION: Although laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was as effective as the open procedure in controlling reflux, the significantly higher risk of reaching a primary endpoint in the laparoscopic group led us to <b>stop</b> the <b>stud...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Despite his {{identification}} with Chicago, he kept aloof {{from some of}} that city's more conventional writers. In a 2006 interview with <b>Stop</b> Smiling magazine, <b>Studs</b> Terkel said of Bellow: [...] "I didn't know him too well. We disagreed {{on a number of}} things politically. In the protests in the beginning of Norman Mailer's Armies of the Night, when Mailer, Robert Lowell and Paul Goodman were marching to protest the Vietnam War, Bellow was invited to a sort of counter-gathering. He said, 'Of course I'll attend'. But he made a big thing of it. Instead of just saying OK, he was proud of it. So I wrote him a letter and he didn't like it. He wrote me a letter back. He called me a Stalinist. But otherwise, we were friendly. He was a brilliant writer, of course. I love Seize the Day." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{town council}} of Torquay {{did not want}} their seaside resort {{disfigured}} by the poles and overhead wires of a conventional electric tramway and so invited the Dolter Electric Traction Company to construct a tramway using their stud-contact system. A horse was killed after it stepped on a live stud during construction of the Torquay Tramways. Each tram car was then fitted with a bell connected to a special contact arm to warn the driver if a stud remained live after it had passed. The conductor of the tram then had to reset the crank using an insulated mallet. During the Board of Trade inspection of the tramway four such studs were detected during about 8 mi of tests. There were also frequent problems with trams being <b>stopped</b> when a <b>stud</b> failed to be made live when needed. The network covered 6.79 mi and opened in stages during 1907 and 1908. On 27 January 1910 a snow storm stopped all the trams as they couldn't {{make contact with the}} studs. It was converted to overhead collection in 1911 shortly before it was extended to Paignton where the town council had refused to allow the Dolter system to be used.|$|R
