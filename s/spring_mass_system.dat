50|$|In {{traditional}} spring based heave {{compensation systems}} {{the movement of}} the mass is parallel to {{the movement of the}} spring cylinder. A passive heave compensation system is in effect a <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> <b>system,</b> it stabilizes a certain mass in a single position of the spring, in that position only the <b>spring</b> and the <b>mass</b> are balanced. In other positions of the <b>spring</b> the <b>mass</b> and the <b>spring</b> are not balanced and the mass will tend to start moving towards the stabilized position due to residual forces in the spring. Therefore, only in certain (preset) conditions a <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> <b>system</b> can be beneficial for heave compensation. In other (unexpected) conditions, <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> <b>systems</b> may experience unwanted effects such as load amplification. An active heave compensation system adds an active component to a passive heave compensation system in order to counteract these residual forces.|$|R

40|$|Performing {{realistic}} deformation simulations in {{real time}} is a challenging problem in computer graphics. Among numerous proposed methods including Finite Element Modeling and ChainMail, we have implemented a <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> <b>system</b> because of its acceptable accuracy and speed. <b>Mass</b> <b>spring</b> <b>systems</b> have, however, some drawbacks such as, the determination of simulation coefficients with their iterative nature. Given the correct parameters, <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> <b>systems</b> can accurately simulate tissue deformations but choosing parameters that capture nonlinear deformation behavior is extremely difficult. Since most of the applications require {{a large number of}} elements i. e. points and springs in the modeling process it is extremely difficult to reach realtime performance with an iterative method. We have developed a new parameter identification method based on neural networks. The structure of the <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> <b>system</b> is modified and neural networks are integrated into this structure. The input space consists of changes in spring lengths and velocities while a "teacher" signal is chosen as the total spring force, which is expressed in terms of positional changes and applied external forces. Neural networks are trained to learn nonlinear tissue characteristics represented by spring stiffness and damping in the <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> algorithm. The learning algorithm is further enhanced by an adaptive learning rate, developed particularly for <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> <b>systems.</b> In order to avoid the iterative approach in deformation simulations we have developed a new deformation algorithm. This algorithm defines the relationships between points and springs and specifies a set of rules on spring movements and deformations. These rules result in a deformation surface, which is called the search space. The deformation algorithm then finds the deformed points and springs in the search space {{with the help of the}} defined rules. The algorithm also sets rules on each element i. e. triangle or tetrahedron so that they do not pass through each other. The new algorithm is considerably faster than the original <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> <b>systems</b> algorithm and provides an opportunity for various deformation applications. We have used <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> <b>systems</b> and the developed method in the simulation of craniofacial surgery. For this purpose, a patient-specific head model was generated from MRI medical data by applying medical image processing tools such as, filtering, the segmentation and polygonal representation of such model is obtained using a surface generation algorithm. Prism volume elements are generated between the skin and bone surfaces so that different tissue layers are included to the head model. Both methods produce plausible results verified by surgeons.
