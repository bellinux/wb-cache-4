25|$|A {{few days}} before Mr. Jardine’s {{departure}} from Canton, the entire foreign community entertained him at a dinner {{in the dining room}} of the East India Company’s Factory. About eighty persons of all nationalities, including India, were present, and they did not separate until several hours after midnight.

25|$|An {{anonymous}} verse lampoon entitled The Sink of Solitude appeared {{during the}} controversy over The Well. Although its primary targets were James Douglas, who had called for The Wells suppression, and the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks, who had started legal proceedings, it also mocked Hall and her book. One of the illustrations, which depicted Hall nailed to a cross, so horrified her that she could barely <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> for years afterward. Her sense of guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel, The Master of the House.|$|E
25|$|In late 1944, Soviet forces battled {{fiercely}} {{to capture}} Hungary in the Budapest Offensive, {{but could not}} take it, which became a topic so sensitive to Stalin that he refused to allow his commanders to <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The Germans held out in the subsequent Battle of Budapest until February 1945, when the remaining Hungarians signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. Victory at Budapest permitted the Red Army to launch the Vienna Offensive in April 1945. To the northeast, the taking of Belarus and western Ukraine permitted the Soviets to launch the massive Vistula–Oder Offensive, where German intelligence had incorrectly guessed the Soviets would have a 3-to-1 numerical superiority advantage that was actually 5-to-1 (over 2 million Red Army personnel attacking 450,000 German defenders), the successful culmination of {{which resulted in the}} Red Army advancing from the Vistula River in Poland to the German Oder River in Eastern Germany.|$|E

The {{reviewer}} from The Illustrated London News described how the story's [...] "impressive eloquence... its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour... its gentle spirit of humanity" [...] all put the reader [...] "in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author". The critic from The Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a [...] "tale to make the reader laugh and cry– to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable... a dainty dish to set before a King." [...] William Makepeace Thackeray, writing in Fraser's Magazine, described the book as [...] "a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. The last two people I heard <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, 'God bless him!'" ...|$|E

He also states, [...] "It was during my absence from France that Bonaparte, in the rank of chef de bataillon , performed his first campaign, and contributed so materially to the recapture of Toulon. Of this period of his life I have no personal knowledge, and therefore I shall not <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as an eye-witness. I shall merely relate some facts which fill up the interval between 1793 and 1795, and which I have collected from papers which he himself delivered to me.

500|$|In the Comines {{sector of}} the front there was an early fraternization between German and French {{soldiers}} in December 1914, during a short truce, and {{there are at least}} two other testimonials, from French soldiers, of similar behaviors in sectors where German and French companies opposed each other. [...] Gervais Morillon wrote to his parents: ‘The Boches waved a white flag and shouted [...] "Kamarades, Kamarades, rendez-vous." [...] When we didn’t move they came towards us unarmed, led by an officer. Although we are not clean they are disgustingly filthy. I am telling you this but don’t <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to anyone. We must not mention it even to other soldiers.’ Gustave Berthier wrote: ‘On Christmas day the Boches made a sign showing they wished to speak to us. They said they didn’t want to shoot....

In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau claimed that Morrison had finally fulfilled his artistic potential: [...] "Forget Astral Weeks—this is a brilliant, catchy, poetic, and completely successful LP." [...] Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs jointly reviewed the album in Rolling Stone, hailing it {{as a work of}} [...] "musical invention and lyrical confidence; the strong moods of 'Into the Mystic' and the fine, epic brilliance of 'Caravan' will carry it past many good records we'll forget in the next few years." [...] Fellow Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau found the singer's vocals overwhelming: [...] "Things fell into place so perfectly I wished there was more room to breathe. Morrison has a great voice and on Moondance he found a home for it." [...] Ralph J. Gleason from the San Francisco Chronicle also wrote of Morrison's singing as a focal point of praise: [...] "He wails as the jazz musicians speak of wailing, as the gypsies, as the Gaels and the old folks in every culture <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He gets a quality of intensity in that wail which really hooks your mind, carries you along with his voice as it rises and falls in long, soaring lines." ...|$|E
