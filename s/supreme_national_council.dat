5|$|In the meantime, however, {{peace talks}} between the warring factions continued, with the First Paris Peace Conference on Cambodia held in Paris in 1989. On 26 February 1990, {{following}} the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting was held, at which the <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> was established to safeguard Cambodian sovereignty. Initially, the <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> was to have 12 members, with three seats allocated to each faction of the CGDK, and three to the pro-Vietnam Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party. However, Hun Sen objected to the proposed arrangement, calling instead for each faction of the CGDK to be given two seats {{for a total of}} six, and the Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party to have six seats. In 1991 the <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> began representing Cambodia at the UN General Assembly. Then, in a bold move, Hun Sen renamed the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party to the Cambodian People's Party in an effort to portray his party as a democratic institution and renounce its revolutionary struggle.|$|E
5|$|Ranariddh became {{secretary-general}} of FUNCINPEC in August 1989, when Sihanouk {{stepped down as}} its president. On 10 September 1990, Ranariddh joined the <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> of Cambodia (SNC), an interim United Nations administrative body tasked with overseeing sovereign affairs of Cambodia. When the 1991 Paris Peace Accords were signed in October of that year, officially ending the Cambodian–Vietnamese War, Ranariddh {{was one of the}} SNC signatories. In February 1992, {{he was elected to the}} presidency of FUNCINPEC.|$|E
5|$|In July 1989 Ali Alatas joined French foreign {{minister}} Roland Dumas in opening the Paris Peace Conference, where discussions took place regarding plans for Vietnamese troop withdrawal and power-sharing arrangements in a hypothetical future Cambodian government. The following month, Sihanouk resigned {{as president of}} FUNCINPEC but remained in the party as an ordinary member. In September 1990 the United Nations (UN) sponsored {{the establishment of the}} <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> of Cambodia (SNC), an administrative body responsible for overseeing the sovereign affairs of Cambodia for an interim period until UN-sponsored elections were held. The creation of the SNC was subsequently ratified with United Nations Security Council Resolution 668. In July 1991 Sihanouk left FUNCINPEC altogether and was elected as the chairperson of the SNC.|$|E

5|$|In August 1989, Sihanouk {{stepped down}} as the President of FUNCINPEC and was succeeded by Nhiek Tioulong. At the same time, Ranariddh was made the Secretary-General of the party. In September 1990, the four warring Cambodian factions reached an {{agreement}} to form the <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (SNC), an organisation designed to oversee Cambodia's sovereign affairs in the United Nations on an interim basis. The SNC consisted of twelve members from the four warring Cambodian factions, with two seats going to FUNCINPEC. Sihanouk negotiated to become the 13th member of the SNC, a proposal which Hun Sen initially rejected, but later acceded after Sihanouk relinquished his FUNCINPEC party membership in July 1991. Sihanouk was elected {{as the chairman of}} the SNC, and the SNC seats under FUNCINPEC's quota were filled up by Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy. When the Paris Peace Accords were signed in October 1991, Ranariddh represented the party as its signatory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{informal}} talks {{were carried out}} to end hostilities between the Vietnam-supported People's Republic of Kampuchea and resistance factions under the CGDK. In 1990 the <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> of Cambodia was formed as a transitional body to oversee Cambodia's sovereign matters, with Sihanouk as its president. In 1991 peace accords were signed, and the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was established the following year. The UNTAC organised general elections in 1993, and a coalition government, jointly led by his son Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, was subsequently formed. In June 1993 Sihanouk was reinstated as Cambodia's Head of State, and in September 1993 was appointed king. In 2004 Sihanouk abdicated again in favour of another son, Norodom Sihamoni, who succeeded him as king. He {{was known as the}} King father until his death in 2012.|$|E
5|$|At the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in 1990, {{under the}} Australian-sponsored Cambodian Peace Plan, {{representatives of the}} CGDK and the PRK agreed to a power-sharing {{arrangement}} by forming a unity government known as the <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (SNC). The SNC's role was to represent Cambodian sovereignty on the international stage, while the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was tasked with supervising the country's domestic policies until a Cambodian government was elected by the people through a peaceful, democratic process. Cambodia's pathway to peace proved to be difficult, as Khmer Rouge leaders decided {{not to participate in}} the general elections, but instead they chose to disrupt the electoral process by launching military attacks on UN peacekeepers and killing ethnic Vietnamese migrants. In May 1993, Sihanouk's FUNCINPEC movement defeated the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), formerly the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP), to win the general elections. However, the CPP leadership refused to accept defeat and they announced that the eastern provinces of Cambodia, where most of the CPP's votes were drawn from, would secede from Cambodia. To avoid such an outcome, Norodom Ranariddh, the leader of FUNCINPEC agreed to form a coalition government with the CPP. Shortly afterwards, the constitutional monarchy was restored and the Khmer Rouge was outlawed by the newly formed Cambodian Government.|$|E

5|$|In March 2005 Sihanouk accused Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam of {{encroaching}} into Cambodian territory, through unilateral border demarcation exercises without Cambodian participation. Two months later, Sihanouk {{formed the}} <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> on Border Affairs (SNCBA), which he headed, {{to address these}} concerns. While the SRP and Chea Sim expressed support for Sihanouk {{for the formation of}} the SNCBA, Hun Sen decided to form a separate body, National Authority on Border Affairs (NABA), to deal with border concerns, with SNCBA to serve only as an advisory body. After Hun Sen signed a border treaty with Vietnam in October 2005, Sihanouk dissolved the SNCBA. In August 2007 the Cambodian Action Committee for Justice and Equity, a US-based human rights NGO, called for Sihanouk's State immunity to be lifted, so as to allow him to testify in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). Sihanouk responded to the call by inviting the ECCC public affairs officer, Peter Foster, for a discussion session on his personal experience under the Khmer Rouge regime. Both Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC criticized the suggestion, with the latter accusing the NGO of being disrespectful. The ECCC subsequently rejected Sihanouk's invitation.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Kościuszko Uprising began in March 1794, Zajączek joined Kościuszko in Luborzyca on 2 April. Zajączek {{was given the}} command of the Lesser Poland Division, and on 4 April he took part in battle of Racławice, which {{concluded}} with a major Polish victory. On 6 April {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant general. Over the next few weeks Zajączek accompanied Kościuszko and his staff. On 8 June he was defeated at the battle of Chełm and retreated toward Lublin. He lost support among the troops, and faced a mutiny, eventually quelled by Kościuszko, on 10 June. In mid June Zajączek's forces merged with those of Kościuszko. He commanded the forces in the inconclusive battle of Gołków on 9–10 July, and soon after {{he was one of the}} Polish commanders of the defense of Warsaw that lasted from mid July until early September. In the following few weeks Zajączek became one of the members of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> and a president of its Criminal Court. He was a commander of the defense of Warsaw during the disastrous battle of Praga of 4 November. During the battle Zajączek was wounded and retreated from the battle even before the conflict was over. He has been criticised for his insufficient preparation for the defense of Warsaw against Russian invasion, and for poor leadership during the battle. Zajączek escaped to Polish Galicia where he was interned by Austrians. He was released one year later, moving to Paris.|$|E
500|$|Potocki {{participated in}} {{preparations}} for the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794. In early April he left Leipzig and arrived in Kraków. He was involved in unsuccessful diplomatic negiations with various foreign powers, in a vain attempt to gain support for the insurgents. During the Uprising {{he served as a}} member of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (...) , as a chief of its diplomatic department. Upon suppression of the Uprising, instead of emigrating again, he took part in the surrender negotiations, which gained him respect in many quarters. Eventually on 21 December 1794 he was imprisoned by the Tsarist Russian authorities. He has lost most of his wealth following the Uprising, as most of his estates were confiscated. Near the end of his life he would be troubled by his inability to pay off debts from the 1780s.|$|E

500|$|On 23 October 1991, the Cambodian {{factions of}} the <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> along with Vietnam and 15 member {{nations of the}} International Peace Conference on Cambodia, signed the Paris Peace Agreement. For the Cambodian people, two decades of {{continuous}} warfare and 13 years of civil war seemed to be over, although an atmosphere of uneasiness amongst {{the leaders of the}} Cambodian factions remained. In order to include the Khmer Rouge in the agreement, the major powers agreed to avoid using the word [...] "genocide" [...] to describe the actions of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea in the period between 1975 and 1979. As a result, Hun Sen criticised the Paris Agreement as being far from perfect, as it failed to remind the Cambodian people of the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge regime. Nonetheless, the Paris Agreement established the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), in accordance with the UN Security Council’s Resolution 745, and gave UNTAC a broad mandate to supervise main policies and administration works until a Cambodian government was democratically elected.|$|E
2500|$|The {{uprising}} in Warsaw marked a significant {{victory for the}} entire cause of Kościuszko, and echoes of the victory in Warsaw spread across the country. Ignacy Zakrzewski became the city's commander in chief and mayor. General Mokronowski repeatedly begged the King, {{who was at the}} same time his cousin, to support the uprising. The king refused and power in the city was seized by the Provisional Temporary Council (...) composed of Zakrzewski, Mokronowski, Józef Wybicki and Kiliński. Mokronowski was soon removed from the council for his opposition to Kościuszko. On 27 May the council was dissolved, and power passed to Kościuszko's <b>Supreme</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (...) [...] On 9 May four prominent supporters of the Targowica Confederation, including Józef Ankwicz, Józef Kossakowski, hetman Piotr Ożarowski and hetman Józef Zabiełło, were sentenced to death by the Insurrectionary Court and were hanged in Warsaw. A few weeks later, on 28 June, an angry mob stormed the prisons and hanged other supporters of Targowica, including bishop Ignacy Jakub Massalski, prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk, ambassador Karol Boscamp-Lasopolski and others. Felix Potocki was not found; his portrait was hoisted on the gallows instead. Kosciuszko quickly {{put an end to the}} lynch mob declaring, [...] "What happened in Warsaw yesterday filled my heart with bitterness and sorrow ...Those who do not obey the laws are not worthy of liberty." ...|$|E
