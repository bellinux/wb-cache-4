5|$|The {{idea that}} Bristol's main <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> should be {{moved away from}} the Castle Street and Wine Street area was first {{proposed}} to Bristol Corporation's Planning and Reconstruction Committee by the Multiple Traders' Federation (MTF), representing the larger retailers and chain-stores, in October 1943. They suggested that the pre-war <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> should be set aside as a civic area with perhaps a concert hall or similar building and an open space, and that the central <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> should be moved to a less-constrained site. This suggestion formed part of the City Engineer's Master Plan of February 1944, which envisaged that the area would contain a limited number of buildings such as a conference hall, with underground parking for 2,000 cars. The removal of the <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> was considered desirable because the fire that had destroyed so much of the area was in large part sustained by its congested nature, and in any case many of the chain-stores represented by the MTF wanted larger sites.|$|E

5|$|Most {{stations}} on the Bloor–Danforth line have side platforms; however, {{there are}} still a few stations which use a centre platform instead. At the surface, some stations are designed {{to be a part of}} the <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> which are located above the subway. Other stations are large facilities on the surface which also contain bus and/or streetcar platforms to allow transfers to take place.|$|E
5|$|The Covent Garden {{area has}} long been {{associated}} with entertainment and shopping. Covent Garden has 13 theatres, and over 60 pubs and bars, with most south of Long Acre, around the main <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> of the old market. The Seven Dials area {{in the north of}} Covent Garden was home to the punk rock club The Roxy in 1977, and the area remains focused on young people with its trendy mid-market retail outlets.|$|E

5|$|The main {{objection}} to this plan {{came from the}} independent traders who {{did not wish to}} relocate because they felt that the proposed new <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> was 'off the beaten track'. This objection was not unreasonable, as in its pre-war topography Bristol had a long shopping axis that started at Stapleton Road to the east, passed through Old Market into Castle Street, Wine Street, and the City Markets, and then via The Centre and Park Street to Queens Road and Whiteladies Road. Moving the central <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> would break this axis. There was also concern about the serious negative social and economic impacts of 'sterilising' such a large area in the centre of the city. However, when the Bristol Retail Traders Federation, representing the small traders, produced a poll showing that 13,000 people wished to retain the shopping centre on its current site whereas only 400 preferred to see it moved, the local Labour party dismissed the poll describing it as 'undemocratic' and comparing the Federation's methods to those of Hitler.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> in Sandakan is the Harbour Mall. Launched in 2003, it {{is located}} in Sandakan's new central {{business}} district and built on a bay of reclaimed land. It {{is part of the}} Sandakan Harbour Square and considered as the first modern shopping mall in the town. In 2014, a new mall project with 341 units of store has been launched and will become the second main shopping destination for Sandakan once it gets finished.|$|E
5|$|Protests erupted {{soon after}} the release of the video, and on Black Friday protesters shut down part of the city's Magnificent Mile. Public calls for {{resignation}} grew steadily over this period, including a well-circulated op-ed published in The New York Times. By early December, Emanuel's approval rating had sunk to 18%, with 67% of Chicagoans disapproving of his job performance and slightly more than half of those polled calling for his resignation. During the week of December 10, protestors blocked streets and continued to call for Emanuel to resign. Additional protests against Emanuel and Chicago's Police Department were held on the city's busy Michigan Avenue <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> on December 24, 2015.|$|E

5|$|The High Street retains various {{independent}} shops, {{including a}} cobbler and a butcher, but {{is seen as}} in need of improvement. Walsall Council's regeneration programme includes extensive redevelopment of the High Street; the council's view is that retail investment should be focussed on the existing <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> rather than encouraging new developments outside this area as, based on consultants' studies, the council believes that the town could not support large-scale retail development. Specific development opportunities within {{the vicinity of the}} High Street have been identified, with particular focus on land on Silver Street, adjacent to the canal.|$|E
5|$|The kebbe {{consists}} of cement buildings that are built overnight {{and made to}} look permanent to avoid destruction by the authorities. In 1999, {{it was estimated that}} more than half of the city's inhabitants lived in tents and shacks, which were used for residential as well as business purposes. The city is broken into nine arrondissements, sub-divided into alphabetised Îlots. These are Teyarett, Ksar, Tevragh Zeïna, Toujournine, Sebkha, El Mina, Dar Naïm, Arafat and Riad.

5|$|The {{rebuilding}} of Bristol city centre was characterised by 1960s and 1970s skyscrapers, mid-century modern architecture and road improvements. Beginning in the 1980s some main roads were closed, the Georgian-era Queen Square and Portland Square were restored, the Broadmead <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> regenerated, {{and one of}} the city centre's tallest mid-century towers was demolished. Bristol's road infrastructure changed dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s with the development of the M4 and M5 motorways, which meet at the Almondsbury Interchange just north of the city and link Bristol with London (M4 eastbound), Swansea (M4 westbound across the Severn Estuary), Exeter (M5 southbound) and Birmingham (M5 northbound).|$|E
5|$|The street {{became popular}} with entertainers {{including}} bear-baiters, theatres and public houses. However, {{it was not}} attractive to {{the middle and upper}} classes due to the nearby Tyburn gallows and St Giles, then a notorious rookery, or slum. The gallows were removed in 1783, {{and by the end of}} the century, Oxford Street was built up from St Giles Circus to Park Lane, containing a mix of residential houses and entertainment. The Princess's Theatre opened in 1840, and is now the site of Oxford Walk <b>shopping</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
