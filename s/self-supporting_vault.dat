5000|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle complex is a tall square clock or gate tower (~1300 AD) opposite the hotel. A connecting path joins the clock tower to {{the remains of the}} living quarters of the landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt (the so-called Darmstadt Building). The Darmstadt building was designed in Tudor style with pointed gables. The connecting path was the site of the former moat of the main castle buildings; part of which is now the large cellar or basement. This large cellar was arched over in 1587-89 in two visible phases. It is the largest <b>self-supporting</b> <b>vaulted</b> cellar in Europe and has a length of 24 m, a width and height of approximately 16 m and can accommodate up to 400 people. The walls are up to 4 m thick. Previously a 200000 L wine barrel was constructed for storage. The cellar was renovated in 1997 and restored to its original condition and now serves as a meeting place for concerts, theater performances, and other shows. Next to the Darmstadt building once stood a 54 m tall tower. It had a diameter of 10.5 m with walls 3.5 m thick at the bottom. In the 14th century, a narrow round tower was added to the top, making it the highest butter-churn tower in Germany.|$|R
40|$|The {{historic}} Jewish Purification House Bet Tahara {{was erected}} in Olsztyn in 1913 {{on the basis}} of the debut design of Erich Mendelsohn, a world-famous architect born in Olsztyn. The most valuable element of the building is a <b>self-supporting</b> pyramid <b>vault</b> above a mourning hall. The paper presents the interesting structure of the building, its technical condition before renovation, as well as the scope of work involved in adapting it into a public utility building - MENDELSOHN HOUSE Intercultural Dialogue Centre. The undertaking was executed thanks to the commitment of the building’s leaseholder - “Borussia” Cultural Community Association, which raised money for this goal from public funds...|$|R
50|$|The rear western {{elevation}} is less elaborate {{than the}} front facade, with some windows {{not having any}} decoration at all. Two matching polygonal towers in the center {{are connected to the}} polygonal south turret by an open loggia that opens the main rooms of the house to the views of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the distance. The loggia is decorated overhead with terracotta tiles set in a herringbone pattern. The <b>self-supporting</b> ceramic tile <b>vault</b> and arch system was used extensively inside and outside of Biltmore, and was patented by Rafael Guastavino, a Spanish architect and engineer, who personally supervised the installation. The limestone columns were carved to reflect the sunlight in aesthetically pleasing and varied ways per Vanderbilt's wish. The rusticated base is a contrast to the smooth limestone used on the remainder of the house.|$|R
