40|$|Quantity <b>stabilizations</b> give agents {{the right}} or {{obligation}} to repeat their earlier trades but otherwise allow for unrestricted trade; they lead to Pareto improvements and Pareto e ¢ ciency and can be implemented with information only about traded quantities, not utility or demand functions. Quantity <b>stabilizations</b> have Coasean advantages: by assigning clear property rights they achieve e ¢ ciency, while the realization of a Pareto improvement can overcome any opposition to reform. Applications exhibit a trade-o ¤ of advantages and drawbacks. In partial-equilibrium settings, quantity <b>stabilizations</b> use relatively little quantity information but obligate agents to repeat their earlier purchases {{as well as their}} sales. General-equilibrium quantity <b>stabilizations</b> can let repetitions of purchases be optional, but more quantity information is necessary...|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{relativistic}} <b>stabilization</b> of flerovium's 7s27p {{valence electron}} configuration, the 0 oxidation state {{should also be}} more stable for flerovium than for lead, as the 7p1/2 electrons begin to also exhibit a mild inert pair effect: this <b>stabilization</b> of the neutral state may bring about some similarities between the behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon. Due to the expected relative inertness of flerovium, its diatomic compounds FlH and FlF should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds PbH and PbF. Flerovium(IV) should be even more electronegative than lead(IV); lead(IV) has electronegativity 2.33 on the Pauling scale; the lead(II) value is only 1.87.|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom on nominal anchors is that exchange rate-based inflation <b>stabilizations</b> lead to economic booms while monetary-based <b>stabilizations</b> lead to recessions. This study finds strong evidence against this view. Rather than determining {{the path of}} economic growth, the choice of nominal anchor appears to be endogenously determined {{by the state of}} the economy. To peg or manage the exchange rate, a high level of international reserves is important, especially when a government's credibility is low after a period of high inflation. After controlling for the level of international reserves and the rate of inflation, growth after monetary-based <b>stabilizations</b> does not significantly differ from that following exchange rate-based stabilizations.; Economic Research Working Paper 9914 Inflation (Finance) ...|$|R
