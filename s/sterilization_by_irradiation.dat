40|$|Dengue and dengue {{hemorrhagic fever}} are {{increasing}} public health problems {{with an estimated}} 50 – 100  million new infections each year. Aedes aegypti is the major vector of dengue viruses in its range and control of this mosquito would reduce significantly human morbidity and mortality. Present mosquito control methods are not sufficiently effective and new approaches are needed urgently. A “sterile-male-release” strategy based on the release of mosquitoes carrying a conditional dominant lethal gene is an attractive new control methodology. Transgenic strains of Aedes aegypti were engineered to have a repressible female-specific flightless phenotype using either two separate transgenes or a single transgene, based {{on the use of}} a female-specific indirect flight muscle promoter from the Aedes aegypti Actin- 4 gene. These strains eliminate the need for <b>sterilization</b> <b>by</b> <b>irradiation,</b> permit male-only release (“genetic sexing”), and enable the release of eggs instead of adults.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ionizing}} radiation on the physicochemical properties of chloramphenicol in solid {{state has been}} studied. The compound was e-beam irradiated with doses from the range 25 – 400 kGy and the possible changes were detected in the organoleptic methods (colour, form, odour, solubility and clarity), by SEM observations, X-ray, chromatography (TLC), spectrophotometry (UV, IR, EPR) and thermal (DSC) methods. No significant changes relative to the unirradiated sample were observed {{as a result of}} irradiation with the dose of 25 kGy – a standard dose for radiation sterilization, besides free radicals generation. Higher doses were found to produce a change in colour, increase in absorbance (UV), changes in the XRD spectra and appearance of products of radiolysis. The presence of the radiolysis products was confirmed by the TLC method, indirectly by DSC showing a decrease in the melting point from 0. 2 to 4. 5 °C and enthalpy from 3. 8 to 23. 3 J g– 1, respectively. A linear relationship was obtained between the irradiation dose (25 – 400 kGy) and the melting point of chloramphenicol, characterised by the correlation coefficient r= 0. 9968. The EPR signal intensity increased with increasing dose of irradiation and the lifetime of the free radicals was longer than 6 months. No changes were detected in SEM and IR spectra. As follows from our results, the DSC method is most suitable for a fast monitoring of the drugs subjected to <b>sterilization</b> <b>by</b> <b>irradiation</b> as it permits detection of changes occurring even on irradiation with low doses and their quantitative description...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gamma {{irradiation}} {{has been}} widely used for sterilization of bone allografts. However, gamma irradiation alters proteins. This is favorable when it reduces immunogenicity, but is undesirable when osteoinductive proteins are damaged. Although the effect of gamma irradiation on BMPs has been studied, the effect of irradiation {{on the process of}} incorporation of morselized bone chips remains unclear. We studied the effects of <b>sterilization</b> <b>by</b> gamma <b>irradiation</b> on the incorporation of impacted morselized allografts. METHODS: Bone chambers with impacted allografts, rinsed impacted allografts, allografts that were rinsed and subsequently irradiated, and an empty control were implanted in proximal medial tibiae of goats. Incorporation was evaluated using histology and histomorphometry. RESULTS: Histology revealed evidence of bone graft incorporation, which proceeded in a similar way in unprocessed, rinsed, and both rinsed and irradiated bone grafts. After 12 weeks, no difference in bone and tissue ingrowth was found between the unprocessed, the rinsed, and the rinsed and subsequently irradiated allografts. The amount of unresorbed graft remnant was highest in the unprocessed bone grafts. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that sterilization with gamma irradiation does not influence the incorporation of impacted rinsed bone allografts...|$|R

Selected samples were also incubated following <b>sterilization</b> <b>by</b> gamma <b>irradiation</b> (50 kGy) to investigate the effects of microorganisims on soil solution C dynamics.

The organically-complexed Al concentration in soil solution was significantly increased by air-drying and re-wetting soil; the organic Al concentration decreased with increased time of incubation to levels comparable with that present in field-moist samples. Inorganic monomeric Al reached a stable concentration, comparable with that in field moist samples, when air-dry soils were re-wet and incubated for 1 day.

40|$|Three {{successive}} emergent macrophytes (Typha latifolia L., Phragmites australis (Cav.) Steudel and Glyceria maxima (Hartman) Holmbly) {{were each}} grown in substrates collected {{from three different}} zones of shoreline vegetation development (non- vegetated sediment, the interface between T. latifolia and P. australis, and degenerating P. australis). The aim {{of the study was}} to assess whether accumulation of litter changes growth conditions of P. australis, and to determine its effects on pre- and post successional plant species. The study was carried out by means of pot experiments in a glasshouse. Seedlings of the three species were cultured in fertilized and unfertilized substrates under both waterlogged and drained conditions. In its own litter, growth of P. australis was strongly reduced, compared with the productivity of plants in substrates from preceeding successional stages, and could not be compensated for by fertilization or soil drainage. The redox potential of the substrate was not strongly reduced and the sediment density was well above the critical level. Soil <b>sterilization</b> <b>by</b> gamma- <b>irradiation</b> did not improve growth substantially, although there was some positive effect in unfertilized substrate. Phytotoxic compounds might have caused poor growth of P. australis in its own litter. T. latifolia and G. maxima were relatively less affected by the P. australis litter. The possible importance of litter accumulation on species replacement in shoreline vegetation is discussed. It is concluded that the accumulation of organic matter should be considered as a factor affecting spatio-temporal processes in littoral vegetation owing to its specific impact on the functioning of individual dominant plant species.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Bone allografts carry {{a risk of}} infection, so {{terminal}} <b>sterilization</b> <b>by</b> gamma <b>irradiation</b> at 25 kGy is recommended; but is deleterious to bone quality. Contemporary bone banking significantly reduces initial allograft bioburden, {{questioning the}} need to sterilize at 25 kGy. METHODS:We inoculated allograft bone with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus pumilus, then exposed them to gamma irradiation at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 kGy. Mechanical and biological properties of allografts were also assessed. Our aim was to determine an optimal dose that achieves sterility assurance while minimizing deleterious effects on allograft tissue. RESULTS: 20 - 25 kGy eliminated both organisms at concentrations from 101 to 103 CFU, while 10 - 15 kGy sterilized bone samples to a bioburden concentration of 102 CFU. Irradiation did not generate pro-inflammatory bone surfaces, as evidenced by macrophage activation, nor did it affect attachment or proliferation of osteoblasts. At doses = 10 kGy, the toughness of cortical bone was reduced (P< 0. 05), and attachment and fusion of osteoclasts onto irradiated bone declined at 20 and 25 kGy (P< 0. 05). There was no change in collagen cross-links, but a significant dose-response increase in denatured collagen (P< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS:Our mechanical and cell biological data converge on 15 kGy as a threshold for radiation sterilization of bone allografts. Between 5 and 15 kGy, bone banks can undertake validation that provides allografts with an acceptable sterility assurance level, improving their strength and biocompatibility significantly. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:The application of radiation sterilization doses between 5 and 15 kGy will improve bone allograft mechanical performance and promote integration, while retaining sterility assurance levels. Improved quality of allograft bone will promote superior clinical outcomes. Griffith Health, School of Medical ScienceFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|Although the United States {{food supply}} is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} safest in the world, foodborne illnesses remain a concern. Each year, millions of Americans become ill and as many as 5000 die from foodborne infections. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that medical treatment and productivity losses associated with foodborne illnesses cost as much as $ 37 billion annually. Irradiation, which involves exposing food briefly to radiant energy, can reduce or eliminate microorganisms that contaminate food or cause spoilage. So far, only limited quantities of irradiated foods—spices, herbs, dry vegetable seasonings, and some fresh fruits, vegetables, and poultry—have been available in the United States. Major purchasers are health care and food service establishments. The World Health Organization reviewed 500 studies and concluded that food irradiation poses no toxicological, microbiological, or nutritional problems. In more than 40 years, there have been no accidents in North America involving transport of the types of radioactive isotopes used for irradiation.
