5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a {{boy on the}} male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the <b>social</b> <b>learning</b> <b>theory</b> of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|According to the <b>social</b> <b>learning</b> <b>theory</b> (more {{recently}} expanded {{as social}} cognitive theory), behavioural change {{is determined by}} environmental, personal, and behavioural elements. Each factor affects each of the others. For example, in congruence {{with the principles of}} self-efficacy, an individual's thoughts affect their behaviour and an individual's characteristics elicit certain responses from the social environment. Likewise, an individual's environment affects the development of personal characteristics as well as the person's behavior, and an individual's behaviour may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels. <b>Social</b> <b>learning</b> <b>theory</b> focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors, which are hypothesised to determine behavioral change.|$|E

25|$|No {{correlation}} (positive or negative) {{exists between}} intelligence and shyness. Research indicates that shy {{children have a}} harder time expressing their knowledge in social situations (which most modern curricula utilize) and because they do not engage actively in discussions, teachers view them as less intelligent. In line with <b>social</b> <b>learning</b> <b>theory,</b> an unwillingness to engage with classmates and teachers makes it more difficult for shy students to learn. Test scores, however, indicate that shyness is unrelated to actual academic knowledge, and therefore only academic engagement. Depending on the level of a teacher's own shyness, more indirect (vs. socially oriented) strategies are used with shy individuals to assess knowledge in the classroom, and accommodations are made. Observed peer evaluations of shy people during initial meeting and social interactions thereafter found that peers evaluate shy individuals as less intelligent during the first encounter. During subsequent interactions, however, peers perceived shy individuals' intelligence more positively.|$|E
40|$|This qualitative, explorative study, which {{comprises}} four essays, {{focuses on}} knowledge management (KM).

Drawing on these three concepts and on becoming ontology and extended epistemology as research philosophies the study suggests the ‘becoming epistemology’ concept and develops the ‘becoming to know’ framework. The framework proposes becoming as phronesis of dialectic interactions between learning and knowing. It shows how becoming to know evolves as an interplay between concrete experience and logical thinking {{in the present and}} in a living context. The proposed framework could be considered a contribution to the current development phase of the knowledge creation theory of KM because it illustrates how ontological and epistemological knowledge spirals come together, which is the essence of the knowledge creation theory of KM...|$|R

500|$|Reiss {{concluded}} that Sexual Preference [...] "has value for suggesting directions and the likely worth of ideas", but that given its shortcomings {{there was no}} way in which its authors could definitively resolve the issues they explored, despite their claim to [...] "once and for all" [...] discredit some theoretical ideas about homosexuality. Reiss wrote that Bell et al. asked questions that were [...] "vague" [...] and [...] "open-ended", had an [...] "arbitrary and rigid conception" [...] of what could be done with their data and lacked [...] "theoretical development" [...] in its handling, and deliberately minimized the importance of the predictor variables they used to test psychoanalytic and other theories. He found their conclusion that sexual orientation has a biological basis unconvincing. DeLamater wrote that Sexual Preference benefited from Bell et al.′s [...] "eclectic theoretical basis", which drew from the psychodynamic model, <b>social</b> <b>learning</b> <b>theory,</b> sociological models that emphasize the importance of peer relationships, and labeling theory. However, while he accepted Bell et al.′s claim that their study was methodologically superior to prior work on homosexuals, he still found it problematic for many reasons and hesitated to endorse its conclusions. In his view, the path analysis involved [...] "arbitrary classification and sequencing of variables".|$|E

2500|$|The {{feminist theory}} of male-female rape is {{summarized}} by Susan Brownmiller's statement: [...] "rape {{is nothing more}} or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear". Some feminists assert that male domination of women in socio-political and economic domains is the ultimate cause of most rapes, and consider male-female rape to be a crime of power that has little or nothing to do with sex itself. However, a 1983 study comparing 14 indicators of male dominance and the incidence of rape in 26 American cities found no correlations, except one where greater male dominance actually decreased the incidence of rape. <b>Social</b> <b>learning</b> <b>theory</b> of rape is similar to the feminist theory and links cultural traditions such as imitation, sex-violence linkages, rape myths (e.g., [...] "women secretly desire to be raped"), and desensitization to be the core causes of rape.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{what kinds}} of knowledge, knowing and learning are required for addressing resource dilemmas {{in the context of}} sustainable development. It also explains why and how the SLIM project focused on <b>social</b> <b>learning</b> for managing water resources. The range of <b>learning</b> <b>theories</b> that informed SLIM are discussed, as is the historical pattern of lineages, relationships and discontinuities among these and other theories. Whilst conceptions of <b>social</b> <b>learning</b> are contested, most perspectives raise questions about the nature of knowledge and knowing. It is argued that becoming aware of our assumptions regarding learning, knowing and how we develop knowledge, can help us find out more about what we need to know. The nature of resource dilemmas, implications for learning, what learning involves, its interdisciplinary nature and its history of ideas are all considered. An overview of <b>learning</b> <b>theories</b> is given, explaining their potential relevance for researchers, policymakers and practitioners in environmental contexts. The discourse, theory and practice of <b>social</b> <b>learning</b> and factors that influenced the choice of <b>social</b> <b>learning</b> <b>theories</b> by SLIM researchers are discussed. The paper concludes by considering how understanding what <b>social</b> <b>learning</b> involves can contribute, in a practical way, to dealing with resource dilemmas...|$|R
