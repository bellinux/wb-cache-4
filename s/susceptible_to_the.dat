5|$|American crows are common, widespread, and <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West Nile virus, {{making them}} {{useful as a}} {{bioindicator}} to track the virus's spread. Direct transmission of the virus from American crows to humans is unheard of and unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In general, Cabernet Sauvignon {{has good}} {{resistance}} to most grape diseases, powdery mildew {{being the most}} noted exception. It is, however, <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vine diseases Eutypella scoparia and excoriose.|$|E
5|$|A {{field study}} of the {{invasion}} of the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi into the Brisbane Ranges National Park in Victoria in 1971 indicated that Epacris impressa was moderately <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pathogen. Inoculation of seedlings confirmed this. Fieldwork in the Brisbane Ranges National Park in 1985 showed that there was some evidence that E. impressa seedlings were able to recolonise areas that had been infested with P. cinnamomi a decade before.|$|E
50|$|Pasteurella spp. are {{generally}} <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> chloramphenicol, <b>the</b> penicillins, tetracycline, and the macrolides.|$|R
50|$|The only {{significant}} disease Japanese walnuts are <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> is <b>the</b> Walnut Bunch Disease.|$|R
50|$|Like other nitriles, {{adiponitrile}} is <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> hydrolysis. <b>The</b> resulting {{adipic acid}} however is more cheaply prepared by other routes.|$|R
5|$|Homarus gammarus is <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disease gaffkaemia, {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Aerococcus viridans. Although it is frequently found in American lobsters, the disease has only been seen in captive H.gammarus, where prior occupation of the tanks by H.americanus could not be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The Tor Project {{recommended}} that Tor relay operators and hidden service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted that Tor relays use {{two sets of}} keys and that Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay. 586 relays later found to be <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Heartbleed bug were taken off-line as a precautionary measure.|$|E
5|$|The onion eelworm (Ditylenchus dipsaci), a tiny {{parasitic}} soil-living nematode, causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young {{plants are}} killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site {{should not be}} used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots, parsnips, and beans, which are also <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eelworm.|$|E
50|$|The K-S2 {{also does}} not have an AA filter which {{increases}} sharpness but makes it more <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> moiré. <b>The</b> K-S2 comes in 7 color combinations.|$|R
50|$|Not overly <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> any of <b>the</b> {{more common}} {{diseases}} and parasites.|$|R
50|$|Dogs {{and cats}} are very <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> {{poisoning}} after <b>the</b> consumption of certain species.|$|R
5|$|The {{phylloxera}} {{epidemic in}} the 19th century severely affected the Languedoc wine industry, killing off {{many of the}} higher quality Vitis vinifera that were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> louse. American rootstock that was naturally resistant to phylloxera did not take well to the limestone soil on the hillside. In place of these vines, acres of the lower quality Aramon, Alicante Bouschet and Carignan were planted.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; of those found in A. ocreata, α-amanitin is the most prevalent and along with β-amanitin {{is likely to be}} responsible for the toxic effects. The major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism stop and the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the first organ encountered after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> toxins.|$|E
5|$|Both {{dogs and}} horses are <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{gastrointestinal}} side effects associated with salicylates, {{but it is}} a convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of laminitis in horses. It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment. Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian; in particular, cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Areas of Lilydale {{township}} are low-lying and <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> flooding from <b>the</b> Olinda Creek.|$|R
5000|$|Fens are {{delicate}} habitats <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> impacts from livestock grazing, hydrologic alteration, {{construction and}} {{continued use of}} roads, and peat mining. [...] Rich fen habitats are especially <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> modification. <b>The</b> surface water chemistry of rich fens is sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic influences.|$|R
50|$|Muscles lacking reticulospinal tract inputs are not <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> SEM. <b>The</b> ability <b>to</b> elicit SEM {{has been}} used as {{evidence}} for reticulospinal tract connections <b>to</b> <b>the</b> muscles governing grasp of the human hand.|$|R
5|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.|$|E
5|$|Farm {{animals such as}} {{cows and}} horses as well as pet animals are also <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effects of lead toxicity. Sources of lead {{exposure}} in pets can {{be the same as}} those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead in toys made for pets. Lead poisoning in a pet dog may indicate that children in the same household are at increased risk for elevated lead levels.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E
5000|$|The {{experience}} led him {{to state}} in 1989 that [...] "I wonder, now, whether the Leppings Lane terraces at Hillsborough is somehow <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> retaining <b>the</b> pressure created in crowd build up".|$|R
50|$|In the book, Frank {{leaves the}} Unifactor, {{and is thus}} <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> change for <b>the</b> first time.|$|R
50|$|Somewhat {{like the}} parent amines, imines are mildly basic and {{reversibly}} protonate to give iminium salts. Iminium derivatives are particularly <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> reduction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amines using transfer hydrogenation {{or by the}} stoichiometric action of sodium cyanoborohydride. Since imines derived from unsymmetrical ketones are prochiral, their reduction is a useful method for the synthesis of chiral amines.|$|R
5|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common nutritional deficiency in the world. When loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake, a state of latent iron deficiency occurs, which over time leads to iron-deficiency anemia if left untreated, which is characterised by an insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of hemoglobin. Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age), and people with poor diet are most <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disease. Most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild, but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in infants and children.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, are more <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} are fully aware of Veridian's nature, and often try to manipulate the system {{in order to stop}} bad things from happening to them (and sometimes to mitigate the evil effects of some of Veridian's projects). They are also all <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> potential rewards the company can offer despite the consequences of their actions, such as the company's attempt to hire Lem's mother, or the company's introduction of scented light bulbs with known flaws. Much of the comedy of the show comes from {{the characters}}' navigation of these morally ambiguous areas.|$|E
50|$|DEHP hydrolyzes to mono-ethylhexyl {{phthalate}} (MEHP) {{and subsequently}} <b>to</b> phthalate salts. <b>The</b> released alcohol is <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> oxidation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aldehyde and carboxylic acid.|$|R
50|$|Devices {{fabricated}} in lightly doped epitaxial layers {{grown on}} heavily doped substrates are also less <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> latch-up. <b>The</b> heavily doped layer {{acts as a}} current sink where excess minority carriers can quickly recombine.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of helicopters {{has to be}} more precise than for fixed-wing model aircraft, because helicopters are <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> even <b>the</b> smallest of vibrations, which can cause problems when the helicopter is in flight.|$|R
5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern crested newt, {{and the northern}} crested newt in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, especially in the crested newts, means that native species can be genetically polluted through the introduction of close species, {{as it is the}} case with the Italian crested newt introduced in the range of the northern crested newt. Warmer and wetter winters due to global warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, introduced to Europe from Asia.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the TgPVR mouse has {{had a profound effect}} on oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) production. Previously, monitoring the safety of OPV had to be performed using monkeys, because only primates are <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> virus. In 1999, the World Health Organization approved the use of the TgPVR mouse as an alternative method of assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine against poliovirus type-3. In 2000, the mouse model was approved for tests of vaccines against type-1 and type-2 poliovirus.|$|E
