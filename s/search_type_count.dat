The riddle <b>search</b> <b>type</b> is {{the outline of a}} relationship between “space search” and sample space reduction based on individual concrete actions (interventions) applied directly to the task.

When the so-called fictitious domain approaches are used for the numerical realization of state problems, the resulting minimized function is non-differentiable and stair-wise, in general. Such complicated behaviour excludes the use of classical local methods. Specific modifications of the above-mentioned global methods for our class of problems are described. Numerical results of several model examples computed by different variants of genetic and random <b>search</b> <b>type</b> algorithms are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we use the}} {{association}} between various measures of the morphological family and decision latencies to reveal {{the way in which}} the components of Dutch and English compounds are processed. The results show that for constituents of concatenated compounds in both languages, a position-related token count of the morphological family plays a role, whereas English open compounds show an effect of a <b>type</b> <b>count,</b> similar to the effect of family size for simplex words. When Dutch compounds are written with an artificial space, they reveal no effect of <b>type</b> <b>count,</b> which shows that the differential effect for the English open compounds is not superficial. The final experiment provides converging evidence for the lexical consequences of the space in English compounds. Decision latencies for English simplex words are better predicted from counts of the morphological family that include concatenated and hyphenated but not open family members...|$|R

40|$|In 2004 Alexander Postnikov and Boris Shapiro {{introduced}} {{a class of}} commutative algebras for non-directed graphs. There are two main types of such algebras, algebras of the first <b>type</b> <b>count</b> spanning trees and algebras  of the second <b>type</b> <b>count</b> spanning forests. These algebras {{have a number of}} interesting properties including an explicit formula for their Hilbert series. In this thesis we mainly work with the second type of algebras, we discover more properties of the original algebra and construct a few generalizations. In particular we prove that the algebra counting forests depends only on graphical matroid of the graph and converse. Furthermore, its "K-theoretic" filtration reconstructs the whole graph. We introduse $t$ labelled algebras of a graph, their Hilbert series contains complete information about the Tutte polynomial of the initial graph. Finally we introduce similar algebras for hypergraphs. To do this, we define spanning forests and trees of a hypergraph and the corresponding "hypergraphical" matroid...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} on anagram solution has produced two original findings. First, it {{has shown that}} a new bigram frequency measure called top rank, {{which is based on}} a comparison of summed bigram frequencies, is an important predictor of anagram difficulty. Second, it has suggested that the measures from a <b>type</b> <b>count</b> are better than token measures at predicting anagram difficulty. Testing these hypotheses has been difficult because the computation of the bigram statistics is difficult. We present a program that calculates bigram measures for two-to nine-letter words. We then show how the program can be used to compare the contribution of top rank and other bigram frequency measures derived from both a token and a <b>type</b> <b>count.</b> Contrary to previous research, we report that type measures are not better at predicting anagram solution times and that top rank is not the best predictor of anagram difficulty. Lastly we use this program to show that type bigram frequencies are not as good as token bigram frequencies at predicting word identification reaction time...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{potential}} for automated indices related to speech delivery, language use, and topic development to model human judgments of TOEFL speaking proficiency in second language (L 2) speech samples. For this study, 244 transcribed TOEFL speech samples taken from 244 L 2 learners were analyzed using automated indices taken from Coh-Metrix, CPIDR, and LIWC. A stepwise linear regression was used to explain the variance in human judgments of independent speaking ability and overall speaking proficiency. Automated indices related to word <b>type</b> <b>counts,</b> causal cohesion, and lexical diversity predicted 52 % {{of the variance in}} human ratings for the independent speech samples. Automated indices related to word <b>type</b> <b>counts</b> and word frequency predicted 61 % of the variance of the human scores of overall speaking proficiency. These analyses demonstrate that, {{even in the absence of}} indices related to pronunciation and prosody (e. g., phonological accuracy, intonation, and stress), automated indices related to vocabulary size, causality, and word frequency can predict a significant amount of the variance in human ratings of speaking proficiency. These findings have important implications for understanding the construct of speaking proficiency and for the development of automatic scoring techniques...|$|R
