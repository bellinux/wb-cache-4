40|$|Abstract. Thermoelectric (TE) {{devices are}} an {{interested}} family of energy harvesters which could convert the thermal energy into electricity. However, the temperature drops at interface between thermoelectric materials and heat <b>source,</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> and electrodes reduce efficiency of thermoelectric devices. As a solution, thermal interface materials (TIM) which have high thermal conductance and low thermal interface resistance with adjacent materials {{are added to}} the device. In this paper, the organic material is considered as the base material for a TE energy harvester device. Also, carbon nanotube (CNT) is applied as TIM, because of its high one dimentional electrical and thermal conductance. A finite element analysis is carried out in order to investigate the role of thermal contact resistance on heat transfer at TE device. To do this, a thermoelectric leg is simulated with two structure consist of (a) TE material and electrodes in direct contact (b) TE material and electrodes with CNT interface and the results are compared. It is shown that CNT layer reduces heat dissipation at the interface and so the temperature difference at the both sides of polymer is increased, which finally results the enhancement of device output voltage...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} thermal {{performance}} of the basic organic Rankine cycle (ORC) several modifications are proposed in literature. One of these modifications {{is the use of}} zeotropic mixtures as working fluids. Zeotropic mixtures as working fluids have the ability to better match the heating (cooling) temperature profiles of the heat <b>source</b> (<b>heat</b> <b>sink).</b> As a result the irreversibilities associated with a finite temperature thermal heat transfer are reduced. In a previous study a first law mixture selection method was proposed, considering most of the commonly used hydrocarbons and siloxane substances as components in various mixture concentrations. This paper extends the previous study by comparing the basic ORC and the ORC with zeotropic mixtures as working fluids based on a second law analysis. The zeotropic mixtures under study are: R 245 fa-pentane, R 245 fa-R 365 mfc, isopentane-isohexane, isopentane-cyclohexane, isopentane-isohexane, isobutane-isopentane and pentane-hexane. The exergetic efficiency, defined as the ratio of shaft power output and input waste heat exergy, is used as optimization criterion. Furthermore, the irreversibilities associated with the different components of the ORC are assessed under different mixture compositions. Next, the optimization potential when using zeotropic mixtures is thoroughly discussed. The results show that the evaporator amounts for the highest exergy loss. However, the best performance is achieved when the condenser heat profiles are matched. A relative increase of exergetic efficiency between 7. 1 % and 14. 2 % is found for a waste heat source at 150 °C. The ORC with isobutane-isopentane as working fluid has the highest second law efficiency (32. 05 %) under optimal mixture concentration and evaporation pressure...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 A {{two-dimensional}} {{model for}} predicting {{the rate of}} radiation heat transfer for the interior of an industrial furnace is described. The model is two-dimensional due to the assumptions of the heat source as an infinite radiating plane and the heat sink as rows of parallel tubes that are both infinite in length and in number. A refractory back wall, located behind the tube rows, is also included {{in some of the}} model configurations. The optical properties for the heat <b>source,</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> and refractory back wall are simplified by assuming the "black-body" case: all are treated as perfect absorbers and emitters of radiation. This assumption allows three different solution techniques-a graphical, crossed-string, and numerical method-to be used in solving for the radiant transfer rate. The numerical method, an innovative Monte Carlo technique, is the one employed in this study. Hottel used a graphical technique to solve the furnace model for a two row configuration in which the tubes are arranged on equilateral triangular centers. His results, along with those produced by the crossed-string method, are used in this work to validate the numerical technique. Having been validated, the numerical method was then employed to extend Hottel's work by adding more tube rows to the original equilateral triangular configuration and by generalizing the results to isosceles arrangements. Findings of this investigation are summarized in a table that lists the direct view factors for a ten tube row configuration arranged in an equilateral triangular array. Values from this table can be used to solve the transfer rate problem for twenty different cases by assuming a nonconducting refractory back wall. Results for twelve cases are represented graphically in this document The results are used to demonstrate the importance of a refractory back wall on overall radiation absorption. Examinations of the two row and five row cases for an isosceles triangular array indicate that the tabular values can be applied to any isosceles arrangement if the ratio of row separation distance to tube center-to-center distance is 0. 7 or greater...|$|E

Recently, thermoelectric devices (TED) are also being used as the <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> in <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> laboratory experiments.
