It also had political connotations, implying that the Normans were on a level with the Romans.

5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata {{to be part of the}} Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a <b>similar</b> <b>pattern</b> to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E
5|$|Although Ferugliotherium {{teeth are}} much lower-crowned {{than those of}} the Sudamericidae, they share an {{essentially}} <b>similar</b> <b>pattern</b> on the occlusal (chewing) surface of mf1 and mf2, similar incisors, backward jaw movement during chewing, and enamel with small prisms. Ferugliotherium is thought to have been a small animal, with a body mass of about 70g (2.5oz), and may have eaten insects and plant material. Its remains have been found in two geological formations of southern Argentina, where {{it is part of a}} mammal fauna that also includes the sudamericid Gondwanatherium and a variety of dryolestoids.|$|E

They were typically a shade of gray or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his Non-commissioned officer status, or as a personal flare, to the ubiquitous service pants. Noncommissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E
5|$|For both offices, the Republicans {{nominated}} regulars. The incumbent treasurer, Francis D. Pastorius, defeated William M. Paschall and Gibson, with 71,364 to Pastorius, 41,244 to Paschall, and 10,464 to Gibson. The Democrats nominated Joseph F. Vogt without opposition, {{though he}} had died in April, {{a month before the}} May primary. (Vogt's was the only name on the ballot.) In September, the Democratic City Committee nominated State Representative Granville E. Jones in Vogt's place. For coroner, the nominations followed a <b>similar</b> <b>pattern.</b> The Hamilton-Meade faction nominated Edward E. Holloway, who defeated Meehan man Roger J. Soens and independent Vincent E. Costello for the Republican nomination. The Democrats renominated the incumbent, Joseph Ominsky, over challenger Gust G. Tatlas.|$|E
5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN and {{diseases}} similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In German Shepherd dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a <b>similar</b> <b>pattern</b> of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Computational {{methods are}} {{prevailing}} in identifying protein intrinsic disorder. The results from predictors are often given as per-residue disorder scores. The scores describe the disorder propensity of amino acids of a protein {{and can be}} further represented as a disorder curve. Many proteins share <b>similar</b> <b>patterns</b> in their disorder curves. The <b>similar</b> <b>patterns</b> are often associated with similar functions and evolutionary origins. Therefore, finding and characterizing specific patterns of disorder curves provides a unique and attractive perspective of studying the function of intrinsically disordered proteins. In this study, we developed a new computational tool named IDalign using dynamic programming. This tool is able to identify <b>similar</b> <b>patterns</b> among disorder curves, {{as well as to}} present the distribution o...|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings. Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to the winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings. Coming {{on the heels of the}} 1926 Miami hurricane where a <b>similar</b> <b>pattern</b> had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes.|$|E
5|$|King St Stephen {{has been}} a popular theme in Hungarian poetry {{since the end of}} the 13th century. The {{earliest}} poems were religious hymns which portrayed the holy king as the apostle of the Hungarians. Secular poetry, especially poems written for his feast day, followed a <b>similar</b> <b>pattern,</b> emphasizing Stephen's role as the first king of Hungary. Poets described Stephen as the symbol of national identity and independence and of the ability of the Hungarian nation to survive historical cataclysms during the Communist regime between 1949 and 1989.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{came in at}} {{the start}} of the second day's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added, before falling at 7/86, part of a {{collapse}} of 5/27. He hit two sixes in his innings, including one from the first ball that he faced, feeling that a defensive strategy would be almost impossible in the difficult conditions. Australia ended at 101, and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury. Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire, 6/51. Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings, which followed a <b>similar</b> <b>pattern</b> to their first effort. Wickets fell steadily as Johnston (6/18) and Miller (3/49) bowled 31.2 of the 36.2 overs.|$|E

However the total points by each player proved even closer than that at that Wimbledon final, as Federer won 1 more point than Nadal (174 vs 173) yet still lost this final.|$|E

Birds of the subspecies rutilans are off-white on their cheeks and the sides of their necks, and have pale grey underparts.

A match away to Finland gave San Marino their first goal away from home in the European championships, but the team lost 4–1. Their only other goal came in a 3–1 home defeat by the Faroe Islands; the two wins over San Marino were the only points gained by the Faroe Islands in the group. In the return match, a 3–0 scoreline in Toftir, is the Faroe Islands record competitive win.|$|E
5|$|Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios is {{difficult}} because juveniles are harder to catch; with current sampling methods, estimates of age distribution vary widely. Annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age. The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19%. For females, the annual survival rate rises to 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a <b>similar</b> <b>pattern,</b> but are lower overall than females, creating an average male age {{lower than that of}} the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions. For instance, a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region, resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year. Age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} minor exchanges {{of fire and}} some patrol activity, there was a lull in the battle on 14March in the {{northern}} sector. The following day, three Japanese infantry battalions fell on the US positions before dawn. They made some progress around Cox's Creek, but US forces counterattacked with air support, bazookas and flamethrowers, retaking part of the line. A platoon of M4 Sherman tanks arrived during the afternoon, and at around 3:00pm they attacked the Japanese with supporting artillery fire and regained more of the perimeter. From there, the battle followed a <b>similar</b> <b>pattern,</b> with a lull in the fighting on 16March, followed by a renewed effort by the Japanese the next day, with several US positions being overrun.|$|E
