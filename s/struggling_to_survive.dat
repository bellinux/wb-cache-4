25|$|In 1881, nearly 75% of Irish {{people lived}} in rural areas. About 38% of these {{comprised}} the agricultural workforce, of which nearly 70% were agricultural labourers, 25% of these forming a class of 'landless' labourers, an estimated 60,000 in number, together with their families amounting to {{nearly a quarter of}} a million of the rural population, <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in the squalor of 40,000 one room 'cabins' (together with their animals if they could afford them).

25|$|Batzaria's {{contribution}} {{in the press}} was diversified in later years. With discreet help from Romanian officials, he and Nicolae Papahagi founded, in Thessaloniki, the French-language sheet Courrier des Balkans ("Balkan Dispatch", published from 1904). It was specifically designed as a propaganda sheet for the Aromanian cause, informing its international readership about the Latin origins and philo-Romanian agenda of Aromanian nationalism. He also worked on, or helped found, other Aromanian organs in the vernacular, including Glasul Macedoniei ("The Macedonian Voice") and Grai Bun ("The Good Speech"). Late in 1906, Revista Macedoniei turned back into Românul de la Pind, <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> as a self-funded national tribune. Batzaria also replaced N. Macedoneanu as Grai Bun editor in 1907, but the magazine was under-financed and went bankrupt the same year.

25|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in a radio}} address, the Emperor of Japan announces {{the end of the}} War. Suzu, having faced countless {{setbacks}} and tragedies during the war, and had grown accustomed to the single-minded focus of keeping the family alive, is forced to accept the reality of her losses and temporarily falls into despair. Soon, the times begin to change rapidly: US occupation forces, no longer the enemy, come to Kure and provide food for its citizens. Suzu visits her grandmother Ito's family house in Kusatsu, a rural town to the west of Hiroshima and out of the affected area, to see her sister Sumi, who took refuge from deserted Hiroshima and is the only survivor of Suzu's family. Sumi informs Suzu of the fate of their parents; Sumi herself has fallen seriously ill from the radiation left behind by the atomic‐bomb radiation. Shūsaku, who returns from his naval service, meets with Suzu by chance in a deserted area of Hiroshima and tells her that he has found a new job. They come across a little girl, a war (atomic bomb) orphan <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in the ruins after losing her mother, and adopt her into their home in Kure. Suzu regains her passion for life slowly, with the courage and affection of her friends and family. As the credits roll, their adopted daughter is shown growing up in Suzu & Shūsaku's family home, sewing clothes with her own hands, aided by Suzu in peaceful post-war Japan.|$|E

[...] Norfolk felt that: [...] "For all the characters' faults, none of them is presented as inauthentic or standing for something that we are intended to disbelieve. On the disparity in sympathy for Sarah and Little Bee, Cleave assessed: [...] "Sarah inevitably suffers by proximity to Little Bee, who is much easier to like. If Sarah is more twisted, I think it's because her path through life has necessarily been more convoluted. Little Bee's life is extremely harrowing but it is also very simple – she is swimming very hard against the current, <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and not to be swept away. Sarah doesn’t have the luxury of knowing in which direction she should swim." ...|$|E
