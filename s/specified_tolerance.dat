25|$|Deming's {{teachings and}} {{philosophy}} are clearly illustrated {{by examining the}} results they produced after they were adopted by Japanese industry, as the following example shows. Ford Motor Company was simultaneously manufacturing a car model with transmissions made in Japan and the United States. Soon after the car model was on the market, Ford customers were requesting the model with Japanese transmission over the US-made transmission, and {{they were willing to}} wait for the Japanese model. As both transmissions were made to the same specifications, Ford engineers could not understand the customer preference for the model with Japanese transmission. Finally, Ford engineers decided to take apart the two different transmissions. The American-made car parts were all within <b>specified</b> <b>tolerance</b> levels. On the other hand, the Japanese car parts were virtually identical to each other, and much closer to the nominal values for the parts—e.g., if a part was supposed to be one foot long, plus or minus 1/8 of an inch—then the Japanese parts were all within 1/16 of an inch, less variation. This made the Japanese cars run more smoothly and customers experienced fewer problems.|$|E

2500|$|By contrast, the New South Wales Legislative Council {{avoids the}} use of districts entirely, electing all 21 members using a single, statewide {{constituency}} and guaranteeing results that are proportional to the final allocation of preferences. [...] In Victoria, Australia, legislation ensures that each Legislative Council electorate contains almost {{the same number of}} constituents. Problems would occur if the number of candidates to be elected were to be different in each such electorate, as the percentage of voters required to elect a candidate would vary, whilst the total number of voters remain the same. The percentage breakdown could come to vary considerably, but that is allowed for by the requirement that the number of voters and the percentage required for election must be, within a <b>specified</b> <b>tolerance,</b> the same across all electorates. [...] Under Victorian legislation, an electoral review is required should the number of electors in each electorate fall outside the nominated tolerance level. Municipal electoral reviews are undertaken every second term of office.|$|E

50|$|A similar problem occurs {{frequently}} in numerical analysis: {{in order to}} compute a certain result, an iteration {{is intended to be}} carried out until the error is smaller than a chosen tolerance. However, because of rounding errors during the iteration, the <b>specified</b> <b>tolerance</b> can never be reached, resulting in an infinite loop.|$|E

To well explain semantics of geometrical tolerances, a representation model of geometrical tolerances based on First Order Logic (FOL) is presented in this paper. We first investigate the classifications of feature variations and give the FOL representations of them based on these classifications.

Furthermore, we demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} representation model by <b>specifying</b> geometrical <b>tolerance</b> types in an example...|$|R

50|$|Some {{caution is}} {{required}} when using and interpreting T/S parameters. It {{is important to}} mention that individual units may not match manufacturer specifications. Parameters values are almost never individually taken, but are at best averages across a production run, due to inevitable manufacturing variations. Driver characteristics will generally lie within a (sometimes <b>specified)</b> <b>tolerance</b> range. Cms is the least controllable parameter, but typical variations in Cms do not have large effects on the final response.|$|E
50|$|The {{model may}} {{act as a}} {{diagnostic}} monitor. In this mode, the model is run in parallel with {{the operation of the}} installed system. The real time simulator displays the dynamic activity in the system and continuously compares the model with the actual operation.

50|$|DVM {{measurement}} accuracy {{is affected by}} many factors, including temperature, input impedance, and DVM power supply voltage variations. Less expensive DVMs often have input resistance {{on the order of}} 10 MΩ. Precision DVMs can have input resistances of 1 GΩ or higher for the lower voltage ranges (e.g. less than 20 V). To ensure that a DVM's accuracy is within the manufacturer's <b>specified</b> <b>tolerances,</b> it must be periodically calibrated against a voltage standard such as the Weston cell.|$|R
50|$|A good set of {{engineering}} tolerances in a specification, by itself, {{does not imply}} that compliance with those tolerances will be achieved. Actual production of any product (or operation of any system) involves some inherent variation of input and output. Measurement error and statistical uncertainty are also present in all measurements. With a normal distribution, the tails of measured values may extend well beyond plus and minus three standard deviations from the process average. Appreciable portions of one (or both) tails might extend beyond the <b>specified</b> <b>tolerance.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Process Capability indices {{have become}} popular for {{describing}} {{how well a}} process meets <b>specified</b> <b>tolerances.</b> The lack of affinity with the process nonconformance probability p {{and the difficulty of}} dealing with the sampling distribution of their natural estimators affect greatly the use of the traditional indices as Cp, Cpk, Cpm and Cpkm.

Moreover, Bayesian inference procedures under multinomial sampling are developed for simplifying application of the index in industry...|$|R
40|$|Tolerance {{analysis}} is receiving renewed emphasis as industry recognizes that tolerance management {{is a key}} element in their programs for improving quality, reducing overall costs and retaining market share. The specification of tolerances is being elevated from a menial task to a legitimate engineering design function. New engineering models and sophisticated analysis tools are being developed to assist design engineers in <b>specifying</b> <b>tolerances</b> on the basis of performance requirements and manufacturing considerations. This paper presents an overview of tolerance analysis applications to design with emphasis on recent research that is advancing the state of the art. Major topics covered are: 1) New models for tolerance accumulation in mechanical assemblies, including the Motorola Six Sigma model. 2) Algorithms for allocating the <b>specified</b> assembly <b>tolerance</b> among the components of an assembly. 3) The development of 2 -D and 3 -D tolerance analysis models. 4) Methods which account for [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Setback is the {{difference}} between right side and left side wheelbase length. It can also be measured as an angle. Setback less than the manufacturer <b>specified</b> <b>tolerance</b> (for example about 6mm) does not affect car handling. That's because, when the vehicle is turning, one wheel is ahead of the other by several centimetres and therefore the setback is negligible. There are even some car models with different factory setting for right and left side wheelbase length, for various design reasons. An off-spec setback may occur because of a collision or a difference between right and left caster.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{overview}} of tolerance analysis. Tolerancing decisions can profoundly impact the quality and cost of product. There is a strong need for increased attention to tolerance design to enable high-precision assemblies to be manufactured at lower costs. Indeed, tolerance analysis is a key element in industry for improving product quality. Designers want tight tolerances to assure product performance; manufacturers prefer loose tolerances to reduce cost. There is a critical need for a quantitative design tool for <b>specifying</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Tolerance analysis brings the engineering design requirements and manufacturing capabilities together in a common model, where the effects of tolerance specifications on both design and manufacturing requirements can be evaluated quantitatively. Significant amount of literature is related to tolerancing methods. Summaries of state of the art, the most recent developments, and the future trends in tolerancing research can be found. This paper provides a classification of the issues from a mathematical point of view...|$|R
