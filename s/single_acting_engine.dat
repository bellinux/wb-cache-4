50|$|During the Second World War {{production}} {{continued at}} a reduced level; also {{during this period}} prototypes for a medium speed 4 stoke <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> <b>engine</b> were produced, codenamed DU (diesel universal). In the decades {{after the second world}} war the DU engine was developed and modified: 5-, 6- and 8-cylinder versions were produced, turbocharged versions (codenamed DUX) with 50% as much power as the equivalent non turbocharged version were made, as were naturally aspirated versions, including turbocharged and intercooled versions. The company was prosperous up to the 1970s, and its engines used in ships, locomotives (usually shunting type) and for electricity generation.|$|E

The high steam admission pressure (about 600 PSI, 41 Bar), high operating speed (1500 RPM), and uniflow porting allowed steam engine cycle efficiency in excess of 20%, very rare for a reciprocating steam cycle.

50|$|The Cyclone Mark V Engine is a {{steam engine}} {{in which the}} engine, steam generator, {{condenser}} and feed pump are integrated into a single compact unit. The company Cyclone Power Technologies of Pampano Beach, Florida was founded by inventor Harry Schoell to develop and market this engine. The Cyclone Mark V Engine is a six cylinder radial uniflow engine of two inch bore and two inch stroke. Pistons are <b>single</b> <b>acting.</b> The <b>engine</b> is claimed to produce 100 hp at 3600 rpm using steam at 3200 psi and 1200 Â°F.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{illustrated}} in the patent is a vertical <b>single</b> cylinder double <b>acting</b> <b>engine</b> which utilises two rubber gas pumps driven by the crankshaft. One provides the main gas that is mixed with air to power the engine, and the other smaller pump pressurises a gas reservoir {{that is used to}} supply gas to the pilot light. The use of flame ignition within the complex slide mechanism extinguishes the flame at every ignition, which is re-ignited by the pilot. This seemingly complex system was quite successful and was used on several early stationary engines.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a simple Stirling {{research}} engine {{that could be used}} by industrial, university, and government laboratories was studied. The conceptual and final designs, hardware fabrication and the experimental validation of a preprototype stirling laboratory research engine (SLRE) were completed. Also completed was a task to identify the potential markets for research engines of this type. An analytical effort was conducted to provide a stirling cycle computer model. The versatile engine is a horizontally opposed, two piston, <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> stirling <b>engine</b> with a split crankshaft drive mechanism; special instrumentation is installed at all component interfaces. Results of a thermodynamic energy balance for the system are reported. Also included are the engine performance results obtained over a range of speeds, working pressures, phase angles and gas temperatures. The potential for a stirling research engine to support the laboratory requirements of educators and researchers was demonstrated...|$|R
2500|$|The Franchot {{engine is}} a double <b>acting</b> <b>engine</b> invented by [...] in the nineteenth century. A double <b>acting</b> <b>engine</b> {{is one in which}} both sides of the piston are acted upon by the {{pressure}} of the working fluid. One of the simplest forms of a double acting machine, the Franchot engine consists of two pistons and two cylinders and acts like two separate alpha machines. In the Franchot engine, each piston acts in two gas phases, which makes more efficient use of the mechanical components than a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> alpha machine. However, a disadvantage of this machine is that one connecting rod must have a sliding seal at the hot side of the engine, which is difficult when dealing with high pressures and temperatures.|$|R
2500|$|A double <b>acting</b> <b>engine</b> is {{an engine}} where steam {{is applied to}} {{both sides of the}} piston. Earlier steam engines applied steam in only one direction, {{allowing}} momentum or gravity to return the piston to its starting place, but a double <b>acting</b> <b>engine</b> uses steam to force the piston in both directions, thus increasing rotational speed and power. Like the term [...] "simple engine", the term [...] "double acting" [...] is less frequently encountered in the literature since almost all marine engines were of the double acting type.|$|R

50|$|<b>Single</b> <b>acting</b> {{telescopic}} cylinders are {{the simplest}} and most common design. As with a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> rod style cylinder, the <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic cylinder is extended using hydraulic or pneumatic pressure but retracts using external forces when the fluid medium is removed and relieved to the reservoir. This external retraction force is usually gravity acting on {{the weight of the}} load. This external weight must obviously be sufficient to overcome the friction and mechanical losses within the machine design even after the work portion of the machine cycle has been accomplished. In the example above of the dump truck, the weight of the dump body, now raised at an angle of 60 degrees but empty of the load, must be enough to force the unpressurized hydraulic fluid out of the cylinder and cause it to retract to the fully collapsed position.|$|R

2500|$|A hybrid between piston and rotary {{configuration}} is {{a double}} <b>acting</b> <b>engine.</b> This design rotates the displacers {{on either side of}} the power piston.

50|$|Whenever fluid is {{supplied}} to the cylinder the piston will move. This movement of piston is called as stroke. The piston can move in forward or reverse direction.The cylinders {{can be classified}} as double <b>acting</b> or <b>single</b> <b>acting.</b> In <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> cylinder work will be performed only in the forward stroke. The fluid will be supplied to the cylinder only during the forward stroke. The return stroke is achieved by the spring mounted in the cylinder. In double acting cylinder {{there will be two}} ports for the supply of fluid. Work can be obtained both at forward and reverse strokes. Directional control valves required for the easy operation of double acting cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The Cheviot {{was built}} by Charles Mitchell and Co., of Low Walker in Newcastle upon Tyne, England in 1870.

50|$|Some late steam engines, mostly {{high-speed}} steam <b>engines,</b> {{were also}} <b>single</b> <b>acting.</b> These also used trunk pistons, {{but in a}} new form.

25|$|The first Watt engines were {{atmospheric}} pressure engines, like the Newcomen engine {{but with the}} condensation taking place separate from the cylinder. Driving the engines using both low pressure steam and a partial vacuum {{raised the possibility of}} reciprocating engine development. An arrangement of valves could alternately admit low pressure steam to the cylinder and then connect with the condenser. Consequently, the direction of the power stroke might be reversed, making it easier to obtain rotary motion. Additional benefits of the double <b>acting</b> <b>engine</b> were increased efficiency, higher speed (greater power) and more regular motion.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{based on}} the application, a {{pneumatic}} cylinder is usually a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> cylinder, {{where there is a}} single port in the cylinder and were cylinder extension is done by compressed air and retraction by means of open coiled spring.
