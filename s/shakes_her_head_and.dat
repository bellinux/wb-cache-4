60|$|Judy, {{with her}} brother's wink, <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> purses up her mouth into no without saying it.|$|E
60|$|The {{old lady}} sorrowfully <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> taking {{one of his}} {{powerful}} hands, lays it lovingly upon her shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|NED. [His face {{brightening}} instantly, {{leaning forward}} and laying a hand soothingly on hers.] That should {{not make any}} girl unhappy. Because you don't love him is no reason--[Abruptly breaking off.] Of course you don't love him? [LORETTA <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> shoulders vigorously.] What? ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{denied the}} {{imputation}} with much disgust.|$|R
60|$|Christina <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> framed a {{negative}} with her lips.|$|R
60|$|Florence <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> pressed <b>her</b> lips {{against his}} cheek.|$|R
6000|$|... (ASHER {{starts to}} pull up an armchair, but AUGUSTA looks at him and [...] <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> pulls it up herself. GEORGE sinks into the [...] chair, leans {{back his head and}} closes his eyes. AUGUSTA hovers over [...] him, {{smoothing}} his hair.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We all ken what sailors are," [...] is {{her dark}} way of denouncing {{those who go}} down to the sea in ships, and then she <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> purses up her mouth as if she could tell things about sailors that would make our hair rise.|$|E
60|$|Wherefore I sneer at our gallant mutineers, and {{recommend}} trained nurses for them, quite {{in the manner}} of Mr. Pike. But Margaret <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> insists that human nature is human nature, and that under similar circumstances human nature will express itself similarly. In short, she points to the number of deaths that have already occurred, and declares that on some dark night, sooner or later, whenever the pinch of hunger sufficiently sharpens, we shall see our rascals storming aft.|$|E
60|$|The other <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> looked uneasily at her daughter.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Snagsby <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> put <b>her</b> {{handkerchief}} to her eyes.|$|R
60|$|She only <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{repeated}} <b>her</b> objection {{in other}} words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! You {{know what}} Ma is, Esther," [...] she returned. [...] "It's {{impossible}} to say whether she knows it or not. She has been told it often enough; and when she IS told it, she only gives me a placid look, as if I was I don't know what--a steeple in the distance," [...] said Caddy with a sudden idea; [...] "and then she <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> says 'Oh, Caddy, Caddy, what a tease you are!' and goes on with the Borrioboola letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} seem to have much to do with it," [...] she said doubtfully, [...] "and yet, perhaps it does. You know my mother is not quite of the same opinion as my father, {{although}} she never says so to him; but, when we are alone together, sometimes she <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> says she fears that trouble is coming, and it makes her very unhappy. One day I was in the garden, and they were talking loudly in the dining room--at least, he was talking loudly. Well, he said--But I don't know whether I ought to tell you, Charlie." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ashley, without noting her protest: [...] "I had {{forgotten}} that I had a corkscrew in my pocket-knife. Don't trouble yourself to ring for one." [...] He produces {{the knife and}} opens the bottle; then, as Miss Ramsey rises and stands aghast, he pours out a glass and offers it to her, with mock devotion. As she <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> recoils: [...] "Oh! I thought you liked cocktails. They are very good after cigarettes--very reviving. But if you won't--" [...] He tosses off the cocktail and sets down the glass, smacking his lips. [...] "Tell your brother I commend his taste--in cocktails and"--puffing his cigarette--"tobacco. Poison for poison, let me offer you one of my cigarettes. They're milder than these." [...] He puts {{his hand to his}} breast pocket.|$|E
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{sheltered}} the drawing-book again {{under her}} shawl.|$|R
60|$|But the White Cat <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> sighed {{deeply in}} answer.|$|R
60|$|But {{the woman}} <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> pointed {{off in the}} distance.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} who {{sat in the chair}} next to me, how {{carefully}} he wrapped the cloak round the shoulders of the little milliner beside him. And when she said she was tired of sitting still, how readily he sprang from his chair to walk with her, though it was evident he was very comfortable where he was. And she! She had laughed at his jokes; they were not very clever jokes, they were not very new. She had probably read them herself months before in her own particular weekly journal. Yet the harmless humbug made him happy. I wonder if ten years hence she will laugh at such old humour, if ten years hence he will take such clumsy pains to put her cape about her. Experience <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> is amused at my question.|$|E
6000|$|But happily (and Mrs. Snagsby tightly <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> tightly smiles) {{that boy}} {{was met by}} Mr. Chadband {{yesterday}} in the streets; and that boy, as affording a subject which Mr. Chadband desires to improve for the spiritual delight of a select congregation, was seized by Mr. Chadband and threatened with being delivered over to the police unless he showed the reverend gentleman where he lived and unless he entered into, and fulfilled, an undertaking to appear in Cook's Court to-morrow night, [...] "to--mor--row--night," [...] Mrs. Snagsby repeats for mere emphasis with another tight smile and another tight shake of her head; and to-morrow night that boy will be here, and to-morrow night Mrs. Snagsby will have her eye upon him and upon some one else; and oh, you may walk a long while in your secret ways (says Mrs. Snagsby with haughtiness and scorn), but you can't blind ME! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is one of}} my expiring efforts," [...] she declared, {{sinking into}} the chair by his side. [...] "You know whose party it is, of course? Old Lady Torrington's. Quite a boy and girl affair. Twenty-four of us had dinner in the worst corner of the room. I can hear the old lady {{ordering}} the dinner now. Charles with a long menu. She <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> taps him on the wrist with her fan. 'Monsieur Charles, I am a poor woman. Give me what there is--a small, plain dinner--and charge me at your minimum.' The dinner was very small and very plain, the champagne was horribly sweet. My partner talked of a new drill, his last innings for the Household Brigade, and a wonderful round of golf he played last Sunday week. I was turned on to dance with a man who asked me to marry him, a year ago, and I could feel him vibrating with gratitude, as he looked at me, that I had refused. I suppose I am very haggard." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Tyrell <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> stooping down {{adjusted}} the fire-stove ornament.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Stumfold <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{then went}} away without further speech.|$|R
60|$|The girl <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> edged {{away from}} the man--toward the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "'How dreadful ill {{and weak}} she do look, don't she?' says Emmy. Before I could say {{as much as}} 'Yes,' she stares up at us, and asks in a wild voice, though it wasn't very loud either, if we can tell her the way to Bangbury workhouse. Having pretty sharp eyes of our own, we both of us knew that a workhouse was no fit place for her. Her gown was very dusty, {{and one of her}} boots was burst, and her hair was draggled all over her face, and her eyes was sunk in her head, like; but we saw somehow that she was a lady--or, if she wasn't exactly a lady, that no workhouse was proper for her, at any rate. I stooped down to speak to her; but her baby was crying so dreadful she could hardly hear me. 'Is the poor thing ill?' says I. 'Starving,' says she, in such a desperate, fierce way, that it gave me a turn. 'Is that your child?' says I, a bit frightened about how she'd answer me. 'Yes,' she says in quite a new voice, very soft and sorrowful, and bending her face away from me over the child. 'Then why don't you suckle it?' says I. She looks up at me, and then at Jenny and <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> says nothing. I give my baby to Jemmy to hold, and went and sat down by her. He walked away a little; and I whispered to her again, 'Why don't you suckle it?' and she whispered to me, 'My milk's all dried up. I couldn't wait to hear no more till I'd got her baby at my own breast.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the arrest}} of Harley, Catwoman thanks Batman for saving her life, to which Batman states that he owed her one for saving him from the Joker's act at the studio. The episode ends on a humorous note, as Catwoman makes a pass at Batman, {{suggesting}} of a possibility of building up their relationship outside Gotham, to which Batman is considering, before instantly pulling one of his trademark disappearing acts. Seeing this, Catwoman smiles, <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> mutters to herself, [...] "Hmm. Almost got 'im." ...|$|E
50|$|Colonel Saul Tigh {{begins to}} make more {{frequent}} stops to her cell, questioning her about what it's like to exist as a Cylon. He confronts her about being {{responsible for the deaths}} of billions and whether she feels any remorse or if she can just 'flip a switch' and shut out the pain. Caprica Six questions Tigh's reasons for the line of questioning, unaware Tigh is one of the Five Unrevealed Cylon Models. When she goads him about needing to feel pain, he turns to leave but she assaults him and bludgeons him. To her surprise he cries and begs for more pain, but in response she abruptly aborts her assault, <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> replies he doesn't need any more pain. She then kisses him passionately.|$|E
60|$|She laughed <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> held <b>her</b> {{hands up}} for inspection.|$|R
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{smiled up}} at him. She was immensely interested.|$|R
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> motioned an entreaty to him {{to leave}} her.|$|R
5000|$|Later, it is {{revealed}} that he has opened his own business inspecting homes. After checking the home of Nadia, he sees the same silver car near his house, and finds that it is his father driving it, who had faked his own death {{to escape from the}} two men who are trying to kill him because of a [...] "retirement con". He wants Locke to go to the bank to get the money for him from a safety deposit box, and keep $200,000 as payment. After going to the safety deposit box and collecting the money, Locke returns home and encounters the two mysterious men who question him about the validity of his father's death and search his work bag. When Helen asks Locke about the situation, he lies to her and says that he has not seen his father. When Locke meets up with his father at the motel, he tells his father that he is planning on marrying Helen. But when he leaves, he sees Helen has followed him, and she is hurt by his lies. She breaks up with Locke, accusing him of choosing his father's love over hers. Locke gets down on one knee and proposes, but Helen <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> drives away, leaving Locke to stare at his father getting into a taxi cab to leave as well.|$|E
5000|$|Wayne {{shows up}} at Katherine's house, {{demanding}} to know who Dylan is. He says that Dylan is not his daughter, so she must not be Katherine's either. He tries to pull {{a strand of hair}} from Katherine's head for DNA examination, but his actions are interrupted when Bob and Lee show up, looking for a caterer for their commitment ceremony. Katherine is delighted, and says that she and Bree will be ready for duty. Wayne leaves but promises to return. Later, Katherine and Bree practice firing guns at the shooting range. When Katherine comes home, Adam is there, and presses Katherine to reveal the truth to Dylan. Katherine <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> Adam suggests they move away. When Katherine again says no as Dylan insists to stay, Adam reveals that he wants to take Dylan to a vacation of anywhere she chooses. Katherine replies, [...] "Then we'd have to come back, and we'd be at square one again", to which Adam replies, [...] "not if we don't come back". That night, at Dylan's recital, Adam goes to the parking lot during intermission. Wayne appears and asks Adam for help with his flat tire. Not knowing that he is Katherine's ex-husband, he agrees to help. Wayne knocks Adam unconscious with a four way wrench and drags him to his car.|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} scene, {{we see a}} young woman jogging in a park. She looks at the screen of a smart device, which is also shown as a graphic element in the image. The “Healthy Living Index” with a {{real-time}} calculation is displayed on the monitor {{as well as the}} name of the jogger, Lana Siewert, and three icons marked in green: a person in motion (value 82), a bottle (value 100), and a smiley face (value 82), which symbolize exercise, nutrition, and well-being, respectively. The next scene shows Lana sitting with her partner in a doctor’s office. She takes a sip from a bottle that we recognize from the icon. The screen of her health device is displayed on the wall. “Bravo, Ms. Siewert,” says the female physician sitting opposite them at the table. “Your HeLI [Healthy Living Index] is at an excellent 95 percent. Go on like that.” Then, the doctor addresses Lana’s partner. “If your index has a similar optimum value, nothing stands in the way of your wish to have a child.” The couple look happily at each other, and the physician asks the partner for his NutriPlus. He holds his left wrist over a screen that is lying on the table. The results and his name, Phius Kreigel, as well as a chart showing his “ethylglucoronide/alcohol” blood level are displayed on the wall. The chart covers the days Monday through Thursday. The physician becomes alarmed and reproachful: “A striking eruption of ethylglucoronide (...) sometimes even in the afternoon. What’s the matter with you, Mr. Kreigel? Almost no alpha-CEHC-glucoronide, and what really worries me is this significant amplitude of lathosterol.” The screen on the wall shows a chart of “lathosterol/fast food” with an upward curve. Lana becomes frightened and looks at him questioningly: “Is this correct, Phius? This cannot be correct. You always drink your Opti-Nutri.” Hopefully, she turns to the physician: “Could the NutriPlus perhaps be defective again?” The doctor <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> Lana adds: “Well, then I may need to look for another father for my children.” We see a graphic display that shows Phius’ Healthy Living Index decreasing from 40 to 18 %, and the smiley face dropping to 8, while the nutrition icon also indicates the low value of 8. “You are making the right decision, Ms. Siewert,” the physician says.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Lupin <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{heaved a}} sigh. It was very affecting.|$|R
60|$|But Dede <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> on {{that one}} point refused to be comforted.|$|R
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and,</b> if pale, <b>her</b> {{face was}} resolute, her glance steady.|$|R
