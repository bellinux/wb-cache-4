5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in <b>square</b> <b>brackets.</b> Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E

30|$|The Mutation Reporter Tool (Bell and Kramvis 2013) {{summarizes}} nucleotide or {{amino acid}} distribution at specified loci of interest. The tool can, optionally, include or exclude sequences {{based on a}} FASTA ID regular expression. This {{can be used to}} report on the nucleotide distribution of only the full-length (“Complete”) sequences, for example. The “include” regular expression used in this example would be “_[C[^∧]]”, that is, an underscore, followed by an open <b>square</b> <b>bracket</b> and a “C” character, not followed by a close <b>square</b> <b>bracket.</b> The last component is particularly required, if the input alignment contains genotype C sequences, to prevent matching with the genotype annotation, “[C]”. Note that the closing <b>square</b> <b>bracket,</b> within the regular expression list, is not escaped with a backslash character.|$|R
50|$|This CamelCase {{convention}} {{was used by}} most wiki software {{for the first few}} years of wikis' existence. In 2001, the software UseModWiki, which at the time was in use on Wikipedia, switched to allow internal links to be done using standard spelling and double <b>square</b> <b>bracket</b> instead, in order to improve Wikipedia's usability. This <b>square</b> <b>bracket</b> syntax has since become more of a default convention for internal links within wiki software in general.|$|R

25|$|Many of the fonts {{listed here}} came in several sub-varieties. For example, {{in the early}} years of the Selectric, typists were used to using the lower-case L for the numeral 1, as many {{previous}} typewriters lacked a dedicated numeral 1 key. The Selectric had a dedicated key for 1/!, but this was also marked , as many of the early elements had <b>square</b> <b>brackets</b> in these positions. Using such an element required the typist to continue the old convention. Later elements tended to have the dedicated numeral 1 and exclamation point characters instead. Some moved the <b>square</b> <b>brackets</b> to the positions formerly occupied by the 1/4 and 1/2 fractions, while others lost them completely. Some put a degree symbol in place of the exclamation point. IBM would furthermore customize any element for a fee, so literally endless variations were possible. Such customized elements were identified by a gray plastic flip-up clip instead of a black one.|$|E
