Clark's theory was one of applying force swiftly, which was being advocated by many soldiers at the time, a concept that would eventually become established as U.S. national <b>security</b> <b>policy</b> {{in the form of}} the Weinberger Doctrine and its successor, the Powell Doctrine. Clark was promoted to major upon his graduation from the CGSC.|$|E

5|$|The Council is {{composed}} of twenty-eight national ministers (one per state). However the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture is being discussed, the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead the Common Foreign and <b>Security</b> <b>Policy.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1949 Sweden {{chose not}} to join NATO and {{declared}} a <b>security</b> <b>policy</b> aiming for non-alignment in peace and neutrality in war. A modified version now qualifies non-alignment in peace for possible neutrality in war. This position was maintained without much discussion during the Cold War. Since the 1990s however {{there has been an}} active debate in Sweden on the question of NATO membership in the post–Cold War world. These ideological divides were visible in November 2006 when Sweden could either buy two new transport planes or join NATO's plane pool, and in December 2006, when Sweden was invited to join the NATO Response Force. Sweden have been active participants in NATO-led missions in Bosnia (IFOR and SFOR), Kosovo (KFOR), Afghanistan (ISAF), and Libya (Operation Unified Protector).|$|E
5|$|The European Council, {{charged with}} {{defining}} the European Union's (EU) overall political direction and priorities, is {{the institution of}} the EU that comprises the heads of state or government of the member states, along with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and <b>Security</b> <b>Policy</b> also takes part in its meetings.

5|$|The Commission {{differs from}} the other {{institutions}} in that it alone has legislative initiative in the EU. Only the Commission can make formal proposals for legislation: they cannot originate in the legislative branches. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, no legislative act is allowed {{in the field of}} the Common Foreign and <b>Security</b> <b>Policy.</b> In the other fields the Council and Parliament are able to request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates the basis of these proposals. This monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law. This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects. However, the Council and Parliament may request the Commission to draft legislation, though the Commission does have the power to refuse to do so as it did in 2008 over transnational collective conventions. Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU citizens are also able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but this is not binding.|$|E

40|$|The {{contents}} {{access and}} sharing in multimedia social networks (MSNs) mainly rely on access control models and mechanisms. Simple adoptions of <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> {{in the traditional}} access control model cannot effectively establish a trust relationship among parties. This paper proposed a novel two-party trust architecture (TPTA) to apply in a generic MSN scenario. According to the architecture, <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> are adopted through game-theoretic analyses and decisions. Based on formalized utilities of <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> and <b>security</b> rules, the choice of <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> in content access {{is described as a}} game between the content provider and the content requester. By the game method for the combination of <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> utility and its influences on each party’s benefits, the Nash equilibrium is achieved, that is, an optimal and stable combination of <b>security</b> <b>policies,</b> to establish and enhance trust among stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Security {{management}} is now acknowledged {{as a key}} constituent of Information Systems (IS) management. IS security management traditionally relies on the formation and application of <b>security</b> <b>policies.</b> Most of the {{research in this field}} address issues regarding the structure and content of security policies; whereas the context within which <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> are conceived and developed remains rather unexplored. However, <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> that are formed without taking into account the specific social and organisational environment within which they will be applied, are often proven to be inapplicable or ineffective. In this paper we explore the issues pertaining to the formation of <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> under the perspective of contextualism. Within the framework of contextualism, we study the context, content and process of IS <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> development. This paper aims to contribute to IS security research by bringing forth the issue of context-dependent formation of <b>security</b> <b>policies.</b> In addition, it provides a contextual framework, which we expect to improve the effectiveness of IS <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> development. Key words: Information systems, information systems security, contextualism. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{constitution}} of East Timor {{states that the}} president is the supreme commander of the defence force and has the power to appoint the F-FDTL's commander and chief of staff. The Council of Ministers and National Parliament are responsible for funding the F-FDTL and setting policy relating to East Timor's security. Cirilo José Cristovão serves as the current minister of Defence and Security, and Julio Tomas Pinto is the Secretary of State for Defense. Both men were sworn into these roles on 8 August 2012. A Superior Council for Defence and Security was established in 2005 to advise the president on defence and <b>security</b> <b>policy</b> and legislation and the appointment and dismissal of senior military personnel. The council is chaired by the president and includes the prime minister, the defence, justice, interior and foreign affairs ministers, the heads of the F-FDTL and PNTL a national state security officer and three representatives from the national parliament. The council's role is not clear, however, and neither it nor the parliament served as a check against the decision to sack large numbers of F-FDTL personnel in 2006. A parliamentary committee also provides oversight of East Timor's security sector. Major General Lere Anan Timor is the current commander of the F-FDTL, and was appointed to this position on 6 October 2011.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Establishing formal {{models of}} <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> {{to control and}} {{restrict}} the access to sensitive pieces of information is a very challenging problem with applications in many domains. Several formalisms have been pro-posed for the modeling of <b>security</b> <b>policies.</b> However, these formalisms are based on static access control policies and do {{not take into account}} the evolution of systems and of the <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> required of them. This paper proposes an approach for the revision of <b>security</b> <b>policies.</b> Policy revision refers here to addition or suppression of regulations. ...|$|R
