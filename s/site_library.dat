50|$|The site is {{involved}} in a legal case with Elsevier: Elsevier et al. v. Sci-Hub et al. Court documents which discuss technical details of how the site functions are available to the public. Elsevier claims that Sci-Hub illegally accesses accounts of students and academic institutions to provide free access to articles through their platform ScienceDirect. The case is {{complicated by the fact that}} the site is hosted in St. Petersburg, Russia, making it difficult to target within the US legal system. A similar case is also being run against the <b>site</b> <b>Library</b> Genesis (LibGen), which may be based in either the Netherlands or also in Russia. As of May 2017, Elsevier is demanding $15,000,000 in damages. In June 2017, a New York district court awarded Elsevier $15 million in damages for copyright infringement by Sci-Hub and others.|$|E
40|$|A fast {{restriction}} sites search algorithm using a quadruplet look-ahead feature {{has been}} written in 6502 assembly language code. The search time, tested on the sequence of pBR 322, is 4. 1 s/kilobase using a restriction <b>site</b> <b>library</b> including 112 specificities corresponding to a total site length of over 700 bases. The search for a short sequence (less than 36 bases) within a longer one (up to 9999 bases) with a given number of mismatches or gaps allowed has also been written in assembly language. Typical run time for the search of a 12 base sequence with 1, 2 or 3 gaps allowed are 6. 2, 9. 4 or 13. 6 s/kilobase, respectively. The dot matrix analysis needs 7. 5 minutes per square kilobase when using a stringency of 15 matched bases out of 25. A 7 / 21 matrix of two 500 amino acid proteins is obtained in 3 minutes.

40|$|The University of Michigan Library {{wanted to}} learn more about the kinds of {{searches}} its users were conducting through the “one search ” search box on the Library Web <b>site.</b> <b>Library</b> staff conducted two investigations. A preliminary investigation in 2011 involved the manual review of the 100 most frequently occurring queries con- ducted through the site search box over the course of a month. Those 100 search terms accounted for 16 percent of total queries and were largely one-word searches for databases. In the follow-up investigation, the Library embarked on a more ambitious exploration of the 454, 443 searches conducted during the winter 2011 semester, devising a method for selecting, categorizing, and summarizing user search queries. A sample of 1, 201 searches from the search query logs was examined; after eliminating duplicate searches, there were 992 unique terms available for categorization. Using a non-overlapping sample of queries, a rubric was developed for categorizing user searches. Each of seven library staff members reviewed all unique terms in the sample to categorize them into the best fitting category from the rubric. After establishing a threshold for reliability among the individuals categorizing the queries, 862 unique search terms were analyzed. Based on this analysis, the most frequent kinds of searches conducted in the winter semester in 2011 on the University of Michiga...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain how Edith Cowan University (ECU) Library {{improved}} the accessibility of their web site, aiming for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2. 0 Level AA. It describes the results obtained. Design/methodology/approach – Initial testing by consultants was conducted in October 2012. The web site was defined as all webpages which appear part of the library web site, including supplier webpages, plus pages from the university web site and library web <b>site.</b> <b>Library</b> staff applied the recommendations to pages which they could edit, and discussed the recommendations with suppliers to improve their product’s accessibility. The web site was re-tested in June 2013. Social implications – A web site not complying with WCAG version 2. 0 would be very difficult for people with disabilities to access. Upgrading ECU Library’s web site will provide all users with more equal access to the resources. Findings – ECU Library web site failed WCAG 2. 0 Level A standard in the initial testing and re-testing. Many individual pages which failed initially passed the re-test. The smallest improvement was seen in suppliers’ web sites. Practical implications – This paper could help libraries to improve web site accessibility, as it covers negotiating with suppliers to upgrade their web sites, plus upgrading editable webpages. It shows initial and re-test results, allowing libraries to compare their results to those of ECU. Legislation and guidelines state web sites should be accessible to all users and organisations providing non-accessible web sites risk being sued. Originality/value – This study describes problems in upgrading academic library webpages and related supplier web sites and organisation web site to improve accessibility for people with disabilities...|$|E
40|$|The {{adipose tissue}} {{participates in the}} {{regulation}} of energy homeostasis as an important endocrine organ that secretes a number of biologically active adipokines, including adiponectin. Recently we developed and characterized a first-in-class peptide-based adiponectin receptor agonist by using in vitro and in vivo models of glioblastoma and breast cancer (BC). In the current study, we further explored the effects of peptide ADP 355 in additional cellular models and found that ADP 355 inhibited chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell proliferation and renal myofibroblast differentiation with mid-nanomolar IC 50 values. According to molecular modeling calculations, ADP 355 was remarkably flexible in the global minimum with a turn present {{in the middle of}} the peptide. Considering these structural features of ADP 355 and the fact that adiponectin normally circulates as multimeric complexes, we developed and tested the activity of a linear branched dimer (ADP 399). The dimer exhibited approximately 20 -fold improved cellular activity inhibiting K 562 CML and MCF- 7 cell growth with high pM - low nM relative IC 50 values. Biodistribution studies suggested superior tissue dissemination of both peptides after subcutaneous administration relative to intraperitoneal inoculation. After screening of a 397 -member adiponectin active <b>site</b> <b>library,</b> a novel octapeptide (ADP 400) was designed that counteracted 10 - 1000 nM ADP 355 - and ADP 399 -mediated effects on CML and BC cell growth at nanomolar concentrations. ADP 400 induced mitogenic effects in MCF- 7 BC cells perhaps due to antagonizing endogenous adiponectin actions or acting as an inverse agonist. While the linear dimer agonist ADP 399 meets pharmacological criteria of a contemporary peptide drug lead, the peptide showing antagonist activity (ADP 400) at similar concentrations will be an important target validation tool to study adiponectin functions...|$|E

40|$|At the MPI for Psycholinguistics we {{launched}} a new web site (www. mpi. nl) on April 20, 2009. The web site is created in the Content Management System Plone. Our Plone CMS communicates with three data bases: 1. The MPI people data base: The interaction between the data base and the CMS is through a python script which allows us to create standard person pages for each MPI member. Person pages have a default person home set-up, a standard sub folder structure and some extra functionality to create user specific content. 2. The MPDL PubMan data base. Every night our CMS retrieves the metadata from the PubMan data base and stores these in the CMS using a python script. Researchers can specify a set of criteria to select the publications they wish to show on the publication folder of their person pages. The display can either be set to sort the publications by year, or by publication type {{or a combination of}} the two. A special (and hidden) 'local tag' element in the PubMan metadata set has been created to either create a collection for special publications or to exclude publications to be presented on the web page. In addition, research group and projects can create publications list based on the research group or project name. The MPDL metadata accomodates persistent links to the full text which can be viewed directly from the website when set at Public (in PubMan). In case the publication is set at Private a request form will appear with which users can send a request to our Library. The MPDL metadata also accomdates persistent links to the MPI-psycholinguistics research data archive. This allows the users to store supplementary material (primary data) in this archive and to link it to the PubMan data base. On the web site it will show automatically if the publiaction has supplementary material. 3. The MPI research data archive At our institute we house a primary research data archive. From the web site links can be created to these data, which will provide an alternative (and more public friendly) manner of showing the data. To realize the communication between the CMS and the three data bases has been quite a technical and organisational challenge, involving a lot of commitment from the MPDL team members and from the institute staff involved {{in the development of the}} web <b>site</b> (<b>library,</b> techical support). We feel that the functionality we have created is complex, but very nice and -easy-to-be-used- by other MPI institutes with a Plone based web site...|$|E
40|$|Directed {{evolution}} of E. coli for improved small-molecule production requires {{a combination of}} rational design and high-throughput screening technologies. Rational design-based directed evolution schemes use structural analyses and metabolic models to help identify targets for mutagenesis, thus improving the likelihood of identifying the desired phenotype. We used a strictly rational design-based approach to re-engineer cytochrome P 450 BM 3 for epoxidation of amorphadiene, developing a novel route for production of the anti-malarial compound artemisinin. A model structure of the lowest energy transition state complex for amorphadiene in the P 450 BM 3 active site was created using ROSETTA-based energy minimization. The resulting enzyme variant produced artemisinic- 11 S, 12 -epoxide at titers greater than 250 mg*l - 1. Continued attempts to use ROSETTA and to either improve P 450 BM 3 epoxidase activity or introduce hydroxylase activity, however, proved unsuccessful. In {{the absence of a}} high-throughput screening approach, further improvement of the P 450 -based production system would be difficult. As with most small-molecules, there exists no known high-throughput screen for artemisinic- 11 S- 12 -epoxide, amorphadiene, or any structurally-related compound. We hypothesized that a generalized method for high-throughput screen or selection design could be based on transcription factor-promoter pairs responding to the target small-molecule. Transcription factors have long been used to construct whole-cell biosensors for the detection of environmental small-molecule pollutants 1, but the work has remained largely un-translated toward screen development. While no known transcription factor binds artemisinic epoxide, a putative transcription factor-promoter pair responsive to 1 -butanol, a biofuel molecule of interest in our laboratory, was recently reported 2. The transcription factor, BmoR, and its cognate promoter, P BMO, were used to build a short-chain alcohol biosensor for use as a genetic screen or selection. Following optimization of expression temperature, promoter, and reporter 5 '-untranslated region, among other parameters, the BmoR-P BMO system was shown to provide robust detection of 1 -butanol in an E. coli host. The biosensor transfer function - relating input alcohol concentration to output fluorescent signal - was derived for 1 -butanol and structurally related alcohols using the Hill Equation. The biosensor exhibited a linear response between 100 µM and 40 mM 1 -butanol, and a dynamic range of over 8000 GFP/OD 600 units. A 700 µM difference in 1 -butanol concentration could be detected at 95 % confidence. By replacing the GFP reporter with TetA, a tetracycline transporter, a 1 -butanol selection was constructed; E. coli harboring the TetA-based biosensor exhibited 1 -butanol dependent growth in the presence of tetracycline up to 40 mM exogenously added 1 -butanol. Demonstration of the biosensor in various high-throughput screening and selection applications first required construction of a 1 -butanol production host. Studies have reporter 1 -butanol production in E. coli through heterologous expression of either the C. acetobutylicum 1 -butanol biosynthetic pathway 3, or a 2 -keto acid-based pathway composed of a L. lactis 2 -keto acid decarboxylase, KivD, and the S. cerevisiae alcohol reductase, ADH 6 4. In our hands, the C. acetobutylicum pathway proved non-robust and yielded low titers. In contrast, high-titer production of user-defined 2 -keto acid derived alcohols was achieved by introduction of a &# 916; ilvDAYC knockout in E. coli and expression of KivD and ADH 6. The engineered strain is auxotrophic for 2 -keto acids, and 1 -butanol was produced by supplementing the growth medium with 2 -oxopentanoate. A liquid culture screen was demonstrated using a 960 -member KivD and ADH 6 ribosome binding <b>site</b> <b>library.</b> Using the TetA-based biosensor, a strict cut-off between analyte 1 -butanol concentration and biosensor output was observed. The assay led to the identification of a variant 2 -keto acid-based alcohol production pathway exhibiting an approximately 20 % increase in specific 1 -butanol productivity. Attempts to engineer concomitant 1 -butanol production and selection in E. coli proved difficult. Both production and detection pathways functioned robustly when individually expressed in engineered E. coli; however, concomitant production and detection resulted in increased plasmid instability and cell death. We conclude by providing an analysis of observed cell stresses, generating negative 1 -butanol selective pressures, and outline future strategies {{that can be used to}} address these hurdles...|$|E

40|$|A {{procedure}} for rapidly generating a <b>library</b> of antisense-accessible <b>sites</b> on native mRNAs (mRNA antisense-accessible <b>sites</b> <b>library</b> [MASL]) is described that involves reverse transcription of whole cell mRNA extracts with a random oligodeoxynucleotide primer followed by mRNA-specific {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR). Antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can then be identified by screening against the antisense-accessible sites. The utility of this methodology is demonstrated for the identification of more effective inhibitors of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction than have previously been reported. This method may also be useful for constraining folding calculations of native mRNAs and for designing mRNA imaging probes...|$|R
