5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier</b> diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E
500|$|The {{detected}} {{voltage signal}} {{output of the}} <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier</b> diodes typically used in microwave detectors have a square law relationship to the power being measured and meters are calibrated accordingly. [...] However, as the power increases, the diode deviates significantly from a square law and remains accurate up to an output voltage of only around [...] [...] This can be improved a little by adding a load resistor to the detector output, but this also has the undesirable effect of decreasing sensitivity. [...] Another technique {{is to reduce the}} range of power being measured (so that it is brought within the square law range of the detector) by measuring at a point other than a maximum. [...] The maximum is then calculated from the known mathematical shape of the standing wave pattern. [...] This has the objection that it adds significantly to the labour required to make the measurements, as does the technique of precisely calibrating the detector and adjusting the readings on the meter according to a calibration chart.|$|E
500|$|The probe is {{connected}} to a detector and a display meter (not shown in figure 2). [...] These can be, respectively, a thermistor and power meter, or an envelope detector and VSWR meter. [...] The detector can be a crystal detector or a <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier</b> diode. [...] The detector is mounted on the probe assembly, usually a distance λ/4 from the probe tip {{as shown in figure}} 3. [...] This is because the detector looks almost like a short circuit to the transmission line, and this distance will convert it to an open circuit through the quarter-wave impedance transformer effect. [...] Thus, the detector has minimal effect on loading the line. [...] The probe tuning stub can be seen on figure 3 branching from the line linking the probe to the detector. [...] Figure 2 has a slightly different arrangement; the main probe into the waveguide leads to a vertical co-axial tuning and adjustment section but the detector is on a horizontal side-section with a secondary probe into the upright co-axial section.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, metal {{electrodeposition}} on semiconductor substrates is investigated. We {{show that}} electrodeposition of metals on n-type Si and Ge {{is an excellent}} method to create <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers</b> and that this method {{has a number of}} unique advantages over other (physical) deposition methods. These advantages can be used to improve the prospects of applications in the area of Spintronics and Plasmonics. Firstly, the excellent current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characteristics of electrodeposited <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers</b> indicate that they have an ideality factor close to unity and that the reverse bias leakage is orders of magnitude smaller than in evaporated <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers.</b> These characteristics {{can be used to make}} highly doped <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers</b> in which all reverse bias current is due to tunnelling. For magnetic metals, these <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers</b> hence allow spin-conserved conduction which is a necessary step towards semiconductor spin valves and spin transistors. Secondly, electrodeposition is not a line-of-sight-technique and can hence be used to grow three dimensional structures when an appropriate pattern is created. Self assembly of latex spheres is shown to change both qualitative and quantitatively upon using a lithographically defined pattern. By using electrodeposition of gold around this latex sphere pattern nano-void array photonic crystals are created. We show that plasmonic modes are detectable in these arrays opening up the path to on-chip optical communication. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) based infrared (IR) detectors {{have been}} reported and shown promising properties taking advantage of its one dimensional structure and unique electrical properties. The CNT photodiodes detect IR signal through <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers</b> that are formed when metal and semiconductor CNT come into contact due to the difference of the energy levels. However, the generated photocurrent was small due {{to the structure of}} the CNT photodiodes, consisting of two reversely connected Schottky diodes. In addition, the mechanism of the <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers</b> of these photodiodes were not well understood. In this paper, a CNT Field Effect Transistor (CNTFET) is designed and used as an IR detector, improving the performance by tuning the doping level of the CNT through the gate. By introducing the gate as in CNTFET to the photodiodes, the Fermi levels of the CNTs are able to be adjusted by the electrostatic doping, as a result the dark currents of CNT photodiodes can be screened. On the other hand, the photocurrent is determined by the capability of <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers</b> to separated photogenerated electron and hole pairs, thus gate can shift the Fermi level of a CNT to the most sensitive level in order to produce a maximum photocurrent. The test results from the proposed CNTFET IR detectors provided a better understanding of its working principle in order to inspire optimal design of a CNT photodetector. The experimental results showed the photocurrent was proportional to the depletion width of <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers.</b> © 2008 IEEE. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{electrodeposited}} PdNi <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers</b> as {{low power}} Hydrogen sensors is investigated. Electrodeposited PdNi <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers</b> exhibit very low reverse bias current and the Palladium {{content of the}} film causes the Hydrogen molecules to dissociate and be absorbed by the film, changing the metal work function and device current. The Schottky diodes were fabricated on 0. 5 - 1. 5 Ohmcm (100) n-type Si by electrodeposition of PdNi followed by evaporation of Aluminium contact pads. Electrical measurements at different Hydrogen pressures were performed on back to back Schottky diodes in a vacuum chamber using pure Nitrogen and a 5 % Hydrogen-Nitrogen mixture. Very low currents of 1 nA were measured {{in the absence of}} Hydrogen. Large increases in the currents, upto a factor of 100, were observed upon exposure to different Hydrogen partial pressures. The highest sensitivity was estimated to be 17. 27 nA/mbar.

Even though like <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier</b> diodes, the barriers would have made this FET to transport only one type of carrier, the carrier transport through the metal-CNT interface is dominated by quantum mechanical tunneling through the <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier.</b> CNTFETs can easily be thinned by the gate field such that tunneling through them results in a substantial current contribution. CNTFETs are ambipolar; either electrons or holes, or both electrons and holes can be injected simultaneously. This makes {{the thickness of the}} <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier</b> a critical factor.|$|E

30|$|The {{selective}} oxidation of rhodium at {{the surface}} of top PtRh layer forms oxygen diffusion barriers, which isolates ITO layer from the external oxygen environment. Meanwhile, Platinum and Rhodium atoms would diffuse into ITO film at high temperature and segregate at the grain boundary of ITO film. As a consequence, the <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers</b> could form at the grain boundaries of ITO. The <b>Schottky</b> <b>barriers</b> may constrain the local concentration of oxygen vacancies in ITO film. As a result, the variation of the carrier concentration of ITO film is minimized. All of these factors lead to excellent high-temperature stability and repeatability of the thermoelectric response of the TFTC.|$|R

First, we obtained deposited layers of Pd nanoparticles which were electrically isolated {{from each other and}} from the semiconductor substrate.
