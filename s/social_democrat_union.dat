50|$|Ever since <b>Social</b> <b>Democrat</b> Christian Jacobsen became Vejle's {{first elected}} mayor in 1919, {{the town has}} been a stronghold for the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and trade <b>unions.</b> The longest serving Social Democratic mayor was Willy Sørensen, a union leader who joined the city council in 1937 and held the mayor's post for 31 years, from 1946 {{until his death in}} 1978.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, the <b>social</b> <b>democrats</b> {{lost their}} majority. The 1976 {{parliamentary}} elections brought a liberal/right-wing coalition to power. Over {{the next six}} years, four governments ruled and fell, composed by all {{or some of the}} parties that had won in 1976. The fourth liberal government in these years came under fire by <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and trade <b>unions</b> and the Moderate Party, culminating in the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> regaining power in 1982.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with fellow}} Wilno <b>Social</b> <b>Democrat,</b> Arkady Kremer, Martov {{explained}} the strategy involving mass agitation {{and participating in}} Jewish strikes, by also sometimes learning Yiddish to win over their support, in the work On Agitation (1895). The plan detailed that workers were to see a need for broader political campaigning through participating in strikes, led by the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> as trade <b>unions</b> were banned under the Tsarist regime.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{possible}} coalitions emerged {{after the}} elections. Homeland Union and Liberal and Centre Union indicated {{their willingness to}} join a [...] "rainbow" [...] coalition with the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats,</b> excluding only Labour and Liberal Democrats. Labour joined forces with Peasants and New Democratic Party <b>Union</b> and invited <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> to join. Brazauskas initially ruled out a coalition with Labour, but eventually <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and New <b>Union</b> joined forces with the Labour Party and the Peasants, with Brazauskas as the Prime Minister.|$|R
5000|$|In government, Fagerholm {{was one of}} {{the chief}} executors of the neutralist Scandinavia-orientation, that in the 1930s {{increasingly}} had been seen as Finland's deliverance from the danger of Russian expansionism [...] - [...] both by Conservatives and Socialists [...] - [...] a danger that seemed to have increased with fierce Soviet anti-Capitalist sentiments being met with equally fierce anti-Bolshevist sentiments in Finland. As native Swedish speaker, <b>Social</b> <b>Democrat,</b> former <b>Union</b> leader, and head of the Ministry for Social Affairs, he was just cut out for this task. The time given was however too short.|$|R
50|$|Several {{aspects of}} the electoral {{campaign}} and voting came under criticism. In particular, allegations of vote buying, mostly implicating the Labour Party, emerged in voting by post, prompting the Seimas to consider changes in voting procedures. <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and New <b>Union</b> also accused the Labour Party of violating the rules for electoral campaigns and exceeding campaign spending limits.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{co-operative}} {{efforts of the}} German and Danish police in the surveillance of German Communists who sought refuge in Denmark duing the 1930 s. Because of the escalating and violent confrontation levels during World War II, postwar accounts have to a considerable extent regarded the relations between Nazi Germany and its neighboring Scandinavian countries in the 1930 s in a conflict rather than a cooperation perspective. While in the prewar period there were fundamental ideological differences between Denmark and Germany, and Danish anxieties about Hitler’s aggressive foreign policy were tangible indeed, there were points of mutual interest as well. During the social turmoils of the 1930 s, the governments of both countries were working at strengthening social cohesion through different political schemes. They were also busy fighting political elements that threatened such cohesion. In Denmark measures were taken to protect democracy against subversive efforts of Communists and National Socialists, while in Germany, the Nazi dictatorship was ridding itself of the ‘Marxists’ – Communists, <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>Union</b> activists etc.; in other words enemies that were considered {{a major threat to}} the state and the celebrated Volksgemeinschaft. In this way, in both countries, social engineering came to include the close monitoring of Communist activities...|$|R
2500|$|Other {{victims of}} Nazi persecution: Between 1,000 and 2,000 Roman Catholic clergy, about 1,000 Jehovah's Witnesses, and {{an unknown number}} of Freemasons perished in Nazi prisons and camps. [...] "The fate of black people from 1933-45 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from {{isolation}} to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder." [...] During the Nazi era Communists, Socialists, <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats,</b> and trade <b>union</b> leaders were victims of Nazi persecution.|$|R
50|$|The {{bank was}} founded by Danish trade <b>unions,</b> the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Arbejderkul (<b>union</b> of coal workers) with a {{starting}} capital of DKK 2 million, most of which was pledged by Arbejderkul, who were particularly powerful after performing {{a crucial role in}} securing Denmark's energy supply during World War I. Although the bank was officially a public company, the shares could not be listed and remained with the labour movement. In practice the bank operated as a cooperative.|$|R
50|$|After the 2002 debacle, the PDS {{adopted a}} new program and {{installed}} long-time Gysi ally Lothar Bisky as chairman. In the 2004 elections to the European Parliament, the PDS won 6.1% of the vote nationwide, its highest share {{at that time in}} a federal election. Its electoral base in the eastern German states continued to grow, until it ranked as the third strongest party in the east, behind the CDU and SPD. However, low membership and voter support in Germany's western states continued to plague the party until it formed an electoral alliance in July 2005 with the newly formed Electoral Alternative for Labour and Social Justice (WASG), a party largely consisting of dissident <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats,</b> trade <b>union</b> members, and an assortment of radical leftists.|$|R
5000|$|Kurt Nehrling {{was born}} in Weimar to restaurateurs Max and Emma Nehrling. His parents' restaurant, Zum Goldenen Stern in the Jakobstrasse, was a popular workers' tavern {{and served as a}} meeting place for members of the Social-Democratic People Association (a local chapter of the SPD). This {{exposure}} was surely to have an influence on young Kurt's future political career.From 1901 to 1905, membership in the local chapter of the SPD increased dramatically from 120 to 616. The party therefore created an autonomous social and cultural environment in the worker-populated areas of the Weimar. In 1907, the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats,</b> trade <b>unions,</b> and associations laid the foundation for their own building, the [...] "Community Center". Two years later, a local group of the Socialist Worker Youth was founded there.|$|R
25|$|In 1921, Bethlen made a {{deal with}} the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and trade <b>unions</b> (called the Bethlen-Peyer Pact) to legalize their {{activities}} and free political prisoners in return for their pledge to refrain from spreading anti-Hungarian propaganda, calling political strikes, and attempting to organize the peasantry. Bethlen brought Hungary into the League of Nations in 1922 and out of international isolation by signing a treaty of friendship with Italy in 1927. Overall, Bethlen sought to pursue a strategy of strengthening the economy and building relations with stronger nations.|$|R
50|$|Jüri Ratas' cabinet is the {{incumbent}} cabinet of Estonia, in office since 23 November 2016. It is a coalition cabinet of Centre Party, Social Democratic Party and conservative Pro Patria and Res Publica Union. It {{was preceded by}} the Second Cabinet of Taavi Rõivas, a cabinet that ended when <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and the <b>Union</b> of Pro Patria and Res Publica joined the opposition's no confidence vote against the cabinet. This {{is the first time}} since 1999 the liberal Reform Party is out of the government.|$|R
50|$|The Centrist Union group (groupe Union centriste, {{abbreviated}} UC) is {{a centrist}} parliamentary {{group in the}} Senate uniting members of the <b>Union</b> of <b>Democrats</b> and Independents (UDI) and Democratic Movement (MoDem), {{as well as the}} Centrist Alliance (AC), a former component of the UDI. The group was historically associated with the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) and later the Democratic Centre (CD), Centre of <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> (CDS), and <b>Union</b> for French Democracy (UDF). Most recently, from 2012 to 2017, it was known as the <b>Union</b> of <b>Democrats</b> and Independents - UC group (groupe Union des démocrates et indépendants - UC, abbreviated UDI-UC).|$|R
2500|$|The generous {{system of}} welfare {{benefits}} {{emerged from a}} long process of debate, negotiations and maneuvers between efficiency-oriented modernizers {{on the one hand}} and <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and labor <b>unions.</b> A compulsory system provides old-age and disability insurance, financed mostly by taxes on employers. The national government provides unemployment insurance, maternity benefits, family allowances, and day-care centers. Health insurance covers most of the cost of outpatient care. The national health act of 1972 provided for the establishment of free health centers in every municipality. [...] There were major cutbacks in the early 1990s, but they were distributed to minimize the harm to the vast majority of voters.|$|R
50|$|The Liberal Movement {{had emerged}} as one of the main {{political}} forces in Lithuania, finishing a close third in the European Parliament elections in 2014 and the municipal elections in 2015. Until May 2016, the party was consistently the second most popular party in opinion polls (behind only the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats)</b> and was seen as the most likely coalition partner for both the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Homeland <b>Union.</b> The party lost most of its support after its leader, Eligijus Masiulis, was accused of taking a substantial bribe from one of the leading business groups in the country. Masiulis promptly resigned and was eventually replaced by the mayor of Vilnius, Remigijus Šimašius. As part of its platform, the party proposed a smaller government, lower taxes (especially VAT) and more flexible labor relationships. The party also expressed support for same-sex unions in Lithuania.|$|R
50|$|On 29 August, Ilves was {{the only}} {{candidate}} {{in the second and}} the third round of the presidential election in Riigikogu, the Parliament of Estonia (he was supported by an electoral coalition consisting of the governing Reform Party plus the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and the <b>Union</b> of Pro Patria and Res Publica which form the parliamentary opposition). Ilves gathered 64 votes out of 65 ballots. Therefore, one deputy of the three party alliance supporting Ilves did not vote in favour of his candidacy. A two-third majority in the 101-seat Riigikogu was required, so he was not elected in Riigikogu. His candidacy was automatically transferred to the next round in the Electors' Assembly on 23 September.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1933, the {{recently}} installed Nazi government declared 1 May the [...] "Day of National Work," [...] an official state holiday, {{and announced that}} all celebrations were to be organised by the government. Any separate celebrations by communists, <b>social</b> <b>democrats</b> or labour <b>unions</b> were banned. After World War II, 1 May remained a state holiday in both East and West Germany. In communist East Germany, workers were de facto required to participate in large state-organised parades on May Day. Today in Germany it is simply called [...] "Labour Day" [...] (...) , and there are numerous demonstrations and celebrations by independent workers' organisations. Today, Berlin witnesses yearly demonstrations on May Day, the largest organised by labour unions, political parties and others by the far left and Autonomen.|$|R
5000|$|The failed {{intervention}} {{against the}} Nazi-march in February 2009 provided {{the setting for}} the [...] "Dresden Nazifrei" [...] alliance in fall of 2009. It was announced on an [...] "action conference" [...] organized by [...] "No Pasaran" [...] in Dresden. The conference announced a public call to block the Nazi march. It said: [...] "We will use the tactic of mass blockades in which everybody can participate to prevent the Nazi-march" [...] and it called {{for the creation of}} a [...] "framework to plan and coordinate the necessary actions". This framework was created with the official announcement of the creation of the alliance [...] "Dresden Nazifrei" [...] (Dresden without Nazis) in the first week of December 2009. Part of the alliance of more than 50 groups were the antifascist groups of the [...] "No Pasaran" [...] alliance, local citizen groups, liberal parties like the Left, the Greens and parts of the <b>Social</b> <b>democrats,</b> different <b>unions</b> and the youth organizations of the parties and unions. In a press release [...] "Dresden Nazifrei" [...] declared: [...] "Our blockades are a form of action in which people experienced and those inexperienced in protest, young and old people, can participate simultaneously".|$|R
50|$|The 1976 {{parliamentary}} elections brought a liberal/right-wing coalition to power after {{almost half a}} century of <b>social</b> <b>democrat</b> leadership, and Mr Palme gave way to Thorbjörn Fälldin (of the Centre Party, a former farmers/landowners party which had incorporated social liberal ideas as well as the burgeoning environmental debate). Over the next six years, four governments ruled and fell, composed by all or some of the parties that had won in 1976, and the questions of energy and of battling the economic recession came to the fore like never before. The fourth liberal government in these years, again with Fälldin at the helm, seemed somewhat baffled by these problems and had neither the support of a firm majority in the parliament, nor a clear mandate from the non-socialist part of the Swedish electorate. Predictably it came under fire both from the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and trade <b>unions,</b> and from the Moderate Party, now heading in an increasingly Friedman-inspired and market liberal direction, and it was defeated in the elections of 1982, with Mr. Palme returning to the PM's seat.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} the current discussion on links between party politics and production regimes. Why do German <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> opt for more corporate gov-ernance liberalization than the CDU although, {{in terms of}} the distributional out-comes of such reforms, one would expect the situation to be reversed? By analyzing the party positions in the main German corporate governance reforms in the 1990 s, I show that the SPD and the CDU behaved “paradoxically”. The SPD favored more corporate governance liberalization than the CDU, which protected the institutions of “Rhenish”, “organized ” capitalism. This constellation occurred in the discussions on company disclosure, management accountability, the power of banks, network dissolution, and takeover regulation. I show that <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and trade <b>unions</b> adopted their liberal attitude to company regulation issues after World War II, which caused a conversion of leftist thinking on economic organization. Political considerations in the two phases when <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> were in government helped to stabilize liberal positions in company regulation issues: in the 1970 s, competition policy was introduced to make Keynesian macroeconomic policy work; in the 1990 s, it turned out that both works councils and trade unions favored shareholder-oriented measures because they helped employee representatives in their interaction with managers. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the implications for varieties of capitalism theory...|$|R
5000|$|He {{soon became}} noted for his {{opposition}} to the Premier, and called on him to resign [...] - [...] according to the journalist Sorin Roşca-Stănescu, Opriş was the leader of a PNŢCD faction who came into conflict with Vasile's. After the Vasile cabinet was replaced with that of Mugur Isărescu, the PNŢCD went on to face a parliamentary crisis due to a standoff with the PD, when the PD's Minister of Defense, Victor Babiuc, decided to leave his party [...] - [...] the PD refused to pass legislation until Babiuc was to be replaced with Sorin Frunzăverde. In response, Opriş called on all other coalition partners (the National Liberals, the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats,</b> the Democratic <b>Union</b> of Hungarians and various minor groups) to express support for the proposed legislation, and argued that new laws could conceivably be passed with support from opposition parties. (The crisis was ultimately overcome when Frunzăverde took over as minister.) ...|$|R
30|$|The SED {{went looking}} for West German allies not only among <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> and trades <b>unions,</b> but also among more {{establishment}} parties. East Berlin sought to woo even national-conservative critics of Konrad Adenauer. After the People’s Congress Movement had largely failed to impact the writing of a new constitution in Bonn {{in the autumn of}} 1948, a new way of influencing developments in the four occupation zones had to be found. Against the background of the founding of the GDR and in close consultation with Moscow, the so-called Nationale Front was formed in order to win support from all possible political forces and groups in West Germany. In this situation, of course, Stalin was able to fall back on his own pre-war politics. But political leaders realised already by late 1949 that the success of their rallying movement in the Federal Republic very much depended on developments within the GDR. The SED’s room for manoeuvre in terms of its German policies were increasingly determined by domestic developments and the success of East Germany’s ambitious economic plans.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, the Republicans {{gathered}} in the liberal-conservative National Centre of Independents and Peasants, from which the conservative-liberal Independent Republicans was formed in 1962. The originally centre-left Radical Party was a declining force and joined the centre-right in 1972, causing the split of the left-wing faction and {{the foundation of the}} Radical Party of the Left, closely associated to the Socialist Party. The former was later associated with the Union for a Popular Movement. In 1978 both the Republican Party (successor of the Independent Republicans) and the Radical Party were founding components, along with the Christian-democratic Centre of <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats,</b> of the <b>Union</b> for French Democracy, an alliance of non-Gaullist centre-right forces. The Republican Party, re-founded as Liberal Democracy and re-shaped as a free-market libertarian party, left the federation in 1998 and was later merged, along with the Radical Party, into the liberal-conservative Union for a Popular Movement (later The Republians) in 2002. The Radicals and several former Republicans launched the <b>Union</b> of <b>Democrats</b> and Independents in 2012.|$|R
