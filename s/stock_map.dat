However, insufficient {{raw materials}} and products will also influence the efficiency and output of the manufacturing process. Therefore, to largely reduce stock cost and facilitate adequate production for plants with multiple manufacturing processes and warehouses, the adjustment of raw material and products between warehouses is necessary. In addition, {{in order to keep}} track of current {{raw materials and}} products, remote online monitoring and control of the storage/retrieval system is compulsory. To simplify the search in an AS/BS process, a graph-aided strategy that manually selects the location within the <b>stock</b> <b>map</b> is presented. Moreover, to avoid interference from internet wiring allocation with existing equipment, a wireless storage/retrieval system using the ZigBee module is adopted.

40|$|Geographically {{weighted}} regression (GWR) procedures {{can be adapted}} to enhance the spatial features of low spatial resolution maps based on higher resolution remotely sensed imagery. This operation relies {{on the assumption that the}} GWR models developed at low resolution can be proficiently applied to higher resolution data. An example of such an application is presented for downscaling a forest growing <b>stock</b> <b>map</b> which has been recently produced over the Italian national territory. GWR was applied to a Landsat Thematic Mapper image of Tuscany (Central Italy) for downscaling the growing stock predictions from a 1 -km to a 100 -m resolution. The accuracy of the experiment was assessed versus the measurements of a regional forest inventory. The results obtained indicate that GWR can enhance the spatial features of the original map depending on the spatially variable correlation existing between the forest attribute and the ancillary data used. A final ecosystem modeling exercise demonstrates the utility of the spatially enhanced growing stock predictions to drive the simulation of the main forest processes...|$|E
40|$|National-scale {{inventories}} of soil organic carbon (SOC) and forest floor carbon (FFC) stocks {{have a high}} uncertainty. Inventories are often based on the interpolation of sampled information, often using a number of covariables to help such interpolation. The rationale for the choice of these covariables is not always documented, {{despite the fact that}} many local-scale studies have identified the factors explaining spatial variability of SOC and FFC stocks. These studies indicate, among others the importance of long-term land use history. Despite this, information on the effects of land use history has never been used to explain variability of carbon stocks in national-scale inventories. We designed an alternative method to improve national-scale {{inventories of}} SOC and FCC for the Dutch sand area that takes stock of the findings of detailed case studies. Determinants for SOC and FFC stocks derived from landscape-scale case studies were used to map national-scale spatial variability and to calculate national totals. The resulting national-scale spatial distribution was compared with the SOC <b>stock</b> <b>map</b> from the current Dutch greenhouse gas inventory. Using land use history to explain SOC variability decreased the error of the SOC stock estimate in 60 % of the area. The error in FFC stocks decreased in half of the forest area after including soil fertility, tree species, and forest age as explanatory factors. Estimates with reduced uncertainty will make land use and land management a more attractive and acceptable mitigation option to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases for the LULUCF sector. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E

40|$|Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) {{estimation}} {{is crucial}} to manage both natural and anthropic ecosystems and has recently been put under the magnifying glass after the Paris agreement 2016 due to its relationship with greenhouse gas. Statistical applications have dominated the SOC <b>stock</b> <b>mapping</b> at regional scale so far. However, the community has hardly ever attempted to implement Quantile Regression (QR) to spatially predict the SOC distribution. In this contribution, we test QR to estimate SOC stock (0 - 30 $cm$ depth) in the agricultural areas of a highly variable semi-arid region (Sicily, Italy, around 25, 000 $km 2 $) by using topographic and remotely sensed predictors. We also compare the results with those from available SOC stock measurement. The QR models produced robust performances and allowed to recognize dominant effects among the predictors {{with respect to the}} considered quantile. This information, currently lacking, suggests that QR can discern predictor influences on SOC stock at specific sub-domains of each predictors. In this work, the predictive map generated at the median shows lower errors than those of the Joint Research Centre and International Soil Reference, and Information Centre benchmarks. The results suggest the use of QR as a comprehensive and effective method to map SOC using legacy data in agro-ecosystems. The R code scripted in this study for QR is included...|$|R

Here, we present the application of the MIMOSE approach to a study area of 443, 758 hectares  coincident with administrative Molise Region in Central Italy. The procedure is based on a local high resolution forest types map integrated with information on the main forest management approaches.

40|$|Cities {{and their}} {{building}} stocks result in huge environmental impacts which {{are critical to}} reduce. However, the majority of existing studies focus on operational requirements or on material stocks. To date, very few studies have quantified embodied environmental requirements of building stocks and spatialised them. This study describes a bottom-up approach to spatially model building stocks and quantify their embodied environmental requirements. It uses a highly disaggregated approach where each building's geometry is modelled and used to derive a bill of quantities. Construction assemblies relevant to each building archetype (derived based on land-use, age and height) are defined using expert knowledge in construction. The initial and recurrent embodied energy, water and greenhouse gas emissions associated with each material within each assembly are calculated using a comprehensive hybrid analysis technique. This model is applied to all buildings of the City of Melbourne, Australia. Results show that rebuilding the City of Melbourne's building stock today would require 904 kt of materials/km² (total: 32 725 kt), 10 PJ/km² (total: 362 PJ), 17. 7 Million m³ of embodied water/km² (total: 640. 74 Million m³) and would emit 605 ktCO 2 e/km² (total: 23 530 ktCO 2 e).

40|$|Terrestrial carbon <b>stock</b> <b>mapping</b> is {{important}} for the successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies. Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric models to infer oven-dry aboveground biomass of trees from census data. The degree of uncertainty associated with previously published pantropical aboveground biomass allometries is large. We analyzed a global database of directly harvested trees at 58 sites, spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and vegetation types (4004 trees = 5 cm trunk diameter). When trunk diameter, total tree height, and wood specific gravity were included in the aboveground biomass model as covariates, a single model was found to hold across tropical vegetation types, with no detectable effect of region or environmental factors. The mean percent bias and variance of this model was only slightly higher than that of locally fitted models. Wood specific gravity was an important predictor of aboveground biomass, especially when including a much broader range of vegetation types than previous studies. The generic tree diameter-height relationship depended linearly on a bioclimatic stress variable E, which compounds indices of temperature variability, precipitation variability, and drought intensity. For cases in which total tree height is unavailable for aboveground biomass estimation, a pantropical model incorporating wood density, trunk diameter, and the variable E outperformed previously published models without height. However, to minimize bias, the development of locally derived diameter-height relationships is advised whenever possible. Both new allometric models should contribute to improve the accuracy of biomass assessment protocols in tropical vegetation types, and to advancing our understanding of architectural and evolutionary constraints on woody plant development.
