60|$|Dawes <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{picture with}} a caustic {{expression}} on his face.|$|E
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window-sill {{overhead}} and measured {{the size of}} the room with his eye.|$|E
60|$|They {{stopped and}} stood in a row, and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised.|$|E
60|$|The lineman, a young fellow, {{paused in}} the {{cracking}} of a hard-boiled egg to <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> couple.|$|R
60|$|He {{wanted to}} get right away from London and {{everybody}} and lie in the quiet darkness and <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars.|$|R
60|$|He would {{sneak out}} on moonless winter nights and <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars, and {{afterwards}} {{find it difficult}} to tell his father where he had been.|$|R
60|$|They {{stopped and}} stood {{in a row and}} <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised. Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.|$|E
60|$|Never again shall I {{wonder that}} the sea is hard. I walked apart from the second mate and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{magnificent}} fabric of the Elsinore sweeping and swaying great blotting curves of darkness {{across the face of}} the starry sky.|$|E
60|$|They <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> roosts {{where the}} biddies were huddled together, fast asleep. They {{were too high}} up to be reached from the floor even when Reddy and Granny stood on their hind legs and {{stretched}} {{as far as they}} could.|$|E
60|$|Someone {{has told}} them--I think I first started {{the idea in}} my pamphlet--that the thing is to sleep {{on a pile of}} hemlock branches. I think I told them to listen to the wind sowing (you know the word I mean), sowing and crooning in the giant pines. So there they are upside-down, doubled up on a couch of green spikes that would have killed St. Sebastian. They <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky with blood-shot, restless eyes, waiting for the crooning to begin. And there isn't a sow in sight.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the tender}} has floated some {{distance}} from the yacht, Josh pulls his hunting knife from his shorts and points it at Tammi. He demands the incriminating tape from Tammi and, fearing for her life, she obliges, throwing it {{on the floor of the}} tender. As a distracted Josh reaches for the tape, Tammi quickly throws the looped end of the mooring rope around his neck. The rope immediately reaches the end of its tether and Josh is wrenched into the sea, snapping his neck and killing him. Tammi, now the sole survivor, fires a distress flare in the hope of being rescued. She then lies down on the tender and morbidly <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> night sky, as the raft drifts away into the ocean.|$|R
60|$|The younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the {{converse}} of his companion. His stature {{could not have}} exceeded four feet. A pair of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure, while his unusually short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists at their extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a sea-turtle. Small eyes, of no particular color, twinkled far back in his head. His nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his round, full, and purple face; and his thick upper-lip rested upon the still thicker one beneath {{with an air of}} complacent self-satisfaction, much heightened by the owner's habit of licking them at intervals. He evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous, half-quizzical; and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> occasionally in his face as the red setting sun <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crags of Ben Nevis.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! if I {{could only}} {{fly to the}} highest beam in the barn, and give a splendid crow that {{everyone}} could hear, I should be perfectly happy,' said this silly little fowl, as he <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> loft where the old cock often sat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I bear him no malice," [...] replied Ashe good-humoredly, [...] "But I'm glad he's gone, because--well, because I don't {{want him}} to know how jolly right he is." [...] And {{he leaned back in his}} chair and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> roof of green leaves.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> darkling {{sky with}} its grey promise of snow, {{and down the}} slopes of the mountain. Clearly they must stay the night here. They were too high for wood among these rocks, but three or four hundred yards below {{there were a number of}} dwarfed fir trees. She had brought an axe, so that a fire was possible. Should she go back to camp and get the tent? ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} {{view of the}} "Wall of Fame" <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Earl Carroll Theater, [s. d. ]. A large wall {{can be seen at}} center, and rectangular plaques with signatures on {{them are}} visible on the wall. Three children <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wall from behind a chain-link fence at center. Several low bushes are visible between the fence and the wall.; The signatures include those of Paulette Goddard, Robert Young, Reginald Own, Andy Devine, Ann Sotham, Jeffery Lyon, Beatrice Joy, Monty Love, Jack Benny, Mary Livingstone, Allan James, Eric Bleve, Tammy Bird, Alan Mowbray, Reginald Gardiner, Basil Rathbone, Jan Bennett, Edward P. Robinson, Miriam Hopkins, Jean Hersholt, ZaDu Pitts, Hew Ayer, Don Amecke, Binnie Burnes, Charles Loughton, Brian O'Hearn, Pick Powell,, Eddie Canton, Rosalind Russell, Bob Hope, Olivia de Havilland, Myrna Loy, Nelson Eddy, Red Skelton, Charles Boyer, Mickey Rooney, Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert and Cary Grant...|$|R
60|$|Strolling {{about the}} green with this thought in my mind, I began to pay {{attention}} to the movements of a man who was manifestly there with the same object as myself--to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cathedral. I had seen him there for quite half an hour, and now began to be amused <b>at</b> <b>the</b> emphatic manner in which he displayed his interest in the building. He walked up and down the entire length and would then back away a distance of a hundred yards from <b>the</b> walls and <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spire, then slowly approach, still gazing up, until coming to a stop when quite near the wall he would remain with his eyes still fixed aloft, the back of his head almost resting on his back between his shoulders. His hat somehow kept on his head, but his attitude reminded me of a saying of the Arabs who, to give an idea of the height of a great rock or other tall object, say that to look <b>up</b> <b>at</b> it causes your turban to fall off. The Americans, when they were chewers of tobacco, had a different expression; they said that to look <b>up</b> <b>at</b> so tall a thing caused the tobacco juice to run down your throat.|$|R
50|$|The catastrophic {{crash landing}} of a Federation {{spacecraft}} on an uncharted planet made up entirely of sand leaves crewman Grimes dead, while Rand and Shapiro survive. Rand stares {{out over the}} sand dunes and both men associate the endless rolling dunes with a beach. Rand is becoming hypnotized by the dunes and refuses {{to move from the}} dune he is standing on or drink water. Shapiro also feels drawn to the dunes but, unlike Rand, finds this hypnosis frightening and is relieved to go inside the ship where the dunes are out of sight. When a trader spacecraft arrives in response to Shapiro's beacon, the trader's crew initially treat Shapiro's account of events with skepticism but become convinced when they are unable to get Rand away from the dunes. Rand resists leaving the planet, and the sand reveals itself to be sentient. It prevents Rand's rescue by damaging a sampler android sent from the ship and sending a hand of sand up to stop a tranquilizer dart. The rescue ship escapes just in time, with Shapiro and the trader's captain both narrowly avoiding a giant hand of sand. Rand, left alone, <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ship as it disappears, and then begins to pile handfuls of sand into his mouth.|$|R
60|$|They {{were alone}} behind the green lattices through which {{filtered}} the perfumes {{of the garden}} and the throbbing of a nightingale's voice laden with the tale of its love for the rose. Fenzileh reclined upon a divan that was spread with silken Turkey carpets, {{and one of her}} gold-embroidered slippers had dropped from her henna-stained toes. Her lovely arms were raised to support her head, and she <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lamp of many colours that hung from the fretted ceiling.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a small}} room, {{with nothing}} in it but a bed, two chairs, and a big chest. A few little gowns hung on the wall, and the only picture was the wintry sky, {{sparkling}} with stars, framed by the uncurtained window. But the moon, pausing to peep, saw something pretty and heard something pleasant. Two heads in little round nightcaps lay on one pillow, two pairs of wide-awake blue eyes <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> light, and two tongues were going like mill clappers.|$|E
60|$|I {{leaned against}} the rail {{in the lee of}} the wheel-house, and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lofty spars and myriad ropes that I could guess were there. No, I decided I was not keen on the voyage. The whole {{atmosphere}} of it was wrong. There were the cold hours I had waited on the pier-ends. There was Miss West coming along. There was the crew of broken men and lunatics. I wondered if the wounded Greek in the 'midship house still gibbered, and if Mr. Pike had yet sewed him up; and I was quite sure I would not care to witness such a transaction in surgery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she again returned, [...] "don't {{put it all}} on me! Maggie {{would have}} given herself to his child, I'm sure, {{scarcely}} less than he gives himself to yours. It would have taken more than any child of mine," [...] she explained--"it would have taken more than ten children of mine, could I have had them--to keep our sposi apart." [...] She smiled as for {{the breadth of the}} image, but, as he seemed to take it, in spite of this, for important, she then spoke gravely enough. [...] "It's as strange as you like, but we're immensely alone." [...] He kept vaguely moving, but there were moments when, again, with an awkward ease and his hands in his pockets, he was more directly before her. He stood there at these last words, which had the effect of making him for a little throw back his head and, as thinking something out, <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. [...] "What will you say," [...] she meanwhile asked, [...] "that you've been doing?" [...] This brought his consciousness and his eyes back to her, and she pointed her question. [...] "I mean when she comes in--for I suppose she WILL, some time, come in. It seems to me we must say the same thing." ...|$|R
60|$|Derek {{was waiting}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door. After some {{difficulty}} they were admitted and taken {{down the corridor}} where the prisoner on his knees had <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Nedda, past <b>the</b> courtyard where those others had been pacing out their living hieroglyphic, up steps to the hospital. Here, in a white-washed room on a narrow bed, {{the body of the}} big laborer lay, wrapped in a sheet.|$|R
6000|$|He {{suddenly}} {{undid the}} first button {{of her blouse}} and kissed her neck harshly, while she watched him, in a maze. He abruptly fastened the button again, sprang <b>up,</b> <b>stared</b> out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wraith-filled darkness over the river, while his voice droned on, {{as though it were}} a third person speaking: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} the typical bedroom {{of the typical}} boarding-house, {{furnished}}, insofar {{as it could be}} said to be furnished at all, with a severe simplicity. It contained two beds, a pine chest of drawers, a strip of faded carpet, and a wash basin. But there was that on the floor which set this room apart from a thousand rooms of the same kind. Flat on his back, with his hands tightly clenched and one leg twisted oddly under him and with his teeth gleaming through his grey beard in a horrible grin, Captain John Gunner <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceiling with eyes that saw nothing.|$|E
60|$|When {{he reached}} the ground, there was Chatterer scurrying around and poking under the fallen leaves, but he hadn't found a single nut. Happy Jack couldn't stop to quarrel any more, because you see {{he was afraid that}} Chatterer would find the biggest and fattest nuts, so he began to scurry around and hunt too. It was queer, very queer, how those nuts could have hidden so! They hunted and hunted, but no nuts were to be found. Then they stopped and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the tall hickory tree. Not a nut could they see. Then they stared at each other, and {{gradually}} a foolish, a very foolish look crept over each face.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Baas. What is the use, {{seeing that}} {{they are ready to}} let you pass, also the Lady Sad-Eyes, and me and the cattle with the driver and voorlooper, which is better still, and all the other goods. So what have you to gain by showing them the medicine? But perchance if it were on the neck of Umslopogaas and he showed it to them and brought it to their minds that those who touch him who is in the shadow of Zikali's Great Medicine, or aught that is his, die within three moons in this way or in that--well, Baas, who knows?" [...] and again he coughed drily and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky.|$|E
60|$|Harris {{pushed the}} card aside and <b>stared</b> back <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> youth {{across the desk}} from him. The young man seemed ill at ease and {{appeared}} to be avoiding answering the question Harris had put to him. Harris frowned. Westerburg was a good-looking chap, actually handsome in his Patrol uniform, a shock of blond hair over one eye. He was tall, almost six feet, a fine healthy lad, just two years out of Training, according to the card. Born in Detroit. Had measles when he was nine. Interested in jet engines, tennis, and girls. Twenty-six years old.|$|R
60|$|Seven {{times that}} day Milt tried to lose him. Once he stopped without excuse, and merely <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> rocks {{overhanging}} <b>the</b> hollowed road. Pinky was not embarrassed. He {{leaned back in}} the seat and sang two Spanish love songs. Once Milt deliberately took a wrong road, up a mountainside. They were lost, and took five hours getting back to the highway. Pinky loved the thrill and--in a brief address lasting fifteen minutes--he said so.|$|R
60|$|The {{sand and}} gravel and shale had disappeared; all was bare clean-washed rock. In many places the brook failed as a trail, for it leaped down in white sheets over mossy cliffs. Hare faced these walls in despair. But Wolf led on over the ledges and Silvermane followed, nothing daunted. At last Hare shrank back from a hole which defied him utterly. Even Wolf hesitated. The canyon was barely twenty feet wide; the floor ended in a precipice; the stream leaped out and fell into a dark cleft from which no sound arose. On the right there was a shelf of rock; it was scarce half a foot broad <b>at</b> <b>the</b> narrowest and then {{apparently}} vanished altogether. Hare <b>stared</b> helplessly <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> slanting shut-in walls.|$|R
6000|$|Again he risked the scorn of {{conductors}} and jitney drivers. He found Queen Anne Hill, {{found the}} residence of Mr. Eugene Gilson. He sneaked about it, slipped into the gate, prowled toward the house. Flabby from the intensity of study, he longed for the stimulus of Claire's smile. But as he <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> great squares of the clear windows, at the flare of white columns in the porch-lights, that smile seemed unreachable. He felt like a rustic at court. From {{the shelter of the}} prickly holly hedge he watched the house. It was [...] "some kind of a party?--or what would folks like these call a party?" [...] Limousines were arriving; he had a glimpse of silken ankles, frothy underskirts; heard easy laughter; saw people moving through a big blue and silver room; caught a drifting tremor of music.|$|E
60|$|Now a madness {{seemed to}} take hold of him. For a moment he <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> figures of the two women {{standing}} high above the rolling smoke and wrapping flame. Then, with his three men, he charged with a roar into the crowd of soldiers who had {{followed him into the}} courtyard, striving, it would seem, to cut his way to the Abbot, who lurked behind. It was a dreadful sight, for he and those with him fought furiously, and many went down. Presently, of the four only Christopher was left upon his feet. Swords and spears smote upon his armour, but he did not fall; it was those in front of him who fell. A great fellow with an axe got behind him and struck with all his might upon his helm. The sword dropped from Harflete's hand; slowly he turned about, looked upward, then stretched out his arms and fell heavily to earth.|$|E
60|$|Flambeau {{had seen}} quite enough of these daily salutations of Phoebus, and {{plunged into the}} porch of the tall {{building}} without even looking for his clerical friend to follow. But Father Brown, whether from a professional interest in ritual or a strong individual interest in tomfoolery, stopped and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> balcony of the sun-worshipper, just as he might have stopped and stared up at a Punch and Judy. Kalon the Prophet was already erect, with argent garments and uplifted hands, and the sound of his strangely penetrating voice could be heard {{all the way down the}} busy street uttering his solar litany. He was already in the middle of it; his eyes were fixed upon the flaming disc. It is doubtful if he saw anything or anyone on this earth; it is substantially certain that he did not see a stunted, round-faced priest who, in the crowd below, looked up at him with blinking eyes. That was perhaps the most startling difference between even these two far divided men. Father Brown could not look at anything without blinking; but the priest of Apollo could look on the blaze at noon without a quiver of the eyelid.|$|E
60|$|We {{swept across}} the {{roadstead}} towards the town, trailing our grapnel as it were a hooked fish, a bare hundred feet above <b>the</b> water. Faces <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> us from <b>the</b> ships' decks. The crew of one lowered a boat to pursue; we were {{half a mile away}} before it touched the water. Should we clear <b>the</b> town? <b>At</b> Byfield's orders we stripped off our overcoats and stood ready to lighten ship; but seeing that the deflected wind in the estuary was carrying us towards the suburbs and the harbour's mouth, he changed his mind.|$|R
60|$|Wally {{walked to}} the parapet, and looked over. Below him {{the vastness of the}} city {{stretched}} itself in a great triangle, its apex the harbour, its sides the dull silver of the East and Hudson Rivers. Directly before him, crowned with its white lantern, the Metropolitan Tower reared its graceful height to the stars. And all around, in the windows of the tall buildings that looked from this bastion on which he stood almost squat, a million lights <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, <b>the</b> unsleeping eyes of New York. It was a scene of which Wally, always sensitive to beauty, never tired: but to-night it had lost its appeal. A pleasant breeze from the Jersey shore greeted him with a quickening whisper of springtime and romance, but it did not lift the heaviness of his heart. He felt depressed and apprehensive.|$|R
60|$|A man wrote it, {{from his}} little {{room in the}} heart of London, whilst night faded into morning. He wrote it with leaden heart and unwilling {{mechanical}} effort--wrote it as a man might write his own doom. Every fresh sentence, which <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him from <b>the</b> closely written sheets seemed like another landmark in his sad descent from the pinnacles of his late wonderful happiness down into the black waters of despair. When he had finished, and the pen slipped from his stiff, nerveless fingers, there were lines and marks in his face which had never been there before, and which could never altogether pass away.|$|R
