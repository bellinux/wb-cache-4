5000|$|A {{different}} view of textuality has been put forward by Rein Raud, according to whom textualities are [...] "ordered <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> of different status {{that are related to}} each other and come with pre-arranged modes of interpretation". A textuality consists of base-texts, [...] "those that define a textual community and form a part of the necessary cultural competence of its members", result-texts, [...] "bids that have just been accepted and entered circulation, as well as those that have done so some time ago but are still being considered recent arrivals by their recipients", mediated by an operational memory, [...] "a shared (and internally contradictory) mental space of the cultural community and its various subgroups where texts are produced and processed", which contains different kinds of knowledge, standards and codes shared to different extent by the carriers of the culture. According to Raud, this model is complementary to a model of cultural practices, in which the production, distribution and transmission of meaning is regarded in the context of individual participation and activity, while a textuality is necessarily shared and perceived by its carriers to be an objective, albeit constructed, reality.|$|E

40|$|A text can {{be defined}} as a word w {{together}} with a (second) linear order on its domain f 1; :::; jwjg.

Two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> samples were analysed, {{both of which}} are characterized by the same stylistics features within the cathegory of scholarly style but differ in the date of origin (1500 - 1620 for one set, 1950 - for the other). Analysis is focused on the issue to which extent are semantic relations in the discourse structure marked up by explicit lexical means, i. e. by the discourse connectives. The <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> samples were annotated according to the scheme used for the discourse annotation in The Prague Dependency Treebank. The hypothesis was confirmed that discourse relations are marked up by the discourse connectives more frequently in the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> from the 16 th {{and the beginning of the}} 17 th century than in the other set. It turns out in further investigation that the difference mentioned above was caused by different conventions in placing discourse connectives rather than by establishing different semantic relations between textual units.
