The amphipods were identified, counted and separated in size classes through a nested <b>sieve</b> <b>set.</b> Month hystograms were obtained for juveniles, males and females. The ampithoid sex ratio was determined monthly. The reproductive biology of the species was evaluated by the relative frequency of ovigerous females, fecundity, average egg volume and correlation analysis between head lengh of ovigerous females and number of eggs in its brood pouch. Ampithoe ramondi was the most abundant species. The higher densities of the three species occurred in spring and summer. The sex ratio presented a significant difference from 1 : 1 only for A. ramondi (1 : 1. 2; χ 2 = 4. 37; g. l. = 1; p < 0. 05). Ovigerous females were registered for almost all the sampling periods. A positive correlation between the female head lengh {{and the number of}} eggs were only registered for A. ramondi (r 2 = 0. 27; p < 0. 05; n = 33).

O trabalho desenvolveu-se em um LATOSSOLO VERMELHO Distroférrico, de Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul. O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi o de blocos casualizados com quatro repetições e os tratamentos foram arranjados em parcelas sub-subdivididas. Os tratamentos consistiram de dois sistemas de manejo (convencional e plantio direto), duas doses de gesso (zero e 2 t ha- 1) e a utilização de duas culturas de verão (soja e milho). Os agregados foram coletados, nas profundidades de 0 a 10 e 10 a 20 cm, utilizando-se, nos procedimentos experimentais, os retidosno intervalo de diâmetro de 9, 52 e 4, 76 mm, após peneiramento em um jogo de peneiras-padrão. As análises dos agregados foram realizadas por meio de imagens digitais obtidas via scanner (300 dpi) em 60 agregados dispostos em um tabuleiro de furos desencontrados. As imagens foram posteriormente analisadas com o programa QUANTPORO, e a característica analisada dos agregados foi a área e sua inter-relação com atributos químicos do solo. Os resultados demonstraram que o sistema de plantio direto proporcionou a formação de agregados maiores, a soja como cultura de verão contribuiu para esse efeito estrutural no solo e a aplicação de gesso agrícola incrementou a agregação em maiores profundidades.

Treatments were established in two management systems (conventional and no-tillage), two doses of gypsum (zero and 2 t ha- 1) and the use of two summer crops (soybean and corn).

Aggregate analyses were done by digital images obtained by scanner (300 dpi) of 60 aggregates arranged in a tray with untidy holes in order to preserve the principle of randomization. Images were later analyzed using the QUANTPORO program, and the analyzed characteristics of the aggregates were the area and its inter-relation with chemical attributes of the soil.

To demonstrate effects of such different approaches, we compared five particle size indicators in order to demonstrate {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each method, the modulus of fineness (MOF), the discrete mean (dMEAN) and median (dMED), and the continuous mean (cMEAN) and median (cMED), well {{aware of the fact that}} a gold standard for this procedure is lacking. Data were obtained from 580 individual faecal samples of different herbivore species by wet sieving over a cascade of nine sieves with mesh sizes ranging from 0. 063 to 16 mm. MOF, dMEAN and dMED can be calculated directly from the results of sieve analysis, but cMEAN and cMED require a curve-fitting procedure. Across the whole sample size, dMEAN and cMEAN showed the highest correlation. The correlation between the respective MEAN and MED was higher for d than for c. As expected, MOF deviated most from the other measurements. Simulating different <b>sieve</b> <b>sets</b> resulted in a poor correlation between the results from the different sets in MOF and cMED, but a good correlation in dMEAN and cMEAN, suggesting that these latter measures can also be compared between studies that do not use identical <b>sieve</b> <b>sets.</b> As the calculation of dMEAN is comparatively simpler and less time-consuming than for cMEAN, we propose the dMEAN as a standard for the description of a mean particle size value obtained from sieve analysis.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 229 - 239). Multi-view shape-from-silhouette {{systems are}} increasingly used for analysing stones. This thesis presents methods to estimate stone shape and to recognise individual stones from their silhouettes. Calibration of two image capture setups is investigated. First, a setup {{consisting of two}} mirrors and a camera is introduced. Pose and camera internal parameters are inferred from silhouettes alone. Second. the conﬁguration and calibration of a high throughput multi-camera setup is covered. Multiple silhouette sets of a stone are merged into a single set by inferring relative poses between sets. This is achieved by adjusting pose parameters to maximise geometrical consistency speciﬁed by the epipolar tangency constraint. Shape properties (such as volume, flatness, and eiongation) are inferred more accurately from the merged silhouette sets than from the original silhouette sets. Merging is used to recognise individual stones from pairs of silhouette sets captured on different occasions. Merged sets with sufﬁcient geometrical consistency are classiﬁed as matches (produced by the same stone), whereas inconsistent sets are classiﬁed as mismatches. Batch matching is determining the one-to-one correspondence between two unordered batches of silhouette sets of the same batch of stones. A probabilistic framework is used to combine recognition by merging (which is slow, but accurate) with the efﬁciency of computing shape distribution-based dissimilarity values. Two unordered batches of 1200 six-view silhouette sets of uncut gemstones are correctly matched in approximately 68 seconds (using a 3. 2 GHz Pentium 4 machine]. An experiment that compares silhouette-based shape estimates with mechanical sieving demonstrates an application using the developed methods. A batch of 494 garnets is sieved 15 times. After each <b>sieving,</b> silhouette <b>sets</b> are captured for sub-batches in each bin. Batch matching is {{used to determine the}} IS sieve bins per stone.

40|$|Near {{infrared}} reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is a rapid and low-cost method {{that has been}} reported to provide accurate prediction of soil total carbon (Ct) and nitrogen (Nt) contents. However, methodological aspects such as sample preparation and set homogeneity have not been addressed extensively. The main objective of the paper was to assess how NIRS determination of Ct and Nt was affected by sample preparation (0. 2 man grinding vs. 2 mm <b>sieving)</b> and <b>set</b> heterogeneity (i. e. using the total set vs. texture or localised sets). The study was performed on a range of Affican and Brazilian Alfisols, Oxisols and Ultisols (297 samples, with 6 - 80 % clay). The total set could be divided into a coarse-textured set, including samples from Burkina Faso and Benin mainly, and a clayey set, including samples front Brazil mainly. Calibration and validation procedures were carried out within the total set and within each of the two texture sets and the three localised sets (Burkina Faso, Benin, and Brazil), Prediction of Ct using first derivatives with SNV (standard normal variate) scatter correction, which was the most appropriate spectrum preprocessing method, was in general more accurate for ground than for sieved samples. The difference was decisive when the determination was carried out on the localised clayey set, moderate on total and texture sets, and unclear on localised coarse-textured sets. Prediction of Nt was less clearly affected by sample preparation, though grinding was useful for the localised clayey set and harmful for localised coarse-textured ones. Thus the effect of sample preparation on prediction accuracy depended on soil texture, which may explain the contradictory results reported in the literature, often referring to narrow soil ranges. Using the same preprocessing method, the accuracy of Ct prediction generally increased with set homogeneity (i. e. from total to texture sets and from texture to localised sets), providing that clayey sets were ground. This agreed with deductions drawn from comparison between earlier studies carried out with either homogeneous or heterogeneous sets. The effect of set homogeneity on Nt prediction could not, however, be clearly demonstrated by this study. In conclusion, the study confirmed the interest of NIRS for the rapid and accurate determination of Ct and Nt, especially when homogeneous sets including ground samples were used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the past}} two decades, several {{breakthrough}} techniques, known as “color coding-related techniques”, lead {{to the design of}} extremely fast parameterized algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a family of strategies, that we call “mixing strategies”, for applying these techniques, developing even faster, closer to optimal, parameterized algorithms. Our strategies combine the following novel ideas. • Mixing narrow <b>sieves</b> and representative <b>sets,</b> two independent color coding-related techniques. • For certain “disjointness conditions”, improving the best known computation of representative sets. • Mixing divide-and-color-based preprocessing with the computation mentioned in the previous item, speeding-up standard representative sets-based algorithms. • Cutting the universe into small pieces in two special manners, one used in the mix mentioned in the previous item, and the other mixed with a non-standard representative sets-based algorithm to improve its running time. Note that the first item implies that representative sets are relevant to the design of fast randomized parameterized algorithms, and not only deterministic ones. We demonstrate the usefulness of our strate-gies by obtaining the following results. We first solve the well-studied k-Internal Out-Branching problem in deterministic time O∗(5. 139 k) and randomized time O∗(3. 617 k), improving upon the pre-vious best deterministic time O∗(6. 855 k) and randomized time O∗(4 k). To this end, we establish a relation between “problematic ” out-trees and maximum matching computations in graphs. We then present a unified approach to improve the O ∗ running times of the previous best deterministic algo-rithms for the classic k-Path, k-Tree, r-Dimensional k-Matching and Graph Motif problems, including their weighted versions, from O∗(2. 619 k), O∗(2. 619 k), O∗(2. 619 (r− 1) k) and O∗(2. 6192 k) to O∗(2. 597 k), O∗(2. 597 k), O∗(2. 597 (r− 1) k) and O∗(2. 5972 k), respectively.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. A {{need was}} {{identified}} {{for a set}} of basic design tools for Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) plant evaporators. This led to an investigation into the different types of evaporators as well as further research on horizontal falling film evaporators as used in the MED process. It also included the theory on these types of evaporators. In order not to duplicate existing design tools, an investigation was also performed on some of the tools that are currently available. The first set of tools that were developed were tools, programmed in EES (Engineering Equation Solver), for the vacuum system and the evaporator. These programs can be used to simulate different parameters (like different mass flows and temperatures). That enables the correct selection of components for the vacuum system and can be used to address sizing issues around the evaporator. It {{can also be used to}} plan the layout of the plant. The second of the design tools was developed by designing and building a flow pattern test section. From the flow pattern test section a set of curves for the wetted length under different conditions was obtained which can be used in order to design the <b>sieve</b> tray. This <b>set</b> of curves was found to be accurate for municipal as well as seawater and can be used in the design of the sieve tray of the evaporator. Further development can be done by implementing the figures of the wetted length into a simulation package like, for example, Flownex (a system CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code that enables users to perform detail design, analysis and optimization of a wide range of thermal-fluid systems). The background gained from the study done on the evaporator can also be implemented into such a package. This could solve the problem of different design packages by creating a single design package with all of the above mentioned options included. Master...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} av ailable at: [URL] wind-erodible {{fraction of the}} soil (EF) (percentage of aggregates < 0. 84 mm in diameter) is a key parameter to estimate the soil susceptibility to wind erosion. The standard method for EF determination is the dry sieving {{by means of a}} rotary sieve. Flat <b>sieving</b> with a <b>set</b> of <b>sieves</b> {{and the use of the}} equation EF = (29. 09 + 0. 31 sand + 0. 17 silt + 0. 33 sand/clay – 2. 59 organic matter– 0. 95 CaCO 3) / 100, R 2 = 0. 67, Fryrear et al., 1994) are two alternative ways of determining EF. As the flat sieving has still not been contrasted against the standard rotary sieve method nor the Fryrear et al. equation tested for soils other than US soils, we estimated EF with both dry sieving methods and tested the equation for soils of semiarid regions of Central Aragon (NE Spain) and the Semiarid Pampas (centre of Argentina), two regions prone to wind erosion. Results showed that EF values obtained with the flat sieve were comparable with those obtained using the standard rotary sieve indicating that the flat sieving technique is suitable for EF determinations. The estimation of EF with the model proposed by Fryrear et al. (1994) did not fit with measured EF values, indicating that this model is not useful for predicting EF in Spanish and Argentinian soils. This was attributed to the high CaCO 3 contents of Spanish soils and the low sand/clay ratios and high organic matter contents of some Argentinean soils. The equation EF = 9. 98 + 6. 91 sand/clay + 14. 1 /organic matter (r = 0. 933; P < 0. 001) was proposed to predict EF in the studied soils.
