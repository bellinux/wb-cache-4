5|$|Burnett Hillman Streeter {{proposed}} Caesarea or Beirut {{for three}} reasons: it contains, after the New Testament, the two Epistles of Clement; it represents an eclectic {{text in the}} New Testament, Antiochian in the Gospels and Alexandrian in the Acts and Epistles, it suggests <b>some</b> <b>place</b> where the influence of Antioch and of Alexandria met; {{the text of the}} Old Testament appears to be a non-Alexandrian text heavily revised by the Hexapla, the Old Testament quotations in New Testament more often than not agree with Alexandrinus against Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|The {{language}} spoken {{during this period}} {{is thought to be}} Southwestern Brythonic, but only one or two inscribed stones survive in Somerset from this period. However, a couple of curse tablets found in the baths at Bath may be in this language. <b>Some</b> <b>place</b> names in Somerset seem to be Celtic in origin and may be from this period or earlier, e.g. Tarnock. Some river names, such as Parrett, may be Celtic or pre-Celtic. The religion of the people of Somerset in this period is thought to be Christian but it was isolated from Rome until after the Council of Hertford in 673AD when Aldhelm was asked to write a letter to Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops. Some church sites in Somerset are thought to date from this period, e.g., Llantokay Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} and religious status spurred growth so in 1477 the defensive earthen ramparts, ringing the town since the Viking age, were abandoned to accommodate expansion. Parts of the ramparts {{are still in}} existence today and can be experienced as steep slopes at the riverside and they have also survived in <b>some</b> <b>place</b> names of the inner city, including the streets of Volden (The Rampart) and Graven (The Moat). Aarhus grew {{to become one of}} the largest cities in the country by the early 16thcentury. In 1657, octroi was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades. Wooden city walls were erected to prevent smuggling, with gates and toll booths on the major thoroughfares, Mejlgade and Studsgade. The city gates funnelled most traffic through a few streets where merchant quarters were built.|$|E

50|$|Kreisler {{performed}} and recorded {{his own version}} of the first movement of Paganini's D major violin concerto. The movement is rescored and in <b>some</b> <b>places</b> reharmonised, and the orchestral introduction is completely rewritten in <b>some</b> <b>places.</b> The overall effect is of a late-nineteenth-century work.|$|R

50|$|Apple has {{admitted}} {{that there were}} several bugs in the mapping app on iOS 6, with cities in the wrong location, <b>some</b> <b>places</b> being missed off altogether, <b>some</b> <b>places</b> misnamed and places {{of interest in the}} sea.

50|$|Mopane is the {{distinctive}} feature, a single-stemmed tree in <b>some</b> <b>places</b> up to 10 m high and in <b>some</b> <b>places</b> {{not much more}} than a shrub. It has butterfly-shaped leaves and grows in dense thickets. In Etosha National Park in Namibia it is by the far the most common species.|$|R

25|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the dating of Zoroaster, the Avesta gives no direct information about it, while historical sources are conflicting. Some scholars base the date reconstruction on the Proto-Indo-Iranian language and Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, and thus it is considered <b>some</b> <b>place</b> in the north-east and time between 1500 and 500 BCE.|$|E
25|$|Demographic {{accounts}} on the Chabad movement vary. Chabad adherents {{are often}} reported to number some 200,000 persons. Some scholars {{have pointed to}} the lack of quantitative data to back this claim, and <b>some</b> <b>place</b> the number of Chabad followers at around 40,000 but note that the number may be higher if the non-Hasidic Jews who join Chabad synagogues are included as well.|$|E
25|$|I {{had to get}} my {{grasshoppers}} from Waco, Texas. They had {{the only}} species large enough to carry focus. I could only import males because they didn't want the things to start breeding. They even had someone from the agricultural department or <b>some</b> <b>place</b> like that come out to take a head count, or wing count. The grasshoppers turned cannibalistic.|$|E

25|$|On 24 June the {{government}} suffered an anti-communist coup attempt. A retaliation occurred via secret police, revolutionary tribunals and semiregular detachments such as Tibor Szamuely's bodyguards, the Lenin Boys, which {{became known as}} the Red Terror. Of those arrested, an estimated 370 to about 600 were killed; <b>some</b> <b>place</b> the number at 590. It has been argued that the major limiting factor on the repression were the former Social Democrats such as József Pogány, relatively moderate supporters of Kun.|$|E
25|$|The movie {{takes place}} everywhere, {{and it takes}} place nowhere. It's a city built of pieces of cities. A corner from one place, another from <b>some</b> <b>place</b> else. So, you don't really know where you are. A piece will look like a street in London, but {{a portion of the}} {{architecture}} looks like New York, but the bottom of the architecture looks again like a European city. You're there, but you don't know where you are. It's like every time you travel, you'll be lost.|$|E
25|$|A pilgrim (from the Latin peregrinus) is a {{traveler}} (literally {{one who has}} come from afar) who is on a journey to a holy place. Typically, this is a physical journey (often on foot) to <b>some</b> <b>place</b> of special significance to the adherent of a particular religious belief system. In the spiritual literature of Christianity, the concept of pilgrim and pilgrimage may refer {{to the experience of}} life in the world (considered as a period of exile) or to the inner path of the spiritual aspirant from a state of wretchedness to a state of beatitude.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the very}} similar {{processes}} of place name formation in Sinhala and Tamil explicated above, {{it is not}} always easy to establish the original language of a place name, because loan translations are common in both directions. For such an alleged example of loan translation, see the case of Trincomalee above. Additionally, <b>some</b> <b>place</b> names draw on Sanskrit or Pali roots, which are then adapted to Sinhala and Tamil phonology in different ways. These intricacies {{must be taken into account}} when evaluating claims that a certain area was predominantly inhabited by one group or the other at a certain point in time.|$|E
25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{affirms that}} human beings exist in a world around them and that through {{background}} a priori (before experience) foreknowledge, they constantly seek to understand themselves and that world, including other humans and inanimate objects. Heidegger termed human beings as Dasein, the German word for being-there. In other words, an individual is termed Dasein {{because he or she}} exists there, being there at <b>some</b> <b>place</b> in the present. Put in more simple terms, an individual is Dasein because he or she literally exists. Heidegger, along with Dilthey, was concerned about understanding human nature, what it means to exist, to be.|$|E
25|$|The map {{currently}} in Ryūkoku University (hereafter, Ryūkoku copy) has gathered scholarly attention {{since the early}} 20th century. It is 158cm by 163cm, painted on silk. It is presumed that the Ryūkoku copy was created in Korea {{but it is not}} clear when the copy was brought to Japan. One claims that it was purchased by Ōtani Kōzui and others assume that it was obtained during the invasion of Korea (1592-1598) and given to the West Honganji temple by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. It contains <b>some</b> <b>place</b> names of Korea that are newer than 1402, suggesting that the Ryūkoku copy was partially modified from the 1402 original around the 1470s and 1480s.|$|E

25|$|Taxonomists {{generally}} {{disagree about}} the most appropriate placement of the subfamily Cricetinae within the superfamily Muroidea. <b>Some</b> <b>place</b> it in a family Cricetidae that also includes voles, lemmings, and New World rats and mice; others group all these into a large family called Muridae. Their evolutionary history is recorded by 15 extinct fossil genera and extends back 11.2 million to 16.4 million years to the Middle Miocene Epoch in Europe and North Africa; in Asia it extends 6 million to 11 million years. Four of the seven living genera include extinct species. One extinct hamster of Cricetus, for example, lived in North Africa during the Middle Miocene, but the only extant member of that genus is the European or common hamster of Eurasia.|$|E
500|$|The name Tylos {{is thought}} to be a Hellenisation of the Semitic Tilmun (from Dilmun). The term Tylos was {{commonly}} used for the islands until Ptolemy’s Geographia when the inhabitants are referred to as Thilouanoi. <b>Some</b> <b>place</b> names in Bahrain go back to the Tylos era; for instance the name of Arad, a residential suburb of Muharraq, is believed to originate from [...] "Arados", the ancient Greek name for Muharraq.|$|E
500|$|If <b>some</b> <b>place</b> in the New World deserves, for its {{location}} and natural conditions, {{to become one}} day a theater of big events, a center of civilization and culture, an emporium of worldwide commerce, it is, in my opinion, Rio de Janeiro. I cannot, here, repress this observation. Willingly hovers the fantasy {{on the future of}} such charming country, that is at present little developed and, so to speak, does not have a past.—Johann Emmanuel Pohl ...|$|E
