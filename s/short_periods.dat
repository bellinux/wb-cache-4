40|$|Seismic {{behavior}} of <b>short</b> <b>period</b> structures with dampers founded on rock is investigated. A single bay frame with diagonal damper that represents <b>short</b> <b>period</b> structures is evaluated {{in response to}} the excitation of a set of earthquake records. The frame system is modeled as a generalized single degree of freedom system, and is subjected to five earthquake records representative of rock site conditions. The relationship between the force modification factor and the global ductility demand for <b>short</b> <b>period</b> structures founded on rock, in the presence of dampers, tends to approach those of long period ones. Compared with seismic demand under general site conditions, <b>short</b> <b>period</b> structures founded on rock show less seismic demand and less sensitivity to earthquake excitations. Similar to seismic demand in general site conditions, dampers with high damping ratios for <b>short</b> <b>period</b> structures in rock sites tend to keep the structural response in the elastic range even for high values of force reductions. Seismic code provisions should be revised to account for <b>short</b> <b>period</b> effect under seismic excitation...|$|R
40|$|The {{observed}} orbital {{elements of}} <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comets {{are found to}} be consistent with the hypothesis of derivation from long period comets as long as two assumptions are made. First, the distribution of <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comets has been randomized by multiple encounters with Jupiter and second, the <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comets have lower velocities of encounter with Jupiter than is generally expected. Some 16 % of the observed <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comets have lower encounter velocities than is allowed mathematically using Laplace's method. This may be due to double encounter processes with Jupiter and Saturn, or as a result of prolonged encounters. The distribution of unobservable <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comets can be inferred in part from the observed comets. Many have orbits between Jupiter and Saturn with somewhat higher inclinations than those with perihelions near the earth. Debris from those comets may form the major component of the zodiacal dust...|$|R

5|$|Modern {{methods of}} {{producing}} lager were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the Spaten Brewery in Bavaria, and Anton Dreher, who began brewing a lager (now known as Vienna lager), probably of amber-red colour, in Vienna in 1840–1841.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{observations}} {{and analysis of}} HIFOGS 10 microns spectrophotometry of <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comet 19 P/Borrelly on 2003 October 13, 15 UT at the NASA IRTF. 19 P/Borrelly {{is one of two}} <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comets, comet 4 PIFaye being the other, to have a silicate feature detected. During Borrelly s perihelion passage in 1994 December, a silicate feature was present with a flux-to-continuum ratio of 0. 25. Two apparitions later in 2003 October, the silicate feature is absent. Thermal emission modeling using amorphous olivine and amorphous carbon shows that a slight increase in grain size accounts for the disappearance of the silicate feature. Analysis of 19 P/Borrelly suggests grain size, and not the absence of olivine minerals, may be responsible for the absence of silicate features in most <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comets. 19 P/Borrelly {{is one of the more}} active <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comets. However, <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comets as a family are less active than long <b>period</b> comets. <b>Short</b> <b>period</b> comets probably originated in the Kuiper Belt and suffered collisions while in residence in the outer solar system. Upon evolution into orbits that take them through the inner solar system, the surfaces of <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comets are exposed to sunlight through their many perihelion passages. This is in contrast to long period comets which probably originated near Jupiter and were expelled to the Oort cloud where they have existed and been exposed to cosmic ray processing. By studying the grain properties in <b>short</b> <b>period</b> comets and comparing to long period comets, we compare the effects on the grain populations of different parent body evolution histories. Upcoming opportunities to study <b>short</b> and long <b>period</b> comets will be advertised...|$|R

Panorpa raid spider webs to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs.

5|$|However, {{others argue}} that the Sun is {{currently}} close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} had {{a complicated}} organisational history during this period, {{with a large}} number of units being attached or withdrawn for <b>short</b> <b>periods,</b> while others were merged or disbanded. About thirty infantry battalions were attached for <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> and the divisional artillery and supply columns remained in support of the front line, while one ambulance company was later transferred to serve with the American 27th Division. The future of the division was again in doubt by early September; the 197th Brigade had been transferred to a training role and the division was expected to be disbanded. Bethell argued for retaining the division and was ordered to prepare it for front-line service; the 197th Brigade was replaced by the South African Brigade to bring the division back up to strength. By the end of September, following amalgamations and reorganisation, the division was left with the South African Brigade (1st, 2nd, and 4th South African Infantry regiments), the 198th Brigade (5th Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, 6th Royal Dublin Fusiliers and 6th Lancashire Fusiliers) and the 199th Brigade, with the 9th Manchester Regiment, 5th Connaught Rangers and 18th King's (Liverpool Regiment). The divisional pioneers were the 9th Gloucestershire Regiment. Less than {{a year and a half}} after arriving in France, the division retained only the 6th Lancashire and 9th Manchester of its twelve original battalions and both of these had been amalgamated with other units from the 42nd Division.|$|E
