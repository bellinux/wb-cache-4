5|$|With Charles V {{distracted by}} the {{internal}} politics of his many kingdoms and external threats, and Henry and Francis on relatively good terms, domestic and not foreign policy issues had been Henry's priority {{in the first half}} of the 1530s. In 1536, for example, Henry granted his assent to the Laws in Wales Act 1535, which legally annexed Wales, uniting England and Wales into a single nation. This was followed by the Second Succession Act (the Act of Succession 1536), which declared Henry's children by Jane to be next in the line of succession and declared both Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate, thus excluding them from the throne. The king was also granted the power to further determine the line of succession in his will, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> no further issue. However, when Charles and Francis made peace in January 1539, Henry became increasingly paranoid, perhaps as a result of receiving a constant list of threats to the kingdom (real or imaginary, minor or serious) supplied by Cromwell in his role as spymaster. Enriched by the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry used some of his financial reserves to build a series of coastal defences and set some aside for use in the event of a Franco-German invasion.|$|E
25|$|Norwegian police {{rounded up}} their {{investigation}} in May 2009. Until then, the detained suspect {{had been charged}} with 54 cases of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault; however, this number was raised with an unmentioned number at that time. He has admitted to involvement in 20 cases. The suspect who has been detained throughout the investigation will remain in custody until at least the end of August 2009. He has consistently agreed to prolonged detention to avoid being hounded by the news media <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> been released before the trial.|$|E
25|$|Police had {{established}} a command post {{two blocks from the}} restaurant. They initially did not know how many shooters were inside, since Huberty was using firearms of several different types, and rapidly firing numerous shots. Because most of the restaurant's windows had been shattered by gunfire, reflections from shards of glass made it difficult for police to see inside. A police sniper who was part of the SWAT team was positioned {{on the roof of the}} post office next door to the McDonald's. He was authorized to kill Huberty <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> a clear shot.|$|E

25|$|After these expeditions {{returned}} home, Brennus urged {{and persuaded}} them {{to mount a}} third united expedition against central Greece, led by himself and Acichorius. The reported strength of the army of 152,000 infantry and 24,400 cavalry is impossibly large. The actual number of horsemen has to be intended half as big: Pausanias describes how they used a tactic called trimarcisia, where each cavalryman was supported by two mounted servants, who could supply him with a spare horse <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> to be dismounted, or take {{his place in the}} battle, should he be killed or wounded.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Gordon asked {{part-time}} driver Mark Martin if {{he could}} be on standby {{for him to take}} over the No. 24 car, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> needed to miss a race to witness the birth of his first child. Daughter Ella Sofia Gordon was born on Wednesday, June 20 in New York City; Gordon traveled to Sonoma, California later that week to compete in the Toyota Save/Mart 350 on June 24. In 2010, Gordon similarly asked road course ringer Scott Pruett to be on standby for him at Watkins Glen due to the impending birth of his second child. Although Gordon let Pruett run a couple of practice laps in Gordon's car, Gordon was able to start and complete the race without Pruett's assistance. Son Leo Benjamin Gordon was born less than a day after the race's conclusion. In 2014, Gordon had Regan Smith on standby for the Coca-Cola 600, as Gordon suffered from back spasms during qualifying and practice. Gordon was able to start and complete the race as scheduled.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruling was}} based around seven issues. The panel {{declared}} that Keegan had been misled {{to believe he}} had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, or word of mouth {{that he did not}} or that his role would see him essentially report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premiership manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect {{that this was not a}} factor. The club's signing of González meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While González was the main issue in the panel final decision, the club's alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> not agreed to the terms they offered him, as well as his decision to remain at the club till the 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the panel ruling in Keegan's favour. Keegan was awarded £2million (plus interest accrued) according to severance clauses in his contract, which the club never paid him after his departure. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the standard contract severance clauses covered constructive dismissal, however he happily stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.|$|E

500|$|Following the race, Kimi Räikkönen apologised to {{his team}} {{over the radio}} for his spin, which many felt cost him a podium finish. In post-race interviews, he {{explained}} that an issue with the torque map, triggered by the pit stop, had caused him to spin out at the hairpin. After finishing sixth from 15th on the grid, Felipe Massa was happy with a [...] "good race", but lamented his problems in qualifying as he felt a podium finish {{would have been in}} reach, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> started further up the order.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after, however, Lefebvre {{announced}} that he had received a note from Cardinal Ratzinger in which he [...] "was asked to beg pardon for [...] errors" [...] and thereupon decided that he was obliged both to reject the arrangement he had agreed to and to consecrate a successor—if necessary, without papal approval. As Cardinal Ratzinger did not specify a date for the episcopal consecration, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> died before the consecration was granted, the Society would be unable to ordain any seminarians and thus forced into capitulation with the Holy See. He dubbed his plan [...] "Operation Survival".|$|E
500|$|Verdi and Strepponi {{moved into}} Sant'Agata on 1 May 1851. May also brought an offer {{for a new}} opera from La Fenice, which Verdi {{eventually}} realised as La traviata. That was followed by {{an agreement with the}} Rome Opera company to present Il trovatore for January 1853. Verdi now had sufficient earnings to retire, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> wished to do so. He had reached a stage where he could develop his operas as he wished, rather than be dependent on commissions from third parties. [...] Il trovatore was in fact the first opera he wrote without a specific commission (apart from Oberto). At around the same time he began to consider creating an opera from Shakespeare's King Lear. After first (1850) seeking a libretto from Cammarano (which never appeared), Verdi later (1857) commissioned one from Antonio Somma, but this proved intractable, and no music was ever written. Verdi began work on Il trovatore {{after the death of his}} mother in June 1851. The fact that this is [...] "the one opera of Verdi's which focuses on a mother rather than a father" [...] is perhaps related to her death.|$|E

60|$|But {{whatever}} fate might decree for him, Rais Ali had {{a peculiar}} knack of decreeing {{a few things}} for himself which neither fate nor anything else appeared {{to be able to}} deprive him of. One of these decrees was that, come what might, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> his morning cup of coffee; another, that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a daily shave; a third, that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a bath at least once a week.|$|R

2500|$|Suppose Libet {{knows that}} your {{readiness}} potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 {{of the experimental}} trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> to add to this number to get {{the time you were}} conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from [...] retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds [...] a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to you. (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the intersection of two trajectories: ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{commentators}} {{complained that}} because Pietersen changed {{from being a}} right-handed to a left-handed batsman as the bowler approached his delivery stride, he was gaining an unfair advantage. Gideon Haigh said that [...] "A bowler must advise a batsman when he's changing direction, why should the batsmen not; given that where the bowler's aiming {{will depend on the}} placement of the off stump". Ian Healy seconded this by saying [...] "It just should be outlawed straightaway. If you want to hit {{to one side of the}} field, you've got to do it in a cross fashion, and not swap the way you're facing or your grip. Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups." [...] Former fast-bowler Michael Holding argued [...] "if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> to tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Istrati's {{connection}} with the Crusade was not his only contact with right-wing radicalism: he had also promised to have his political testament printed in Gringoire, a newspaper of the French far-right. Against Talex's disclaimers, several later exegetes have reanimated the debate about Istrati's possible fascist leanings. Historian Jean-Michel Palmier includes Istrati's name {{on a list of}} [...] "intellectuals [...] saw for a moment in fascism the possibility of arousing a crisis-struck Europe from its lethargy." [...] He is in the company of Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis. Philologist Tudorel Urian asks: [...] "Who really is Istrati: the frantic socialist he was before his visit to the USSR [...] or the nationalist of his very last months, the emblem of a Guardist periodical? There is something that those who judge him rarely take into account: in the periods when he flirted with socialism [...] and Guardism, both movements where in their romantic, idealistic stages. Once he {{came face to face with}} the brutal realities of the Soviet regime, Istrati broke with socialism and perhaps his famous motto, je ne marche pas [...] would have come into play in relation with the Guardists, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> lived to see their earliest crimes." ...|$|E
