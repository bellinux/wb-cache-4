5000|$|<b>Strawberry</b> <b>crinkle</b> virus (SCV) is a plant virus of {{the family}} Rhabdoviridae that infects plants of the genus Fragaria, {{commonly}} called [...] "strawberries". It is transmitted by aphids of the genus Chaetosiphon. Virions are rod-shaped, enveloped, 74-88 nanometres (nm) in diameter and 163-383 nm in length, with surface projections. Its genome encodes at least five proteins including the nucleocapsid protein (45 kDa), the viral matrix protein (77 kDa), a nonstructural phosphoprotein (55 kDa), and a glycoprotein (23 kDa).|$|E
40|$|Rhabdoviridae family viruses {{attacking the}} plant hosts were only {{described}} at the angiosperms. In this work, a gymnosperm rhabdoviridae infection was described {{for the first}} time ever ? specifically at Ginkgo biloba. Even though there were not observed any kinds of obvious infection symptoms on any of randomly chosen plant samples, through the molecular methods and detection primers the rhabdoviridae infection was proved at six of the plant samples. The acquired nucleotide and amino acid sequences, which were compared with the GenBank sequences, confirm the Rhabdoviridae family viruses occurrence. These given sequences demonstrated a certain analogy with a <b>Strawberry</b> <b>crinkle</b> virus assigned to the genus of Cytorhabdoviruses. The analyses proved a different reciprocal homology among the nucleotide sequences of the individual isolates, and in all likelihood an occurrence of two up to now unknown viruses in the Ginkgo biloba samples was proved {{for the first time}}. A definite categorization will be dependent on an acquisition and comparison of other sequences from the isolates genome and also on certain biological characteristics observation...|$|E
40|$|We {{completed}} the genome sequence of Lettuce necrotic yellows virus (LNYV) by determining the nucleotide sequences of the 4 a (putative phosphoprotein), 4 b, M (matrix protein), G (glycoprotein) and L (polymerase) genes. The genome consists of 12, 807 nucleotides and encodes six {{genes in the}} order 3 ′ leader-N- 4 a(P) - 4 b-M-G-L- 5 ′ trailer. Sequences were derived from clones of a cDNA library from LNYV genomic RNA and from fragments amplified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The 4 a protein has a low isoelectric point characteristic for rhabdovirus phosphoproteins. The 4 b protein has significant sequence similarities with the movement proteins of capillo- and trichoviruses and {{may be involved in}} cell-to-cell movement. The putative G protein sequence contains a predicted 25 amino acids signal peptide and endopeptidase cleavage site, three predicted glycosylation sites and a putative transmembrane domain. The deduced L protein sequence shows similarities with the L proteins of other plant rhabdoviruses and contains polymerase module motifs characteristic for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of negative-strand RNA viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of this motif among rhabdoviruses placed LNYV in a group with other sequenced cytorhabdoviruses, most closely related to <b>Strawberry</b> <b>crinkle</b> virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} aphid-borne viruses infecting Strawberry (Fragaria spp.) <b>Strawberry</b> <b>crinkle</b> virus (SCV), Strawberry mild yellow edge virus (SMYEV), Strawberry mottle virus (SMoV) and Strawberry vein banding virus (SVBV) {{can cause}} serious crop losses. In this paper, a multiplex reverse transcriptase {{polymerase chain reaction}} (RT-PCR) method is described for the simultaneous detection of all four viruses in combination with a plant mRNA specific internal control {{which can be used}} as an indicator of the effectiveness of the extraction and RT-PCR. In total, 18 strawberry isolates infected naturally were analysed by this method. Every combination of RNA virus was able to be detected and a full complement of all four viruses were found together in three isolates, all taken from wild strawberry (Fragaria chiloensis (L.) Duch.) in Chile. The upper detection limit for the four viruses was at an extract dilution of 1 / 200. The broad applicability of the RNA specific internal control primers—which produced a PCR fragment of the expected size in 25 of 27 plant species tested—combined with improvements, made in extraction methods described provides potentially a standard method for comparable RT-PCR analyses {{in a wide variety of}} plant species...|$|E
40|$|A partial {{sequence}} of the putative polymerase (L) protein of <b>Strawberry</b> <b>crinkle</b> virus (SCV), genus Cytorhabdovirus, is described. The virus protein {{was found to be}} distantly related to the L protein of the rhabdoviruses Northern cereal mosaic virus, Rice yellow stunt virus and Sonchus yellow net virus. Moreover, a tentative grouping of SCV isolates is described, based on phylogenetic analysis of a region enclosing the GDN-motif within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. A sequence homology of 98 % was found for each tentative group, and heterogeneity of at least 11 % was observed between both groups. The tentative grouping {{did not appear to be}} related to symptomatology or geographical origin of the isolates. Nevertheless, the use of several reverse-transcription (RT) -PCR primer sets, all directed to different regions within the SCV genome, confirmed the presumptive classification into two groups, namely group I (isolates 1554, KG and Post), and group II (isolates 1553, Hb-A 1, 37 - 1 and 37 - 2). Additionally, the detection of SCV isolates from herbaceous hosts and strawberry plant material was possible through use of a newly developed gel-based RT-PCR and a gel-free AmpliDet RNA assay. Both methods have the potential to provide rapid, sensitive and specific detection of SCV in in vitro propagation materia...|$|E
40|$|Intact {{rhabdovirus}} {{particles of}} <b>strawberry</b> <b>crinkle</b> virus (SCV) mechanically transmitted from Fragaria vesca UC-S to Physalis pubescens plants were purified. When these particles {{were used as}} an immunogen, {{it was not possible}} to obtain either a virus-specific polyclonal antiserum after rabbit immunization or monoclonal antibodies. Each of the major nucleocapsid proteins (N, Ns and M) were therefore purified by means of preparative electrophoresis and injected into mice. The polyclonal mouse antisera raised showed a specific reaction with SCV-infected P. pubescens sag. Work is in progress to obtain specific monoclonal antibodies. It is also possible to isolate one ssRNA of about 13 kb from purified particles of SCV. Relatively abundant dsRNA could be extracted from Nicotiana occidentalis 37 B plants infected with strawberry mottle virus (SMoV). This dsRNA was composed of two bands of about 7. 8 and 6. 3 kbp which were DNase resistant. They became RNAse resistant in the presence of NaCI above 0. 5 M. Work is in progress to make a cDNA library from purified dsRNA of SMoV. The need of replacing the leaf-graft indexing of strawberry for the major aphid-borne viruses in relation to the potential offered by the current knowledge on these viruses is discussed...|$|E

[1] [1] Univ Talca, Inst Biol Vegetal & Biotecnol, Talca, Chile [3] Univ Talca, Fac Ciencias Agr, Talca, ChileWild and {{cultivated}} Fragaria chiloensis ssp. chiloensis (Fcc) plants were collected at different locations in southern Chile {{in order to}} determine the current viral status of this native strawberry. The following aphidborne viruses (ABVs) : Strawberry mild yellow edge virus (SMYEV), Strawberry mottle virus (SMoV), <b>Strawberry</b> <b>crinkle</b> virus (SCV) and Strawberry vein banding virus (SVBV), were found in wild {{and cultivated}} Fcc plants, but severe symptoms were not associated with viral infection. Furthermore, partial gene sequences of these ABV isolates were determined and displayed a high degree of conservation with virus isolates reported previously. In addition, partial gene sequences of SCV and SVBV from southernmost South American populations of Fcc are described for the first time. High-throughput parallel sequencing (Illumina) of double-stranded RNA was used to provide viral profiles of Fcc from different locations. Although strong evidence of novel viruses affecting Fcc was not found, it was confirmed that ABVs are the most frequent viruses affecting this subspecies. The information provided will help in the development of high-quality molecular tools for virus detection and control in Fcc.;;...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{assessed}} {{the risk to}} plant health of <b>Strawberry</b> <b>crinkle</b> virus (SCV) for the European Union (EU) territory, and evaluated the current EU legislation and possible risk reduction options. This virus is widely distributed {{both within and outside}} Europe and the same applies to its main vector, the strawberry aphid, Chaetosiphon fragaefolii. At-risk hosts (Fragaria spp.) occur widely in Europe. Plants for planting were identified as the most significant entry pathway and the probability of entry is rated as unlikely to moderately likely with high uncertainty. The probability of establishment is rated as very likely with low uncertainty. The probability of local spread by natural means is moderately likely, with high uncertainty, whereas that of human-assisted long-distance spread is unlikely, with medium uncertainty. The potential consequences are rated as minimal to minor with medium uncertainty. Prohibition and restricting import or intra-EU trade to certified materials or to materials originating from pest-free areas or pest-free places of production are the options with highest effectiveness against the risks of introduction or against the risks of further spread. Prohibition and certification are also among the options of high or very high feasibility. In addition, {{it should be noted that}} the combination of options (cultural practices, certification, exclusion conditions, tolerant varieties) has an overall high to very high level of effectiveness and feasibility. The current legislation has few weaknesses: the reliance on visual inspection, as well as the exceptions or derogations offered to some countries in which SCV is present. If the current legislation were removed, no major consequences would be expected unless the industry simultaneously ceased its widely adopted certification activity, which seems unlikely given the potential consequence...|$|E

In addition, the Panel is requested to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the present EU requirements against these organisms laid down in Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. As a consequence EFSA needs insight in the cropping practices of Citrus spp., Fragaria x ananassa, Ribes spp., Rubus spp., Vaccinium spp., Humulus lupulus, Vitis vinifera, Prunus armeniaca, P. avium, P. cerasus, P. domestica and P. persica, which are host plants for these pests. An extensive and systematic literature search was done in which scientific and grey/technical literature was retrieved from the 28 EU Member States, Iceland and Norway. All references were stored in EndNote libraries, separately for scientific literature and grey/technical literature. For each reference information is provided on the source/search strategy, the crop, the country, the topic (cropping practice, propagation, protection or irrigation (only for Citrus)) and protected cultivation vs. field production. Yields of references depended on the crop and on the country. Over 27, 000 references were provided to EFSA. This allows EFSA to quickly find information on crop production, both indoors and outdoors, of all crops that were studied in this extensive literature search. The data can be used by EFSA for the present mandate, but are also an excellent basis for other current and future mandates...|$|E
