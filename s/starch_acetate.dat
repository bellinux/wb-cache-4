40|$|This study {{investigates the}} release {{mechanism}} of a hydrophilic drug (caffeine) from hydrophobic matrix tablets composed of <b>starch</b> <b>acetate.</b> Different particle size fractions of <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> were mixed with caffeine (22 % V/V) to obtain various mixture organisations in the powder, as 14 {{well as in the}} final tablet. The organisation of powder mixtures was calculated by the carrier payload of <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> particles, while the pore size distributions in tablets were measured by mercury intrusion porosimetry. A carrier payload below I indicated the existence of a free <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> particle surface, while numbers greater than 1 pointed to a complete occupation of the <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> particle surface area by caffeine particles. The carrier payload calculations gave a good prediction for the existence of a <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> matrix in the tablet structures. Caffeine matrices in tablets compressed from the mixtures could be detected by mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements. The existence of different matrices, as well as different pore networks, determined the physical changes of the tablets and {{the release mechanism}} of caffeine during dissolution tests. When a tablet contained only a caffeine matrix, rapid tablet disintegration and immediate release of the total amount of caffeine occurred. A single matrix of <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> resulted in tablets that remained intact, although cracks were formed. The co-existence of matrices of both materials created surface erosion of the tablet. The caffeine release profiles of tablets that remained intact or showed erosion were fitted by an equation containing both diffusional and relaxational factors to describe the effect of tablet porosity on drug release.

At the end of the production phase of <b>starch</b> <b>acetate,</b> the slurry of <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> was dried using various techniques. Particle, powder, and tableting properties of end products were investigated. Particle size, circularity, surface texture, water content and specific surface area varied according to the particular drying method of choice. However, all powders were freely flowing. Bulk and tapped densities of powders varied in the range of 0. 29 to 0. 44 g/cm 3 and 0. 39 to 0. 56 g/cm 3, respectively. Compaction characteristics revealed that all powders were easily deformed under compression, having yield pressure values of less than 66 MPa according to Heckel analysis. All powders possessed a significant interparticulate bond-forming capacity during compaction. The tensile strength values of tablets varied between 10 and 18 MPa.

40|$|Starch is a {{well-known}} candidate material for replacement of petroleum-derived synthetic polymers to decrease environmental pollution due to its low cost, availability, and total degradability after usage. However, weak water-resistance and poor mechanical properties and dimensional stability limit its wide application. High degree of substitution (DS) <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> and starch acetate-maleate are alternatives. ^ During acetylation, DS increased with longer reaction times and higher ratios of acetic anhydride to starch. Reaction efficiency increased with longer reaction times, and decreased with increases in the ratio of acetic anhydride to starch. After acetylation, and as DS increased, the crystalline structures and granule structures of native starch disappeared, while thermal stability increased. ^ Foams were prepared by extruding <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> with different DS values using water or ethanol as the blowing agent. Physical and mechanical properties, morphology, and water absorption of the foams depended {{on the type of}} blowing agent and DS. When extruded with water, the extrudates had dense cells with thick cell walls. Radial expansion ratio and spring index decreased, while unit density and compressibility increased with increasing DS. Contrary results were obtained with ethanol as the blowing agent. Tg and the thermal stability of foams increased with extrusion. The rate of biodegradation of the foams decreased with increasing DS. ^ Mixing with other biopolymers or preparation of <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> nanocomposites are two methods to improve functional properties of <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> foam.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{demands for}} using agricultural materials in industrial applications {{to reduce the}} dependence on cruel oils and natural gases, starch has {{received a lot of}} attention. Starch molecules can be chemically modified to obtain properties similar to petroleum-based polymers. However, due to their inherent hydrophilic characteristics, after thermomechanical process such as extrusion, starch-based materials have low functional properties and cannot compete with other polymers. In this dissertation, <b>starch</b> <b>acetate,</b> a chemically modified hydrophobic polymer, was used as the base material to prepare extruded materials. ^ During extrusion, starch acetates were transformed, losing their original morphological properties, and resulting in direct effects on the functional and thermal properties of the final materials. With this information, it was possible to separate the effect from second phase materials on the final two phase starch system. ^ Research was conducted to prepare various extruded foams from starch acetates and other biopolymers. By blending starch acetates with biopolymers, some of the functional properties were increased while the preparation cost was reduced. On the other way, the improved functional properties suggested well-blended/homogeneous mixtures were obtained. ^ Detailed studies also were conducted to analyze the relationship between morphological and functional properties of processed two phase starch-based materials. Both starch acetate-cellulose and starch acetate-PLA (two phase systems) were well-mixed and no phase separation occurred, suggesting starch acetates had good miscibility with the other two biopolymers. Cellulose and PLA did not just functioned as fillers in the predominantly <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> systems, but their appearances also improve some of the functional properties. ^ Finally, macromolecular structural properties were examined using scanning electronic microscope. The starch acetate-cellulose foams showed the optimum hexagonal cell structures. This was the major reason why these foams had good functional properties. Meanwhile, post-extrusion steaming recovery of starch acetate-based extruded foams was discovered, to provide broader applications and reusability of the foams. ...|$|E

Acetic, propionic, heptanoic, and palmitic anhydrides were used at 0. 01, 0. 02, and 0. 03 mol levels to obtain different degrees of substitution (DS) in the starch. Physical properties of the extrudates such as unit and solid density, specific mechanical energy, water absorption and water solubility indices, as well as molecular degradation and DS of the starch, were measured. DS increased {{as the level of}} anhydride increased. Lower molecular weights and higher levels of anhydride resulted in the greatest reduction in starch molecular weight. ^ Modified starches also were produced in a batch process and then extruded. <b>Starch</b> <b>acetate</b> with degrees of substitution of 2 and 3 were extruded with either water or ethanol in a single screw extruder. <b>Starch</b> <b>acetate</b> with degree of substitution of 3 was extruded with either 16 or 18 % (db) ethanol in a single screw extruder at 120 and 160 Â°C. Physical properties of the extrudates such as unit and solid density, specific mechanical energy, water absorption and water solubility indices, as well as molecular degradation and degree of substitution (DS) of the starch, were measured. It was established that samples extruded with organic solvent such as ethanol, and at higher temperatures, had mechanical properties closer to commercial foam materials than samples extruded with water and samples extruded at lower temperatures.

The highest first-order RDX biodegradation rate ranged between 0. 140 and 0. 447 hâˆ’ 1 for acetate amended columns as compared to 0. 037 to 0. 083 hâˆ’ 1 in control columns (no amendment). The addition of soluble starch resulted in increased toxicity (based on MicrotoxÂ® analysis) that was partially removed by biological activity in the columns. Ethanol addition itself {{did not result in}} increased toxicity but biological activity in this system did induce MicrotoxÂ® toxicity. Acetate did not have any MicrotoxÂ® toxicity associated with it. The addition of ammonium as a nitrogen source did not significantly increase the removal rate of RDX.

40|$|In this study, a {{specific}} enzyme catalase was immobilised {{onto the surface}} of two different biodegradable materials, <b>starch</b> cellulose <b>acetate</b> (SCA) and <b>starch</b> polycrapolactone (SPCL) blends. This immobilisation was achieved by several different routes, mainly by covalent binding and an adsorption method using as activation agents epichlorohydrin, cyanogen bromide (CNBr), and aminopropyltriethoxysilane. The effect of the coupling pH of the enzyme-support reaction was determined in terms of activity recovery (%). The catalase immobilised on SCA showed higher activity recovery (%) for all the methods used as compared with results obtained with SPCL. The immobilisation process using epichlorohydrin as an activation agent and polyethylenimine as a spacer-arm enhanced the stability and the half-lives at pH 7. 0, 30 Â°C, for immobilised catalase on both SCA and SPCL. The half-lives were respectively, 1162 and 870 h compared with other treatments and free enzyme (480 h). The free glycerol present in the immobilisation medium was also a factor that contributed toward the better performance regarding the long-term stability at 30 Â°C and neutral pH. The extension of the morphological modifications {{on the surface of the}} materials was observed by scanning electron microscopy. In general, the results indicated that the chemical modification with epichlorohydrin could provide a simple and rather efficient technique to modify the starch-based materials' surface that might be useful in several biomedical applicationsFundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e Tecnologia (FCT) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is optimization of losartan floating tablet formulation by 23 factorial design. Floating tablets of losartan (100 mg) were formulated employing Cross linked starch-urea, a new modified starch (50 %) as matrix forming polymer, sodium bicarbonate as gas generating agent and beeswax and <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> as floating enhancers. Losartan potassium is an orally active anti-hypertensive drug, majorly absorbed from stomach and upper small intestine. Formulation of sustained release floating tablets of losartan is needed because of its poor oral bioavailability and short biological half-life. Losartan floating tablets were formulated as per 23 factorial design and were evaluated. The individual effects of sodium bicarbonate (Factor A) and <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> (Factor C) and their combined effect (AC) on the floating lag time were significant (P < 0. 05). Whereas the individual effect of bees wax (Factor B) and all other combined effects of the three factors involved were not significant in influencing floating lag time of the tablets. Formulations Fab, Fac and Fabc exhibited excellent floating over 12 - 14 h with a floating lag time in the range 15 - 35 seconds. Higher levels (20 %) of sodium bicarbonate gave shorter floating lag time. Losartan release from the floating tablets prepared except formulation Fa was slow and spread over 12 h and dependent on the composition of the tablets. Drug release from formulation Fa was very rapid. Losartan release from the floating tablets was by nonfickian diffusion mechanism in all the cases except Fa. In the case of formulation Fa that gave rapid release of drug fickian diffusion was the drug release mechanism. Optimization of losartan floating tablet formulation was done taking floating lag time as the parameter for optimization. The polynomial equation describing the relationship between the response, Y and the variables, X 1, X 2 and X 3 based on the observed data was found to be Y = 11. 59 - 11. 18 (X 1) + 4. 36 (X 2) â€“ 4. 37 (X 1 X 2) - 1. 08 (X 3) + 0. 895 (X 1 X 3) â€“ 0. 735 (X 2 X 3) + 0. 79 (X 1 X 2 X 3). Based on the polynomial equation developed, the optimized losartan floating tablet formulation with a floating lag time of 20 seconds could be formulated employing sodium bicarbonate (160 mg/tablet), beeswax (28 mg/tablet) and <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> (60 mg/tablet). The optimized formulation (Fopt) exhibited a floating time of 12 - 14 h with a lag time of 19 - 20 seconds fulfilling the target floating lag time set indicating validity of the optimization technique employed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to prepare, characterize and to evaluate a new modified starch namely cross linked starch urea for its application in the formulation of sustained release floating tablets as rate controlling polymer. Cross linked starch urea was prepared and characterized by various physical properties and IR spectra. Sustained release floating tablets of three anti-hypertensive drugs namely Captopril, Losartan and Valsartan were formulated employing cross Linked starch Urea as rate controlling polymer and were evaluated. Cross linked starch urea prepared by gelatinizing potato starch in the presence of urea and calcium chloride was insoluble in water and aqueous fluids of acidic and alkaline pHs. Cross linked starch urea exhibited good swelling in water. The swelling index was 630. 2 %. As crosslinked starch urea is insoluble and has good swelling in water, it is considered suitable as release retarding and rate controlling matrix polymer for sustained release floating tablets. stained release tablets of (i) captopril, (ii) losartan and (iii) valsartan prepared using cross linked starch urea as matrix polymer were non disintegrating in water, acidic (pH 1. 2) and alkaline (pH 7. 4) fluids and gave slow and controlled release over longer periods of time. In each case the release rate depended on the strength or concentration of cross linked starch urea polymer in the tablets. A good linear relationship was observed between percent polymer in the matrix tablets and release rate (K 0) with all the three drugs indicating that the cross linked starch urea polymer is an efficient rate controlling polymer suitable for design of sustained release tablets. Drug release from these SR tablets was by diffusion mechanism, fickian diffusion in the case of tablets containing low percent of polymer and non fickian (anamalous) diffusion in the case of tablets containing high percent of polymer. Cross linked starch urea alone and in combination with sodium bicarbonate (gas generating agent) was found not suitable for formulation of floating tablets though it has good rate controlling effect for formulation of sustained release tablets. When cross linked starch urea was used along with bees wax (lipohilic polymer) and <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> (good film forming polymer) it was found suitable for formulation of floating tablets. Floating tablets formulated with cross linked starch urea (50 %) as matrix polymer, Bees wax (5 %) and <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> (5 %) as floating enhancers and sodium bicarbonate as gas generating agent exhibited good floating over 13 â€“ 14 hrs with a floating lag time of 45 â€“ 60 seconds. Drug release from these floating tablets was spread over 12 hrs with all the three drugs studied. The drug release from these tablets was by non fickian (anomalous) diffusion. Thus cross linked starch urea was found to be a good rate controlling polymer for sustained release tablets and along with bees wax and <b>starch</b> <b>acetate</b> it was also a good matrix polymer for floating tablets.

50|$|The flow {{of carbon}} for H. paucihalophilus {{is done with}} the {{oxidative}} tricarboxylic acid cycle, {{but it does not}} use the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle. It uses glutamic acid, histidine, norleucine, phenylalanine, D-glucuronic acid, aesculin, trehalose, dextrin, salicin, sucrose, fructose, xylose, glucose, galactose, glycerol, citrate, pyruvate, <b>acetate,</b> <b>starch,</b> lactate, mannitol, fumarate, and malate as sources of carbon. H. paucihalophilus is aerobic, so it uses oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. It is not capable using nitrate, sulfate, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, dimethyl sulfoxide, or trimethylamine N-oxide as an electron acceptor for growth in anaerobic conditions. In this species, lysine synthesis is done by the diaminopimelate pathway, the typical pathway for halophilic archaea. H. paucihalophillus sets itself apart by its biosynthesis of glycine by using a mixture of three biosynthetic pathways, which are the serine hydroxymethyltransferase pathway, the threonine aldolase pathways, and the reverse of the glycine cleavage system.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{a series of}} totally novel {{bio-nanocomposite}} films from cellulose laurate (CL) and <b>starch</b> nanocrystals <b>acetate</b> (SNA) were fabricated, and the properties of nanocomposite films were investigated in detail. SNA was obtained by modifying starch nanocrystals (SNs) produced by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of corn starch with acetic anhydride. The favorable dispersity of SNA in chloroform made it ready to convert into nanocomposite films with CL via casting/evaporation method. The transmittance, thermal behavior, mechanical properties, barrier properties and hydrophobicity of CL/SNA nanocomposite films were investigated with UV-vis spectrophotometer, simultaneous thermal analyzer (STA), universal tensile tester/dynamic thermomechanical analysis (DMA), water vapor permeation meter/oxygen permeability tester, and contact angle tester, respectively. The transmittance of nanocomposite films decreased {{with the increase of}} SNA content. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed that the introduction of SNA into CL matrix did not severely decrease the thermal behavior of CL/SNA nanocomposites. Moreover, non-linear and linear mechanical analysis reflected the enhancement of SNA. At lower contents of SNA (< 5. 0 wt%), the values of Youngâ€™s modulus, tensile strength and the elongation at break of nanocomposite films were comparable with those of neat CL. However, with the increase of SNA, the Youngâ€™s modulus and tensile strength were improved significantly and were accompanied by the decreased elongation at break. The water vapor permeability (WVP) and oxygen permeability (PO 2) of CL/SNA nanocomposite films were significantly improved by the addition of SNA...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{acarbose}} on hydrolysis of a pure starch meal {{was investigated in}} normal subjects and ileostomy patients by means of 13 CO 2 breath tests and blood glucose levels as parameters of absorption, and of H 2 breath tests, serum acetate levels, and ileal loss of carbohydrate as parameters of malabsorption. Additional information {{on the effect of}} acarbose on alpha-amylase activity was obtained by in vitro experiments. Acarbose (200 and 400 mg) significantly delayed <b>starch</b> absorption. Serum <b>acetate</b> was found to be a less sensitive marker of malabsorption than breath H 2 excretion. After intake of 50 g starch plus 400 mg acarbose, 23 - 71 % of the starch load was lost in the ileostomy effluent, for a large part as starch. This suggests that acarbose considerably inhibits alpha-amylase, and not only brush-border enzymes. In vitro experiments confirm that an inhibition of two thirds of alpha-amylase activity can be expected from pharmacologically used doses of acarbose. status: publishe...|$|R
