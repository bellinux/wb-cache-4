GSC's were initially based on the Strowger <b>step-by-step</b> <b>system</b> as adopted by the British Post Office for the United Kingdom telephone network. Subsequent developments permitted the use of Crossbar switches designated as TXK1 which offered enhancements such as 2nd attempt routing; a facility not available on Strowger systems. Each of the 639 charging areas was associated or coterminous with one of 230 Group Switching Centres which contained register-translators (Also referred to as GRACE - Group Routing And Charging Equipment) required for local subscribers to originate self dialled trunk calls. During the introduction of International Direct Dialling (IDD), initially referred to as International Subscriber Dialling (ISD) within the UK, Group Switching Centres were equipped with international call timers and international register-translators to route calls to the relevant international exchange for onward routing abroad.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 This thesis {{examines}} the transient and steady-state temperature {{performance of a}} rotary regenerative heat exchanger. In contrast to previous studies on this problem, fluid flow in the circumferential direction was considered. Appropriate modeling was included to measure the effect of carry-over on the differential equations describing mass and energy conservation. The energy equations describing transient temperature profiles in two spatial dimensions were derived from the general case. These energy equations were then non-dimensionalized for the case where both fluids were identical, producing the appropriate parameters for evaluating performance. A <b>step-by-step</b> <b>system</b> was obtained in explicit form for the fluid temperatures and in implicit form for the matrix temperature using upstream differencing methods. The errors for this numerical system were analyzed and {{a necessary condition for}} stability was obtained. Sample problems for balanced and symmetrical cases were solved and the effect of carry-over and matrix rotation speed on performance was discussed. A parameter representing the effects of carry-over was suggested. This thesis treats two conditions not considered previously. These are the effects of carry-over on regenerator performance and the solution of transient temperature profiles in both axial and circumferential directions. Carry-over effects were evaluated to be unimportant, however a more complete description of the temperature field suggests that previous results for unit effectiveness are in error by as much as 13 percent...|$|E

Through the examination, reflection and reaction to a perceived crisis in playwriting in the Australian theatre sector, the notion of Industrial Playwriting is arrived at: a practice whereby plays are designed and constructed, and where {{the process of writing}} becomes central to the efficient creation of new work and the improvement of the writer’s skill and knowledge base. Using a practice-led methodology and action research the study examines a system of play construction appropriate to and addressing the challenges of the contemporary Australian theatre sector. Specifically, using the action research methodology known as design-based research a conceptual framework was constructed to form the basis of the notion of Industrial Playwriting. From this two plays were constructed using a case study method and the process recorded and used to create a practical, <b>step-by-step</b> <b>system</b> of Industrial Playwriting. In the creative practice of manufacturing a single authored play, and then a group-devised play, Industrial Playwriting was tested and found to also offer a valid alternative approach to playwriting in the training of new and even emerging playwrights. Finally, it offered insight into how Industrial Playwriting could be used to greatly facilitate theatre companies’ ongoing need to have access to new writers and new Australian works, and how it might form the basis of a cost effective writer development model. This study of the methods of formalised writing as a means to confront some of the challenges of the Australian theatre sector, the practice of playwriting and the history associated with it, makes an original and important contribution to contemporary playwriting practice...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. The spring-mass-damper (SMD) model {{with a pair of}} internal biomechanical forces is the simplest model for a walking pedestrian to represent his/her mechanical properties, and thus can be used in human-structure-interaction analysis in the vertical direction. However, the values of SMD stiffness and damping, though very important, are typically taken as those measured from stationary people due to lack of a parameter identification methods for a walking pedestrian. This study adopts a <b>step-by-step</b> <b>system</b> identification approach known as particle filter to simultaneously identify the stiffness, damping coefficient, and coefficients of the SMD model's biomechanical forces by ground reaction force (GRF) records. After a brief introduction of the SMD model, the proposed identification approach is explained in detail, with a focus on the theory of particle filter and its integration with the SMD model. A numerical example is first provided to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach which is then applied to several experimental GRF records. Identification results demonstrate that natural frequency and the damping ratio of a walking pedestrian are not constant but have a dependence of mean value and distribution on pacing frequency. The mean value first-order coefficient of the biomechanical force, which is expressed by the Fourier series function, also has a linear relationship with pacing frequency. Higher order coefficients do not show a clear relationship with pacing frequency but follow a logarithmic normal distribution.

40|$|Systems {{biology is}} an {{emergent}} field {{that aims to}} understand biological systems at system-level. The increasing power of genome sequencing techniques and ranges of other molecular biology techniques is enabling the accumulation of in-depth knowledge of biological systems. This growing information, properly quantified, analysed and presented, will eventually allow {{the establishment of a}} system-based cartography of different cellular populations within the organism, and of their interactions at the tissue and organ levels. It will also allow the identification of specific markers of individual cell types. Systems biology approaches to discover diagnostic markers may have an important role in diabetes. There are presently no reliable ways to quantify beta cell mass (BCM) in vivo, which hampers the understanding of the pathogenesis and natural history of diabetes, and the development of novel therapies to preserve BCM. To solve this problem, novel and specific beta cell biomarkers must be identified to enable adequate in vivo imaging by methods such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The ideal biomarker should allow measurements by a minimally invasive technology enabling repeated examinations over time, should identify the early stages of decreased BCM, and should provide information on progression of beta cell loss and eventual responses to agents aiming to arrest or revert beta cell loss in diabetes.

More proficient students benefited more from seeing solutions rather than going through all of the steps. However, our previous study controlled for the number of problems done and since tutored problem solving takes significantly more time than other approaches, it suffered from a “time on task ” confound. We wanted to determine whether tutored problem solving was worth the extra time it took or if students would benefit from practice on more problems in the same amount of time.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the carrier-envelope offset (CEO) frequency dynamics of SESAM modelocked thin disk lasers (TDLs) pumped by kW-class highly transverse multimode pump diodes with a typical M 2 value of 200 - 300, and give guidelines for future frequency stabilization of multi- 100 -W oscillators. We demonstrate CEO frequency detection with > 30 dB signal-to-noise ratio with a resolution bandwidth of 100 kHz from a SESAM modelocked Yb:YAG TDL delivering 140 W average output power with 748 -fs pulses at 7 -MHz pulse repetition rate. We compare with a low-power CEO frequency stabilized Yb:CALGO TDL delivering 2. 1 W with 77 -fs pulses at 65 MHz. For both lasers, we perform a complete noise characterization, measure the relevant transfer functions (TFs) and compare them to theoretical models. The measured TFs are {{used to determine the}} propagation of the pump noise <b>step-by-step</b> through the <b>system</b> components. From the noise propagation analysis, we identify the relative intensity noise (RIN) of the pump diode as the main contribution to the CEO frequency noise. The resulting noise levels are not excessive and do not prevent CEO frequency stabilization. More importantly, the laser cavity dynamics are shown to play an essential role in the CEO frequency dynamics. The cavity TFs of the two lasers are very different which explains why at this point a tight CEO frequency lock can be obtained with the Yb:CALGO TDL but not with the Yb:YAG TDL. For CEO stabilization laser cavities should exhibit high damping of the relaxation oscillations by nonlinear intra-cavity elements, for example by operating a SESAM in the roll-over regime. Therefore the optimum SESAM operation point is a tradeoff between enough damping and avoiding multiple pulsing instabilities. Additional cavity components could be considered for supplementary damping independent of the SESAM operation point...|$|R
