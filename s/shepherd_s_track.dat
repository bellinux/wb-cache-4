He is notable for designing Boston's Public Garden; the Massachusetts Bicycle Club; and churches, homes, and monuments in greater Boston and elsewhere in New England. He was born in Watertown, Massachusetts, to Giles Meacham and Jane Meacham. He was graduated from Harvard College in 1853. After college {{he worked as a}} civil engineer for the Jersey City Water Works. By 1855 he returned to Boston and worked for {{an architect}}ure firm there. He practiced as an architect from 1857 through 1891, and in that time produced numerous designs. People associated with the office of G.F. Meacham included Henry Martyn Francis, George Pyne, and <b>Shepherd</b> <b>S.</b> Woodcock. Meacham married Mary Warren (d.1877) in 1859; they had two children who died very young.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} practical error control mechanism that allows multiple-errors and multiple-erasures correction for multitrack magnetic recording systems. The proposed mechanism is based on using a simple and fast hash function to locate erroneous tracks in magnetic tape and exploit the MDS property of array codes to correct these tracks as erasures. The mechanism enables MDS array codes with r parity symbols to correct <b>s</b> <b>tracks</b> in error and t erased <b>tracks</b> (<b>s</b> + t ≤ r) with negligible probability of undetected error. The proposed mechanism reduces the redundancy requirement,for a given degree of reliability, by almost 50 % from that needed by conventional systems. It also reduces the encoding and decoding complexity for multitrack magnetic recording channels. 1...|$|R
