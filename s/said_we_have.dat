500|$|The Anasazi ruins were {{constructed}} in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Location manager Mac Gordon later noted that, {{due to the}} presence of a rare [...] "spiny black horned toad" [...] in the area, he and his crew were forced to hire several biologists to locate any lizards in the area and move them elsewhere. In addition, Gordon had a difficult time persuading the park rangers to build and then blow up faux-ruins. He explained, [...] "we were on a state park property that was an off road park, with motorcycles and [...] flying all over the place, but they still blanched when I <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to build Indian ruins and then blow it up." [...] However, the cameo of The Smoking Man was filmed on a sound stage back at 20th Century Fox. Manners noted that Davis had [...] "a hell of a time" [...] trying to smoke his cigarettes through a hole in his neck, because the hole was fake. The scene featuring The Smoking Man being burnt up by the fire from a missile was done via computer animation. The missiles were created via CGI technology by animator Mat Beck. The helicopter, however, included real smoke bombs. A shot of William B. Davis was overlapped with fire, and eventually a skull to give the effect that The Smoking Man's flesh was burnt away. Paul Rabwin later called the scene a [...] "great sequence".|$|E

2500|$|The {{combination}} {{of sexuality and}} spirituality shown at Herrnhaag was not unknown in Christian history, but it caused increasing scandal both within and without the church, particularly embarrassing for Nicholas, [...] "who {{was trying to be}} recognized as a rightful theologian after joining the confession of Augsburg" [...] in 1748. Even Christel’s mother was concerned, realizing the events taking place at Herrnhaag and its nearby sister community of Marienborn were at the edge where metaphor and reality meet. Referring to a plowshare that can be raised and lowered, she later wrote to her son that [...] "I sometimes <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> already put the peg in the last hole. If we wanted to remain in the world, the Savior would have to make three or four holes further back and lower down." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, the Pillar of Fire Church was vocal in {{its support}} of the Ku Klux Klan, to an extent which was unique for a {{religious}} denomination. Alma White spoke and wrote prolifically of her and the Pillar of Fire Church's support for the Klan {{and many of the}} Klan's principles including anti-Catholicism, white supremacy, antisemitism, nativism, and [...] In 1943, shortly before her death, she and the Pillar of Fire Church significantly but not completely distanced themselves from the then discredited and nearly bankrupt Klan organization, while continuing to promote many of the Klan's intolerant principles. [...] In a 1920s sermon she republished in 1943 she <b>said</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> no connection with the Klan organization. [...] We endorse them in the principles for which they stand. [...] However there is no room in our hearts for racial prejudice.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the start}} of the series, the lack of a {{relationship}} with her father serves as motivation for Erica's actions. She {{is an example of the}} Nixon staple of the [...] "lost daddy's girl." [...] Eric abandons her and her mother before {{the start of}} the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. [...] "Susan added a lot of Erica's background," [...] Behr said. [...] "Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that he loves me and nobody is going to tell me differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to play this out." [...] In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.|$|E
2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
