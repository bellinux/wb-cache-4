The efforts of the International Technology Education Association (ITEA) to create <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>technological</b> literacy in 2000 and supporting standards for assessment and professional development in 2003 are discussed. The recommendations from the report Technically Speaking and the impact it had in defining how a technologically literate person is characterized are also presented.

The role of pre-engineering curricula in STEM education is examined, and the various curricula that are being used in technology education classrooms since the publication of the <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Technological</b> Literacy are also traced.

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of chemical feedstocks and subsequent processing into derivatives and materials, the U. S. chemical industry sets the current <b>standard</b> of excellence <b>for</b> <b>technological</b> competitiveness. This world-class leadership is attributed to the innovation and advancement of chemical engineering process technology. Whether this status is sustained {{over the next decade}} depends strongly on meeting increasingly demanding challenges stimulated by growing concerns about the safe production and use of chemicals without harmful impacts on the environment. To comply with stringent environmental regulations while remaining economically competitive, industry must exploit alternative benign starting materials and develop environmentally neutral industrial processes. Opportunities are described for development of environmentally compatible alternatives and substitutes for some of the most abundantly produced, potentially hazardous industrial chemicals now labeled as "high-priority toxic chemicals. " For several other uniquely important commodity chemicals where no economically competitive, environmentally satisfactory, nontoxic alternative starting material exists, we advocate the development of new dynamic processes for the on-demand generation of toxic chemicals. In this general concept, which obviates mass storage and transportation of chemicals, toxic raw materials are produced in real time, where possible, from less-hazardous starting materials and then chemically transformed immediately into the final product. As a selected example for semiconductor technology, recent progress is reviewed for the on-demand production of arsine in turnkey electrochemical generators. Innovation of on-demand chemical generators and alternative processes provide rich areas for environmentally responsive chemical engineering processing research and development for next-generation technology...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{education}} {{and many other}} fields are placing increased emphasis on problem solving. The <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Technological</b> Literacy (STL) state that “Problem solving is basic to technology ” (ITEA, 2000, p. 90). Jonassen (2000, p. 63) contends that “most psychologists and educators regard problem solving {{as the most important}} learning outcome for life. ” “Problem solving is a critical process skill that involves virtually all aspects of existence ” (Wu, Custer, & Dyrenfurth, 1996, p. 56). “Virtually everyone, in their everyday and professional lives, regularly solves problems ” (Jonassen, 2000, p. 63). All problems are not the same and must be approached differently than rote or component skills (Westberry, 2003).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Visualization in Technology Education (VisTE) is a standards-based {{initiative}} {{designed to}} promote the use of graphic visualization among grade 8 - 12 students to improve their higher order thinking, communication skills, and understanding of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics. By using simple and complex visualization tools, students can conduct research, analyze, solve problems, and communicate major topics identified in the new ITEA <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Technological</b> Literacy (STL) as well as topics aligned with national mathematics and science standards. Unfortunately, rigorously tested instructional materials to support such activities do not yet exist. Over three years, the project team will develop 12 discrete units. Units will encompass areas such as biotechnology, medical technology, communications, transportation, power & energy, and construction. While the curriculum is not developed for the post-secondary level, {{it is expected to}} have an impact on the students ' understanding of key technologies and their ability to apply graphic communication tools in the exploration and conveyance of technology and engineering concepts.

40|$|The {{technological}} literacy of students has recently {{become one of}} the primary goals of education in countries such as the USA, England, New Zealand, Australia, and so forth. However the question here is whether these educations – their long-term policy documents as well as the standards they provide in particular – address sufficient learning about the nature of technology. This seems to be an important concern that through taking advantage of the philosophy of technology (the arena which affords a bountiful ground of various reflections on the nature of technology) is intended to be discussed throughout this study. In the first place, the paper presents a relevant framework based upon Mitcham’s (1994) four-aspect account of technology, i. e., technology as objects, knowledge, activities, and volition. Then it categorizes the main relevant concepts and concerns put forward by many other philosophers of technology into this framework; this will yield a concrete model (tool) to analyze any intended standard such as the above mentioned ones. Afterwards, to show how this model works, the well-known case of the USA – <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Technological</b> Literacy (ITEA, 2007) – will be used as an example for inspection; the results will disclose the points where the current American case needs to be modifie...|$|E

A recent survey (Reeve, Nielson, 2 ̆ 6 amp; Meade, 2003) revealed that in Utah, a majority of teachers have a copy of the standards and are supportive of them, but they want help implementing standards-based technology education in their classrooms. Initially, a self-evaluation of the teacher education program was conducted that included input from students, local teachers, state and district leaders, and an external consultant with expertise in technology teacher education programs. University technology teacher education students could be change agents by bringing ideas into the classrooms of our local technology teachers, allowing them to experience more than just a quick workshop fix for incorporating the standards. With some teaching experience and a moderate understanding of standards-based curriculum, the university students are faced with a considerable challenge as they meet with the cooperating teachers and try to establish the attitude that the curricular unit should be standards-based rather than standards-reflective...|$|E
