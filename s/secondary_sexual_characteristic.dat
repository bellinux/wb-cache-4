25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of sexual dimorphism in heterodontosaurids has long centered on Abrictosaurus. Tusks are a sexually dimorphic trait in many modern mammals, including musk deer, walrus, Asian elephants and many pigs, with tusks being present primarily in males. The lack of tusks in UCL B54 led to suggestions {{that it was}} female; perhaps even a female of another species. The discovery of caniniforms in UCL A100 showed that A. consors also has this 'male' characteristic, suggesting that {{it is at least}} a valid species in its own right. However, UCL B54 may actually be a juvenile, based on its short face and unfused sacral (hip) vertebrae. Therefore, the lack of tusks could be a juvenile trait instead of a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic,</b> weakening the case for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
500|$|Another theory, {{the sexual}} {{selection}} hypothesis, proposes {{that the long}} necks evolved as a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic,</b> giving males an advantage in [...] "necking" [...] contests (see below) to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive females. In support of this theory, necks are longer and heavier for males than females of the same age, and the former do not employ other forms of combat. However, one objection is that it fails to explain why female giraffes also have long necks. It has also been proposed that the neck serves to give the animal greater vigilance.|$|E

2500|$|BDSM {{parties are}} events on which BDSM {{practitioners}} and other similarly interested people meet {{in order to}} communicate, share experiences and knowledge, and to [...] "play" [...] in an erotic atmosphere. The parties show similarities with ones in the dark culture, being based on {{a more or less}} strictly enforced dress code; most often clothing made of latex, leather or vinyl/PVC, lycra and so on., emphasizing the body's shape and the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic.</b> The requirement for such dress codes differ.

2500|$|Fur is dense hair. Primarily, [...] fur augments the {{insulation}} the skin provides {{but can also}} serve as a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> or as camouflage. On some animals, the skin is very hard and thick, and can be processed to create leather. Reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection, and birds have hard feathers, all made of tough β-keratins. Amphibian skin is not a strong barrier, especially regarding the passage of chemicals via skin and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces. For example, a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly, as the chemical diffuses through its skin. [...] Amphibian skin plays key roles in everyday survival and their ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions.|$|E

50|$|Pickerel frogs display sexual dimorphism; {{the females}} are {{typically}} larger and darker in color than the males.

50|$|Biologists {{characterize}} beards as a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{because they}} are unique to one sex, yet do not play a direct role in reproduction.

50|$|Terminal hair {{growth on}} arms is a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> in boys and {{appears in the}} last stages of puberty. Vellus arm hair is usually {{concentrated}} on the elbow end of the forearm and often ends on {{the lower part of}} the upper arm. This type of intense arm vellus hair growth sometimes occurs in young women and people of both sexes until puberty. Even though this causes the arms to appear hairy, it is not caused solely by testosterone. The hair is softer and different from men's arm hair, in texture.|$|E
50|$|A {{competing}} {{hypothesis is}} that, {{rather than being}} principally a feeding adaptation, the distinctive saddle shape and longer extremities {{might have been a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> of saddleback males. Male competition over mates is settled by dominance displays on the basis of vertical neck height rather than body size (see below). This correlates with the observation that saddleback males are more aggressive than domed males. The shell distortion and elongation of the limbs and neck in saddlebacks is probably an evolutionary compromise between the need for a small body size in dry conditions and a high vertical reach for dominance displays.|$|E
50|$|Kerengga ant-like jumpers {{are sexually}} dimorphic. Female jumpers, {{measuring}} about 6-7 mm, {{are the best}} mimics of the weaver ants while the males which usually measure about 9-12 mm in length {{give the appearance of}} a weaver ant carrying a minor worker due to their elongated chelicerae which may be as long as one-third to half their body length. These elongated chelicerae are a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the males. The males use their long fangs like swords to fight off rivals. They can split their jaws, normally held closed, to unfold their fangs when required.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that {{the evolution of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> persists until the relative costs of survival outweigh the benefits of reproductive success. At the level of genes, this means a trade-off between variation and expression of selected traits. Strong, persistent sexual selection should result in decreased genetic variation for these traits. However, higher levels of variation {{have been reported in}} sexually-selected traits compared to non-sexually selected traits. This phenomenon is especially clear in lek species, where males confer no immediate advantage to the female. Female choice presumably depends on correlating male displays (<b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics)</b> with overall genetic quality. If such directional sexual selection depletes variation in males, why would female choice continue to exist? Rowe and Houle answer this question (the lek paradox) using the notion of genetic capture, which couples the sexually-selected traits with the overall condition of the organism. They posit that the genes for <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> must be pleiotropically linked to condition, a measure of the organism’s fitness. In other words, the genetic variation in <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> is a maintained due to variation in the organism’s condition.|$|R

50|$|According to the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis, female mate {{choice is}} based {{on the extent to which}} male <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> are expressed, as these are thought to be {{indicative}} of a heritable resistance to pathogens. A meta-analysis reviewed studies exploring the magnitude of the relationship between expression of <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> and parasite intensity, as well as level of host immune functioning. Consistent with the hypothesis proposed by Hamilton and Zuk, the meta-analysis revealed that males with the fewest parasites and/or the strongest immune systems typically had the most extravagant <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> With regards to parasite-stress theory, these findings would be interpreted as those men who have encountered more parasites - or are naturally less capable of dealing with parasites - are also less desirable mates to women, due to a lower quality genetic quality for the potential offspring.|$|R
