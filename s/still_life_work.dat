Measuring 228.6 cm × 172.7 cm (90 in × 68 in), Still Life with Lemons represented a take on still life from the Cubist perspective, with Lichtenstein using many favorite Cubist motifs: [...] "...pitcher, bowl of fruit, and faux wood grain - {{with some of his}} own, such as sections of the primary colors red, yellow, and blue, portions of an entablature, and a pattern of diagonal stripes." [...] The work has an element of three-dimensionality due to its overlapping planes and reflection, although this still life series was meant to look flat. [...] According to Jack Cowart, [...] "...The scale of Lichtenstein's <b>still</b> <b>life</b> <b>work</b> is antithetical to the primarily intimate and more closely related nature of real Cubism." ...|$|E

5000|$|From {{her early}} {{photography}} of people she {{shifted to the}} still life photography for which she is now known. Her 1990's series, Venus Inferred, of couples were informed by representations, visual and other media, about love and how photography is used to convey our ideas about romantic relationships. Her photographs chip away at normative expectations as depicted in mainstream culture. From this supposed omnipotent third person point of view, her <b>still</b> <b>life</b> <b>work</b> availed {{a point of view}} that feels first person. Impetus for her investigation of the still life was its associations with femininity, the minor arts, and its imbrication within the home as the space of intimacy. Letinsky says that still lifes provides her with the potential to explore the false dichotomy between the personal and the political. Vital to this is the selection/orchestration of objects depicted in her images as well as her photograph's presence as object. Hence scale and surface is important to understanding these photographs. Rather than their being seen on a digital screen, she is invested in the experience of viewing her actual prints. She says that her work “is in part about the relationship between looking at something and other bodily experiences.” ...|$|E
40|$|Andrej Belocvetov first {{dedicated}} {{his efforts}} to chiaroscuro still life paintings and portraits, often using heavy, pasty brushstrokes. He let himself be inspired {{by the work of}} Frans Hals and Rembrant. He also paints urban landscapes and <b>still</b> <b>life</b> <b>work</b> in various impressionistic variations. A very important factor influencing the artistic expression of Andrej's life was his synesthesia - in his case it was a neural connection between music and colours, the so-called coloured hearing. For Andrej, the fifties were a period of surrealist tendencies on the one hand, and to Picasso-like Classicism and the new German Objectivity of George Grosz and Otto Dix. Andrej paints portraits of women and children and still life paintings. He is diagnosed with severe epilepsy. Belocetov's health problems culminate in the fifties and persist during the sixties. The author himself spoke about "Neosurrealism", and even though he was familiar with Surrealist methods and techniques, he never really felt bound by them. He created freely, guided only by his imagination. He also put a great emphasis on the graphic aspect of the painting. He participates in group exhibitions of the Máj 57 movement in 1957 and 1958 in Prague, in 1958 in Warsaw (where he is not personally present), and in 1964 in Prague.
