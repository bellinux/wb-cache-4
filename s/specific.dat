Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike <b>specific</b> performance, which requires them to do something).

Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy–momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.|$|E
