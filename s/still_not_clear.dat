The {{reason for this is}} <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear,</b> but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> whether {{magnetic}} resonance venography, venous angiography, or Doppler sonography {{should be considered}} {{the gold standard for}} the diagnosis of CCSVI. Use of {{magnetic resonance}} venography for the diagnosis of CCSVI in MS patients has been proposed by some to have limited value, and should be used only in combination with other techniques. Others have stated that magnetic resonance venography is a valid measure which has advantages over Doppler including the fact that results are more operator-independent.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> to {{the control}} room staff that the primary loop water levels were low and that {{over half of the}} core was exposed. A group of workers took manual {{readings}} from the thermocouples and obtained a sample of primary loop water. Seven hours into the emergency, new water was pumped into the primary loop and the backup relief valve was opened to reduce pressure so that the loop could be filled with water. After 16hours the primary loop pumps were turned on once again, and the core temperature began to fall. A large part of the core had melted, and the system was still dangerously radioactive.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of physical changes is <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear.</b> Near {{the summer and}} winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere. The bright collar at −45° latitude is also connected with methane clouds. Other changes in the southern polar region {{can be explained by}} changes in the lower cloud layers. The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by a changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.|$|E

The Qur'an equates the murder of one innocent person {{with the murder of}} the whole of humanity.

25|$|Post-Caudal: While {{alligators}} and caimans have DPRs only {{on their}} jaws, crocodiles have similar organs on almost every scale on their bodies. The function of the DPRs on the jaws is clear; to catch prey, but it is <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> what the function is of the organs {{on the rest of}} the body. The receptors flatten when exposed to increased osmotic pressure, such as that experienced when swimming in sea water hyperosmotic to the body fluids. When contact between the integument and the surrounding sea water solution is blocked, crocodiles are found to lose their ability to discriminate salinities. It has been proposed that the flattening of the sensory organ in hyperosmotic sea water is sensed by the animal as “touch”, but interpreted as chemical information about its surroundings. This might be why in alligators they are absent {{on the rest of the}} body.|$|E
500|$|As with Yu Zijun's {{wall in the}} Ordos, the Mongols {{shifted their}} attacks away from the newly {{strengthened}} Xuan–Da sector to less well-protected areas. In the west, Shaanxi province became the target of nomads riding west from the Yellow River loop. The westernmost fortress of Ming China, the Jiayu Pass, saw substantial enhancement with walls starting in 1539, and from there border walls were built discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor to Wuwei, where the low earthen wall split into two. The northern section passed through Zhongwei and Yinchuan, where it met {{the western edge of}} the Yellow River loop before connecting with the Ordos walls, while the southern section passed through Lanzhou and continued northeast to Dingbian.

500|$|Kruger {{was largely}} {{happy with the}} terms under which the {{republic}} would regain its sovereignty, but two points offended him.

The commission, in which De Villiers emerged as the dominant figure, defined it primarily as British purview over the Transvaal's external affairs.

Kruger was absent due to his illness, but he did attend the official retrocession five days later in Church Square.

Unsure whether the main attack was on Wola or the forts around Królikarnia, he did not {{reassign}} any sizable infantry force to the western front, {{despite the fact that}} the southern line was safely in Polish hands and repeated Russian attacks there were being repelled one by one. Out of 3,000 casualties suffered by the Polish side on the first day only approximately 300 were in the southern sector near Królikarnia, including at most [...] "several dozen killed". Yet only a small detachment of horse artillery was dispatched to the second line near Wola. In the evening General Krukowiecki called a meeting of the government and described the situation of his forces as extremely difficult. He suggested that talks with Paskevich be resumed and sent General Prądzyński to Paskevich's camp.|$|E
