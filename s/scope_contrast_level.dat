This study aimed to evaluate whether these delays {{are present in the}} early stage of PD and whether they are dopamine-sensitive. The results show that both PERG P 50 and VEP P 100 latencies are increased (p < 0. 0001) in a group of patients with de novo PD (13 subjects; 13. 3 +/- 5. 6 months' mean disease duration) before therapy in comparison with an age-matched control group (eight subjects). A larger latency increase (9. 9 % at the 47 % <b>contrast</b> <b>level</b> and 7. 8 % at the 96 % <b>contrast</b> <b>level)</b> was present in PERG recordings than in VEPs (6. 2 % at the 47 % <b>contrast</b> <b>level</b> and 3. 9 % at the 96 % <b>contrast</b> <b>level).</b> Levodopa therapy produced recovery of both PERG and VEP latency increases at both <b>contrast</b> <b>levels,</b> but only the PERG recovery at 47 % of contrast was statistically significant. Before therapy, five eyes from PD patients showed no reproducible PERG at the 47 % <b>contrast</b> <b>level</b> although the simultaneously recorded VEP was present. Both potentials were recordable in the same eyes at the 96 % <b>contrast</b> <b>level.</b> During therapy, four of those five eyes showed a clear PERG even at the 47 % <b>contrast</b> <b>level.</b> We conclude that, using an adequate midspatial frequency, both VEPs and PERGs are delayed even in the early stage of PD, and that PERGs are more sensitive if low contrast (47 %) is used. The larger alterations, as well as the larger recovery during levodopa therapy, seem to correlate the PERG response more than the VEP response to dopaminergic transmission...|$|R

40|$|Background: Previously, {{contrast}} visual acuities (VA) {{have been}} evaluated as a potential screening, diagnostic and predictive tool in cases where standard visual acuity remains intact. Issues around contrast acuity sometimes {{make it difficult for}} clinicians to make appropriate clinical decisions and thus such tests have to be standardised and reliable. Aim: To investigate test–retest reliability of contrast VA in healthy adults in a clinical setting. Methods: Best compensated contrast VA at 100 %, 10 %, 5 % and 2. 5 % of 155 patients (mean age 39. 7 ± 12. 2 years) were measured using the computerised Thomson Test Chart 2000 Expert. For all participants and at each <b>contrast</b> <b>level,</b> two measurements per right eye were determined. Test–retest reliability for the four <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> were assessed using reliability coefficients and Bland–Altman plots. Participants were also divided into three age groups of young (18 – 39 years, n = 72), middle-age (40 – 49 years, n = 45) and elderly (50 – 67 years, n = 38) and reliability was assessed within and between age and gender groups. Results: For the whole-sample test and retest, measurements within each <b>contrast</b> <b>level</b> were not statistically different (p ≥ 0. 05). Thus, test and retest measurements per participant were averaged and whole-sample mean-contrast VA and standard deviations for 100 %, 10 %, 5 % and 2. 5 % were - 0. 146 ± 0. 060, 0. 050 ± 0. 071, 0. 135 ± 0. 079 and 0. 405 ± 0. 115 logMAR, respectively. Significant differences were found between all pairs of <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> compared (p ≤ 0. 0125). Mean-contrast VA within each age group were also significantly different across all <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> (p 0. 05) but were statistically different between the young and elderly groups (p < 0. 01). Only mean-contrast VA 10 % was significantly different between the middle-age and elderly groups (p < 0. 001). Also, mean-contrast VA for the four <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> within gender were significantly different (p ≤ 0. 05) but not between genders (p ≥ 0. 05).

40|$|D. Phil. (Optometry) The {{measurement}} of Contrast Visual Acuities (contrast VA) is recognised in various studies {{as an important}} psychophysical measure of visual function, and contrast VA {{is often used to}} understand visual limitations or functional disability. Contrast VA is also useful for monitoring the effects of disease modifying therapies. High and medium <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> are generally used in studies to evaluate contact lens performance, the outcomes of surgical procedures and for assessing activities of daily living. Measurement of stimuli with low <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> are also sometimes applied in diagnosing, monitoring and evaluating disease processes and their management, especially where high contrast visual acuity remains intact. This {{is believed to be the}} first study that comprehensively investigates the reliability (or repeatability) of four <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> using the computerized Thomson Test Chart 2000 XPert. (A similar study with four <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> and both univariate and multivariate analysis as applied in this thesis has not been performed elsewhere). Although the main emphasis of this study was to explore various issues relating to short-term repeatability of contrast VA, both within and across individuals, both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were also used in this thesis to investigate age and gender related changes in measurements of contrast VA. Together the results from this thesis provide test and re-test contrast VA reliability measures and some basic or preliminary statistical normative contrast VA values, which should aid clinicians to confidently detect abnormal measurements which, in turn, promotes good clinical practice. For this thesis and within a clinical environment to investigate inter-subject variation in contrast VA, two measurements of contrast VA at four specified <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> (100 %, 10 %, 5 % and 2. 5 %) at a 6 metre distance were obtained for the right eyes only of 155 healthy participants. Thus, at each <b>contrast</b> <b>level</b> 155 test and re-test contrast VA measurements were determined using the computerized Thomson Test Chart 2000 XPert. All measurements were determined through the optimal refractive compensation for each right eye of the 155 participants concerned. In a subset of ten subjects or participants, samples of thirty consecutive measurements of contrast VA at each of the four <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> were also obtained to explore short-term intra-subject variation in contrast VA. A simple questionnaire was administered to all subjects to obtain biographical, general and ocular health histories.

In {{the context}} of direct imaging of exoplanets, coronagraphs are {{commonly}} proposed to reach the required very high <b>contrast</b> <b>levels.</b> However, wavefront aberrations induce speckles in their focal plane and limit their performance. Aims. An active correction of these wavefront aberrations using a deformable mirror upstream of the coronagraph is mandatory. These aberrations need to be calibrated and focal-plane wavefront-sensing techniques in the science channel are being developed. One of these, the self-coherent camera, of which we present the latest laboratory results. Methods. We present here an enhancement of the method: we directly minimized the complex amplitude of the speckle field in the focal plane. Laboratory tests using a four-quadrant phase-mask coronagraph and a 32 x 32 actuator deformable mirror were conducted in monochromatic light and in polychromatic light for different bandwidths. Results. We obtain <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> in the focal plane in monochromatic light better than 3. 10 ^- 8 (RMS) in the 5 - 12 λ/D region for a correction of both phase and amplitude aberrations.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} human contrast perception at various <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> ranging from detection threshold to suprathreshold levels by using psychophysical techniques. The work consists of two major parts. The first part deals with contrast matching, {{and the second part}} deals with contrast discrimination. Contrast matching technique was used to determine when the perceived contrasts of different stimuli were equal. The effects of spatial frequency, stimulus area, image complexity and chromatic contrast on contrast detection thresholds and matches were studied. These factors influenced detection thresholds and perceived contrast at low <b>contrast</b> <b>levels.</b> However, at suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> perceived <b>contrast</b> became directly proportional to the physical contrast of the stimulus and almost independent of factors affecting detection thresholds. Contrast discrimination was studied by measuring contrast increment thresholds which indicate the smallest detectable contrast difference. The effects of stimulus area, external spatial image noise and retinal illuminance were studied. The above factors affected contrast detection thresholds and increment thresholds measured at low <b>contrast</b> <b>levels.</b> At high <b>contrast</b> <b>levels,</b> <b>contrast</b> increment thresholds became very similar so that the effect of these factors decreased. Human contrast perception was modelled by regarding the visual system as a simple image processing system. A visual signal is first low-pass filtered by the ocular optics. This is followed by spatial high-pass filtering by the neural visual pathways, and addition of internal neural noise. Detection is mediated by a local matched filter which is a weighted replica of the stimulus whose sampling efficiency decreases with increasing stimulus area and complexity. According to the model, the signals to be compared in a contrast matching task are first transferred through the early image processing stages mentioned above. Then they are filtered by a restoring transfer function which compensates for the low-level filtering and limited spatial integration at high <b>contrast</b> <b>levels.</b> Perceived <b>contrasts</b> of the stimuli are equal when the restored responses to the stimuli are equal. According to the model, the signals to be discriminated in a contrast discrimination task first go through the early image processing stages, after which signal dependent noise is added to the matched filter responses. The decision made by the human brain is based on the comparison between the responses of the matched filters to the stimuli, and the accuracy of the decision is limited by pre- and post-filter noises. The model for human contrast perception could accurately describe the results of contrast matching and discrimination in various conditions...|$|R

The study was conducted in two phases. In the first, three experienced observers determined the visibility of sessile polyps (6 mm) at five <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> (300, 490, 790, and 1, 040 HU and air) and five tube charge levels (10, 14, 20, 28, and 40 mAs) in an anthropomorphic phantom. Each polyp was present in one of eight possible locations. The mean tube charge threshold for 90 % correct responses was determined for each <b>contrast</b> <b>level.</b> Blinded observers performed independent 2 D readings. In the second phase of the study, three 150 -cm virtual colons were evaluated at two <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> (300 and 480 HU) and at five tube charge levels between 20 and 80 mAs. The three colons contained 18 randomly located polyps. The mean tube charge threshold for 90 % sensitivity was determined for each <b>contrast</b> <b>level.</b> RESULTS. In the first phase of the study, the estimated tube charge thresholds for 300, 480, and 790 HU were 24. 0, 16. 3, and 6. 2 mAs.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 A well-defined, {{quantitative}} {{model for}} determining soil contrast {{was developed to}} improve soil survey interpretations concerning the effects of mixtures {{of different kinds of}} soils on agricultural land use. The model was evaluated by determining the levels and reasons for soil contrast on mapped soil areas representing 5 different landscapes, each dominated by a different soil order. Several preliminary models are discussed. The final model is based on twelve soil properties including slope, drainage, depth of rooting, texture and pH. For each property, the range of possible values was divided into a small number of classes. By comparing classes, five <b>levels</b> of <b>contrast</b> (Very Similar, Similar, Somewhat Contrasting, Contrasting, Very Contrasting) were established within each property. These same five terms, plus an additional Exceedingly Contrasting class, were used to characterize the overall degree of contrast between any two soils. Overall contrast was determined by first comparing the property values of a pair of soils and determining the degree of contrast for each property. Then the overall contrast was set equal to either the <b>contrast</b> <b>level</b> for the most contrasting property or properties, or to the next higher <b>contrast</b> <b>level</b> if several properties varied between the two soils. Distributions of <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> within soil landscapes show that areas of Inceptisols, Ultisols, Alfisols and Mollisols are characterized by a high percentage of similar soils. The Aridisol landscape sampled had the highest percentage of exceedingly contrasting soils. The Alfisols and Mollisols sampled have the highest percentage of somewhat contrasting and very contrasting soils, respectively. Reasons for soil contrast were determined both by identifying those few properties that actually dictated the <b>contrast</b> <b>level</b> and by calculating a weighted average contribution of each of the 12 soil properties. In general, lower <b>levels</b> of <b>contrast</b> were controlled by one or two properties. At higher <b>levels</b> of <b>contrast,</b> more properties varied, and no property had as dominant an effect. Slope was the major factor controlling the contrast of similar soils. Drainage, pH, texture, and depth of rooting differences, all of which reflected differences in parent materials, were most often expressed at somewhat <b>contrasting</b> or <b>contrasting</b> <b>levels.</b> The most common reason for very contrasting soils was flooding, and that occurred where an alluvial soil was adjacent to an upland soil...|$|R

White, pure red, pure green and pure blue upper-case Bailey Lovie letters with a contrast between 3 : 1 and 300 : 1 were displayed on an LCD to 20 participants. The threshold identification size was equivalent for all colours except for blue, which had larger threshold identification size than white, red and green at all character luminance levels tested. The threshold identification size initially decreased as character luminance increased, but asymptoted to a minimum size after which further increases in character luminance yielded no additional significant reduction in the threshold identification size. The threshold identification size was relatively insensitive to contrast provided the <b>contrast</b> <b>level</b> was above 6 : 1. Self-report preferred character luminance levels were generally higher than the character luminance levels necessary to achieve minimum threshold identification size.

After a delay of 1000 ms a probe object was presented and the monkeys had to decide whether the probe matched the sample by releasing a lever. The objects were natural images of the size 10 f x 10 f. The sample stimuli had <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> between 5 and 100, while the probe objects were always at 100 contrast. The monkeys' performance was almost at ceiling for <b>contrast</b> <b>levels</b> higher than 25 and at chance for low <b>contrast</b> <b>levels.</b> We compared the delay period to the xation period by assessing power in the theta band of the LFP during the last 800 ms of the delay and the xation respectively. Compared to the xation period we observed increased theta oscillations for high contrast stimuli at many recording sites during the delay. Almost all sites showed reduced theta oscillations at 5 <b>contrast</b> <b>level,</b> when the monkeys were performing at chance. Unlike in prefrontal cortex there was no elevated neuronal activity during the delay period. SUA during the delay was similar to values during the xation. But examining at the relationship between theta phase and SUA, we found that many neurons red preferentially at a particular phase of the theta cycle. These ndings suggest that theta oscillations increase during the delay period in visual cortex, and that these oscillations serve to structure neuronal activity...|$|R
