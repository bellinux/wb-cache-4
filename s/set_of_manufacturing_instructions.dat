40|$|Design ” {{can be a}} noun, or a verb. Six paths for {{research}} into engineering design (as verb) are identified, they must be coordinated for internal consistency and plausibility. Design research tries to clarify design processes and their underlying theoriesfor designing in general, and for particular forms, e. g., design engineering. Theories are a basis for deriving theory-based design methods. Both are useful for education. Design engineering and artistic forms of designing, industrial design, have much in common, but also differences. For an attractive and user-friendly product, its form (observable shape) is importanta task for industrial designers, architects, etc [...] “Conceptualizing ” consists of preliminary sketches, a direct entry to hardwareindustrial designers work “outside inwards”. For a product that should work and fulfill a purpose and perform a transformation process, its functioning and operation are importanta task for engineering designers. Anticipating and analyzing a capability for operation is a role of the engineering sciences. The outcome of design engineering is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>instructions,</b> and analytical verification of anticipated performance. Engineering designers tend to be primary for TS (technical system), and their operational and manufacturing processesThey work “inside outwards”. Design engineering is more constrained than industrial design, but in contrast has available a theory of TS and its associated engineering design science, with several abstract models and representations of structures. Hubka’s theory, and consequently design methodology, includes consideration of tasks of a TS(s), typical life cycle, duty cycle, classes of propertie...|$|E

40|$|In {{the modern}} <b>manufacturing</b> environment, {{alternative}} <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> operations can normally be generated for machining one feature of a part. Each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> operations {{results in a}} specific manufacturing cost {{in terms of the}} allocated tolerances, and requires a specific <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> resources, such as machines, fixtures/jigs and cutting tools. In this paper, the problems of allocating tolerances to the manufacturing operations and selecting exactly one representative from the alternative <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> operations for machining one feature of the part are formulated. The purpose is to minimize, for all the features to be machined, the sum of the costs <b>of</b> the selected <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> operations and the dissimilarities in their manufacturing resource requirements. The techniques of the genetic algorithm and the Hopfield neural network are adopted as possible approaches to solve these problems. The genetic algorithm is utilized to generate the optimal tolerance for each <b>of</b> the <b>manufacturing</b> operations, and the Hopfield neural network is adopted to solve the manufacturing operations selection problem. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches. Indeed, the proposed approaches show the potential of working towards the optimal solutions to the tolerance allocation problem and the manufacturing operations selection problem in process planning. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|International audienceIn {{machining}} workshops, workpieces {{are produced}} according to dimensions known as manufacturing dimensions. For the same workpiece {{and the same}} <b>manufacturing</b> plan, several <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> dimensions can be used but none satisfy simultaneously the two main missions workshops need to fulfil: (a) Ensuring conformity of products to their design dimension tolerances (also called blueprint tolerances) and (b) steering machines in order to compensate for tool wear. The <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> dimensions obtained from the design dimensions using the minimal chain of dimensions method is optimal for a conformity check of workpieces but is practically unusable for steering machines because {{of the complexity of}} its relationships toward the tool correctors and tools dimensions. The pilot dimensions method consists in, on the one hand, identifying and representing these tool correctors and these tool/program dimensions on the production drawings (besides the manufacturing dimensions) and, on other the other hand, determining their correction values through a mathematical <b>set</b> <b>of</b> relations after having measured the manufacturing dimensions on a workpiece. Doing so will strongly reduce adjustment time, reduce the number of workpieces used for adjustments and greatly enhance the quality of workpiece batches...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Manufacturing process {{planning}} {{is the process}} of se-lecting and sequencing manufacturing processes such that they achieve one or more goals and satisfy a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> domain constraints. <b>Manufacturing</b> scheduling {{is the process of}} selecting a process plan and assigning manufacturing resources for specific time periods to the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> processes in the plan. It is, in fact, an op-timization process by which limited manufacturing resources are allocated over time among parallel and sequential activities. Manu-facturing {{process planning}} and scheduling are usually considered to be two separate and distinct phases. Traditional optimization approaches to these problems do not consider the constraints of both domains simultaneously and result in suboptimal solutions. Without considering real-time machine workloads and shop floor dynamics, process plans may become suboptimal or even invalid at the time of execution. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} the integra-tion <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process-planning and scheduling systems for generating more realistic and effective plans. After describing the complexity <b>of</b> the <b>manufacturing</b> process-planning and scheduling problems, this paper reviews the research literature on manufac-turing process planning, scheduling as well as their integration, particularly on agent-based approaches to these difficult problems. Major issues in these research areas are discussed, and research opportunities and challenges are identified.

5000|$|The American system <b>of</b> watch <b>manufacturing</b> is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> {{techniques}} and best-practices {{to be used}} in the manufacture of watches and timepieces. It is derived from the American system <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> techniques (also called [...] "armory practices"), a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> general {{techniques and}} guidelines for manufacturing that was developed in the 19th century. The system calls for using interchangeable parts, which is made possible by a strict system of organization, the extensive use of the machine shop, and quality control systems utilizing gauges to ensure precise and uniform dimensions. It was developed by Aaron Lufkin Dennison, a watch repairman who was inspired by the <b>manufacturing</b> techniques <b>of</b> the United States Armory at Springfield, Massachusetts, which manufactured identical parts, allowing rapid assembly of the final products.
