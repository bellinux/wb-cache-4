They are used primarily for control of technological processes, but the exception is neither the utilization in transport.

40|$|Throughout the {{industrial}} process control industry Safety Instrumented Systems are becoming high profile. Most companies have accepted that the performance-based standards such as ANSI/ISA 84. 01, IEC 61508 and IEC 61511 {{are here to}} stay and that conformance is not optional. A growing number of instrumentation manufacturers have recognized the steadily increasing interest that this market has shown in bringing their plants into conformance with the standards. They have responded by introducing a wide range of products that are “suitable for use ” in Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS). These products include sensors, transmitters, valves and valve positioners and a wide range of logic solvers. Most users have little concern about being able to select a proper sensor, transmitter or valve positioner {{but when it comes to}} choosing from the vast array of logic solvers, they often do not know how to make a proper decision. The problem is clear when you consider the range of choices for Logic Solvers that range from the relatively simple alarm trip architectures up through the wide variety of <b>safety</b> <b>PLCs</b> offered by about twenty different manufacturers. These PLC architectures cover the scale from simple one-out-of-one (1 oo 1) architectures up through triple and quadruple redundant systems with differing degrees of self-diagnostics. With all of these choices, how is a control engineer supposed to pick the “best ” system for his project and / or plant standard? If he errors on the side of conservatism, he may cost his company tens of thousands of wasted dollars by selecting a more sophisticated system than is warranted by the application. And, even worse, a simplistic system may not be in conformance with the standards and could place human life at unnecessary risk.

40|$|The past 50 {{years have}} seen a {{staggering}} amount {{of change in the}} technology and the business of process automation. The programmable logic controller (PLC) based control and monitoring system is a proven technology used to not only control processes but also to perform safety functions for processes in many industrial applications. There are many opportunities for improvements in any process or manufacturing system. One of the opportunities is achieving accurate safety function for measurement and process control to prevent human injury or death. The programmable electronic systems (PES) such as PLC systems are increasingly being used to perform safety functions {{as an integral part of}} the process or plant control system. A Robotic Manufacturing Cell is an example of a PES system and is used as an experimental setup for this work. The IEC 61508 standard defines various phases involved in the overall safety lifecycle for the PES system. This thesis study concentrates on such phases that include safety analysis methods, selection of an appropriate safety control system, implementation of safety as per the standard and safety validation. In this study four test cases are selected to perform safety analysis and implementation. It is verified how the conventional safety analysis method (FMEA) can be used to estimate the risk associated with each test case. As recommended by IEC 61508, a Risk-Graph method is used to calculate the Safety Integrity Level (SIL) requirement for each test case. A number of factors are required to be considered for selecting the appropriate safety control system architecture. After studying these factors and the safety analysis results, the Siemens safety PLC-based control system with SIL 3 configuration is selected for this application. IEC 61508 also recommends implementation of independent control systems for normal operation and safety. This study demonstrates how two independent PLC based control systems, one for normal operations and other for safety-related functions, are implemented to offer the most effective solution for this application. This is achieved by using PLCs from two different manufacturers, a non-safety PLC for normal operations and a Siemens <b>safety</b> <b>PLC</b> for safety-related functions.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} project supported by the INFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare) it is SPES (Selective Production of Exotic Species), which aims to develop a facility for the production of RIBs (Radioactive Ion Beams) and radioisotopes for nuclear medicine applications. The LNL (Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro) was chosen as the site for the construction and operation of SPES. This kind of facility brings many technology challenges, which require research and development on the mechanical, structural and material fields, {{as well as on the}} control systems for the coordinated deployment of the accelerator facilities. For the past five years, an off-line laboratory has been in operation at the LNL. This laboratory serves as a research and development test bench for engineers of different fields. New devices and techniques developed on this laboratory will be later be implemented on the final SPES facility. For the SPES project, EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) was chosen as the standard framework for the control systems. The general architecture is a series of distributed IOCs (Input Output Controllers) for controlling all the accelerator instrumentations, using a custom communication protocol knows as Channel Access (CA). For critical application from the safety point of view, it was chosen to use PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers), instead of native EPICS controllers. These applications comprises mainly interlock systems for both Machine Protections Systems (MPS) and Personnel Protection Systems (PPS). Furthermore, for PPS certificated <b>safety</b> <b>PLCs</b> must be used. Although PLCs will directly control these systems, an interface to EPICS must be available for sharing process values with the rest of the facility control systems. The arrival of the SPES project to the LNL has also demanded a review and upgrade of many of the control systems present in the laboratories, in particularly those that are going to be directly interconnected to SPES, as it is the case of the ALPI superconductive LINAC (Linear Accelerator) control system. These upgrades will allowed an interconnection and interoperability of all the systems using the EPICS CA transport layer. This imply to develop and implement EPICS IOCs, not only for controlling the SPES instrumentation, but also for all the instrumentation present on the LNL accelerator complex. Consequently, a standardization of the hardware and software used to develop all these control systems is fundamental. In this context, it is evident the need of custom I/O controllers that embed different functionalities to cope with the needs of many subsystems, e. g. tape system, charge breeder, target and ion source, etc. This need has driven the development of a standard hardware platform for the embedding of the EPICS IOC of all the future control systems. This will help to considerably reduce costs and maintenance efforts. For the off-line laboratory, a low-cost embedded IOC was designed using the computer board Raspberry Pi (Model B, rev. 2). In order to provide data acquisition capabilities to this board, tailored expansion boards where developed at LNL. They are connected to the GPIO port of the Raspberry PI and interface drivers for EPICS were implemented. Diverse kinds of boards have been developed for specify applications. Four of these IOC were implemented on the off-line laboratory for: the beam diagnostic data acquisition system, the mass separator control system, the vacuum measurement data acquisition system and the PLC to EPICS interface. The performance results demonstrate that this IOC is capable of manage this instrumentation under the conditions requested by the operators. While a low-cost solution is completely valid for the off-line laboratory, SPES and the LNL accelerators require a more robust and standard solution, which can operated under industrial environments and constructed with hardware components that can be available on the marked for the major part of the life cycle of the accelerators. In this sense, a second version of EPICS IOCs were developed using as hardware platform the COM (Computer on Modules) form factor. The peripheral devices needed for developing all the foreseen control systems to be used at LNL will be connected to the COM, such as ADCs, DACs, stepper motors controllers, etc. They will be installed on a custom Carrier Board along with the COM. This new IOC is intended as a basic construction block for all the control systems at LNL. In the next years, all the new control systems will target this hardware device. Currently at LNL, prototypes of this new EPICS IOC have been developed using an ADLINK Type 6 COM Express module on a generic carrier board along with commercial ADCs and DACs PCI Express boards. They have been install on different application at LNL. The performance test results show that these IOCs are more than capable of manage the accelerator instrumentations as required. The CPU units have more than enough computing power required by the control system algorithms, while consuming low power. For the application based on PLCs, one of the first system to be upgrade at the LNL accelerator complex, in order to be compatible with SPES, was the personnel access control system. The principal motivations were its obsolescence and the need of its interconnection to EPICS. This is a new fail-tolerant system, based on a redundant CPU PLC, in conjunction with remote IO islands, connected on a redundant optic fiber communication ring. For this new system, it was implemented an EPICS interface, in order to access all the status of the system for sharing it with the rest of the control systems. ...|$|R
40|$|The area of {{nanotechnology}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} active fields in science today. It is often seen as the area that could lead to substantial progress in terms of finding new materials with new properties. In this respect, silicon nano-particles are found to be greatly attractive because of their significant technological implications. Considering different areas of research, the energy production, conversion and storage processes are definitely among the most important topics to be studied by science. The reason for that lies in the significant and immediate consequences of their related technology on the current society. Silicon has received a great interest in the energy storage field and is, in fact, considered as one the most promising chemical element for energy storage in modern electrochemical devices due to the fact that it can alloy with lithium. In this respect, energy storage based on lithium chemistry {{is one of the}} most advanced electrochemical system in terms of specific power and energy density. Accordingly, Li-ion batteries could be significantly improved in terms of volumetric and gravimetric energy density by using silicon as a negative electrode material. The aim of the present thesis is to find a complete pathway for the silicon nano-particles, from their synthesis to their final designed application: a negative electrode for Li-ion batteries. Since no conventional methods to produce silicon nano-particles have been already established, several synthesis routes have been explored: Electrochemical Etching, Spark Discharge Generation and Laser assisted Chemical Vapor Pyrolisys, respectively. In Chapter 2, the anodic dissolution of a p-type silicon wafer in a HF solution is discussed. Despite the fact that the reaction mechanism is rather complicated and involves many different physical parameters, electrochemical etching offers a simple way to produce porous silicon layers, which can be detached and fragmented into small nano-particles by means of sonication. A basic electrochemical cell is developed for this purpose, and the anodic dissolution of a p?doped silicon wafer was performed in a concentrated HF solution. A linear relation between the electrode mass loss and the current density used during the electrochemical etching confirms the reaction mechanism, where two electrons per atom of silicon etched are involved. More- over, with the current experimental conditions, a current density threshold is found. Below this current threshold, which corresponds to 20 mA/cm 2, porous silicon is no longer formed. Although the nano-particles production rate provided by the electrochemical etching is definitely not sufficient for batteries application, the morphological and optical properties of both the surface substrate and the nano-particles are considered very interesting for the application in optoelectronic devices. Strong ultra-violet luminescence is observed at room temperature for the resulting nano-particles suspended in ethanol. The position of the photoluminescence peak is found to be independent from the excitation wavelength, as it is determined by the interaction between the surface states and the selected solvent. Its position is evaluated by means of the quantum confinement effect, which is responsible for the energy gap widening between valence and conduction band. From the quantum confinement theory, the estimated size of the nano-particles is approximately 1. 2 nm. In Chapter 3 Spark discharge generation (SDG) of silicon nano-particles is discussed. The production rate of silicon nano-particles from intrinsic silicon electrodes by spark discharge is orders of magnitude smaller compared to metals, since less energy goes into a larger area at a lower rate. Replacing intrinsic silicon by boron-doped rods results in a considerable increase in the production rate, namely two orders of magnitude. Generally speaking, it can be concluded that particles can be generated from any semiconductor using spark discharge, as long as the resistance is kept sufficiently low by either n- or p-doping, heating the electrodes, or changing their shape to reduce the current path-length. Transmission electron micrographs revealed a rather narrow size distribution, comparable to SDG-prepared metal particles. By taking stringent measures to reduce the ingress of oxygen and water into the setup, the production of virtually pure, unoxidized silicon particles with a primary particle size of 3 - 5 nm is possible using doped silicon rods. Here the initial formed particles are used to getter oxygen from any source, before the actual production. A clear correlation between the color of the particles and the degree of oxidation is observed. This continuous technique can be combined with other steps, e. g. surface functionalization or the immediate impaction of freshly prepared nano-particles onto a substrate for several different applications. Whether or not spark discharge generation is suitable for the production of silicon particles depends on the particular application. In the case of battery and hydrogen storage applications, the high elemental Si content of 95 - 100 % implies more active material, which positively influences the energy content of both batteries and hydrogen storage materials. Since oxides inevitably act as diffusion barriers, their reduction or total elimination also results in higher reaction rates. With careful working and relatively simple measures, the purity can likely be further increased. Moreover, the size of the spark discharge produced nano-particles is also responsible for rapid reaction rates in the above-mentioned applications. Compared to liquid phase methods the production rate is however currently very low; the laboratory scale production rate is only of the order of 0. 1 mg/hr. Significant increases in the production rate are thus needed, since battery or hydrogen storage related applications require rather sizable quantities of materials. For this reason, future work will be focused on upscaling the production rate of spark discharge generation. This can be achieved by increasing the energy input per spark, the number of sparks per second and the number of spark gaps. The current production rate is well suitable for sensor applications though, where even the currently still limited laboratory scale production rate can provide sufficient material. The possibility of continuous operation, direct functionalization and application of the particles through impaction, makes spark discharge especially suited for sensor applications. The simplicity of the spark discharge setup is a real advantage, as there is for instance less need for safety measures related to the use of lasers and hazardous gases such as silane. Although of less importance for sensor applications, both laser ablation and laser pyrolysis also lack the good and simple possibilities for mixing as the use of different electrodes in a single spark gap offers. In Chapter 4 the mass production of silicon nano-particles via an im- proved and upscaled Laser assisted Chemical Vapor Pyrolisys reactor is presented. Silicon nano-particles are synthesized from a SiH 4 precursor in a N 2 atmosphere. The improvement of the setup consists in the design of a new reaction zone, which leads to a homogenous product in terms of size and composition. For these purposes the reaction zone has been studied in relation to the nozzle and the laser beam geometry. In particular, in order to have mono-dispersed nano-particles, it is important to match the laser beam in- tensity profile with the the gas velocity profile. In this way different gas elements have the same probability to absorb the same amount of energy, resulting in a uniform heating along the reaction zone and therefore in a mono-dispersed product. The concept results in a newly built reaction zone, consisting of a rectangular nozzle and a quasi-rectangular laser beam. The reaction zone is built into a new, flexible to use, reactor that is capable to produce highly pure nano-particles with production rates between 1 and 100 g/h. Its flexibility relies not only in the different types of material that can be produced, but also in the modular configuration of the reactor body towards the assembly pieces (i. e. : nozzles, hoods, probes). The new LaCVP set-up consists of a main core, the reaction chamber, extended with the following auxiliary units: gas supply system, CO 2 laser and optics, filtration section, pump and exhaust system, <b>safety</b> control unit (<b>PLC).</b> The effect of the laser power on the powder characteristics is analyzed and five different samples are chosen for a more extensive characterization. The products have been characterized via TEM, XRD, TGA and FTIR analyses and compared to a commercially available one (Aldrich). The synthesized products show a narrow size distribution and a small particle size compared to the commercial material. Both the particle size and the particle size distribution are found to be strictly dependent on the laser power used in the synthesis experiments. Silicon nano-particles are pure and chemically stable upon air exposure, due to a thin passivation layer on the particle surface. These three synthesis techniques have been investigated in order to select the most suitable one with respect to the final designated application of the nano-particles. The most promising technique, in terms of purity of the product, size and size distribution of the particles as well as its great capabilities in terms of production rate, it is found to be the LaCVP. Mass production via LaCVP of small silicon nano-particles allows for thin film composite preparation, their characterization and their application in high energy storage devices. Chapter 5 is the bridge between the synthesis step and the final application of the product. For most electronic and electrochemical applications, in fact, silicon nano-particles have to be incorporated in a real electrode|$|R
