One such method is resynthesis. Resynthesis js {{viewed as a}} procedure whereby an analyzed scene can be reconstituted and subjerted to an analysis by human (informal) methods to determine the information preservation of the process. Several algorithms are presented for different ways of resynthesizing a decomposed image from its morphological decomposition analysis. In attempting to do pattern recognition with computers on continuous tone image sources of complex structure, one encounters the problem of decomposing the images for scene analysis. When one‘s goal in such pattern recognition is more than to assign the image to {{one of a number}} (usually small) of distinct classes, it become...|$|E

5000|$|Yet {{mahogany}} {{became the}} essential material {{that led to}} the golden age of British furniture-making in the 18th century, which Percy Macquoid, a connoisseur of English furniture, calls the [...] "Age of Mahogany". Furniture makers have used the wood more or less continuously since then not only in the United Kingdom, but in France, Spain and Italy as well. The Empire style of furniture featured its use extensively, and the Federal Style (1780-1830) in American furniture design is essentially a mahogany style. Mell's paper of 1917 refers to its extensive use in the early 20th century, but its importance for some purposes has diminished. Mahogany was formerly much used for the interior finish of railroad parlor cars, public buildings, hotels, and dwellings and for office fixtures. It also was used extensively in the manufacture of fortepianos, astronomical and surveying instruments, and cases for delicate apparatuses such as <b>scales,</b> <b>microscopes,</b> and microtomes.|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims at {{deciphering}} {{the complex}} and polyphase seismic deformation associated with two major pseudotachylyte-bearing fault zones, the pre-mesozoic Outer Hebrides Fault (OHF) in northwest Scotland, and the Mesozoic to Cenozoic Canavese fault zone and adjacent Ivrea zone in the Italian Alps. For both areas, the deformation was analysed from the field scale to scanning electron <b>microscope</b> <b>scale</b> to scanning electron <b>microscope</b> <b>scale.</b> In addition, Ar:Ar absolute dating was performed on Italian pseudotachylytes. The {{first part of this}} thesis shows that the OHF in the south Uist-Barra area is clearly segmented: the northern Stulabhal segment is characterized by quartz-feldspar gneisses (QF gneisses) in the foot wall and by two pyroxene gneisses (Corodale gneisses) in the hanging-wall. The southern Eriskay segment is characterized by QF gneisses both in the hanging wal. Moreover, the Stulabhal segment is underlined by a continuous and mappable, several meters thick, pseudotachylyte sole {{at the base of the}} hanging wall, and by diffuse pseudotachylyte fault vein in the footwall, while the Eriksay segment consists of several faults outlined by pseudotachylyte-rich zones whose thickness never exceeds 1 m. []In the second part of this thesis, we clarify the spatial and temporal distribution of pseudotachylyte in the Val Sesia area of the Ivrea zone. Pseudotachylytesin the Balmuccia periotite tectonic lens were formed during at least two periods:before Permian times and lateCretaceous to Tertiary. Pseudotachylytes in gabbroic rocks are randomly distributed over two-kilometrer-wide belt and were formed in the early Cretaceous. Pseudotachylytes in paragneisses distributed near the Canavese fault were formed in Eocene Times and are probably related to the thrusting of the Sesia zone over the Ivrea zone. This polyphase formation accompanied the exhumation of the Ivrea crust.

There are mainly two kinds of hexagonal arrangement found: Orientation 1 and 2, corresponding to ΓM and ΓK directions along normal incident wave vector. Spectroscopic measurement with spatial resolution of several micrometers is used to demonstrate the UV and visible wavelength range spectra of two independent modes of polarized light, TE and TM modes. The obtained experimental spectra are then compared with theoretical calculation based on two orientations of air tubes model, to show correspondence between two color regions and two orientations.

40|$|This work {{presents}} several high throughput {{imaging and}} analysis techniques performed by fluorescence detection and surface plasmon resonance biosensing. The microarray fabrication methods introduced in this thesis, {{as well as}} the DNA functionalization on planar and nanoparticle surfaces, enable and facilitate the real-time study of adsorption events via DNA- DNA hybridization and protein-DNA interaction. Silica deposited on polyolefin film serves as the base for the development of DNA microarray. Fabrication process involves poly(L-glutamic acid) monolayer to react with amine functional groups functionalized on both the silica surface and the probe DNA strands. Covalently surface-bound probes then hybridize with fluorophore-labeled target DNA. Shrinking the microarray with heat significantly enhances the sensitivity of detection via fluorescence signal amplification. Polydopamine, a biomimetic polymer, easily and rapidly grows an adhesive layer to link amine-terminated, single-stranded DNA to gold surface. Self-polymerization of polydopamine simply requires mild reagents and reaction condition. The microarray formed with polydopamine attachment technique reserves its stability and specificity to detect DNA and protein targets by surface plasmon resonance imaging. This one-step microarray fabrication approach, when coupled with signal amplification from DNA-modified gold nanoparticles, empowers the detection limit capable of seeing down to 10 pM target concentration. Electrochemical deposition of polydopamine demonstrates strong control over film localization and thickness. This meticulous polymerization on gold surface at the microscale proves the high toposelectivity of this deposition technique. Amine-modified DNA bound on this polydopamine thin flim hybridizes with fluorophore-tagged DNA to generate fluorescent DNA micropatterns. This electordeposition also forms DNA microarrays used in surface plasmon resonance imaging for DNA-DNA hybridization and DNA-coated gold nanoparticle adsorption measurements.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the {{advances}} in x-ray microscopy have mainly been due {{to the development of}} x-ray source technology and to the micro-fabrication of x-ray optics. These advances have spurred the development of x-ray microscopes that are approaching the best resolution possible in the presence of radiation damage in the specimen. In addition, the development of specimen preparation techniques that reduce tile effects of radiation damage on the specimen are underway. In contrast, tile development or x-ray detectors for x-ray microscopy has been a low priority. The objective of the work was to develop a new detector for x-ray microscopy. This involved the modification of a Thorn EMI electron tube in order to sensitise the multiplier for soil x-rays In the energy range of interest (0. 2 - 6 keV). The electron multiplier was then tested on a repetitive laser plasma source, which {{has been shown to be}} eminently suitable for a laboratory <b>scale</b> x-ray <b>microscope,</b> and the Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscope (STXM) at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), which is the most successful STXM presently in operation. The processed data from tile electron multiplier was used to characterise its response and assess its potential as all alternative to existing detectors. In addition, ID 21, the microscopy beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Source (ESRF) was studied to assess the need for a beam position monitor close to the exit slit of the monochromator. This involved the ray tracing of the beamline. It was proposed that in the case of a crystal monochromator a beam position monitor based oil the total signal from a photo-emitting blade containing a number of different diameter pinholes was sufficient. However, for a grating monochromator tile beamline design relied upon feedback from a beam position monitor capable of detecting the height of the beam at tile entrance to the microscope. A number of conceptual designs for a monitor that could fulfil this criterion are presented, including a novel method of using a Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) resonance. In principle this could be used to pinpoint a single energy from a grating monochromator.

In relatively unfractured parent rock the phyllosilicate clay contains Ni-rich smectites, the atomic ratio of Ni: octahedral cations ranging from 0. 3 to 0. 5. These smectites were studied by polarized light microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy, and electron microprobe, and infrared, optical absorption, M 6 ssbauer, and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. The chemical composition of the smectite is constant on the optical <b>microscope</b> <b>scale</b> even to the smallest analyzed particles (3000 ~, in diameter and about 75, ~ thick). From XRD data the mineral is principally a swelling, trioctahedral smectite; however, some kerolite-pimelite-like layers are present, and a weak 06, 33 reflection indicates {{the presence of a}} small amount of a dioctahedral phase.

The ability to probe, manipulate, and construct at this scale is a continuing challenge that needs to be addressed. There are concurrent projects in both industry and academia to construct nanotweezers to serve as the hands and arms for nanomanipulation. Most such devices are not fabricated using completely batch processes and lack the consistency, feature definition, and ease of production required for general use. In this project, we propose a completely batch fabricated nanotweezer designed for compatibility with the AFM. We have developed a completely batch process for making overhanging, electrostatically actuated, compliant mechanism nanotweezers with nanoscale gripper motion resolution. The nanotweezer we tested requires lower actuation voltage and is more compliant than other similar grippers. It also has desired out of plane stiffness and resonance modes for operation with the AFM. We have also developed a batch process to fabricate self-aligned nanoscale tips with nanoscale spacing without the need for nanoscale lithography. The two processes are compatible and can be combined to batch fabricate consistent and practical nanotweezers for large scale use. by Fardad A. Hashemi. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Cornell University One of {{the major}} goals of the geoscience {{community}} is to develop an accurate tectonic history of North America. Understanding how our continent evolved through time has numerous implications for our ability to develop accurate models of the tectonic evolution of continents - how they form, deform, and break. The interactions of deformation, metamorphism, and plutonism, three fundamental geological processes at work throughout the evolution of continents, record {{information that can be}} used to better understand the mechanisms and events that have shaped our continent. This dissertation employs metamorphic petrology, structural geology, geochemistry and geothermobarometry to interrogate the interactions of deformation, metamorphism and plutonism on multiple scales across the southwest United States. On a <b>microscope</b> <b>scale,</b> this dissertation shows that deformation and metamorphism can work in a positive feedback loop, facilitated by solution mass transfer, to localize both deformation and metamorphism, producing areas of high strain that have more closely approached metamorphic equilibrium. This result informs our understanding of crustal behavior at mid-crustal depths during orogenesis. On the mountain range scale, this dissertation combines petrographic analysis, structural geology, geochemistry and geothermobarometry to show that metamorphism in the Tusas and Picuris Mountains of northern New Mexico is consistent with one metamorphic event following a pressure-temperature-time trajectory consistent with progressive loading during the formation of a fold and thrust belt. This result informs our understanding of the tectonic history of North America, and has implications for the petrogenesis of aluminosilicate triple-point rocks in the region. Finally, on a continental scale, this dissertation uses previously published geochronologic data to identify spatial patterns in the age of igneous bodies across the southwest United States. These results were used to characterize mesoproterozoic tectonism and develop a model for melt production of these plutons. This result informs not only our understanding of crustal growth and rejuvenation during orogeny, but also provides a comprehensive dataset and novel approach that may both be employed in future research. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy showed that high density networks of tunnels about 300 A in diameter were formed in (i 11 } foils of GaP thinned by jet electropolishing using a chlorine in methanol solution. These tunnels ran in directions, in the polar sense from the gall ium to the phosphorus atom along a chemical bond. They were unrelated {{to any of}} the pre-existing defects in the material that could be seen by transmission {{electron microscopy}}. Deep, narrow, optically resolvable tunnels produced in crystall ine materials by dissolution processes have long been known to mineralogists as "anomalous olu-tion phenomena " (1). Later such a process described as tunnel etching producing "negative whiskers " was studied in LiF (2). A similar phenomenon of tunnel corrosion has recently been observed on a transmis-sion electron <b>microscope</b> <b>scale</b> in CuaAu alloys (3). We observed that narrow crystallographic channels were produced in GaP in the course of electrochemical thinning of this material for transmission electron microscopy (4). The results of a microscopic study of these etch tunnels are presented in this paper. Exper imenta l Methods The method of thinning the specimens was de-scribed in the previous paper (4). It involved directing a jet of chlorine in methanol on the GaP specimens. This worked well when the P (l l l) face was to be at-tacked. When the Ga (l l l) side had to be attacked however, it was found necessary to employ electro-polishing. The specimen was made. The anode and a potential difference of 120 V was applied between it and a tungsten electrode inside the jet nozzle. A current of about 20 mA then flowed, and rapid localized attack on the GaP occurred. An orange surface film was formed during electrochemical thinning from the Ga (111) face. This surface film could be removed by a final 15 sec chemical attack in the chlorine in methanol jet with no voltage applied. The evidence to be discussed below showed a dense network of tunnels to be present in the orange films. The scattering of light from these net-works of tunnels caused the translucence of the films and the diffuse nature of l ight reflected from them when observed in the optical microscope...|$|R
30|$|As an {{important}} wide band n-type semiconductor, SnO 2 possesses many unique optical and electrical properties {{which have been}} widely used in optoelectronic devices and gas sensors [1 – 4]. One dimensional (1 -D) SnO 2 have been reported to have some different characteristics from the bulk crystal due to its large surface-to-volume ratio [5]. Nanodevices based on 1 -D SnO 2 nanostructures have been fabricated and showed significant potential for applications ranging from field-effect transistors, gas sensors, displays, as well as solar cells [6 – 9]. Although promising results of the gas sensing and other performance of 1 -D SnO 2 have been reported, the development of highly sensitized devices remains a future challenge. Usually, the surface atoms and states on the (1 -D) SnO 2 surface play {{an important}} role in its transport behavior which complicates the nanodevice characterization [10]. Recent research result showed that the surface states indeed existed in these wires which could be detected in a contactless manner by spectral analysis [11]. Thus the better understanding of the surface states affected the device transport property needed. The transport property of the nanobelts device and the surface states on the (1 -D) SnO 2 surface must be cared in order to fabricate the practical application of nanodevices. It is difficult for us investigating the transport property of one single nanobelt in the nanometer scale before atomic force microscopy (AFM), especially the conductive AFM (C-AFM) with a conductive tip; in recent years, more and more are used to investigate the transport property and the surface property on the nanostructure in <b>microscope</b> <b>scales</b> [12 – 15]. AFM tip coated with metal can serve as the conducting electrode, and the transport property of the nanowires can be studied through the I-V curve recorded by C-AFM technique [16]. Furthermore, the current image, simultaneously with the AFM topography, can provide the direct information how the current flows through the nanostructure surface [17, 18]. In this paper, singe SnO 2 nanobelt device is assembled across opposing Au electrodes by electric-field assembly method [19]. Nonlinear and asymmetric I-V curve are obtained by applying a small voltage onto the conductive AFM tip positioned directly on the surface of SnO 2 nanobelt. We conclude the nonlinear and asymmetric I-V behavior resulted from the back-to-back Schottky barriers between AFM tip/SnO 2 nanobelt/electrode, and the Schottky barriers is related to the surface states on the nanobelt surface. The current images of the nanobelt device are also studied by C-AFM techniques, which show the current flow through the single nanobelt devices clearly. The results showed that the surface states can affect the transport property of the nanobelt device and display stripe patterns in the current images.|$|R
