40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is {{to show how the}} {{relationship}} between credit and critique is important for Jacques Derrida’s deconstruction of law. I will start from Force of Law, in which law, as well as justice, is deconstructed by Derrida. My purpose is further to show how the two concepts, credit and critique, are intertwined in the discourse of law and thereby crucial for Derrida’s deconstruction. As Derrida always states, the rational projects need to have a master concept, which the project revolves around, and this master concept needs at least one other <b>subordinate</b> <b>concept</b> to contrast itself against. In this context, I argue that critique can be that master concept. I base this argument upon the fact that critique in its ancient Greek sense, krinein, can be translated into the verb ‘to separate’, ‘to decide’ or ‘to judge’, which shows that there is an obvious link to the task of a judge. This puts critique in center of the discourse of law. Credit on the other hand is not rational, which makes it opposed to critique, but it is still important for law. It is a typical subordinated concept that just appears in the discourse without any further explanation but is present by its implicit importance to the discourse. I argue that credit is the <b>subordinate</b> <b>concept</b> that is needed for the concept of critique to be a master concept. Both concepts are important for the foundation of law, and this is why I believe that Derrida in the end states the importance {{to take responsibility for the}} law. In other words, one must take responsibility for both founding aspects of credit and critique when deconstructing the law...|$|E

Most of the pre-university students studying in Japanese language schools in Japan are in their adolescence. They are faced with the developmental challenge of establishing their ego identity in the culture different from their own. As the result of this challenge, their roots of identities are often shaken, and the attainment of self-identity among these students tends to be delayed. Furthermore, their mental health is affected by these unique experiences. Results demonstrated the positive relationship between self-identity formation and mental health; the more established the Chinese pre-university students’ self-identity, the better mental health they reported. <b>Subordinate</b> <b>concept</b> of ego identity, self-continuity was the strongest predictor of mental health.

40|$|Conventional medical concept systems {{represent}} generic concept relations by hierarchical coding principles. Often, these coding principles {{constrain the}} concept system {{and reduce the}} potential for automatical derivation of subsumption. Formal reconstruction of medical concept systems is an approach that bases on the conceptual representation of meanings and that allows {{for the application of}} formal criteria for subsumption. Those criteria must reflect intuitive principles of subordination which are underlying conventional medical concept systems. Particularly these are: The <b>subordinate</b> <b>concept</b> results (1) from adding a specializing criterion to the superordinate concept, (2) from refining the primary category, or a criterion of the superordinate concept, by a concept that is less general, (3) from adding a partitive criterion to a criterion of the superordinate, (4) from refining a criterion by a concept that is less comprehensive, and finally (5) from coordinating the superordinate concept, or one of its criteria. This paper introduces a formalism called BERNWARD that aims at the formal reconstruction of medical concept systems according to these intuitive principles. The automatical derivation of hierarchical relations is primarily supported by explicit generic and explicit partititive hierarchies of concepts, secondly, by two formal criteria that base on the structure of concept descriptions and explicit hierarchical relations between their elements, namely: formal subsumption and part-sensitive subsumption. Formal subsumption takes only generic relations into account, part-sensitive subsumption additionally regards partive relations between criteria. This approach seems to be flexible enough to cope with unforeseeable effects of partitive criteria on subsumption...|$|E

Convergence implies that previously unalike areas come together, approaching a common goal. A <b>subordinate</b> <b>concept</b> of convergence, i. e., media convergence, {{is a concept that}} has become common when denoting a range of processes within the production of media content, its distribution and consumption. Newspapers are one of many so-called publishing channels that provide information and entertainment. They have traditionally been printed on paper, but today’s digital technology makes it possible to provide newspapers through a number of different channels. The current strategy used by newspaper companies involves a process of convergence mainly regarding multiple publishing. A newspaper company interested in publishing content through multiple channels has to adapt its production workflow to produce content not only for the traditional printed edition, but also for the other channels. In this thesis, a generalized value chain involving four main stages illustrates the production workflow at a newspaper company in relation to the convergence processes. The four stages are creation, packaging, distribution and consumption of content. One of the aims of this thesis is to assess how the views and strategies of newspaper companies concerning media convergence correspond with the opinions and views concerning convergence of their audience. In order to discuss this, seven types of media convergence are suggested. Furthermore, the thesis explores how the newspaper industry is relating to the processes of convergence, using two examples: newspaper companies’ ventures into the use of moving images, and the newspaper companies’ strategies for a future epaper edition. Among the findings of this thesis are that digital news services can add value to a newspaper company, however that the digital news services investigated, in their current form, are not sophisticated enough to give added value as perceived by the audience. The findings of the thesis are based on studies of the newspaper industry in Sweden and reflect specific newspaper companies, their strategies, production workflow and ventures from 2002 to 2007.

A <b>subordinate</b> <b>concept</b> of convergence, i. e., media convergence, {{is a concept}} that has become common when denoting a range of processes within the production of media content, its distribution and consumption. The concept of media convergence has achieved buzzword status in many contexts due to its widespread use. The concept is not new and has been discussed by researchers in many academic fields and from several different points of views. This thesis will discuss media convergence as an ongoing process and not an end state. Newspapers are one of many so-called publishing channels that provide information and entertainment. They have traditionally been printed on paper, but today’s digital technology makes it possible to provide newspapers through a number of different channels. The current strategy used by newspaper companies involves a process of convergence mainly regarding multiple publishing. A newspaper company interested in publishing content through multiple channels has to adapt its production workflow to produce content not only for the traditional printed edition, but also for the other channels. In this thesis, a generalized value chain involving four main stages illustrates the production workflow at a newspaper company in relation to the convergence processes. The four stages are creation, packaging, distribution and consumption of content. The findings of the thesis are based on studies of the newspaper industry in Sweden and reflect specific newspaper companies, their strategies, production workflow and ventures from 2002 to 2005. The methods used have been case studies, literature studies and scenarios. Some of the conclusions of the thesis indicate that convergence processes have steered the newspaper companies’ development towards multiple channel publishing. Advancing technology and mergers between companies have contributed to the processes of convergence. However, the new publishing channels have been described as threatening to the traditional printed editions since they compete for consumers’ time and advertising revenues. Convergence of technology has made it possible to store, edit and publish material over many different networks using the same tools and the same database system. If the content is stored in a neutral format, it can be packaged and used in many different types of publishing channels. However, according to the studied newspapers, a fully automated workflow for all publishing channels is undesirable and impossible to achieve with the existing technology, standards and organizational structure. This licentiate thesis will discuss some of the strategies behind multiple channel publishing, production workflows and market conditions to detect how the newspaper industry is coping with media convergence.

The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the non-inferiority of the objective outcome of medical interview training with CYPT compared with the results of faculty-led training (FLT), and to explore qualitatively the educational benefits of CYPT. Methods We conducted a convergent mixed methods study including a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial and two focus groups. For the CYPT group, teaching was led by six student tutors from year 5. In the FLT group, students were taught by six physicians. Focus groups for student learners (four tutees) and student teachers (six tutors) were conducted following the training session. Results One hundred sixteen students agreed to participate. The OSCE scores of the CYPT group and FLT group were 91. 4 and 91. 2, respectively. The difference in the mean score was 0. 2 with a 95 % CI of − 1. 8 to 2. 2 within the predetermined non-inferiority margin of 3. 0. By analyzing the focus groups, we extracted 13 <b>subordinate</b> <b>concepts</b> and formed three categories including ‘Benefits of CYPT’, ‘Reflections of tutees and tutors’ and ‘Comparison with faculty’, which affected the interactions among tutees, tutors, and faculty. Conclusions CYPT is effective for teaching communication skills to medical students and for enhancing reflective learning among both tutors and tutees...|$|R

The research was conducted in an English Grade 2 class in a primary school in a lower socio-economic community in Manenberg on the Cape Flats, The research is based on the constructivist theories of Piaget, Vygotsky and Feuerstein and was conducted in the paradigm of praxis. The focus of the research was six learners in a class of 43 who were identified by the class educator through the process of continued assessment as needing intervention. Initial data collection was conducted utilising a questionnaire. This instrument was chosen to allow for a gentle introduction and a less threatening means of collecting information from a fellow colleague. I entered the classroom initially as observer and later as participant-observer. I observed how the class teacher taught the superordinate and <b>subordinate</b> <b>concepts</b> of number concept. Some observation sessions were video-recorded to allow for richer data collection. Followup interviews with the class teacher to discuss observations made as well as introduce new teaching methods were audio-recorded. Data were analysed using the process of discourse analysis.

40|$|Disability Ecology: Re-Materializing U. S. Fiction from 1890 - 1940 {{argues that}} {{disability}} is the material-semiotic {{product of an}} ecological network of human and non-human actors. As social forms, disability ecologies move across contexts, including the non-literary and the literary, to structure disability subjectivities, attach meaning to textualizations of nonnormative embodiments, and produce other effects particular to a given milieu. The introduction, “Returning to Bodies: Disability, Ecology, and Literary Disability,” proposes a model of disability that is distinct from extant essentialist and social models for the equal agentic capacities it grants to nonnormative embodiments and to cultural actors. Chapter one, “Disability, Subjects, Ecology,” develops the concepts of disability ecology {{and its relationship to}} disability subjectivities, and it argues that the disability ecologies in literary texts act as heuristics for the examination of the actors that structure disability subjectivities. Chapter two, “The Spectacular Banality of Literary Disability,” theorizes how the deployment of disability for egalitarian ends in realist fiction by William Dean Howells and Charles Chesnutt in fact produces discursive subjugation. Chapter three, “Biopolitical Aesthetics and the Crip Gesture of Naturalism,” coordinates analyses of proto-eugenic practices of medical classification that depended on biopolitical aesthetic criteria and the aesthetic projects of naturalist fiction by Frank Norris and Edith Wharton that reify <b>subordinating</b> <b>concepts</b> of disability even as they foreground impairment as a universal condition of human being. Chapter four, “Disability Kitsch, Literary Inclusionism, and the Crip Art of Aesthetic Failure,” argues that representations of disability in literary art tend toward kitsch, yet as kitsch such representations wield an expressive power that marginalizing discourses cannot contain. Through analyses of texts by Willa Cather and Ernest Hemingway, the chapter further develops an idea of post-thematic disability aesthetics, meaning the application of disability themes to experimental literary forms in the absence of representation...|$|R

Design/methodology/approacThis paper uses the results of an archival study conducted on data collected in an insurance firm. Findings The results suggest that the reasons underlying the heterogeneity of transactions’ time consumption are multiple and rule out a systematic and unique explanation. They lend support to the importance of the “human effect” in explaining the time consumption of service transactions and support the need for more research into the evolution of marketing thought that <b>subordinates</b> the <b>concept</b> of transaction to the concept of relationship. In addition, our results not only suggest that the drivers of time consumption and their importance are contingent on the type of service activity performed within the same firm, but also that inside a generic service activity, deviations in time consumption remain due to the provision of specific services. Originality/valueServices have their own characteristics which make it difficult to trace their resource consumption.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} the Facility Management knowledge categories within the life cycle of a building context. The significance of the study stemmed from research undertaken into the compliance to Australian Standards 1851 - 17 : 2005 Maintenance of Fire and Smoke Doors within West Australian nursing homes, which demonstrated 87 per cent non-compliance. The level of non-compliance appeared to identify a lack of knowledge, and appropriately qualified and experienced personnel involved within the management of nursing homes (Doleman, 2008). The issues identified prompted the question on how facility management knowledge categories evolves and develops throughout the life cycle of a building. The research used a three Phase, Grounded Theory interpretive analysis of the Facility Management knowledge construct. Phase One involved the examination of 21 international tertiary undergraduate Facility Managers courses. The course content was analysed and assessed through linguistic analysis to extract the knowledge categories and <b>subordinate</b> <b>concepts.</b> The findings identified 14 primary knowledge categories which were presented to 10 Facility Management experts for validation. Phase Two presented the findings of Phase One in a Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) survey instrument to Facility Management experts for dissimilarity assessments. The results from the 56 completed surveys were embedded within MDS software to present spatial knowledge proximity cluster analysis. The final phase was the validation of the research findings through semi-structured interviews of 10 industry experts, selected with consideration of heterogeneity in order to validate the findings of the previous phase. The outcome of this study was to develop an understanding of the Facility Management knowledge categories within the life cycle of a building context and the identification of 14 core knowledge base, required as a Facility Manager practitioner. Core knowledge categories included Finance as a central theme within the Facility Management domain with Building Services and Business providing an indication as to the broad nature of Facility Management knowledge construct. Also identified within the research was the lack of legislative harmonisation between different states and territories within the Facility Management domain and the disparity between Facility Management practitioners with regards to knowledge context and application. The role of Facility Management and their involvement within the lifecycle of a building was also identified within the research as being little or none during the design and construction phases of the building. The handover and management of the buildings to Facility Managers occurs within the occupancy phase of the buildings life cycle meaning that the building was inherited without due consideration of continued operational efficiencies or functionality affecting the overall cost effectiveness of the building. Such outcomes lead to a number of recommendations such as a the introduction of central knowledge standard in order to provide context of definitions and well as the continued development and drive of Facility Management practitioners and associations to establish the Facility Management profession as a respected body...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} findings {{have shown a}} positive relationship between achievement and the amount of time students engage in learning activities. Since the greatest percentage of class time is allocated to seatwork, with worksheets being the most frequently used activi-. y, a study investigated the effects of using three types of worksheet tasks on engaged learning time (ELT) for fifth grade students of three levels of reading ability (high, middle, low). The 134 subjects were assigned to one of three treatment groups: (1) drill, consisting of worksheets composed of mu?tiple choice, true/falsa, and fill-in-the-blank questions; (2) comprehension 4 consisting of worksheets designed to promote comprehension cf <b>subordinate</b> lesson <b>concepts</b> by requiring analysis, evaluation, or application of the lesson material; and (3) structuring, consisting of worksheets requiring students to locate and write main ideas appearing in the text. The results indicated that low level readers in the drill treatment spent a significantly greater amount of their time on-task than did high level readers in the same treatment. In addition, high and middle level readers assigned to the structuring treatment had a significantly higher engagement rate than did high level readers in the drill treatment. Finally, subjects at each of the three reading level: in the comprehension treatment spent significantly more time on-task than did high level readers in the drill treatment.
