Much of the organic matter in oil shale is of algal origin, but may also include remains of vascular land plants.

To this end the Antruiles section (northeastern Dolomites, Italy) has been investigated as a reference section for the Cenomanian black shales. The data obtained, based oncalcareous nannofossils and foraminifera, have been compared to those from a core in the Mediterranean Sea containing a complete succession of Late Pleistocene^Holocene <b>sapropels.</b> Our study suggests that deposition of black shales, like <b>sapropels,</b> occurred when the water column was stratified, as implied by increased abundance of the Cenomanian deeper-dwellers Rotalipora cushmani and R. greenhornensis. The superficial/subsuperficial opportunist form Heterohelix reussi, which strongly increases in numbers within the black shales, could be analogous to the modern surface-dweller Globigerinoides ruber, which is abundant in Late Pleistocene^Holocene Mediterranean <b>sapropels.</b> The peaks of G. ruber {{can be related to}} decreased salinity in surface water, thus the increase of H. reussi could also be related to a freshwater superficial layer. We hypothesise also that an increase in abundance of Watznaueria barnesae reflects conditions of superficial low salinity. In black shales increases in abundance of Dicarinella algeriana and Praeglobotruncana gibba, by analogy to modern Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, could reflect availability of food restricted to subsuperficial waters. However, a Cretaceus equivalent of the Pleistocene nannoplankton form Florisphaera profunda, which proliferates within the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum, is not observed. In addition, the abundance of H. reussi indicates a well-expanded oxygen minimum zone, although less in extent than in Pleistocene <b>sapropels,</b> as shown by the occurrence within the Cenomanian black shales of a benthic fauna, even though reduced in size and impoverished.

40|$|Eastern Mediterranean sediments are {{characterized}} by the occurrence of distinct, organic-rich layers, called <b>sapropels.</b> These harbour elevated microbial numbers in comparison with adjacent carbon-lean intermediate layers. A recently obtained culture collection from these sediments was composed of 20 % of strains closely related to Rhizobium radiobacter, formerly classified as Agrobacterium tumefaciens. To prove and quantify the in situ abundance of R. radiobacter, a highly specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was developed. To convert quantification results into cell numbers, the copy number of rrn operons per genome was determined. Southern hybridization showed that our isolates contained four operons. Finally, quantitative PCR was applied to 45 sediment samples obtained across the eastern Mediterranean. Rhizobium radiobacter was present in 38 of 45 samples indicating an almost ubiquitous distribution. In total, 25 – 40 000 cells per gram of sediment were detected, corresponding to 0. 001 – 5. 1 % of the bacterial cells.

40|$|Cyclic sediments {{observed}} {{throughout the}} Mediterranean during the Late Miocene have {{been related to}} precessional forcing of ocean stratification. Individual couplets, typically 2 -m-thick sequences of <b>sapropels</b> and diatom-rich marls, can be reliably traced from western Spain to Crete, and were formed in restricted marginal basins. Micropaleontological evidence indicates paradoxically that the organic carbon-rich <b>sapropels</b> were formed under low productivity conditions marked by surface water stratification and deep anoxia, whereas the diatom-rich marls were formed under high productivity conditions marked by upwelling. Here we present geochemical evidence, mainly from detailed phosphorus determinations and paleo-redox proxies, indicating that a sediment–nutrient–oxygen feedback (herein dubbed the SNO Effect) is in part responsible for driving the observed productivity variations. During stratification, anoxic conditions in these basins cause {{the release of the}} limiting nutrient phosphorus from reducible oxide phases in the sediments. Basin stagnation causes the buildup of phosphorus below the photic zone. Subsequent overturn driven by precessionally-driven winds injects phosphorus-rich bottom waters into the photic zone. The biotic response to this overturn is high productivity in marls directly overlying the <b>sapropels</b> culminating in diatom mat formation. Exhaustion of the stored excess phosphorus results in lower productivity marls, which grade back into <b>sapropels</b> due to lower wind stresses and the return of stagnant basin conditions. These findings indicate that the SNO Effect may in part be responsible for precessional-scale productivity variations observed in parts of the Mediterranean, and perhaps present in other restricted ocean basins, like the Miocene Monterey Formation and the modern Santa Barbara Basin.

According to the integrated calcareous plankton biostratigraphy and to cyclostratigraphy based on fluctuations in the relative abundance of fauna in the planktonic foraminiferal assemblage, the base of the Uvigerina pygmaea-peregrina Event coincides with cycle 6 a and its top coincides with cycle 10 in the Sicilian sections. A similar temporal correlation is seen in the Tyrrhenian basin (ODP Site 652). On the contrary, the Uvigerina pygmaea-peregrina Event covers a longer time interval in the Jonian basin, where it is recognizable from cycle 4 to cycle 12.

40|$|The {{organic carbon}} isotopic {{record of the}} sapropels(S 1 and S 3 -S 10) and {{intercalated}} marl oozes has been determined in a 12 -m piston core from the eastern Mediterranean. The d 13 C_organic values are systematically lighter (mean=- 21. 0 ± 0. 82 per mil) in all <b>sapropels</b> and heavier (mean=- 18. 8 ± 1. 07 per mil) in the marl oozes. These differences are not due to variable marine and terrestrial organic matter mixtures because all values are heavier than modern plankton in the Mediterranean, there is no relationship between the C_organic/N ratios and the isotopic values, and published information on the abundance and distribution of organic biomarkers shows that terrestrial material constitutes a minor {{fraction of the total}} organic matter. Temperature effects on isotope fractionation are also discounted because the change in d 13 C_organic values between glacial and interglacial horizons is in the opposite sense. Diagenesis, which can produce relatively small changes in the carbon isotopic composition of sedimentary organic matter under certain circumstances, is unlikely to have caused the observed differences because this mechanism would cause an enrichmet in 12 C, implying that all values were even heavier originally, and there is no secular trend in the d 13 C_organic record. The observed differences in d 13 C_organic between the two lithologies are probably produced by changes in the isotopic composition and the concentration of dissolved CO 2. First, freshwater flooding during the formation of the <b>sapropels</b> caused the isotopic composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface waters of the Mediterranean to become lighter because of the 13 C deficiency in fresh waters. Hence photosynthesis would have produced isotopically lighter organic material. Second, changes in atmospheric pCO 2 between glacial and interglacial periods, as shown by the Vostok ice core, caused marked changes in the concentration of free dissolved CO 2 in the mixed layer; lower values during glacial maxima caused a smaller fractionation of the carbon isotopes by phytoplankton, whereas levels were less limiting during the interglacials. Concentrations of dissolved CO 2 could also have been much higher during the deposition of the <b>sapropels</b> because of the supply of regenerated CO 2 to the mixed layer by upwelling, and this could have further lightened the d 13 C_organic values in the <b>sapropels</b> themselves.
