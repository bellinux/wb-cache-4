40|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>lag</b> occurs {{not only}} in bridge decks and framed tubes, but also in shear/core walls. However, there have been {{relatively}} few studies on <b>shear</b> <b>lag</b> in wall structures. Moreover, most existing theories neglect <b>shear</b> <b>lag</b> in the webs and, although they are acceptable for bridge decks that normally have flanges wider than webs, {{they may not be}} applicable to shear/core walls whose webs can be much wider than flanges. To study the <b>shear</b> <b>lag</b> phenomenon in wall structures, a parametric study using finite-element analysis is carried out. Unlike previous studies that neglected <b>shear</b> <b>lag</b> in the webs, many layers of elements are used for both the webs and flanges so that <b>shear</b> <b>lag</b> in the webs can also be taken into account. The results indicate that the shape of the longitudinal stress distribution in an individual web or flange panel is quite independent of the dimensions of the other panels. Based on this observation, design charts and empirical formulas for estimating the <b>shear</b> <b>lag</b> effects are developed for practical applications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|We present direct {{evidence}} of low frequency, radially sheared, turbulence-driven flows (zonal flows (ZFs)) triggering edge transport barrier formation preceding the L- to H-mode transition via periodic turbulence suppression in limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs), consistent with predator-prey dynamics. The final transition to edge-localized mode-free H-mode occurs after the equilibrium E × B flow shear increases due to ion pressure profile evolution. ZFs are also observed to initiate {{formation of an}} electron internal transport barrier (ITB) at the q = 2 rational surface via local suppression of electron-scale turbulence. Multi-channel Doppler backscattering (DBS) has revealed the radial structure of the ZF-induced shear layer and the E × B shearing rate, ωE × B, in both barrier types. During edge barrier formation, the <b>shearing</b> rate <b>lags</b> the turbulence envelope during the LCO by 90 °, transitioning to anti-correlation (180 °) when the equilibrium shear dominates the turbulence-driven flow shear due to the increasing edge pressure gradient. The time-dependent flow shear and the turbulence envelope are anti-correlated (180 ° out of phase) in the electron ITB. LCOs with time-reversed evolution dynamics (transitioning from an equilibrium-flow dominated to a ZF-dominated state) have also been observed during the H-L back-transition and are potentially of interest for controlled ramp-down of the plasma stored energy and pressure (normalized to the poloidal magnetic field) in ITER. © 2014 IAEA, Vienna...|$|R

TITLE: VERIFICATION OF <b>SHEAR</b> <b>LAG</b> IN LONGITUDINALLY WELDED TENSION MEMBERS. MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. J. Kent Hsiao, Ph. D., P. E. (CA), S. E. (UT) Tension members are used broadly as bracing members in buildings and truss. When double channels or double tees are welded to a gusset plate, stresses are distributed non-uniformly in connected members since {{only a part}} of its cross-section is connected. <b>Shear</b> <b>lag</b> factor describes this phenomenon. The main objective {{of this study is to}} verify <b>shear</b> <b>lag</b> factor of tension steel members with welded connections using the finite element computer analysis and the current design Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC 2010). The provision for calculating <b>shear</b> <b>lag</b> factor, U, is given by AISC Specification as 1 -x ̅/L for angles, tees, channels and wide flange tension members. Weld size and length of the weld are the main parameters studied here. The current AISC design provision over-estimates the design tensile strength of double channel shapes. While, for WT Shapes it under-estimates one. The increase in weld size and decrease in weld length shows slight change in <b>shear</b> <b>lag</b> factor. Comparison is also made with the equation proposed by Fortney and Thornton (2012). The equation under-estimates the design tensile strength of both sections...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{electromechanical}} impedance (EMI) {{technique for}} structural health monitoring (SHM) and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) employs piezoelectric-ceramic (PZT) patches, which are surface bonded to the monitored structures using adhesives. The adhesive forms a finitely thick, permanent interfacial layer between the host {{structure and the}} patch. Hence, the force transmission between the structure and the patch occurs through the bond layer, via shear mechanism, invariably causing <b>shear</b> <b>lag.</b> However, the impedance models developed so far ignore the associated <b>shear</b> <b>lag</b> and idealize the force transfer to occur {{at the ends of}} the patch. This paper analyses the mechanism of force transfer through the bond layer and presents a step-by-step derivation to integrate the <b>shear</b> <b>lag</b> effect into impedance formulations, both one-dimensional and two-dimensional. Further, using the integrated model, the influence of various parameters (associated with the bond layer) on the electromechanical admittance response is studied by means of a parametric study. It is found that the bond layer can significantly modify the measured electromechanical admittance if not carefully controlled during the installation of the PZT patch.
