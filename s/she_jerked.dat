60|$|She swayed for {{a moment}} and pretended that she tripped. He caught her arm and steadied her. <b>She</b> <b>jerked</b> it from him.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>jerked</b> {{her hand}} away, and, burying it with its mate in his curly mop, {{shook his head}} back and forth. [...] "What shall I do with him, father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mine's Philadelphia. But {{everybody}} except Rene {{calls me}} Phil. I'm Squire Bucksteed's daughter--over at Marklake yonder.' <b>She</b> <b>jerked</b> her little round chin towards the south behind Dallington. 'Sure-ly you know Marklake?' ...|$|E
50|$|Carter finds he {{can neither}} {{shut it off}} nor {{disconnect}} the power. With the engine building to an overload, he begins to panic when discovering all communications {{to and from the}} room are jammed. Fortunately, Verdeschi and Maya are passing through the Technical Section. The pair is attracted to the workshop by the motor's deafening whine, and Carter shouts a warning through the door. Maya transforms into a mountain gorilla and forces the hatch open. <b>She</b> <b>jerks</b> the motor's power cable right out of the wall, narrowly averting a nuclear explosion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, youse," [...] {{a coarse}} voice yelled in her ear. [...] "Come out o' de trance," [...] {{and at the}} same time <b>she</b> was <b>jerked</b> roughly toward the companionway.|$|R
6000|$|... [With {{whispering}} and scuffling; gurgling and squeaking, the [...] reluctant Ivy's hand {{is caught}} and <b>she</b> is <b>jerked</b> away. In their [...] haste {{they have left}} the door open behind them.] ...|$|R
60|$|As {{her husband}} {{proceeded}} {{to take her}} hand, <b>she</b> <b>jerked</b> it away, and at once openly told him all that she had promised to Somdatt on condition of his not killing himself.|$|E
60|$|Jenny Wren {{came right}} {{up in front}} of Sammy Jay and hopped up and down. She was so mad that with every word <b>she</b> <b>jerked</b> her funny little tail so that Sammy Jay almost had to laugh.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>jerked</b> at the bridle, and, wading blindly {{across the}} brook, she mounted somehow, and rode with blurred sight {{back to the}} cabin. Kells {{appeared}} busy with men outside and did not accost her. She fled to her cabin and barricaded the door.|$|E
60|$|With a {{vigorous}} <b>jerk</b> <b>she</b> freed herself from Don Miguel's grasp.|$|R
60|$|Within {{ten minutes}} <b>she</b> was <b>jerking</b> the old-fashioned bell-pull of Luke Dawson. Mrs. Dawson {{opened the door}} and peered doubtfully about the edge of it. Carol kissed her cheek, and frisked into the lugubrious sitting-room.|$|R
6000|$|Thatcher stood {{dumb and}} astounded at this capricious girl. She saw his mystification instantly. [...] "It {{is for the}} old Cat!" [...] <b>she</b> whispered, <b>jerking</b> her thumb over her {{shoulder}} {{in the direction of}} the sleeping Mrs. P. [...] "Good night,--go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's kind," [...] said Biddy, {{dropping}} {{her hands and}} now resting her eyes on him gratefully. She remained in this position as if under a charm; then <b>she</b> <b>jerked</b> herself back to her work with the remark: [...] "Florence will like that immensely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is what I like," [...] said Mrs. Flushing. <b>She</b> <b>jerked</b> {{her head}} at the Villa. [...] "A little house in a garden. I had one once in Ireland. One could lie in bed in the mornin' and pick roses outside the window with one's toes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mercy, I {{have to be}} going," [...] she exclaimed, {{glancing at}} the black marble clock on the mantel. [...] "We've {{got a lot of}} {{invoices}} to put through to-day. See you again, Mr. Holder." [...] <b>She</b> <b>jerked</b> his hand once more. [...] "Good morning, Mr. Bentley." ...|$|E
5000|$|While she immerses herself quite happily in this elusive world, <b>she</b> <b>jerks</b> {{herself out}} of dreams when she gets to know he is a married man. Her world then starts {{drifting}} between the two extremes of her dreams and reality. She finds herself enjoying life in the dream world but reality drags her out of it. In the real world she is debarred from bringing up an illegal child without a father by the civil law of the country while depriving her of aborting the pregnancy by the penal code, which considers abortions as a severe criminal offence. A young girl caught in this dilemma condemned by society, is the dream world her only retreat? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah I've said so many things! One {{has to do}} that to get rid of you. You rather hurt my hand," [...] <b>she</b> added--and <b>jerked</b> it away in {{a manner}} showing that if she was an angel of mercy her mercy was partly for herself.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> debated, <b>jerking</b> {{the book}} {{into the nearest}} empty chair, where Mr. Cashmore quickly pounced on it. [...] "Wasn't it for that you brought it me?" [...] she demanded. Yet before he could answer she again {{challenged}} her child. [...] "Have you read this work, Nanda?" ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly she {{snatched}} a rifle {{off the wall}} and backed away, her strong hands fumbling at the lever. As <b>she</b> <b>jerked</b> it down, throwing a shell into the chamber and cocking the weapon, Duane leaped upon her. He struck up the rifle as it went off, the powder burning his face.|$|E
60|$|He swayed, tugging forward. <b>She</b> <b>jerked</b> at him {{till the}} button gave way, {{and then he}} slipped half out of his jacket and, turning round, {{remained}} strangely motionless. His heart seemed to beat in his throat. He choked--tried to speak--could not find any words. He thought with fury: I will kill both of them.|$|E
60|$|The old {{familiar}} roar of {{the wind}} was with them. The Malahini, caught broadside, was pressed down almost {{on her beam ends}} as she swung the arc compelled by her anchors. They rounded her into the wind, where <b>she</b> <b>jerked</b> to an even keel. The propeller was thrown on, and the engine took up its work again.|$|E
60|$|I {{had to drop}} {{my camera}} to help Jones and Jim pull the animal from her perch. The {{branches}} broke in a shower; then the lioness, hissing, snarling, whirling, plunged down. <b>She</b> nearly <b>jerked</b> the rope out of our hands, but we lowered her to Emett, who noosed her hind paws in a flash.|$|R
60|$|I {{hammered}} fresh charges into my pistols after I {{had turned}} this {{over in my}} head. Then I put {{them back in the}} holsters, and I examined my little mare, <b>she</b> <b>jerking</b> her head and cocking her ears the while, as if to tell me that an old soldier like herself did not make a fuss about a scratch or two. The first shot had merely grazed her off-shoulder, leaving a skin-mark, as if she had brushed a wall. The second was more serious. It had passed through the muscle of her neck, but already it had ceased to bleed. I reflected that if she weakened I could mount Montluc's grey, and meanwhile I led him along beside us, for he was a fine horse, worth fifteen hundred francs at the least, {{and it seemed to me}} that no one had a better right to him than I.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! oh!! oh!!!" [...] shrieked Edith in mingled {{fear and}} excitement, as, at each {{successive}} [...] "oh!" [...] <b>she</b> received a <b>jerk</b> that well-nigh pulled {{her into the}} ice-hole.|$|R
60|$|Having {{delivered}} these ironical passages with a {{most wonderful}} volubility, {{and with a}} shrillness perfectly deafening (especially when <b>she</b> <b>jerked</b> out the interjections), Miss Miggs, from mere habit, and not because weeping was at all appropriate to the occasion, {{which was one of}} triumph, concluded by bursting into a flood of tears, and calling in an impassioned manner on the name of Simmuns.|$|E
60|$|Yet all {{the time}} she wanted, and stormily knew she wanted, to be fleeing to the boy Milt, her mate; to run away with him, hand in hand, {{discovering}} all the colored world, laughing at life, not afraid of losing dignity. In fear of Jeff's very kindliness and honor, <b>she</b> <b>jerked</b> her hand free. Then she tried to smile like a clever fencer.|$|E
60|$|Then she edged down {{in among}} the cactus and brush. The red horse no longer lay in a {{strained}} position. He could lift his head. Lucy saw that the noose still held tight round his neck. Fearlessly <b>she</b> <b>jerked</b> it loose. Then she backed away, but not quite out of his reach. He coughed and breathed slowly, with great heaves. Then he snorted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Release my pony's head!" [...] she cried, {{her face}} flushing, as <b>she</b> gave a <b>jerk</b> to the reins. [...] "How dare you? What right have you to detain me?" ...|$|R
60|$|This remark, and {{the rough}} strain in his voice, {{recalled}} to her memory so many difficult speeches and abortive meetings that <b>she</b> was <b>jerked</b> directly {{back to the}} London drawing-room, the family relics, and the tea-table; {{and at the same}} time recalled some half-finished or interrupted remark which she had wanted to make herself or to hear from him--she could not remember what it was.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Shukla calls Sudha, Sudha brings tea downstairs. Chandar stops her {{and asks}} her to sit. She shows her {{the photo of}} Sudha, that this is Kailash. Sudha says he is good looking, and handsome. Chandar asks if she likes him. Sudha says yes, and heads to leave. Chandar stops her, Sudha says if he needs {{something}} he must ask Binti. Chandar asks her {{to sit down and}} takes her hand in his. He asks her to agree upon something he is going to say. Sudha asks what is that she doesn’t hear when he says. Chandar says that he wants her to promise she won’t deny. Chandar places his eyes on Sudha’s hand and asks her to marry that guy. Sudha jerks his hand away and goes backward, away from Chandar. She cries and says she doesn’t like such jokes. Is this why he had been speaking to her with such love. Chandar says that she has promised him. Sudha says she didn’t promise, and what promise does he fulfil; is it right to get his promise fulfilled. She cries and pleads him not to sacrifice her tying her in a promise. Chandar comes to her, keeps a hand on her shoulder. <b>She</b> <b>jerks</b> his hand away and runs inside the room. Chandar comes to her again, <b>she</b> again <b>jerks</b> him away and says she will never marry. They want to kill her, she herself will beat herself to death and hits her head on mirror. Sudha asks if {{he was the only one}} to make her choose her proposal, she doesn’t need him anymore. She asks him if he felt ashamed asking the questions that he did. She cries, takes the photo from Chandar’s hand and says that she will tell Papa that she likes this guy, he is good but she will never marry him. Chandar stops Sudha, she wrestles with him. He slaps her, she fell on the floor. Both cry in agony.|$|R
60|$|I {{went and}} found him at the fifth, the last cow. When at length he had {{finished}} he put down his pail, and going over to poor Julia, stood scratching her back, and her poll, and her nose, looking into her big, startled eye and murmuring. She was afraid; <b>she</b> <b>jerked</b> her head, giving him a good blow on the cheek with her horn.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>jerked</b> {{her head}} {{sideways}} like one who understands. Meantime Razumov's eyes had strayed {{after the two}} men. They were crossing the grass-plot obliquely, without haste. The shorter of the two was buttoned up in a narrow overcoat of some thin grey material, which came nearly to his heels. His companion, much taller and broader, wore a short, close-fitting jacket and tight trousers tucked into shabby top-boots.|$|E
60|$|Miss Grover had {{capability}} {{written all}} over her. She {{was a young woman}} of thirty, slim to spareness, simply dressed in a shirtwaist and a dark blue skirt; alert, so distinctly American in type as to give a suggestion of the Indian. Her quick, deep-set eyes searched Hodder's face as <b>she</b> <b>jerked</b> his hand; but her greeting was cordial, and, matter-of-fact. She stimulated curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That they what?' cried Catherine, {{gazing at}} him with a troubled countenance. 'Oh, Nelly!' <b>she</b> added petulantly, <b>jerking</b> her head away from my hands, 'you've combed my hair quite out of curl! That's enough; let me alone. What are you on the point of {{complaining}} about, Heathcliff?' ...|$|R
60|$|Joan {{became aware}} of a {{singular}} tremor in Kells's arm, which she still clasped. Suddenly it <b>jerked.</b> <b>She</b> caught a gleam of blue. Then the bellow of a gun almost split her ears. Powder burned her cheek. She saw Frenchy double up and collapse on the platform.|$|R
60|$|A {{mile from}} Gopher Prairie the track mounts a curving low ridge, {{and she could}} see the town as a whole. With a passionate <b>jerk</b> <b>she</b> pushed up the window, looked out, the arched fingers of her left hand {{trembling}} on the sill, her right hand at her breast.|$|R
