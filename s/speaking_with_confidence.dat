6000|$|He {{corresponds}} with a learned French statesman, {{not on the}} insoluble Newfoundland problem, turning {{so much on the}} nice issue whether a lobster is a fish, and not on the vexed Egyptian question, but on the curious prohibition of pork as an article of food—a strange contradiction between the probable practice of the Phœnicians and that of the Jews, perpetuated in our times through all Mussulman countries, and a prohibition not to be explained on sanitary grounds, because to the present day Christians in the East all indulge in pork and are none the worse for it. A young member of parliament one night fell into conversation with him, as a branch from the subject of the eating of bovine flesh by the Greeks, on the eating of horseflesh, and the next day writes to mention to him that at a council in 785 with the Bishop of Ostia as president, it was decreed, “Many among you eat horses, which is not done by any Christians in the East: avoid this;” and he asks Mr. Gladstone whether he believed that by reason of the high estimation in which the Greeks held the horse, they abstained from his flesh. Mr. Gladstone (August 1889) replies that while on his guard against <b>speaking</b> <b>with</b> <b>confidence</b> about the historic period, he thought he was safe in saying that the Greeks did not eat the horse in the heroic period, and he refers to passages in this book and the other. “It was only a conjecture, however, on my part that the near relation of the horse to human feeling and life may probably have been the cause that prevented the consumption of horse-flesh.” In a further letter he refers his correspondent to the closing part of the Englishman in Paris for some curious particulars on hippophagy. Then he seems to have interested himself in a delicate question as to the personal claims of Socrates in the light of a moral reformer, and the sage’s accommodation of moral sentiment to certain existing fashions in Athenian manners. But as I have not his side of the correspondence, I can only guess that his point was the inferiority of the moral ideals of Socrates to those of Christ. Gustave d’Eichthal, one of the celebrated group of Saint-Simonians who mingled so much of what was chimerical with much that was practical and fruitful, draws the attention of Mr. Gladstone, statesman, philosopher, and hellenist, to writings of his own on the practical use of Greek, as destined to be the great national language of humanity, perhaps even within the space of two or three generations. Guizot begs him to accept his book on Peel; and thanking him for his article on the “Royal Supremacy” (Feb. 9, 1864), says further what must have given Mr. Gladstone lively satisfaction:— ...|$|E

40|$|The context, content, {{and process}} of making faith {{accessible}} to young people within Catholic {{elementary and secondary schools}} is examined in light of the faith formation needs of the overwhelmingly lay and female faculties of Catholic schools. The complexity and challenge of the changing American culture and catechetical models in the post-Vatican II Church raise questions of the Catholic identity of the schools and their effectiveness in forming people of faith and practicing Catholics. These concerns are addressed through a dialogic methodology, bringing the disciplines of theology, religious education, psychology, sociology, anthropology, business, and education into dialogue. Integral writings include McBrien, Boys, Harris, Hofinger, Darcy-Berube, Groome, Whiteheads, Vogel, Belenky, Friere, Palmer, Sergiovanni, Barth, and Senge. The constructs of coming to know, believe, and act are examined from the perspective of women as leaders and teachers, with particular attention to the lenses of voice, gender, and subjectivity. A description of Christian Story/Vision leads to metaphors and models for faith formation of teachers and to the ability to make faith more accessible to the young. A taxonomy of the Spirituality of the Catholic School Educator organizes the knowledge-base, skills, attitudes/behaviors of the educator as individual, model and leader, and builder of community. The conscious creation of Christian community in the Catholic school is described through the concepts of collegiality and of Community of Place, Community of Kinship, Community of Mind, and Community of Memory, as well as the five disciplines of learning communities: personal mastery, interpreting mental models, shared values and beliefs, team learning, and systems thinking. Community of Spirit is articulated as the ideal form of faith community, focusing on personal and communal conversion, and integrating the vision of the reign of God into the creation and action-reflection of the Catholic school faith community. Faithful, effective, inclusive community is the result of faith formation and professional development of teachers, in the context of Community of Spirit, fulfilling the teaching mission of the Church. It leads to knowing with conviction, <b>speaking</b> <b>with</b> <b>confidence,</b> and living with commitment in the faith community of the Catholic school, making faith compellingly accessible to the young...|$|E

In those far lands I reveled in the ambrosial food that fructifies the soul, the mind, the heart. But of all things, that which most appealed to my inborn esthetic taste was the prevailing custom there, among the rich, of making collections of elegant and costly rarities, dainty objets de vertu, and in an evil hour I tried to uplift my uncle Ithuriel to a plane of sympathy with this exquisite employment.|$|R

One could have used the authority of a profound observer {{after the first few}} days in 1861 and 1865, but the experience of weeks stretching to months in 1882 and 1883, clouded rather than cleared the air through which one earliest saw one's London; and the successive pauses in 1894 and 1897, with the longest and latest stays in 1904, have but served to confirm one in the diffident inconclusion on all important points to which I hope the pages following will bear witness.|$|R

60|$|With {{regard to}} the {{specific}} mode of regulating the importation of corn, if the restrictive system be adopted, I am not sufficiently acquainted with {{the details of the}} subject to be able to <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>confidence.</b> It seems to be generally agreed, that, in the actual state of things, a price of about eighty shillings a quarter(19*) would prevent our cultivation from falling back, and perhaps allow it to be progressive. But, in future, we should endeavour, if possible, to avoid all discussions about the necessity of protecting the British farmer, and securing to him a fair living profit. Such language may perhaps be allowable in a crisis like the present. But certainly the legislature {{has nothing to do with}} securing to any classes of its subjects a particular rate of profits in their different trades. This is not the province of a government; and it is unfortunate that any language should be used which may convey such an impression, and make people believe that their rulers ought to listen to the accounts of their gains and losses.|$|R

60|$|The British {{losses at}} the battle of Nooitgedacht {{amounted}} to 60 killed, 180 wounded, and 315 prisoners, all of whom were delivered up a few days later at Rustenburg. Of the Boer losses it is, as usual, impossible to <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>confidence,</b> but all the evidence points to their actual casualties being as heavy as those of the British. There was the long struggle at the camp in which they were heavily punished, the fight on the mountain, where they exposed themselves with unusual recklessness, and the final shelling from shrapnel and from lyddite. All accounts agree that their attack was more open than usual. 'They were mowed down in twenties that day, but it had no effect. They stood like fanatics,' says one who fought against them. From first to last their conduct was most gallant, and great credit is due to their leaders for the skilful sudden concentration by which they threw their whole strength upon the exposed force. Some eighty miles separate Warm Baths from Nooitgedacht, and it seems strange that our Intelligence Department should have remained in ignorance of so large a movement.|$|R
