50|$|Each fighter has a {{different}} <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> that can be upgraded or changed. There are also the side-weapon pick-ups including a pair of homing lasers, diagonal firing napalm and missiles.|$|E
5000|$|The single-bullet {{theory as}} {{proposed}} by the House Select Committee on Assassinations and later by author Gerald Posner in his book Case Closed (which {{is that the first}} shot missed and the second shot passed through both the President and the Governor) has also been criticised {{on the grounds that it}} does not fit the <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> recalled by most of the witnesses (which was: first shot, a longish pause and then two shots in rapid succession, the second shot being after the midpoint between the first and last shots). The Warren Commission remarked on the [...] "substantial majority" [...] of witnesses who recalled that the shots were not evenly spaced but did not attribute much significance to the <b>shot</b> <b>pattern.</b> If the first shot occurred after frame 150 of the Zapruder film, the second shot could not have occurred before frame 240 in order to have a <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> in which the last two shots were noticeably closer together (the head shot obviously occurred between frames 312 and 313).|$|E
30|$|In this article, {{we present}} {{something}} of a twisted tale. We first give a short background concerning fractal (fractional) analysis of time series vectors, {{with an emphasis on}} those related to the <b>shot</b> <b>patterns</b> of popular movies. We then move on to six empirical studies.|$|R
50|$|Using a jump <b>shot</b> <b>patterned</b> {{after what}} she saw in {{televised}} professional games, Blazejowski {{became one of the}} greatest scorers in the history of women's basketball, although she didn't begin serious competition until her senior year at Cranford High School in Cranford, New Jersey.|$|R
50|$|Current Citoris feature {{screw-in}} Invector choke tubes {{to regulate}} <b>shot</b> <b>patterns</b> downrange and thus provide versatility for usage in hunting and target shooting. These {{can be used}} with either lead, bismuth, or steel shot. Older models had factory fixed chokes, and steel shot is not recommended for use with those.|$|R
50|$|Power ups are {{available}} in the form of small pink pods on the ground which when shot release a coloured orb into the air, which can do one of the following: make Mutron-kun very large and invincible for a short period, transform Mutron-kun into multiple creatures, award extra points or grant increased fire power in a scatter <b>shot</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Players had {{a typical}} vulcan weapon {{that could be}} {{upgraded}} three times {{in order for the}} <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> to widen. Players also had an unlimited amount of ground force bombs that would increase in firing speed with the vulcan. The player's bomb weapon was a weapon called [...] "The Forcer" [...] that fired a large fireball straight forward.|$|E
50|$|A recent {{innovation}} is the back-boring of barrels, {{in which the}} barrels are bored out slightly larger than their actual gauge. This reduces the compression forces on the shot when it transitions from the chamber to the barrel. This leads to a slight reduction in perceived recoil, and an improvement in <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> due to reduced deformation of the shot.|$|E
50|$|Some newer 12 gauge and 20 gauge Citori {{models have}} back-bored barrels. These are barrels with {{slightly}} larger bore diameters. Their {{purpose is to}} improve <b>shot</b> <b>patterns</b> by reducing the friction of the shot charge on the barrel wall, while also reducing felt recoil. Models with back-bored barrels use Invector Plus choke tubes.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary reason}} that the pattern is altered is because cutting {{off the end of}} the barrel removes the choke, which {{generally}} only extends about two inches (about 5 cm) inward from the muzzle. This results in a cylinder bore, which causes the widest spread generally found in shotgun barrels. (See choke {{for more information on the}} impact of chokes. See shotgun shell for information on spreader loads.) See details on <b>shot</b> <b>patterning.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In practice, steel <b>shot</b> <b>{{patterns}}</b> {{as much as}} two chokes tighter for a given {{amount of}} constriction. In other words, a choke that patterns [...] "Modified" [...] with lead or bismuth shot would give a [...] "Full" [...] <b>pattern</b> with steel <b>shot.</b> To avoid excessive wear or grooving from occurring within chokes when shooting steel shot, many manufacturers recommend avoiding shooting steel shot in any chokes marked tighter than [...] "Modified", unless the choke tube is specifically marked as being safe for use with steel shot.|$|R
5000|$|Lead shot dropped {{quickly into}} liquid cooling baths when being {{produced}} from molten lead {{is known as}} [...] "chilled lead shot", in contrast to [...] "soft lead shot" [...] which is produced by molten lead not being dropped as quickly into a liquid cooling bath. The process of rapidly chilling lead shot during its manufacturing process causes the shot to become harder than it would otherwise be if allowed to cool more slowly. Hence, chilled lead shot, being harder {{and less likely to}} deform during firing, is preferred by shotgunners for improving <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> densities at longer (> 30 yard) ranges, whereas soft lead shot, being softer and more likely to deform during firing, is preferred for improving <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> densities at very close (< 20 yard) ranges as the softer and now deformed shot scatters more quickly when fired. Soft lead shot is also more readily deformed during the firing process by the effects of chokes.|$|E
50|$|Oval chokes, {{which are}} {{designed}} to provide a <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> wider than it is tall, are sometimes found on combat shotguns, primarily those of the Vietnam War era. They were available for aftermarket addition in the 1970s from companies like A & W Engineering. Military versions of the Ithaca 37 with duckbill choke were used in limited numbers during the Vietnam War by US Navy Seals. It arguably increased effectiveness in close range engagements against multiple targets. Two major disadvantages plagued the system. One was erratic patterning. The second was that the shot would spread too quickly providing a limited effective zone.|$|E
50|$|One {{significant}} {{advantage that}} doubles have over single barrel repeating shotguns {{is the ability}} to provide access to more than one choke at a time. Some shotgun sports, such as skeet, use crossing targets presented in a narrow range of distance, and only require one level of choke. Others, like sporting clays, give the shooter targets at differing ranges, and targets that might approach or recede from the shooter, and so must be engaged at differing ranges. Having two barrels lets the shooter use a more open choke for near targets, and a tighter choke for distant targets, providing the optimal <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> for each distance.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{conventional}} scrolling shooter. Your {{mission is to}} penetrate a hostile communist military force situated inside Russian territory. The player takes control of a Harrier fighter jet with two types of main weapons. The first type can only shoot flying opponents, such as enemy planes and copters; the second, a bomb-type weapon, can only hit ground enemies, such as tanks and turrets. The player can also acquire escorts to increase firepower. Changing {{the formation of the}} escort fighters results in different <b>shot</b> <b>patterns</b> and also affects the maneuvering speed.|$|R
30|$|Fractal {{patterns}} are seemingly everywhere. They {{can be analyzed}} through Fourier and power analyses, and other methods. Cutting, DeLong, and Nothelfer (2010) analyzed as time-series data the fluctuations of shot durations in 150 popular movies released over 70 years. They found that these patterns had become increasingly fractal-like and concluded {{that they might be}} linked to those found in the results of psychological tasks involving attention. To explore this possibility further, we began by analyzing the <b>shot</b> <b>patterns</b> of almost twice as many movies released over a century. The increasing fractal-like nature of <b>shot</b> <b>patterns</b> is affirmed, as determined by both a slope measure and a long-range dependence measure, neither of which is sensitive to the vector lengths of their inputs within the ranges explored here. But the main reason for increased long-range dependence is related to, but not caused by, the increasing vector length of the shot-series samples. It appears that, in generating increasingly fractal-like patterns, filmmakers have systematically explored dimensions that are important for holding our attention—shot durations, scene durations, motion, and sound amplitude—and have crafted fluctuations in them like those of our endogenous attention patterns. Other dimensions—luminance, clutter, and shot scale—are important to film style but their variations seem not to be important to holding viewers’ moment-to-moment attention and have not changed in their fractional dimension over time.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, there isn’t even a {{significant}} interaction in the <b>shot</b> duration <b>patterns</b> between the silent movies and the contemporary sound movies of 1990 – 2015 (F[1, 8997][*]=[*] 2.52, p[*]>[*]. 10). Thus, {{there is a sense}} in which it took popular movies 60  years (from 1930 to 1990) to recapture the shot duration profile that silent movies seem to have had from 1915 to 1925. Nonetheless, one should be cautious inferring too much here. The silent era data are very noisy, sufficiently so that there was no reliable difference in <b>shot</b> duration <b>patterns</b> for the silent vs. the early sound movies either (F[*]<[*] 1).|$|R
50|$|In December 1874, {{the first}} mention of Greener's choke bore {{appeared}} {{in an article}} by J.H. Walsh, the editor of Field magazine. The article mentioned the extraordinary <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> that the Greener shotgun could produce. The next issue came with an advertisement from Greener, stating that the firm would guarantee that their new guns would shoot a closer pattern than any other manufacturer. The advertisement claimed that Greener 12 bores were warranted to shoot an average pattern of 210, when the best 12 bore gun in the London Gun Trial of 1866 could only average 127. Naturally, the advertisement generated considerable controversy, especially from rival manufacturers of cylinder guns, who refused to believe the numbers quoted in the advertisement.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shooting}} occurred {{sometime during}} the two-mile trek through the desert. Clarence Burleson saw the two internees wander off of the road. According to the official report, Burleson shouted [...] "Halt!" [...] twice before shooting both of the men with a shotgun at about thirty-yards away. The coroner later found nine pellets each in the middle left portion of their backs, and since the <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> was not very wide it was {{an indication that the}} shooting occurred at close range. It was also revealed that the two men had asked the guards to use a restroom, but the guards said no. This suggested that the victims may have walked off the road to relieve themselves.|$|E

40|$|Structural information, on {{the form}} of <b>shot</b> <b>patterns</b> and timing, plays an {{important}} role in scripted video, being consistently used by filmmakers as a way to convey meaning and significance into their work. For this reason, a video retrieval system can benefit from exploiting this kind of information. In this paper we propose a novel method for the retrieval of video scenes according to their structural similarity, based on graph-theoretical measures and vector quantization techniques. We show the results of our method in some scene retrieval experiments on a data set of 802 movie scenes, extracted from a set of 180 mainstream movies...|$|R
5000|$|The {{exit end}} of a choke is smaller by some {{dimension}} than the actual bore of the barrel. This difference in diameter {{is the amount of}} constriction. For example, for a 12 gauge, the bore diameter of the barrel is nominally 0.729 inches (1.85 cm), although different manufacturers do vary their as-manufactured bore from this diameter slightly. This is commonly called [...] "overbore", when the as-built diameter exceeds the nominal actual diameter of 0.729 inches (1.85 cm). The advantages touted for [...] "overbore" [...] are a perceived reduction in recoil, and a lessened shot deformation for improving <b>shot</b> <b>patterns.</b>|$|R
40|$|Activities {{carried out}} during this {{reporting}} period are summarized. Much {{of the work}} undertaken involved additions to the space-based coherent lidar model, including the addition of performance {{as a function of}} altitude; a receiver design section; the development of a simple orbit model suitable for use in plotting orbits, swath and <b>shot</b> <b>patterns</b> and estimating power availability; and the inclusion of Fascode derived atmospheric extinction. Assistance was also given to NASA MSFC in the design and analysis of lidar instruments, both for the AEOLUS conceptual designs within MSFC (one such analysis is included in an appendix) and of proposed NASA MSFC instruments for the New Millennium Program...|$|R
5000|$|A rifled slug, with finned rifling {{designed}} {{to enable the}} projectile to be safely fired through a choked barrel, {{is an example of}} a single projectile. Some shotguns have rifled barrels and are {{designed to}} be used with a [...] "saboted" [...] bullet, one which is typically encased in a two-piece plastic ring (sabot) designed to peel away after it exits the barrel, leaving the bullet, now spinning after passing through the rifled barrel, to continue toward the target. These shotguns, although they have rifled barrels, still use a shotgun-style shell instead of a rifle cartridge and may in fact still fire regular multipellet shotgun shells, but the rifling in the barrel will affect the <b>shot</b> <b>pattern.</b> The use of a rifled barrel blurs the distinction between rifle and shotgun, and in fact the early rifled shotgun barrels went by the name Paradox for just that reason. Hunting laws may differentiate between smooth barreled and rifled barreled guns.|$|E
5000|$|For {{shotguns}} with fixed chokes {{integral to}} the barrel, it is sometimes still possible to change the choke to a tighter choke. This is done by increasing {{the diameter of the}} bore inside the barrel for a short length of barrel, while the portion of the barrel and bore nearest the muzzle is left as it was. The effect is to form what is called a [...] "jug choke" [...] or a [...] "reverse choke". [...] This method is sometimes used by gunsmiths to implement a tighter choke on an existing gun without replaceable chokes, and can be done without requiring replacement of a barrel and without installing new screw-in replaceable chokes. Advantages claimed for a [...] "jug choke" [...] include improved patterns, reduction of recoil, and an increase of choke in a shotgun that does not have replaceable choke tubes. When a [...] "jug choke" [...] is implemented in an existing choked barrel, the bore inside the bored-out section of barrel effectively becomes [...] "overbored", and this also typically lessens the amount of shot deformation, thereby increasing the <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> density.|$|E
5000|$|A choke is {{designed}} to alter {{the distribution of the}} shot as it leaves the firearm. For shooting most game birds and clay pigeons, a desirable pattern is one that is as large as possible while being dense enough to ensure multiple hits on the target. Shotguns intended for defensive use often have cylinder or improved cylinder chokes for the widest <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> at typically short defensive ranges. The choke should be tailored to the range and size of the targets. A skeet shooter shooting at close targets might use [...] of constriction to produce a 30 inch cm diameter pattern at a distance of [...] A trap shooter shooting at distant targets might use [...] of constriction to produce a 30 inch cm diameter pattern at [...] Special chokes for turkey hunting, which requires long range shots at the small head and neck of the bird, can go as high as [...] The use of too much choke and a small pattern increases the difficulty of hitting the target; the use of too little choke produces large patterns with insufficient pellet density to reliably break targets or kill game. [...] "Cylinder barrels" [...] have no constriction.|$|E
40|$|Water-borne blast {{pressures}} from confined blasts were recorded {{as part of}} a submerged blasting program in Florida for channel deepening. The blasting was confined within the rock floor by stemming. <b>Shot</b> <b>patterns</b> of stemmed borings were recorded, as were two open-water shots. One hole of one shot was not confined properly, which allowed comparison of confined and a poorly confined larger charge weights per delay. The pressure data were intended to gain information on typical pressure measures from the rock removal program relative to impacts on marine organisms. Water-borne {{pressures from}} actual confined, rock-removal shots validate the hypothesis of lessened impacts to aquatic and marine biota...|$|R
2500|$|Both Stringer and Nochimson {{claim that}} Wong {{has one of}} the most {{distinctive}} filmmaking styles in the industry. From his first film As Tears Go By he made an impact with his [...] "liquid" [...] aesthetic, which Ungerböck claims was completely new and quickly copied in Asian film and television. His second film, Days of Being Wild, is described by Brunette as [...] "a landmark in Hong Kong cinema" [...] for its unconventional approach. Nochimson writes that Wong's films are entirely personal, making him an auteur, and states, [...] "Wong has developed his own cinematic vocabulary, with an array of <b>shot</b> <b>patterns</b> connected with him". Stringer argues that Wong's success demonstrates the importance of being [...] "different".|$|R
30|$|Moreover, and again, {{since the}} {{pattern in the}} post- 1960 movies was most {{critical}} to the conclusions of Cutting et al. (2010), we could simply assess the linear effects of release year and shot number on derived slope in those movies from 1965 to 2015. Together these account for 24 % {{of the variance in}} the data, but the effect of shot number is again substantial (t(189)[*]=[*] 5.89, p[*]<[*] 0.0001, d[*]=[*] 0.86), whereas that of release year is not (t(189)[*]=[*] 1.89, p[*]=[*] 0.06). Clearly, the evolution towards a 1 /f 1, or fractal, structure in the <b>shot</b> <b>patterns</b> of movies is reflected in more shots per movie in these data than in release years.|$|R
5000|$|Shot, {{small and}} round and {{delivered}} without spin, is ballistically inefficient. As the shot leaves the barrel {{it begins to}} disperse in the air. The resulting cloud of pellets {{is known as the}} <b>shot</b> <b>pattern,</b> or shotgun shot spread. The ideal pattern would be a circle with an even distribution of shot throughout, with a density sufficient to ensure enough pellets will intersect the target to achieve the desired result, such as a kill when hunting or a break when shooting clay targets. In reality the pattern is closer to a Gaussian, or normal distribution, with a higher density in the center that tapers off at the edges. Patterns are usually measured by firing at a 30 in diameter circle on a large sheet of paper placed at varying distances. The hits inside the circle are counted, and compared to the total number of pellets, and the density of the pattern inside the circle is examined. An [...] "ideal" [...] pattern would put nearly 100% of the pellets in the circle and would have no voids—any region where a target silhouette will fit and not cover 3 or more holes is considered a potential problem.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of the double, with double triggers or SST, is that a second shot can be taken almost immediately after the first, without removing the gun from the firing position on the shoulder and without any other action than a second trigger pull, utilizing different chokes for the two shots. (Assuming, of course, that full power shotshells are fired, at least for a double-barreled shotgun with an inertial type SST, as needed to toggle the inertial trigger.) This can be noticeably faster than a pump shotgun, which requires pumping to eject and reload for the second shot, and may be faster, or not slower, than a semi-automatic action. Note, however, in neither the pump or semi-automatic will the second shot be a different choke pattern from the first shot, whereas for a double, the two shots are usually with different chokes. Thus, depending {{on the nature of the}} hunt, the appropriate choke for the shot is always at hand. For example, while field hunting flushing birds, the first shot is usually closer than the second because the bird flies away from the shooter; so, the more open choke (and barrel) would be better for the first shot, and if a second shot is needed, as the bird is flying away, the more closed (and thus longer distance of an effective <b>shot</b> <b>pattern)</b> choke (and barrel) is then appropriate. Conversely, on a driven hunt, where the birds are driven towards the shooter, the closed (longer effective distance) choke (and barrel) should be fired first, saving the open (closer effective distance) choke (and barrel) for the now-closer incoming bird. None of this is possible with single-barrel shotguns, only with a double, whether SxS or O/U.|$|E
5000|$|For {{practical}} purposes, {{there are}} three types of shotguns if the shooter must have two shots in rapid succession, a requirement for American skeet. The types are: the pump gun, the automatic and a two barrel gun. Pumps operate {{with one hand on}} the grip and trigger, and the other on a sliding wooden or composite forearm. In turn, the forearm is attached to one or two bars that operate the action, both to load the chamber with the first round and to cycle the action after firing, putting another round in the chamber for the second shot. The power is supplied by the shooter pulling the forearm back and then pushing it forward: a process prone to error on the skeet field because it requires speed, consistency, and precision from the shooter. However, pumps are the least expensive repeating shotgun. Further, the pumping action, when well executed, is a joy to watch and a pleasure for the shooter. A semi-automatic gun has a fixed forearm: it relies on either the burning, expanding, gas from the first fired round, or the recoil from the same fired round, to cycle the action. Such a gun cycles [...] "automatically" [...] each time it is fired: ejecting the just fired, now empty, shell casing, and ramming a new round into the chamber for a second shot. One sees semi-automatics in tournaments, occasionally, now. They shoot well when clean, but are prone to jamming when dirty, when fouled by debris, or when there is something unusual about the rounds in gun. Just how prone to jamming varies by brand, design and shooter maintenance. They largely supplanted pump guns in skeet tournaments during the 1960s, because, even if they jam from time to time, semi-automatics still invite less error than all the activity the shooter must control with a pump gun. Further, semi-automatics usually offer a softer recoil, a real benefit given all the rounds fired in a skeet tournament. Automatics are most reliable with 12 ga. rounds, and are thus most used in the 12 ga. skeet events. [...] A two barrel gun is just that: two single shot barrels and hammer sets attached to the same receiver and trigger assembly. The barrels are attached to each other and are aimed to hit the same spot a given distance: say, 21 yards or so at skeet (though the <b>shot</b> <b>pattern</b> from both barrels will still be very close both before and after that yardage, because the barrels are very close together). The barrel set hinges {{on the bottom of the}} gun’s receiver and is locked in place by lever on top of the action. When the lever is pushed, it releases the barrels, allowing them to swing down from the hinge, exposing the chambers for each barrel. The shooter drops one round into each chamber and then swings the barrels back up, closing and locking the breech. The act of opening and closing the gun cocks both hammers, each of which are activated, in a modern gun, by a single trigger: once the action is closed, the gun will fire two shots as fast as a person can pull the trigger twice. A two barrel gun can have the two barrels side by side or one on top of the other (stacked). All serious skeet tournament two barrel guns are stacked (the narrow sighting picture is an advantage), and are most commonly referred to as [...] "over and under" [...] shotguns. Two barrel guns are the least fussy about ammunition and surest method of getting two fast shots from a shotgun. These guns also permit the shooter to recover every just-fired shotgun shell, to be reloaded and used again, a convenient and valuable characteristic.|$|E
50|$|A stage {{spanning}} all 8 levels {{including an}} extra bonus level. This mode is completely remade, different locations mixed into ones that remind {{of the classic}} ones but aren't the same. All the levels now carry the scars of a prolonged conflict, looking much more gritty and beat up. New enemies also come into play, as well as completely new attack formations and <b>shot</b> <b>patterns.</b> The frequency of enemy encounters is also multiplied compared to other Raidens. All of this along with the new rules and secrets make this a very, very different game than its predecessor. The extra level takes players above a cluster of floating icy planetoids and fight a boss tank. Good for skilled players.|$|R
