5|$|Her son was {{diagnosed}} with autism {{at the age of}} three. As Phua consulted professionals and did research on how to help him, she thought about how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> other autistic children. She subsequently founded WeCAN, a charity which helps caregivers of autistic people and offers early intervention programmes for autistic preschoolers.|$|E
5|$|Lépine {{sat for a}} time in {{the office}} of the {{registrar}} on the second floor. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|Publisher Jamie Byng of Canongate Books {{solicited}} author Margaret Atwood {{to write}} a novella re-telling a classic myth of her choice. Byng explained it would be published simultaneously in several languages {{as part of an}} international project called the Canongate Myth Series. Atwood agreed to help the rising young publisher by participating in the project. From her home in Toronto, the 64-year-old author made attempts at writing the Norse creation myth and a Native American story but struggled. After speaking with her British literary agent about canceling her contract, Atwood began thinking about the Odyssey. She had first read it as a teenager and remembered finding the imagery of Penelope's twelve maids being hanged in the denouement disturbing. Atwood believed the roles of Penelope and her maids during Odysseus' absence had been a largely neglected scholarly topic and that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> address it with this project.|$|E

He often praised the bravery of the fighters in the Battle of Jaji to his children, but never suggested that he had participated.|$|E
25|$|Allen {{retired in}} 1958, and Burns tried to soldier on without her. The show was renamed The George Burns Show {{with the cast}} intact except for Allen. The locale of the show was changed from the Burns home to George Burns' office, with Blanche Morton working as Burns' {{secretary}} so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> Allen {{keep an eye on}} him. Allen's absence was only too obvious and impossible to overcome. The renamed show barely lasted a year.|$|E
25|$|After the 1944 San Juan earthquake, Perón organises {{a charity}} concert at Luna Park {{to provide aid}} to the victims. Eva attends and briefly reunites with Magaldi, who spurns her for her past actions. Perón {{addresses}} the crowd with words of encouragement and leaps off the stage, meeting Eva {{as soon as he}} exits ("Charity Concert"). Eva and Perón share a secret rendezvous following the charity concert, where Eva hints that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> Perón rise to power ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You"). Eva dismisses Perón's Mistress (the character is known only by that title), who ponders the rejection ("Another Suitcase in Another Hall").|$|E

In May 2004, Simpson did a benefit concert to help the Skin Care Foundation. In March 2007, Simpson donated a new Chrysler minivan to the Elim orphanage in Nuevo Laredo. Simpson won a Chrysler Crossfire sports car at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, but exchanged the $50,000 luxury car for a minivan so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> the orphanage. Simpson is Soles4Souls's Ambassador where she participated in autographing shoes to donate the money from communities across the United States. Simpson also works with Make A Wish Foundation.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, aged 16, Kidman {{made her}} film debut in {{a remake of}} the Australian holiday season {{favourite}} Bush Christmas. By the end of 1983, she had a supporting role in the television series Five Mile Creek. In 1984, her mother {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer, which caused Kidman to halt her acting to work temporarily while she studied massage so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> her mother with physical therapy. She began gaining popularity in the mid-1980s after appearing in several film roles, including BMX Bandits (1983), Watch the Shadows Dance (1987 aka Nightmaster), and the romantic comedy Windrider (1986), which earned Kidman attention due to her racy scenes. Also during the decade, she appeared in several Australian productions, including the soap opera A Country Practice and the miniseries Vietnam (1986). She also made guest appearances on Australian television programs and TV movies.|$|E
500|$|Without {{definite}} {{plans for}} her future after Dartington, Imogen toured Europe, collecting music {{that she would}} later edit for performance, including madrigals by Carlo Gesualdo which she found [...] "very exciting". At home, although not formally employed by Britten, she worked with him on several projects, including a new performing version of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas and [...] {{the preparation of the}} vocal and full scores for Britten's opera Billy Budd. Pears, who had observed Imogen's overall contributions to musical life at Dartington, believed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> Britten and the Aldeburgh Festival on a more formal basis, and shortly after the 1952 festival Britten invited her to come and work with him. She agreed, and in September 1952 moved to lodgings in Aldeburgh.|$|E

500|$|Fortoul {{was often}} called to serve abroad in Japan and {{south-east}} Asia; between 1882 and 1885, {{he was in}} Tonkin in Indochina, returning home after being seriously injured. During his absence, in addition to raising her two boys, de Bourgoing wrote nearly 1,000 pages of letters to her husband, now preserved in her archive. After his injury, Fortoul was stationed in Castres, where he commanded the 3rd Artillery Regiment, until his sudden death {{from a heart attack}} in 1900. As both her sons, now grown, had embarked on military careers, de Bourgoing determined to study nursing, hoping <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> to [...] alleviate sickness and distress in France's colonies. That same year, she joined the first school opened to train nurses in Paris and was in the inaugural class of trainees.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was negatively received by Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture and Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail. In May 2009, Deller placed Charlie at number five on her list of worst soap opera characters segment. Deller said, [...] "The Summer Bay cop may {{have lots of}} storylines, but the LC community don't really approve – mainly due to Esther Anderson's apparent lack of acting chops. It's like our hatred for Michelle Connor (Coronation Street) all over again, only this time with added scandalous-headline-grabbing-faux-lesbianity!" [...] In July 2009, Deller said, [...] "It {{would be easy to}} spend every month slagging off Charlie, because there's so much to dislike". Deller also added that Charlie's daughter is [...] "everything Charlie isn't". Stephen wondered if Charlie is going through an early menopause as she always appears [...] "to be in a sweat onscreen." [...] During a storyline, which saw Charlie decide she needs a counsellor to find her self-identity, Stephen complained that it was all she seemed to mention since her [...] "foray into lesbianism." [...] Stephen did, however, agree that Charlie needed a counsellor. She also stated <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> by telling her; [...] "Charlie: you're a mess." [...] Stephen was critical of Charlie's relationship with Angelo, which she described as a [...] "rocky road". She wanted to know how much the show could [...] "wring out of their on/off romance" [...] and asked if somebody could send them out to sea in a sinking boat. Following Charlie and Angelo's 2011 break up, Stephen stated that the show needs to [...] "change the record!" ...|$|E
500|$|By the {{afternoon}} of Friday 8November, the newspapers' early editions carried photographs of the Lucans across their front pages, accompanied by headlines like [...] "Body in sack... countess runs out screaming", and [...] "Belgravia murder– earl sought". A meeting that day at the Clermont, between John Aspinall, Daniel Meinertzhagen, Charles Benson, Stephen Raphael, Bill Shand-Kydd, and Dominick Elwes, became the cause of much press speculation. Meinertzhagen and Raphael later insisted that the gathering was just a rational discussion between concerned friends, keen to share anything they knew about what had happened, but {{the relationship between the}} police and Lucan's social circle was strained; some officers complained that an [...] "Eton mafia" [...] worked against them. Susan Maxwell-Scott refused to add to her statement, and when Aspinall's mother, Lady Osborne, was asked if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> locate Lucan's body, she replied [...] "The last I heard of him, he was being fed to the tigers at my son's zoo", prompting the police to search the house and the animal cages there. They searched fourteen country houses and estates, including Holkham Hall and Warwick Castle, to no avail. Amidst concerns expressed by the Labour MP Marcus Lipton that some people were [...] "being a bit snooty" [...] with the police, Benson wrote a letter to The Times asking him to either identify those people or [...] "kindly withdraw his remarks". To their cost, Private Eye accused James Goldsmith of being at the Clermont meeting, when he was actually in Ireland. Dominic Elwes went to see Lady Lucan in hospital and was reportedly deeply shocked both by her appearance and her statement [...] "Who's the mad one now?" [...] Elwes was apparently unhappy at some of the negative press coverage of the countess, and was later ostracised by his friends for his part in an article critical of Lucan, which appeared in the Sunday Times Magazine. He committed suicide in September 1975.|$|E

500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{news article}} and video entitled, [...] "SF library offers Social Services to Homeless," [...] speaks about the San Francisco library having a {{full-time}} social worker {{at the library}} to reduce and help homeless patrons. It mentions that Leah Esguerra, who is a psychiatric social worker, has a usual routine which is done by making her rounds to different homeless patrons and greeting them to see if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> them. She offers help in different forms that could range from linking patrons with services or providing them with mental health counseling. She also supervises a 12-week vocational program that culminates in gainful employment in the library for the formerly homeless (Knight, 2010). The changes have garnered positive results from all patrons. Since this service started, staff at the library stated that they have noticed a drop in inappropriate behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Parker {{finds the}} cave {{mentioned}} by Demarion, {{but when he}} enters, he sees a strange light and his surroundings change. He emerges on Fetch Rock in 2004. The lighthouse is now a visitor center, although it has recently closed because of several [...] "incidents". Inside, Parker finds a book which explains that when the three keepers disappeared, Parker was blamed for their murder, as it was believed he killed them and then committed suicide. The chief witness in the case was Demarion, {{who claimed to have}} seen Parker heading to the lighthouse the night of the disappearance. Parker also finds correspondence from Polly White, a ghost hunter, who is convinced she is the reincarnation of Woolfe, and wants to come to the island to investigate. During regression hypnosis therapy, she claims there are four [...] "presences" [...] in the lighthouse, but the fourth presence [...] "doesn't exist in our time." [...] She claims Drake [...] "lost his soul" [...] after accidentally [...] "releasing the darkness" [...] in the basement. However, Parker encounters the spirit of Woolfe, who tells him he tricked Polly into coming because he thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> him and Shaw escape their entrapment. He now realises he was wrong to do so, and advises Parker to save himself and Polly.|$|E
