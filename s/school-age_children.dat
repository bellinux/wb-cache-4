The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) on behalf of his resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to {{conversations and}} {{engaging}} in conversation with others help <b>school-age</b> <b>children</b> develop vocabulary. Fast mapping {{is the process of}} learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.|$|E

5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in <b>school-age</b> <b>children.</b> It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E

5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in <b>school-age</b> <b>children</b> have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to <b>school-age</b> <b>children,</b> teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in <b>school-age</b> <b>children.</b> Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E

There are also preparatory schools for younger children, such as All Hallows, and Hazlegrove Preparatory School. Chilton Cantelo School offers places both to day pupils and boarders aged 7 to 16.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses data from a survey based in rural Bangladesh and considers ther children aged 5 – 17 years living in rural households in which the mother and father are both present. The sample size is 1628 children. A multinomial logit model is used to estimate the determinants of schooling and working, combining schooling and work, or doing nothing children. Findings – The results show that the education of parents significantly increases the probability that a <b>school-age</b> <b>child</b> will specialise in study. The presence of very young children (aged 0 - 4) in the household increases the likelihood that a <b>school-age</b> <b>child</b> will combine study with work. The significant and positive gender coefficient suggests that girls are more likely than boys to combine schooling with work. The children who are sons and daughters of the household-head, as opposed to being relatives living in the household are more likely to combine study and work but less likely to specialise in work...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} Bangladesh {{to examine the}} {{determinants}} of child labour and schooling. The theoretical framework adopted in this paper is a standard household production model that analyses the joint allocation of time within the household. Using Multinomial logit model, we then jointly estimate the determinants of schooling and working, combining schooling and work, or doing nothing for 5 - 17 year old children. Multinomial logit {{results show that the}} education of parents significantly increases the probability that a <b>school-age</b> <b>child</b> will specialise in study. Empirical results further show that if the father is employed in a vulnerable occupation, for example, day-labour or wage-labour, it raises the probability that a child will work full time or combine work and study. The presence of very young children (ages 0 - 4) in the household increases the likelihood that a <b>school-age</b> <b>child</b> will combine study with work. The significant and positive gender coefficient suggests that girls are more likely than boys to combine schooling with work.
