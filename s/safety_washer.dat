40|$|This {{work has}} the aim to {{evaluate}} the replacement of quenching and hardening thermal treatment by direct quenching of forged <b>safety</b> <b>washer</b> component, to ensure and to maintain the mechanical properties of the products associated with competitive manufacturing costs. Supporting that, a statistical tool was used to delineate the processing routes, and forging tests were conducted at industrial scale. The effect of the different processing routes on the forged product was investigated through Finite Element Method and metallurgical analysis of the final product. The results showed {{the viability of the}} direct quenching with technical and economical advantages, once the control of the process parameters are guaranteed...|$|E

50|$|The Holden HR {{range was}} {{released}} in April 1966, replacing the Holden HD series which had been in production since 1965. In addition to a revised grille, the HR featured a reworked roofline and larger rear window (on the sedans), revised rear lights (on sedans and wagons) and changes to almost all exterior body panels.Other changes included revised ball joint front suspension, widened track, improved interior trim and woodgrain interior finish for the Premier models. Six months after {{the launch of the}} HR, all models were given a safety upgrade with the addition of front <b>safety</b> belts, windscreen <b>washers,</b> reversing lights, sunvisors and a shatterproof interior rearview mirror.|$|R
