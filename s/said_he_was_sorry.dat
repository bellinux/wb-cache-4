2500|$|President Lyndon B. Johnson {{ignored the}} report and {{rejected}} the Kerner Commission's recommendations. In April 1968, {{one month after the}} release of the Kerner report, rioting broke out in more than 100 cities following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. [...] However, in New York City, Lindsay traveled directly into Harlem, telling black residents that he regretted King's death and was working against poverty. He is credited with averting riots in New York with this direct response, even as other major cities burned. David Garth, who accompanied Lindsay that night, recalled: [...] "There was a wall of people coming across 125th Street, going from west to east... I thought we were dead. John raised his hands, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry.</b> It was very quiet. My feeling was, his appearance there was very reassuring to people because it wasn't the first time they had seen him. He had gone there on a regular basis. That gave him credibility when it hit the fan." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{possibility}} of having sent a messenger {{in advance to}} advise Miss Mayfield of his projected visit did not strike Jeff as ridiculous. Your true lover is far beyond such trivialities. He accepted the rebuke meekly. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry.</b>|$|E

Williamson spoke to Dick {{as if he had}} not seen him since he came, and Dick <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> he wasn't able to meet him at the station. In fact, they rather overdid it; and Staffer seemed to think so, because he stopped them. Then, perhaps, because he felt relieved, Dick--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He hasn't done anything--it isn't for that. Master don't want to sell; but he owes {{this man}} money.

60|$|Tuppy <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry.</b> Aunt Dahlia, with a deathbed groan, said it didn't matter.

60|$|The {{merchant}} <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry,</b> {{but if she}} was {{not going}} home he supposed he would have to find some one who was.

I asked him {{to see to it that}} the buttons were sewn on firmly, and that the stitching everywhere was perfect, adding that the last gloves my wife had had of his firm had been most unsatisfactory. Jane had impressed upon me to add that. She said it would make them more careful.|$|E
5000|$|Basketball star Charles Barkley <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> {{agreed with}} the verdict.

60|$|One day {{he came to}} school, in the afternoon, {{and found}} the room filled with smoke; {{the doors and windows}} were all closed, though, as soon as he came in, some of the boys opened them. He knew by this circumstance, that it was roguery, not accident, which caused the smoke. He {{appeared}} not to notice it, however, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> it smoked, and asked the mischievous boy, for he was sure to be always near in such a case, to help him fix the fire. The boy supposed it was understood to be accidental, and perhaps secretly laughed at the dulness of his master.|$|E
