5|$|Lactarius sanguifluus is {{classified}} in the section Dapetes of the genus Lactarius. This section, which also includes other popular edible species such as L.deliciosus, and the less popular L.deterrimus, is characterized by mushrooms with orange or red latex that often impart a greenish <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flesh and gills, an often sticky cap, and association with conifers. The specific epithet sanguifluus {{is derived from the}} Latin words sanguis ("blood") and fluus ("flowing").|$|E
25|$|So flawed is this Resolution {{that only}} its {{effective}} repeal by the General Assembly can provide {{any hope of}} expunging the <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> U.N.’s escutcheon in the international system. Taiwan partially adopted this strategy, and attempted to begin a debate on the repeal of Resolution 2758 during the Fifty-Second General Assembly. Although turned aside in 1997 by the P.R.C.’s energetic diplomatic lobbying, {{the issue of the}} R.O.C.’s status at the U.N. will not disappear.|$|E
25|$|The FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC {{is named}} the J. Edgar Hoover Building, after Hoover. Because of the {{controversial}} nature of Hoover's legacy, there have been periodic proposals to rename it by legislation proposed by both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate. For example, in 2001 Senator Harry Reid sponsored an amendment to strip Hoover's name from the building. Reid said J. Edgar Hoover's name on the FBI building is a <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> building. The Senate did not adopt the amendment.|$|E

25|$|Sin is not {{viewed by}} the Orthodox as a <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soul {{that needs to be}} wiped out, or a legal {{transgression}} that must be set right by a punitive sentence, but rather as a mistake made by the individual with the opportunity for spiritual growth and development. An act of Penance (epitemia), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic, but rather is directed toward the individual and their particular problem, as a means of establishing {{a deeper understanding of the}} mistake made, and how to effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants, it is not unusual for even small children to confess; though the scope of their culpability is far less than an older child, still their opportunity for spiritual growth remains the same.|$|E
25|$|An {{incident}} {{regarding the}} character of Sidney Dillon (or William S. Paley) is then discussed between Jonesy and Mrs. Coolbirth. Sidney Dillon {{is said to have}} told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (Babe Paley) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself at which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife, it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together, and afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large blood <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sheets, which represents her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends {{the rest of the night}} and early morning manually washing the sheet with scalding water in an attempt to conceal his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning. In the end, Dillon falls asleep on a damp sheet and wakes up to a note from his wife telling him she had arrived while he was sleeping, did not want to wake him, and that she would see him at home.|$|E
500|$|Thomas of Marlborough, {{who knew}} Norreis, {{wrote that he}} was [...] "everywhere {{condemned}} as the manifest enemy of God". More modern writers echo the sentiment. John Moorman described Norreis as a man [...] "totally unsuited to the delicate and responsible task of ruling over a company of men and directing the affairs of a wealthy corporation". David Knowles, a historian of English monasticism, wrote that Norreis was [...] "utterly unworthy to hold spiritual office of any kind", and that Baldwin's appointment of him as prior at Christ Church [...] "must always remain a dark <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> archbishop's reputation". Knowles also noted that he was [...] "a man of great practical ability". Even Thomas of Marlborough noted that Norreis was energetic, entertaining, and full of enterprise.|$|E

The episode was his third {{contribution}} after the first season entry [...] "The Alliance" [...] and second-season episode [...] "Office Olympics". B. J. Novak later noted that, compared to Schur's previous episode [...] "The Alliance", the [...] "driving force of the mayhem" [...] in the episode is Michael's desire to make all of his workers [...] "happy", rather than him being [...] "a jerk". The scene wherein Dwight plugs the Christmas tree in, only for the office to be underwhelmed by the dismal lights {{was based on a}} real moment Schur and his wife experienced during their first Christmas together. Schur based the Christmas party sequences on a scene in Rushmore that happens after the main character does his Vietnam play. He noted that he wanted it to be [...] "pastiche-y" [...] and feature [...] "small groups of people talking to each other". Meredith flashing Michael was based on a real-life experience Greg Daniels's dad had at a former job; {{at the end of one}} particular Christmas party, there was a <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> office couch, which he called an [...] "inappropriate ending" [...] for the party. Daniels's father kept pressuring him to make a Christmas episode of The Office, and so Daniels utilized this experience.|$|E
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying {{on the table in front}} of him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
500|$|The most {{dramatic}} deterioration has {{been caused by}} biological factors. It used to be thought that {{the depths of the}} ocean were a lifeless desert, but research carried out since the mid-1980s has found that the ocean floor is teeming with life and may rival the tropical rainforests for biodiversity. During the 1991 IMAX expedition, scientists were surprised by the variety of organisms that they found in and around Titanic. A total of 28 species were observed, including sea anemones, crabs, shrimp, starfish, and rattail fish up to a yard (1 m) long. Much larger creatures have been glimpsed by explorers. Some of Titanics fauna has never been seen anywhere else; James Cameron's 2001 expedition discovered a previously unknown type of sea cucumber, lavender with a glowing row of phosphorescent [...] "portholes" [...] along its side. A newly discovered species of rust-eating bacterium found on the ship has been named Halomonas titanicae, which has been found to cause rapid decay of the wreck. Henrietta Mann, who discovered the bacteria, has estimated that the Titanic will completely collapse possibly as soon as 2025. The Canadian geophysicist Steve Blasco has commented that the wreck [...] "has become an oasis, a thriving ecosystem sitting in a vast desert." [...] In mid 2016, using an imaging technique neutron radiation, the facilities of the Institut Laue-Langevin demonstrate that a molecule called ectoine is used by [...] Halomonas titanicae to survive the osmotic pressure that causes salt water on their membranes. Analysis by Henrietta Mann and Bhavleen Kaur, both of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in conjunction with other scientists and researchers of the University of Seville in Spain, has determined that the wreck of Titanic will not exist by 2037 and that preservation of Titanic is impossible. [...] "Unfortunately, because Titanic is 2.3 miles down, it is very difficult or impossible to preserve. It is film which will preserve it for history now," [...] says Mann. [...] "It has already lasted for 100 years, but eventually there will be nothing left but a rust <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the Atlantic... I think Titanic has maybe 15 or 20 years left. I don't think it will have too much longer than that." [...] Other scientists have estimated that Titanic will last no longer than 14 years, as of 2017.|$|E

Kimmel picked the bullet up off the floor and murmured, more to himself than to Curts, [...] "It would have been merciful had it killed me."

2500|$|According {{to several}} sources, {{one of the}} results of this conference was the German Ausserordentliche Befriedungsaktion (see: German AB Action {{operation}} in Poland), elimination of Krakow intelligentsia Sonderaktion Krakau and the Soviet Katyn massacre In his 1991 book Stalin: Breaker of Nations, British historian Robert Conquest stated: [...] "Terminal horror suffered by so many millions of innocent Jewish, Slavic, and other European peoples {{as a result of this}} meeting of evil minds is an indelible <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> history and integrity of Western civilization, with all of its humanitarian pretensions". Also, Professor George Watson of Cambridge University concluded in his [...] "Rehearsal for the Holocaust?" [...] commentary (June 1981) that the fate of the interned Polish officers may have been decided at this conference. This is however disputed by other historians, who point out that there is no documentary evidence confirming any cooperation on that issue, that the existing Soviet documentation actually makes such a cooperation improbable and that it is reasonable to say that Germany did not know about the Katyn massacre until the mass graves were analysed by the Katyn Commission.|$|E

Tutu claimed that arguments being made in Britain and the United States were similar to those the South African apartheid regime had used. [...] "It is disgraceful and one cannot find strong enough words to condemn what Britain and the United States and some of their allies have accepted," [...] said Tutu. Tutu also spoke against Tony Blair's failed attempt to hold terrorist suspects in Britain for up to 90 days without charge. [...] "Ninety days for a South African is an awful déjà-vu because we had in South Africa in the bad old days a 90-day detention law," [...] he said.

2500|$|The Irish Independent said [...] "Meath's Leinster Final goal-that-never-was {{will go down}} {{in history}} – and not only in Ireland, since by now the images have flashed round the world – among the great injustices {{suffered}} in any sport". The Irish Times described [...] "ugly scenes", with Damian Cullen calling it [...] "one of the strangest endings ever to a GAA match", Seán Moran describing it as [...] "the most extraordinary refereeing error since Jimmy Cooney whistled up early 12 years ago", and the newspaper publishing numerous letters on the topic from disgruntled members of the public every day that week. The same newspaper's Philip Reid remarked upon the coincidence that these events had occurred on the same day as the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final in South Africa, wondered why goal-line technology could not be used and added: [...] "On this point, it would appear, the GAA and FIFA have something in common: they live in the times of the dinosaur". The events in Croke Park led to less prominent newspaper coverage of the FIFA World Cup Final itself the next day. The incident surrounding the goal was likened to Thierry Henry's illegal handball in the France vs Republic of Ireland 2010 FIFA World Cup play-off. Public service broadcaster RTÉ referred to [...] "disgraceful scenes". The GAA website's official match report brushed aside the controversy, saying Sheridan had [...] "smuggled the ball over the line". Eugene McGee, writing in the Irish Independent, said [...] "It will be a <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> good name of the GAA if this result is allowed to stand".
