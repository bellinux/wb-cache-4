5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator <b>satiation</b> is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
25|$|Pharaoh ants have a {{sophisticated}} strategy for food preference. They implement two related behaviors. The first {{is known as}} <b>satiation.</b> The workers will at first show a strong preference for a particular food type. However, if this food is offered alone, with no other options, for several weeks, workers will afterward show a distinct preference for {{a different type of}} food. In this way, the ants become satiated on a certain food group and will change their decision. The second behavior is called alternation. If given the continuous choice between food groups, pharaoh ants will tend to alternate between carbohydrate-rich foods and protein-rich foods. These <b>satiation</b> and alternation behaviors are evolutionarily adaptive. The decision to vary the type of food consumed ensures that the colony maintains a balanced diet.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting {{is due to}} gastric stasis (large volume vomiting, brief nausea {{relieved}} by vomiting, oesophageal reflux, epigastric fullness, early <b>satiation),</b> besides direct action on the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, the vomiting centre of the brain. Vomiting can thus be prevented by prokinetic agents (e.g. domperidone or metoclopramide). If vomiting has already started, these drugs need to be administered by a non-oral route (e.g. subcutaneous for metoclopramide, rectally for domperidone).|$|E
25|$|This species {{engages in}} {{trophallaxis}} with the larvae. Regardless of the attributes {{and conditions of}} each larva, they are fed roughly {{the same amount of}} liquid food. The rate of trophallaxis may increase with larval food deprivation, but such increase depends on the size of each larva. Larvae that are fed regularly tend to be given small amounts. To reach <b>satiation,</b> all larvae regardless of their size generally require the equivalent of eight hours of feeding.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral {{treatments}} target {{sexual arousal}} to children, using <b>satiation</b> and aversion techniques to suppress sexual arousal {{to children and}} covert sensitization (or masturbatory reconditioning) to increase sexual arousal to adults. Behavioral treatments appear {{to have an effect}} on sexual arousal patterns during phallometric testing, but it is not known whether the effect represents changes in sexual interests or changes in the ability to control genital arousal during testing, nor whether the effect persists in the long term. For sex offenders with mental disabilities, applied behavior analysis has been used.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{circuits}} in {{the brain}} stem are able to control acceptance or rejection of sweet or bitter foods, and can be modulated by <b>satiation</b> or physiological hunger signals. Signals from the tongue, stomach, small intestine and liver are received by the area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract, which then send information to many regions of the forebrain that control food intake. The lateral hypothalamus contains two sets of neurons that increase eating and decrease metabolic rate by secreting the peptides orexin and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH). Neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the lateral hypothalamus induces ravenous eating; neurons that secrete NPY are targeted by ghrelin in the hypothalamus. Leptin desensitizes the brain to hunger signals and inhibits NPY-secreting neurons.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, a {{motivating}} {{operation that}} causes {{a decrease in}} the effectiveness of a reinforcer, or diminishes a learned behavior related to the reinforcer, functions as an abolishing operation, AO. Again using the example of food, <b>satiation</b> of food prior to the presentation of a food stimulus would produce a decrease on food-related behaviors, and diminish or completely abolish the reinforcing effect of acquiring and ingesting the food. Consider the board of a large investment bank, concerned with a too small profit margin, deciding to give the CEO a new incentive package in order to motivate him to increase firm profits. If the CEO already has a lot of money, the incentive package might not be a very good way to motivate him, because he would be satiated on money. Getting even more money wouldn't be a strong reinforcer for profit-increasing behavior, and wouldn't elicit increased intensity, frequency or duration of profit-increasing behavior.|$|E
500|$|While {{dopamine}} has {{a central}} role in mediating [...] "wanting" [...] — associated with the appetitive or approach behavioral responses to rewarding stimuli, detailed studies have shown that dopamine cannot simply be equated with hedonic [...] "liking" [...] or pleasure, as reflected in the consummatory behavioral response. Dopamine neurotransmission is involved in some but not all aspects of pleasure-related cognition, since pleasure centers have been identified both within the dopamine system (i.e., nucleus accumbens shell) and outside the dopamine system (i.e., ventral pallidum and parabrachial nucleus). [...] For example, direct electrical stimulation of dopamine pathways, using electrodes implanted in the brain, is experienced as pleasurable, and many types of animals are willing to work to obtain it. Antipsychotic drugs used to treat psychosis reduce dopamine levels and tend to cause anhedonia, a diminished ability to experience pleasure. Many types of pleasurable experiences—such as sex, enjoying food, or playing video games—increase dopamine release. All addictive drugs directly or indirectly affect dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens; these drugs increase drug [...] "wanting", leading to compulsive drug use, when repeatedly taken in high doses, presumably through the sensitization of incentive-salience. Drugs that increase synaptic dopamine concentrations include psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. These produce increases in [...] "wanting" [...] behaviors, but do not greatly alter expressions of pleasure or change levels of <b>satiation.</b> However, opiate drugs such as heroin or morphine produce increases in expressions of [...] "liking" [...] and [...] "wanting" [...] behaviors. Moreover, animals in which the ventral tegmental dopamine system has been rendered inactive do not seek food, and will starve to death if left to themselves, but if food is placed in their mouths they will consume it and show expressions indicative of pleasure.|$|E
2500|$|The feeling {{has been}} evoked through {{semantic}} <b>satiation.</b> Chris Moulin of the University of Leeds asked 95 volunteers {{to write the}} word [...] "door" [...] 30 times in 60 seconds. 68 percent of the subjects reported symptoms of jamais vu, with some beginning to doubt that [...] "door" [...] was a real word.|$|E
2500|$|... {{development}} {{is related to}} its unique {{physical and chemical properties}} that aid in early signals of <b>satiation</b> and enhanced or prolonged signals of satiety. Early signals of <b>satiation</b> may be induced through cephalic- and gastric-phase responses related to the bulking effects of dietary fiber on energy density and palatability, whereas the viscosity-producing effects of certain fibers may enhance satiety through intestinal-phase events related to modified gastrointestinal function and subsequent delay in fat absorption. In general, fiber-rich diets, whether achieved through fiber supplementation or incorporation of high fiber foods into meals, have a reduced energy density compared with high fat diets. This is related to fiber’s ability to add bulk and weight to the diet. There are also indications that women may be more sensitive to dietary manipulation with fiber than men. The relationship of body weight status and fiber effect on energy intake suggests that obese individuals {{may be more likely to}} reduce food intake with dietary fiber inclusion.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{of these}} factors serve {{biological}} functions. [...] For example, the process of <b>satiation</b> helps the organism maintain a stable internal environment (homeostasis). When an organism has been deprived of sugar, for example, the taste of sugar is a highly effective reinforcer. However, when the organism's blood sugar reaches or exceeds an optimum level the taste of sugar becomes less effective, perhaps even aversive.|$|E
2500|$|Epicurus' {{philosophy}} {{is based on}} the theory that all good and bad derive from the sensations of what he defined as pleasure and pain: What is good is what is pleasurable, and what is bad is what is painful. His ideas of pleasure and pain were ultimately, for Epicurus, the basis for the moral distinction between good and evil. If pain is chosen over pleasure in some cases it is only because it leads to a greater pleasure. Although Epicurus has been commonly misunderstood to advocate the rampant pursuit of pleasure, his teachings were more about striving for an absence of pain and suffering, both physical and mental, and a state of <b>satiation</b> and tranquillity that was free of the fear of death and the retribution of the gods. Epicurus argued that when we do not suffer pain, we are no longer in need of pleasure, and we enter a state of ataraxia, [...] "tranquillity of soul" [...] or [...] "imperturbability".|$|E
2500|$|Psychiatrist Ernst Simmel first defined {{primordial}} narcissism in 1944. [...] Simmel's fundamental {{thesis is}} that the most primitive stage of libidinal development is not the oral, but the gastrointestinal one. Mouth and anus are merely to be considered as the terminal parts of this organic zone. Simmel terms the psychological condition of prenatal existence [...] "primordial narcissism." [...] It is the vegetative stage of the pre-ego, identical with the id. At this stage there is complete instinctual repose, manifested in unconsciousness. <b>Satiation</b> of the gastrointestinal zone, {{the representative of the}} instinct of self-preservation, can bring back this complete instinctual repose, which, under pathological conditions, can become the aim of the instinct. Contrary to Lasch, Bernard Stiegler argues in his book, Acting Out, that consumer capitalism is in fact destructive of what he calls primordial narcissism, without which {{it is not possible to}} extend love to others. In other words, he is referring to the natural state of an infant as a fetus and in the first few days of its life, before it has learned that other people exist besides itself, and therefore cannot possibly be aware that they are human beings with feelings, rather than having anything to do with actual narcissism.|$|E
2500|$|So Durvasa and {{his disciples}} visited the Pandavas in their hermitage in the forest, as per Duryodhana's request. During {{this period of}} exile, the Pandavas would obtain their food {{by means of the}} Akshaya Patra, which would become {{exhausted}} each day once Draupadi finished her meal. Because Draupadi had already eaten by the time Durvasa arrived that day, there was no food left to serve him and the Pandavas were very anxious as to their fate should they fail to feed such a venerable sage. While Durvasa and his disciples were away bathing at the river, Draupadi prayed to Krishna for help. Krishna immediately appeared before Draupadi saying he was extremely hungry and asked her for food. Draupadi grew exasperated and said she had prayed to Krishna precisely because she had no food left to give. Krishna then told her to bring the Akshaya Patra to him. When she did, he partook of the lone grain of rice and piece of vegetable that he found stuck to the vessel and announced that he was satisfied by the [...] "meal". This satiated the hunger of Durvasa and his disciples, as the satisfaction of Krishna (the Supreme Being who pervades the entire universe) meant the <b>satiation</b> of the hunger of all living things. Sage Durvasa and his disciples then quietly left after their bath, without returning to the Pandavas' hermitage, for they were afraid of facing what they thought would be the Pandavas' wrathful reaction at their impolite behaviour of refusing the food that would be served to them.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Walter Brueggemann, {{formerly}} of Columbia Theological Seminary, {{argued that the}} [...] "if-then" [...] structure of [...] a trademark rhetorical feature of the Deuteronomic tradition, makes clear that {{the gift of the}} land was not an automatic given but a consequence of obedience. The double [...] "if-then" [...] of [...] linked land and obedience, making the gift of the land conditional. First, [...] says the positive [...] "if-then" [...] — [...] stating the [...] "if" [...] of obedience in familiar cadences bespeaking total commitment in two standard verbs ("love" [...] and [...] "serve") plus the formula from the Shema in [...] The [...] "then," [...] the consequence of obedience, is abundant rain in every season that will cause the land to produce everything needed, made explicit through three phrases — first, [...] "grain, wine, oil," [...] a common triad to signal a rich, productive economy (see [...] ); second, the pasture land for cattle on which the agrarian economy depended (see [...] ); and third, the rhetoric of <b>satiation</b> from [...] Then [...] follows with the negative [...] "if-then" [...] — the [...] "if" [...] being the nullification in [...] of the Shema of [...] the compromise of covenantal identity by embracing other gods who seem better at giving rain while making lesser demands. And the negative [...] "then" [...] being drought, as rain is God's gift (see [...] and [...] ). Brueggemann wrote that because of the urgency of obedience, [...] returns to the educational accent of [...] urging the internalizing of passionate covenantal conviction among the young through the mandate to produce signs, emblems, conversations, and marked doorposts and gates.|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristic}} of orthographic <b>satiation</b> {{as opposed to}} semantic <b>satiation</b> is that meaning remains intact. It was suggested that this is different from semantic <b>satiation</b> and from the stimulus familiarization effect because orthographic <b>satiation</b> occurs after the perceivers have access to lexical meaning.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} BSR discovered during <b>satiation</b> experiments in rats is that reward {{itself does not}} produce satiety. Olds demonstrated {{that the lack of}} <b>satiation</b> associated with laboratory rewards allows animals to self-stimulate to sheer exhaustion and that <b>satiation</b> is dependent on the location of the electrical stimulation. In a 48-hour <b>satiation</b> test, rats with hypothalamic electrodes self-stimulated to exhaustion and showed no intrinsic <b>satiation</b> tendencies, whereas telencephalic electrodes showed radical slowing of self-stimulation after 4 to 8 hours.|$|E

Remarkably, it also appears that the expected satiety and expected <b>satiation</b> of foods is influenced by their perceived weight.|$|E

50|$|Predator <b>satiation</b> (less {{commonly}} called predator saturation) is an antipredator adaptation in which prey briefly occur at high population densities, reducing {{the probability of}} an individual organism being eaten.When predators are flooded with potential prey, they can consume only a certain amount, so by occurring at high densities prey benefit from a safety in numbers effect. This strategy has evolved in a diverse range of prey, including notably many species of plants, insects, and fish. Predator <b>satiation</b> {{can be considered a}} type of refuge from predators.|$|E
50|$|An {{application}} {{has been}} developed to reduce speech anxiety by stutterers by creating semantic <b>satiation</b> through repetition, thus reducing the intensity of negative emotions triggered during speech.|$|E
50|$|The {{vagus nerve}} {{also plays a}} role in <b>satiation</b> {{following}} food consumption. Knocking out vagal nerve receptors has been shown to cause hyperphagia (greatly increased food intake).|$|E
50|$|<b>Satiation</b> {{occurs when}} the brain {{acknowledges}} that enough food has been eaten; there are triggers in the body that send these signals to the brain. Sizer and Whitney say a, “Greater exposure of the mouth to food triggers increased <b>satiation.</b> When the stomach stretches to accommodate a meal, nerve receptors in the stomach fire, sending {{a signal to the}} brain that the stomach is full”. Healthy snacks are ones that leave the body feeling filled so that it does not continue to signal to the brain that it still wants food.|$|E

50|$|The {{decrease}} in an individual's liking of and {{desire for a}} substance following repeated consumption of that substance is known as <b>satiation.</b> <b>Satiation</b> rates when eating depend on interactions of trait self-control and healthiness of the food. After eating equal amounts of either clearly healthy (raisins and peanuts) or unhealthy (M&Ms and Skittles) snack foods, people who scored higher on trait self-control tests reported feeling significantly less desire to eat more of the unhealthy foods than they did the healthy foods. Those with low trait self-control satiated at the same pace regardless of health value. Further, when reading a description emphasizing the sweet flavor of their snack, participants with higher trait self-control reported a {{decrease in}} desire faster than they did after hearing {{a description of the}} healthy benefits of their snack. Once again, those with low self-control satiated at the same rate regardless of health condition. Perceived unhealthiness of the food alone, regardless of actual health level, relates to faster <b>satiation,</b> but only for people with high trait self-control.|$|E
