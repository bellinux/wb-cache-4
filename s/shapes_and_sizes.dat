5|$|Most tornadoes {{take on the}} {{appearance}} of a narrow funnel, a few hundred yards (meters) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Tornadoes can appear in many <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{method to}} {{evaluate}} the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> of a small 3 -D crack by microwaves was demonstrated. A component named interference waveform, {{which is based on}} the amplitude of the reflection coefficient measured at two different frequencies, was obtained. On the other hand, based on the interference model, a corresponding interference waveform, which can be calculated from the assumed <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> of a 3 -D crack, was also introduced. By compar ing these two interference waveforms, the evaluation of the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> of a 3 -D crack was carried out. The <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> of the crack were estimated well by using the proposed method. ...|$|R

These include red-and-black lacquerwares in various <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes,</b> bronze items such as raised-relief decorated mirrors, oil lamps {{in the shape of}} human figures, and gilded bronzewares, glazed ceramic wares with various incised designs, and ornaments and jewelry made of jade, opal, amber, quartz, gold, and silver.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, the phallus is also {{considered}} to be a symbol of good luck and representative of fertility. There are numerous shrines in the country featuring phallic architecture. Chao Mae Tuptim shrine in Bangkok, behind the Swissôtel Bangkok hotel has over a hundred colored circumcised wooden penis statues of all <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes</b> which are said to possess special cosmic powers and endow good fortune and fertility on anybody coming into contact with them.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{display a}} wide {{diversity}} of <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes,</b> called morphologies. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth {{the size of}} eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0micrometres in length. However, a few species are visible to the unaided eye—for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7mm. Among the smallest bacteria {{are members of the}} genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3micrometres, as small as the largest viruses. Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied.|$|E

5|$|Gonopods {{occur in}} a {{diversity}} of <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes,</b> and {{in the range from}} closely resembling walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between closely related species but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-tailed {{squirrels}} {{and flying}} squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide {{from tree to}} tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes.</b> Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E
5|$|Snakes, {{like other}} reptiles, have a skin {{covered in a}} scale. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes,</b> known as snakeskin as a whole. A scale protects {{the body of the}} snake, aids it in locomotion, allows {{moisture}} to be retained within, alters the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage, and in some cases even aids in prey capture (such as Acrochordus). The simple or complex colouration patterns (which help in camouflage and anti-predator display) are a property of the underlying skin, but the folded nature of scaled skin allows bright skin to be concealed between scales then revealed in order to startle predators.|$|E

40|$|Prediction of raceway <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> {{has always}} been a {{challenging}} task. Based on the previous finding that raceway boundary is an iso-stress boundary, its <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> has been predicted using a continuum approach. A relation has also been developed to get the stress at the raceway boundary at different blast velocity. Predicted raceway boundary is compared with the experimental raceway boundary/shape <b>and</b> <b>size</b> along with the comparison of theoretical and experimental pressure distribution. A reasonable agreement between the theoretical <b>and</b> experimental raceway <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> is found. Extension of the work in real blast furnace case is also discussed...|$|R

5|$|Tyrannosauroids were bipedal carnivores, as {{were most}} theropods, and were {{characterized}} by numerous skeletal features, especially of the skull and pelvis. Early in their existence, tyrannosauroids were small predators with long, three-fingered forelimbs. Late Cretaceous genera became much larger, {{including some of the}} largest land-based predators ever to exist, but most of these later genera had proportionately small forelimbs with only two digits. Primitive feathers have been identified in fossils of two species, and may have been present in other tyrannosauroids as well. Prominent bony crests in a variety of <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes</b> on the skulls of many tyrannosauroids may have served display functions.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on their}} {{experience}} with the ancient surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, scientists expected to see numerous impact craters in Voyager 1s first images of Io. The density of impact craters across Io's surface would have given clues to Io's age. However, they were {{surprised to discover that}} the surface was almost completely lacking in impact craters, but was instead covered in smooth plains dotted with tall mountains, pits of various <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes,</b> and volcanic lava flows. Compared to most worlds observed to that point, Io's surface was covered in a variety of colorful materials (leading Io to be compared to a rotten orange or to pizza) from various sulfurous compounds. The lack of impact craters indicated that Io's surface is geologically young, like the terrestrial surface; volcanic materials continuously bury craters as they are produced. This result was spectacularly confirmed as at least nine active volcanoes were observed by Voyager 1.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny sheath in Hesperosaurus is a strong indication that the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering. A 2015 study of the <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes</b> of Hespersaurus plates suggested that they were sexually dimorphic, with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females.|$|E

5|$|The {{collaboration}} between Disney and Square {{resulted in a}} mixture of familiar Disney and Square characters, as well as several new characters created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura. The primary protagonist of the game is Sora, a 14-year-old boy chosen to wield the Keyblade—a weapon which is a cross between a key and a sword—for battling darkness. The game also features two friends from his home world, Riku and Kairi. For most of the game, Sora is joined by Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, the court wizard, and Goofy, captain of the royal guard, are sent from Disney Castle to find the Keyblade. The three join forces to search for King Mickey Mouse, Kairi, and Riku. The primary antagonist is Ansem, who seeks power and knowledge by using dark beings called the Heartless. The Heartless, hearts corrupted by darkness, serve as most of the enemies encountered in the game and {{come in a variety of}} <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes.</b> Maleficent, from the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty, leads a group of Disney villains that seeks to use the Heartless for their own gain.|$|E
5|$|Like other snake species, {{the forest}} cobra has skin covered in scales. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizes,</b> known as snakeskin as a whole. Scales protect {{the body of}} the snake, aid it in locomotion, allow {{moisture}} to be retained within, and alter the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage. The dorsal scales of the forest cobra are smooth, glossy and strongly oblique. The colour of this species is variable, with three main colour morphs. Those from the forest or forest fringe, from Sierra Leone east to western Kenya and south to Angola are glossy black, the chin, throat and anterior region of the belly are cream or white, with broad black cross-bars and blotches. The sides of the head are strikingly marked with black and white, giving the impression of vertical black and white bars on the lips. The second colour morph, from the west African savanna, is banded black and yellow, with a black tail, the head is brownish-yellow on top, the lips, chin and throat are yellow. The third colour morph, from the coastal plain of east Africa, south to KwaZulu-Natal, inland to Zambia and southern Democratic Republic of Congo, is brownish or blackish-brown above, paler below, the belly is yellow or cream, heavily speckled with brown or black, and specimens from the southern part of its range have black tails. Melanistic (all black) specimens have been documented from west Africa.|$|E

40|$|Series Title: Springer Series in Geomechanics and GeoengineeringThis paper {{presents}} {{some interesting}} {{results from a}} specifically-designed experimental study that aimed to explore the role of particle <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> in static liquefaction of sandy soils. The experimental program included a series of laboratory tests {{on a range of}} sand-fines mixtures in terms of grain <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>size.</b> The stress-strain behavior of the mixed soils, including such characteristic states as instability state and critical state, is studied in detail. The effect of fines is shown to vary with the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> of both coarse and fine particles. The critical state friction angle of a sand-fines mixture is dominated by the roundness of sand grains, but the roundness of the fines also plays a role. Evidence is also given for the impact of grain <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> on the onset of instability of granular soils...|$|R
