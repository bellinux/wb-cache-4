Fuzzy {{concepts}} and fuzzy concept lattices represent a formal approach to the modelling of non-sharp (fuzzy) concepts and conceptual structures {{in the sense of}} traditional (Port-Royal) logic. Applications of concept lattices are in representation of conceptual knowledge and in conceptual analysis of (fuzzy) data. <b>Similarity</b> <b>relations</b> are defined and considered on three levels: similarity of objects (and similarity of attributes), similarity of concepts, and similarity of concept lattices.

5000|$|Leibniz's {{ideas have}} taken {{root in the}} {{philosophy}} of mathematics, where they have influenced the development of the predicate calculus as Leibniz's law. Mathematicians sometimes distinguish identity from equality. More mundanely, an identity in mathematics may be an equation that holds true for all values of a variable. Hegel argued that things are inherently self-contradictory and that the notion of something being self-identical only made sense if it were not also not-identical or different from itself and did not also imply the latter. In Hegel's words, [...] "Identity is the identity of identity and non-identity." [...] More recent metaphysicians have discussed trans-world identity—the notion that there can be the same object in different possible worlds. An alternative to trans-world identity is the counterpart relation in Counterpart theory. It is a <b>similarity</b> <b>relation</b> that rejects trans-world individuals and instead defends an objects counterpart - the most similar object.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA <b>similarity</b> <b>relation</b> {{with its}} {{partition}} tree {{has been applied}} in the performance evaluation area for obtaining an agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These fuzzy relation-based methods require a decision maker to perform pair-wise comparisons for the similarity among criteria as forming a fuzzy relation matrix. The approach is developed based on real membership values of fuzzy relations. However, interval-valued memberships may be better than real membership values to represent higher-order imprecision and vagueness for human perception. Thus, {{in this paper we}} would like to extend fuzzy relations to interval-valued fuzzy relations and then construct interval-valued similarity relations for performance evaluation. We first give some definitions for these interval-valued types of fuzzy relation, <b>similarity</b> <b>relation</b> and resolution form. We then construct an interval-valued fuzzy <b>similarity</b> <b>relation</b> into a hierarchical structure schema. It is shown that both of procedures and results for the partition tree derived from interval-valued and crisp-valued <b>similarity</b> <b>relation</b> matrices have some corresponding relationships and different merits. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, performance evaluations for academic departments of higher education are considered by using actual engineering school data in Taiwan...|$|E

40|$|Interoperability and {{integration}} of data sources are becoming ever more important issues as both, the amount of data {{and the number of}} data producers are growing. Interoperability not only has to resolve the differences in data structures, it also has to deal with semantic heterogeneity. Semantics refer to the meaning of data in contrast to syntax, which only defines the structure of the schema items (e. g., classes and attributes). We focus on the part of semantics related to the meanings of the terms used as identifiers in schema definitions. This paper presents an approach to integrate schemas from different communities, where each such community is using its own ontology. The approach is based on merging ontologies based on <b>similarity</b> <b>relations</b> among concepts of different ontologies.

40|$|In this paper, a fuzzy {{equivalence}} relation is defined, generally, superseding {{most of the}} established results. The technique of employing sets of values for tuple components to express imprecision and redundancy in relational databases was proposed by Buckles and Petry in their classic works on fuzzy relational databases [1], [2]. By employing finite scalar domains with <b>similarity</b> <b>relations</b> and special fuzzy number domains, Buckles and Petry have demonstrated that the classical properties of uniqueness of tuple interpretations and well-definedness of the relational algebra can be retained in the fuzzy relational database model. The key {{to the preservation of}} these properties is the fact that scalar domains with <b>similarity</b> <b>relations</b> and the fuzzy number domains can be partitioned into equivalence classes. However, since equivalence classes can be constructed by assuming the existence of <b>similarity</b> <b>relations,</b> it is desirable to generalize the fuzzy relational database model to one based only on equivalence classes.
