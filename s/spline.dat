5|$|A {{concentricity}} broach is {{a special}} type of <b>spline</b> cutting broach which cuts both the minor diameter and the <b>spline</b> form to ensure precise concentricity.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral <b>spline</b> or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E

25|$|B-splines {{play the}} role of basis {{functions}} for the <b>spline</b> function space, hence the name. This property follows from the fact that all pieces have the same continuity properties, within their individual range of support, at the knots.|$|E
25|$|Like {{polynomial}} interpolation, <b>spline</b> interpolation incurs {{a smaller}} error than linear interpolation and the interpolant is smoother. However, the interpolant {{is easier to}} evaluate than the high-degree polynomials used in polynomial interpolation. It also does not suffer from Runge's phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difficulty}} in applying {{this process is}} in determining the number of knots to use and {{where they should be}} placed. de Boor suggests various strategies to address this problem. For instance, the spacing between knots is decreased in proportion to the curvature (2nd. derivative) of the data. A few applications have been published. For instance, the use of B-splines for fitting single Lorentzian and Gaussian curves has been investigated. Optimal <b>spline</b> functions of degrees 3-7 inclusive, based on symmetric arrangements of 5, 6, and 7 knots, have been computed and the method was applied for smoothing and differentiation of spectroscopic curves. In a comparable study, the two-dimensional version of the Savitzky-Golay filtering and the <b>spline</b> method produced better results than moving average or Chebyshev filtering.|$|E

50|$|Perfect <b>splines</b> often give {{solutions}} to various extremal problems in mathematics. For example, norms of periodic perfect <b>splines</b> (they are sometimes called Euler perfect <b>splines)</b> are equal to Favard's constants.|$|R
25|$|In words, {{the error}} is {{proportional}} to the square of the distance between the data points. The error in some other methods, including polynomial interpolation and <b>spline</b> interpolation (described below), {{is proportional to}} higher powers of the distance between the data points. These methods also produce smoother interpolants.|$|E
25|$|To gain C2 {{continuity}} the Bézier Curve loses local control, {{because to}} enforce C2 continuity the control points {{are dependent on}} each other. If a single control point moves, the whole <b>spline</b> needs to be re-evaluated. B-Splines have both C2 continuity and local control, but they lose the interpolation property of a piecewise Bézier.|$|E
25|$|More generally, {{the shape}} of the {{resulting}} curve, especially for very high or low values of the independent variable, may be contrary to commonsense, i.e. to what is known about the experimental system which has generated the data points.

40|$|In {{this note}} we state some {{problems}} on approximation by univariate <b>splines</b> with free knots, bivariate segment approximation and tensor product <b>splines</b> with variable knot lines. There {{is a vast}} literature on approximation and interpolation by univariate <b>splines</b> with fixed knots (see e. g. the books of de Boor [1], Braess [2], DeVore & Lorentz [4], Powell [20], Schumaker [21], Nürnberger [13] and the book of Chui [3] on multivariate <b>splines).</b> On the other hand, numerical examples show that in general, the error is much smaller if variable knots are used for the approximation of functions instead of fixed knots.

25|$|It is {{important}} that edges have shapes that are as simple as possible, {{to make it easier}} for the eye to follow them. In polyline drawings, the complexity of an edge may be measured by its number of bends, and many methods aim to provide drawings with few total bends or few bends per edge. Similarly for <b>spline</b> curves the complexity of an edge may be measured by the number of control points on the edge.|$|E
25|$|The string method uses splines {{connecting}} the points, , {{to measure and}} enforce distance constraints between the points and to calculate the tangent at each point. In each step of an optimization procedure, the points might be moved according to the force acting on them perpendicular to the path, and then, if the equidistance constraint between the points is no-longer satisfied, the points can be redistributed, using the <b>spline</b> representation of the path to generate new vectors with the required spacing.|$|E
