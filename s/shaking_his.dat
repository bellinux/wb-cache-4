He became Chief of the General Staff and, together with Minister of Military Affairs Władysław Sikorski, managed to stabilize the situation, quelling unrest with a brief state of emergency.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the {{overcast}} skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Allan Watkins opened the bowling, delivering four overs for 19 runs before the after-effects of a Lindwall {{blow to the}} shoulder became too much. The openers passed England's first innings total with ease {{in less than an}} hour, and Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The tourists reached 117 before Barnes fell to Eric Hollies for 61, ending an opening stand that had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As the Australian captain had already announced his retirement {{after the end of the}} series, the innings would be his last in Test cricket if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to the wicket. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving Bradman three cheers, before <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> hand. The Australian captain needed only four runs for a Test average of 100, but was bowled by Hollies for a second ball duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Bradman received another large round of applause as he left the arena.|$|E

At 03:51 a reply confirmed that the medal had been awarded by Hitler. Matrosengefreiter Adolf Eich later witnessed Admiral Günther Lütjens and Kapitän zur See Ernst Lindemann <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> hand after the award was made.

25|$|In {{the course}} of his career, Roose also turned out for Port Vale and Celtic (both 1910). He played one game for Celtic, and it was a Scottish Cup semi-final in which Celtic lost 1–3 to Clyde on 12 March 1910. He made his mark on this game by running after the goalscorer of one of the Clyde goals and <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> hand! Other clubs he {{represented}} on at least one occasion included Druids, Huddersfield Town (1910–1911), Aston Villa (1911) and Woolwich Arsenal (1911–1912).|$|E
25|$|El Shehaby {{lost his}} first match to Israel's Or Sasson, {{but refused to}} bow or shake hands with him, {{resulting}} to a loud jeer from the crowd. When Sasson extended his hand to shake after the match, El Shehaby backed away, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> head. The referee called El Shehaby back to the mat and obliged him to bow, at which point El Shehaby gave a quick nod of his head. El Shehaby's conduct was widely condemned as unsportsmanlike. It is unclear what potential punishment El Shehaby or Egyptian judo as a whole could face, but his hopes of medaling were dashed regardless due to Sasson's decisive performance in the quarterfinals.|$|E
25|$|Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who was {{leader of}} the Labour Party, advised her not to meet Adams, whose party was linked with the Provisional IRA. However, the Government refused to {{formally}} advise her not to meet with him. She felt it would be wrong, {{in the absence of}} such formal advice, for her as head of state not to meet the local member of parliament during her visit, and was photographed publicly <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> hand. During her various visits to Northern Ireland, she in fact regularly met politicians of all hues, including David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party and John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party.|$|E

25|$|Soon afterward, Călinescu, {{acting on}} {{indications}} from the monarch, arrested Codreanu and prosecuted him in two successive trials. Antonescu, whose mandate of Defense Minister had been prolonged under the premiership of Miron Cristea, resigned in protest to Codreanu's arrest. He was a celebrity defense witness at the latter's {{first and second}} trials. During the latter, which saw Codreanu's conviction for treason, Antonescu vouched for his friend's honesty while <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> {{hand in front of}} the jury. Upon the end of procedures, the king ordered his former minister interned at Predeal, before assigning him to command the Third Army in the remote eastern region of Bessarabia (and later removing him after Antonescu expressed sympathy for Guardists imprisoned in Chișinău). Attempting to discredit his rival, Carol also ordered Antonescu's wife to be tried for bigamy, based on a false claim that her divorce had not been finalized. Defended by Mihai Antonescu, the officer was able to prove his detractors wrong. Codreanu himself was taken into custody and discreetly killed by the Gendarmes acting on Carol's orders (November 1938).|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} days of the cartoon's existence, Jack often commented on alcohol, his lack of a job, and his wife. In recent years, the cartoon has taken a {{politically}} correct tone, except on occasion. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Sourdough Jack was pictured <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> fist and saying, [...] "It's time to terrorize the terrorists!" [...] About that time, the original Sourdough Jack drawings that had been reproduced since 1952 were replaced by new drawings made in a similar style.

500|$|The role {{of extra}} 9413 was played by Jules Raucourt, {{credited}} {{in the film}} simply as [...] "Raucourt". Although Raucourt started {{his career as a}} leading man of silent action films, he ironically became a film extra himself after cinema transitioned into the sound era. Raucourt later wrote a novel using the title of the film. The role of Extra #13 was played by Adriane Marsh, herself a film extra, who never again obtained a named role in cinema. Extra #15, who then becomes a movie star, was portrayed by Voya George, a personal friend of Vorkapić, who went on to a career in European films. Robert Florey also himself appears in the film as a casting director, although only his disembodied mouth and hand are visible, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> finger at the protagonist. Slavko Vorkapić also had a brief role in the film as the man constantly walking up the stairs toward the words [...] "SUCCESS".|$|E
500|$|The Brute Man was {{developed}} by Universal Pictures Company, Inc. in the later years of their successful production of horror films, including Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931) and The Mummy (1932). While those films were great critical and financial successes, The Brute Man was filmed during what was widely considered the low point of the studio's horror film period. It was produced by Ben Pivar and directed by Jean Yarbrough, both of whom had worked on House of Horrors and many other horror films for Universal over the years. The Brute Man was filmed in 13 days, during November 1945. The flashback scenes—which depict how Hal Moffet became disfigured and ultimately became the Creeper—were all shot {{on the final day}} of filming. Jane Adams said Hatton's acromegaly was becoming progressively worse by the time The Brute Man was filmed, and it made acting difficult for him. Hatton had trouble remembering his lines, focusing on his performance, and responding to the other actors. Hatton occasionally appears confused even on screen, like during one scene where he says [...] "yes" [...] while <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> head [...] "no." [...] Adams called him a friendly and thoughtful man, but called him [...] "so pathetic to work with [...] almost autistic".|$|E
500|$|Joseph Parkes, Lord Wilton and William Rathbone {{were the}} first to reach Huskisson. They found that a wheel had passed over his right calf and thigh, leaving his knee itself untouched. A flap of skin on his upper leg had been cut back, exposing the muscles, and the exposed arteries had not been severed but were flattened, pulsing with Huskisson's heartbeat. The damaged leg shook uncontrollably. Observers noted that Huskisson {{did not appear to be}} in pain, and instead lay {{watching}} the leg shake. Huskisson shouted [...] "This is the death of me". Parkes attempted to reassure him, but Huskisson replied [...] "Yes, I am dying, call Mrs Huskisson". A man threw his coat over William Huskisson's leg to spare Emily Huskisson from seeing the extent of his injuries, and she was helped from the carriage in which she had been sitting. In hysterics, she attempted to throw herself onto Huskisson, but was restrained by fellow passengers as Lord Wilton applied a makeshift tourniquet he had made using handkerchiefs and an elderly passenger's walking stick. Other passengers ripped the door of a nearby railway storeroom from its hinges, to serve as a makeshift stretcher. Huskisson was lifted onto the door, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> head and saying [...] "Where is Mrs Huskisson? I have met my death, God forgive me." [...] (Garfield, writing in 2002, gives his words as [...] "This is my death, God forgive me".) ...|$|E

500|$|Shaw {{maintained}} a provocative and frequently self-contradictory attitude to Shakespeare (whose name {{he insisted on}} spelling [...] "Shakespear"). Many found him difficult to take seriously on the subject; Duff Cooper observed that by attacking Shakespeare, [...] "it is Shaw who appears a ridiculous pigmy <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> fist at a mountain." [...] Shaw was, nevertheless, a knowledgeable Shakespearian, and {{in an article in}} which he wrote, [...] "With the single exception of Homer, there is no eminent writer, not even Sir Walter Scott, whom I can despise so entirely as I despise Shakespear when I measure my mind against his," [...] he also said, [...] "But I am bound to add that I pity the man who cannot enjoy Shakespear. He has outlasted thousands of abler thinkers, and will outlast a thousand more". Shaw had two regular targets for his more extreme comments about Shakespeare: undiscriminating [...] "Bardolaters", and actors and directors who presented insensitively cut texts in over-elaborate productions. He was continually drawn back to Shakespeare, and wrote three plays with Shakespearean themes: The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, Cymbeline Refinished and Shakes versus Shav. In a 2001 analysis of Shaw's Shakespearian criticisms, Robert Pierce concludes that Shaw, who was no academic, saw Shakespeare's plays—like all theatre—from an author's practical point of view: [...] "Shaw helps us {{to get away from the}} Romantics' picture of Shakespeare as a titanic genius, one whose art cannot be analyzed or connected with the mundane considerations of theatrical conditions and profit and loss, or with a specific staging and cast of actors." ...|$|E
500|$|Göring was the second-highest-ranking Nazi {{official}} tried at Nuremberg, behind Reich President (former Admiral) Karl Dönitz. The prosecution levelled {{an indictment}} of four charges, including a charge of conspiracy; waging a war of aggression; war crimes, including the plundering and removal to Germany {{of works of art}} and other property; and crimes against humanity, including the disappearance of political and other opponents under the Nacht und Nebel (Night and Fog) decree; the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war; and the murder and enslavement of civilians, including what was at the time estimated to be 5,700,000 Jews. Not permitted to present a lengthy statement, Göring declared himself to be [...] "in the sense of the indictment not guilty". The trial lasted 218 days; the prosecution presented their case from November through March, and Göring's defencethe first to be presentedlasted from 8 to 22 March. The sentences were read out on 30 September 1946. Göring, forced to remain silent while seated in the dock, communicated his opinions about the proceedings using gestures, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> head, or laughing. He constantly took notes and whispered with the other defendants, and tried to control the erratic behaviour of Hess, who was seated beside him. During breaks in the proceedings, Göring tried to dominate the other defendants, and he was eventually placed in solitary confinement when he attempted to influence their testimony. Göring told American psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn that the court was [...] "stupid" [...] to try [...] "little fellows" [...] like Funk and Kaltenbrunner instead of letting Göring take all the blame on himself. He also claimed that he had never heard of most of the other defendants before the trial.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{commercial}} failure of [...] "Ain't It Hard", Reprise Records {{was encouraged by}} the group's effort, and signed the band to a recording contract that left them under Hassinger's authority. Weakley departed the band after the single, {{and was replaced by}} Preston Ritter, and rhythm guitarist James [...] "Weasel" [...] Spagnola was recruited to make The Electric Prunes a quintet. Although the band was composing their own material, Hassinger called upon songwriters Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz to write the majority of the group's songs. The new line-up recorded six demos at American Recording Studio and Leon Russell's studio. These mainly comprised cover songs and Tucker-Mantz compositions. According to Lowe, while at Russell's recording studio, [...] "Dave cued up a tape and didn't hit 'record,' and the playback in the studio was way up: ear-shattering vibrating jet guitar. Ken had been <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> Bigsby wiggle stick with some fuzztone and tremolo {{at the end of the}} tape. Forward it was cool. Backward it was amazing. I ran into the control room and said, 'What was that?' They didn't have the monitors on so they hadn't heard it. I made Dave cut if off and save it for later." [...] The fluttering buzz sound was utilized for the opening to the Tucker-Mantz song, [...] "I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night)", which also included a heavily-textured psychedelic guitar motif. The song was chosen to be released as The Electric Prunes' second single in November 1966. It peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number 49 on the UK Singles Chart. The success of the single prompted immediate touring, and earned the group a promotional contract with musical equipment makers Vox. Williams recorded an advert, demonstrating the use of Vox's wah-wah pedal in early 1967, and the band was featured in magazines such as Vox Teen Beat.|$|E

500|$|Before the 1966–67 season, Celtics coach Red Auerbach retired. Initially, he {{had wanted}} his old player Frank Ramsey as coach, but Ramsey was too {{occupied}} running his three lucrative nursing homes. His second choice Bob Cousy declined, stating {{he did not want}} to coach his former teammates, and the third choice Tom Heinsohn also said no, because he did not think he could handle the often surly Russell. However, Heinsohn proposed Russell himself as a player-coach, and when Auerbach asked his center, he said yes. On April 16, 1966 Bill Russell agreed to become head coach of the Boston Celtics followed by a public announcement two days later. Russell thus became the first African American head coach in NBA history, and commented to journalists: [...] "I wasn't offered the job because I am a Negro, I was offered it because Red figured I could do it." [...] The Celtics' championship streak ended in his first full season as head coach at eight, however, as Wilt Chamberlain's Philadelphia 76ers won a record-breaking 68 regular season games and overcame the Celtics 4–1 in the 1967 Eastern Finals. The Sixers simply outpaced the Celtics, shredding the famous Boston defense by scoring 140 points in the clinching Game 5 win. Russell acknowledged his first real loss in his career (he had been injured in 1958 when the Celtics lost the NBA Finals) by visiting Chamberlain in the locker room, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> hand and saying, [...] "Great". However, the game still ended on a high note for Russell. After the loss, he led his grandfather through the Celtics locker rooms, and the two saw white Celtics player John Havlicek taking a shower next to his black teammate Sam Jones and discussing the game. Suddenly, Jake Russell broke down crying. Asked by his grandson what was wrong, his grandfather replied how proud he was of him, being coach of an organization in which blacks and whites coexisted in harmony.|$|E
500|$|After {{losing the}} Intercontinental Championship, Orton became {{the number one}} {{contender}} for the World Heavyweight Championship after winning a 20-man battle royal on July 26. At SummerSlam, Orton defeated Chris Benoit for the championship. Orton became the youngest world champion in WWE history {{at the age of}} 24. Benoit congratulated Orton after the match, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> hand for showing the ability to [...] "be a man". The following night, after Orton successfully defended the championship against Benoit in a rematch, Evolution threw Orton a [...] celebration, only to reveal that they were not pleased with his new victory. While Batista had Orton propped on his shoulders in elation, Triple H gave him a pleased thumbs up and then abruptly changed it to a thumbs-down, which was followed by Batista's dropping Orton to the mat. Ric Flair and Batista attacked Orton in the ring as Triple H revealed his jealousy for Orton's title. He ordered Orton to hand over the championship, but he refused, spitting in Triple H's face and hitting him with the title belt. Orton's break-up with Evolution began a new storyline for him as a fan favorite when he continued to feud with his former stablemates. A month later, Orton lost his championship to Triple H at Unforgiven. Seeking revenge, Orton lashed out at Evolution members, catching them by surprise during a show by giving them a large cake as a make-up gift, which he came out of nowhere to beat and humiliate the group. At Taboo Tuesday, Orton defeated Ric Flair in a Steel Cage match. After this, Orton experienced another push, becoming General Manager of the Raw brand for a week following a match stipulation at Survivor Series where he picked up the win for his team by last pinning Triple H in a 4-on-4 Survivor Series match. He continued to feud with Triple H, using his authority to place his opponents at severe disadvantages during title defenses. Orton was granted another chance at the championship in January 2005, but lost a six-man championship Elimination Chamber match to Triple H at New Year's Revolution. On the January 10 Raw, Orton defeated Batista to earn a match against Triple H at the Royal Rumble for the World Heavyweight title. At the Royal Rumble, Triple H defeated Orton to retain the World title.|$|E
