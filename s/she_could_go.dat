5|$|In November, Chaplin {{began working}} with Cherrill again {{in some of the}} Flower Girl's less {{dramatic}} scenes. While waiting for her scenes for several months, Cherrill had become bored and openly complained to Chaplin. During the filming of one scene, Cherrill asked Chaplin if she could leave early so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to a hair appointment. Chaplin fired Virginia Cherrill and replaced her with Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in The Gold Rush. However, Hale's screen tests proved that she was unsuitable for the role. Chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress Violet Krauth, but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators. Chaplin finally re-hired Cherrill to finish City Lights. She demanded and got a raise to $75 per week. Approximately seven minutes of test footage of Hale survives and is included on the DVD release; excerpts were first seen in the documentary Unknown Chaplin along with an unused opening sequence.|$|E
25|$|This {{accusation}} led to {{her life}} being in danger, and through the help of Bahá'u'lláh, she escaped to Tehran. Táhirih stayed {{at the home of}} Bahá'u'lláh in the private parlour of his wife Ásíyih Khánum. Ásíyih personally looked after Táhirih whilst she was hiding in their house. It was there that she first met `Abdu'l-Bahá and grew very attached the boy of about three or four. Táhirih asked Bahá’u’lláh if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to Māku as a pilgrim to see the Báb, who was then still a prisoner, but Bahá’u’lláh explained the impossibility of the trek.|$|E
25|$|Despite being a brain dead {{patient who}} only has hours to live, Wilson {{wakes up in}} his own Dreamscape and is met by the Scarecrow Guide. She informs him of where he is and allows him to explore his {{memories}} for one last time, but warns him that memories aren't always good. Upon finding a hidden key inside a tree that he had put there in his childhood, Wilson {{opens the door to}} a nearby cabin. Inside he discovers old drawings he and his friend Amelia had made when they were children. He remembers that she made him promise to fly her away from here when they grew up so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to the Big City. Wilson then explores a nearby barn, in which he and Amelia had kissed for the first time.|$|E

25|$|The {{overall effect}} of Reichart's {{literary}} techniques indicate Hilde's estrangement of painful memories, her obsession with guilt and self-loathing, {{her inability to}} resolve anxiety, and the inadequacy of words to capture her feelings. With these devices, Reichart allows the reader to see inside the mind of an extremely disturbed woman. For Reichart, Hilde and her siblings embody the war-time generation: Walter, who helped to hack to death the prisoners in the barn; Monika, who was too delicate and fragile to act; Hannes, who refused to kill the prisoner and tried to save him; and Hilde, who was confused {{and did not know}} to whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> for help. The father, a violent and bitter man, made his family suffer and was indeed complicit in their suffering; the mother, worked hard but said nothing; the distant sister, Christine, was removed from the chaos. The home was no sanctuary, not for the escaped prisoner, nor for Hilde; Pesendorf betrayed the brother—indeed, the family—and killed the prisoner. The home was as dangerous and bloody as the barn.|$|E

Smith told Robyn Harvey from The Sydney Morning Herald, [...] "I wanted Daphne to die. I didn't want to be stuck in a television series {{for the rest of my}} life. I'd taken Daphne as far as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>go.</b> She's run the gamut of every life experience she could possibly have. I'd had enough." [...] Daphne was critically injured during a car crash on the way to her father's funeral and she was left in a coma. Off-screen, representatives from the serial's production company tried to persuade Smith to sign a new contract, but she refused. Daphne briefly regained consciousness to say [...] "I love you Clarkey" [...] to Des, before becoming the first regular character to die.|$|E
500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E

500|$|The {{events that}} {{transpire}} between the fourth to sixth films are effectively ignored in 1998’s [...] This film opens {{twenty years after}} {{the events of the}} second film. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has faked her own death so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> into hiding from her brother Michael. Now working as the head mistress of a private school under the name Keri Tate, Laurie continues to live in fear of her brother’s return. Her own son, John (Josh Hartnett), attends school where she teaches. Laurie’s fear becomes reality when Michael (Chris Durand) shows up at the school and begins killing John’s friends and eventually he and Laurie come face-to-face. Laurie manages to get John and his girlfriend (Michelle Williams) to safety, but decides to return to the school to face Michael once and for all. Laurie succeeds in stopping Michael, but not satisfied until she knows that he is truly dead, Laurie steals his body and decapitates Michael. [...] (2002) picks up three years after H20, and reveals that Michael swapped clothes with a paramedic—crushing the paramedic’s larynx so that he could not talk—and that was who Laurie killed. Unable to deal with killing an innocent man, and the fact that Michael was still out there, Laurie is committed to a mental institution. Michael (Brad Loree) shows up at the institution, but Laurie captures him. Her fear of making the same mistake twice gets the better of her, and when she attempts to remove Michael’s mask he surprises and kills her.

Michael proceeds to kill everyone, until he is finally electrocuted by the only surviving student, Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), and the show’s creator Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes).|$|E
