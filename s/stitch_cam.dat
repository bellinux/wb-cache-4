40|$|Research on {{and about}} the {{circular}} knitting machines with small diameter have developed spectacularly in recents years. In this paper we are exposed to new research on the impact force needle - cam –yarn for the small diameter knitting machine, Ange with Ø[3. 75 ”], K [14 E], 0 - 300 n/rot/min. It is necessary to to extend the service life of pieces of the machines and improve the technology of production of knits for reduce dynamic effects. [1]The present research aims to measure the impact forces on the needle-cam-yarn system during the linear movement of the profile <b>stitch</b> <b>cam.</b> Have been investigated three different cam angles (40 ˚, 50 ˚, 55 ˚) and made measurements for two working speeds. Impact force measurements were made in two cases with and without knitting yarn. Was found due to yarn of knitting voltage influence on the force of impact is negligible, being decisive cam angles and speed of the machine...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{analysis in}} Part I {{shows that a}} new yam length measurement system {{can be used to}} monitor the variation in yam run-in tension which is mainly influenced by the frictional properties of the yam during knitting. The new yarn length system was designed using a measuring wheel principle. It is a simple construction and more reliable. In order to use the new system efficiently and accuratly the number of yam tums wrapped around the measuring wheel is 3 tums to eliminate slippage problem. The number of turns on the positive storage feeder was also fixed at 15 tums to eliminate any variation on the yarn of wrapped yarn. The system is placed between the positive storage feeder and the needle. The run-in yam tension that was affected by the system can be eliminated by adjusting the <b>stitch</b> <b>cam</b> setting. The run-in yam tension must be set around 2 - 3 cN. The resolution of the new system is 0. 48 mm. Special hardware and software was designed to measure the yam delivery to the needles by the positive storage feeder per one revolution, by means of a personal computer. By experimental results it is shown that the new yarn length measuring system can be used to monitor the run-in yam in real-time in order to improve the fabric quality. t...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the fabrication of polydioxanone weft-knitted stents and the mechanical properties optimization on process parameters. The stents {{can be used}} for treatment of intestinal obstruction and stenosis. Patients diagnosed with different phases require different mechanical stents. So, the mechanical properties of stents, radial force and circumferential strength are important for the safety and efficiency of stents. The aim of this paper was to identify the effect of process parameters on the mechanical properties of stents using the statistical modeling method, then propose optimum parameter settings. The intra-abdominal and intra-intestinal pressures of the human intestine were investigated through an intestine physical model; a full factorial experiment was employed to identify the most suitable factors and find the optimum processing parameters according to the two pressures identified. The results showed that optimum stents with radial force in the range of 1. 3 - 2. 5 cN/mm and circumferential strength in the range of 20 - 50 cN/mm could be obtained at a <b>stitch</b> <b>cam</b> setting ranging from 3. 2 to 3. 4 mm, with fabric tension in the range of 140 - 160 cN if the yarn tension and yarn linear density were held at 1. 2 cN and 150 tex, respectively. The model validation results showed that stents with different mechanical properties could be tailored through the statistical method and proposed model. In conclusion, such stents, and optimization method, may find broad applications clinically. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

40|$|Textile {{biomedical}} materials {{have been used}} for various applications contributing considerably in improving quality of life. The current study aims at improving polypropylene fibre stents which may replace metallic ones. In order to produce the stents, weft-knitting and braiding technologies were used. In the braiding technique, by varying the takeup ratio (using gears with the appropriate number of teeth in the braiding machine), it was possible to manufacture regular braids with angles of 65 °, 70 ° and 75 ° in order to obtain different covers. In the knitting technique, a circular machine was used and the tightness of the structure was adjusted by varying the loop length and thus the fabric loop density, resulting in variations of the sample diameter. The knitting machine had negative feed, and so loop length variations were achieved by varying the yarn input tension, the <b>stitch</b> <b>cam</b> settings and the fabric take-down tension. The samples were heat set. Yarns were contracted by setting at 130 ° C and 140 ° C, and this led to increasing the loop density and the flexural rigidity of the samples. A high cover of the samples resulted in a greater stiffness of the structures. The stents were evaluated by undertaking the tests required for arterial support: rigidity to radial compression, resistance to tensile forces and bending rigidity. The best results were obtained with braided structures. Future work may concentrate in improving the stent design and using new biocompatible fibres.
