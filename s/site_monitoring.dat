40|$|Historically, {{the primary}} {{role of the}} {{clinical}} research <b>site</b> <b>monitor</b> has been to verify that study data and regulatory documents are correct at the site. Much of the <b>site</b> <b>monitor’s</b> activities are thus tedious routine – essentially checking boxes according to standard operating procedures. For most <b>site</b> <b>monitors,</b> {{the rest of the}} job is a craft. As with other crafts such as carpentry and blacksmithing, the <b>site</b> <b>monitor</b> learns much of his/her trade through apprenticeship and on-the-job training. As a result, each <b>site</b> <b>monitor</b> has his/her own way of doing things. When a <b>site</b> <b>monitor</b> leaves a study, his/her replacement often has different ways of doing things, creating a period of confusion and inefficiency while the site adjusts to the new rules. This non-interchangeability of personnel is typical of crafts. Clinical Research data collection and validation is evolving through the three stages in Tabl...|$|R

50|$|To {{reduce the}} burden of <b>site</b> <b>monitoring</b> on {{clinical}} trials, the FDA now recommends a risk-based monitoring (RBM) approach. The essence of this recommendation is to gather meaningful metrics that ascertain the safety and welfare of the subjects and performance of the clinical trial, rather than doing 100% source data verification. Adopting RBM may reduce <b>site</b> <b>monitoring</b> costs by 25%. thus reducing overall cost and risk on clinical trials.|$|E
