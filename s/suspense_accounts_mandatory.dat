At the same time, work in process and finished goods would be debited with their respective shares of overhead cost, and a <b>suspense</b> <b>account</b> in the general ledger would be credited. At the start of the next period a reversing entry was to be made, debiting suspense and crediting profit and loss. Then suspense was again debited and finished goods and work in process were credited, bringing the inventory accounts back to a prime cost basis and leaving total overhead cost as a balance in suspense.|$|R

The study examined the underlying and related causes of non-payment of government debt. The study revealed that municipalities in the Eastern Cape lack support from the other spheres of government in ensuring timeous payments of outstanding debt. Growth in debtors indicated the failure by the municipalities to implement proper debt management processes and the lack of political will to collect debts.

40|$|The {{central focus}} {{of this paper is}} on how the quality of {{anticipated}} <b>mandatory</b> <b>accounting</b> reports affects the bias in and likelihood of voluntary management disclosures. Our model integrates two paradigms used to analyze management disclosures, those in which managers choose to disclose or not when disclosures must be truthful, and those in which managers choose the extent of bias when disclosures always occur. Thus, we incorporate both proprietary (firm-wide) costs of disclosures and personal costs of biasing. In our model, the manager endogenously determines both whether to disclose and, if disclosure occurs, how much to bias the disclosure. We find that increases in the quality of <b>mandatory</b> <b>accounting</b> reports decrease the bias in management disclosures because investors rely relatively less on the disclosures in determining the firm’s value. Further, as the quality of accounting reports increases, the probability of management disclosures also increases because the cost to the manager of biasing the disclosures decreases. Finally, we show that the manager may prefer low to high quality <b>mandatory</b> <b>accounting</b> reports when the proprietary costs of disclosures are large or the manager’s stock-based incentives are large relative to the personal cost of biasing...|$|R
40|$|A law {{shall not}} violate its sources, {{especially}} if the sources {{are not subject to}} being overruled or ignored. However, one of the essential Islamic objectives is preserving the wealth “property. ” This preservation requires protecting wealth from being acquired in illegitimate way, which will prevent the owners from controlling and enjoying their wealth. Islam protects true owners themselves from getting harmed or facing suffering caused by engaging in a transaction that involved their property. In making the law, Islamic scholars contend that any deliberate act that creates harm or makes someone suffer is “strictly prohibited” and must be rebuked. This legal rule is founded on a statement from the prophet “PBUH” who said, “There is no injury nor return of injury. ” The law of unclaimed accounts states the following: if the current account lays dormant for a five-year period, with no transactions by the customer or his authorized agent, the account shall be considered unclaimed and the bank should transfer the balance thereof to a pooled <b>Suspense</b> <b>Account</b> reserved for these accounts inside the bank. This law of unclaimed money has given the Saudi banks unjust power over their customers, causing difficulty for heirs and third-party creditors trying to retrieve their wealth. This law should be reformed by adopting a fair law to remove this harmful practice and restore the rightful owners’ rights to control and enjoy their wealth. This law also violates some major principles of Islam, such as the inheritance law. As a result, this law violates the two primary sources of Islam, so it is unconstitutional...|$|R
40|$|Jane Eyre {{has been}} {{reproduced}} many times, in many forms. Every since its publication the novel {{has been very}} popular. Next to Jane Eyre itself this thesis will examine two novels, Rebecca and Nine Coaches Waiting which use the famous myth around Jane Eyre. The myth is: plain girl meets dark handsome and rich man {{but she does not}} marry him until she is independent herself. These elements give the novel the character of a Bildungsroman; throughout the novel the heroine develops and grows. Significant for the myth are its ending, the character of the heroine, the Gothic elements, the romantic suspense and the form of narration. These are the basic elements of the myth and they recur in the other reproductions of Jane Eyre. The combination of the myth’s high literary value and its romantic <b>suspense</b> <b>account</b> for its continuing popularity. On the one hand it is a Bildungsroman displaying the growth of a young lady fighting the system to become an independent woman. On the other hand, it is the classic romantic love story of a poor girl who wins the heart of a rich, outspoken character of a man. Despite the obstacles the novel has a happy ending and the couple marries. This thesis will be analysing the polarity of the myth by answering the following question: what causes the popularity and quality of the Jane Eyre-myth?

40|$|The Chinese {{government}} enforced mandatory quarantine for 60 days (from 10 May to 8 July 2009) as a preventative {{strategy to}} control {{the spread of the}} 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic. Such a prevention strategy was stricter than other non-pharmaceutical interventions that were carried out in many other countries. We evaluated the effectiveness of the mandatory quarantine and provide suggestions for interventions against possible future influenza pandemics. We selected one city, Beijing, as the analysis target. We reviewed the epidemiologic dynamics of the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic and the implementation of quarantine measures in Beijing. The infectious population was simulated under two scenarios (quarantined and not quarantined) using a deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. The basic reproduction number R 0 was adjusted to match the epidemic wave in Beijing. We found that mandatory quarantine served to postpone the spread of the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic in Beijing by one and a half months. If mandatory quarantine was not enforced in Beijing, the infectious population could have reached 1, 553 by 21 October, i. e., 5. 6 times higher than the observed number. When the cost of quarantine is taken into <b>account,</b> <b>mandatory</b> quarantine was not an economically effective intervention approach against the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic.
