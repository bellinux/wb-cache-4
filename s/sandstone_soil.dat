25|$|The {{southeast}} {{province of}} Gorizia {{is home to}} the DOCs of the Collio region, most notably Collio Goriziano. Part of the region's vineyards extend over the border with Slovenia but none of the Slovenian Wines can bear the designation Collio. The area benefits from its location among the foothills of the Alps where the cool winds that come off the Adriatic moderate the climate. The cool air helps maintain the acidity levels in the grape. The region's best vineyards are found in the clay and <b>sandstone</b> <b>soil</b> around the comune of Cormons. The region is dominated by white wine production, making five times more white than red wine. Collio wine is typically full bodied and rich, made as a varietal or blend of Friulano, Ribolla Gialla, Malvasia Istriana, Chardonnay, Pinot bianco, Pinot grigio and Sauvignon blanc. Red wine under the designation Collio Rosso is made from a blend of Merlot, Cabernet franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. The general Collio Bianco designation can also include the white grapes Müller-Thurgau, Picolit, Riesling, Traminer and Welschriesling as well as the white juice from the red wine grapes of Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot nero.|$|E

40|$|Soils are {{globally}} significant {{sources and}} sinks of atmospheric CO 2. Increasing the resolution of soil carbon turnover estimates is important for predicting the response of soil carbon cycling to environmental change. We show that soil carbon turnover times can be more finely resolved using a dual isotope label like the one provided by elevated CO 2 experiments that use fossil CO 2. We modeled each physical soil fraction as two pools with different turnover times, using the atmospheric 14 C bomb spike {{in combination with the}} label in 14 C and 13 C provided by an elevated CO 2 experiment in a California annual grassland. In sandstone and serpentine soils, the light-fraction carbon was 20 – 40 % fast cycling with 2 – 10 yr turnover and 60 – 80 % slow cycling with turnover slower than 100 yr. This validates model treatment of the light fraction as active and intermediate cycling carbon. The dense, mineral–associated fraction also had a very dynamic component, consisting of 5 – 10 % fast cycling carbon and 90 – 95 % very slow cycling carbon. Similarly, half the microbial biomass carbon in the <b>sandstone</b> <b>soil</b> was more than five years old, and 40 % of the carbon respired by microbes had been fixed more than five years ago. Resolving each density fraction into two pools revealed that only a small component of total soil carbon is responsible for most CO 2 efflux from these soils. In the <b>sandstone</b> <b>soil,</b> 8 – 11 % of soil carbon contributes more than 85 % of the annual CO 2 efflux. The fact that soil physical fractions, designed to isolate organic material of roughly homogeneous physico-chemical state, contain material of dramatically different turnover times is consistent with recent observations of rapid isotope incorporation into seemingly stable fractions, and with emerging evidence for hot spots of decomposition within the soil matrix. Predictions of soil response using a turnover time estimated with the assumption of a single pool per fraction would greatly overestimate near-term response to changes in productivity or decomposition rates. Therefore, these results suggest more rapid, but more limited, potential for change in soil carbon storage due to environmental change than has been assumed by more simple mass-balance calculations...|$|E

The GeneFishing and proteomic results showed that the expression of DEGs and DEPs were critical for photosynthesis and stomata closure, such as RuBisCO, photosynthetic electron transfer c and malate dehydrogenase varied in the leaves of L. confusa that cultivated in different soils. These DEGs or DEPs were further found to be directly or indirectly regulated by calcium sensor proteins.

40|$|Many habitat {{specialist}} {{species are}} originally composed of small, discontinuous populations because their habitats are naturally fragmented or patchy. They may have suffered {{the long-term effects}} of natural patchiness. Mediterranean heathlands, a representative habitat in the Strait of Gibraltar region, are associated with nutrient-poor, acidic sandstone soils. <b>Sandstone</b> <b>soil</b> patches in the African side of the Strait (Tangier) are, in general, smaller and more scattered than in the European side (Algeciras). In this study, we analyze the effect of this sandstone patchiness on the population genetic diversity and structure of two Erica species from these Mediterranean heathlands that differ in their edaphic specificity, E. australis, sandstone specialist, and E. arborea, generalist. Average levels of within-population genetic diversity and gene flow between populations were significantly lower in Tangier (high sandstone patchiness) than in Algeciras (low patchiness) for the sandstone specialist, whereas no differences between both sides of the Strait were detected in the edaphic generalist. Since most endemic species in Mediterranean heathlands of the Strait of Gibraltar are sandstone specialists, these results highlight an increased vulnerability to loss of genetic diversity and local extinction of the heathland endemic flora in the Tangier side of the Strait of Gibraltar. © 2014 Gil-López et al.

40|$|Indonesia is {{one country}} that has many areas {{vulnerable}} to landslides. To the present time, there are many victims of disasters caused by landslides in Indonesia. To handle the landslide disaster, requires some knowledge about the causes, mechanisms and appropriate mitigation efforts against disasters mentioned above. Causes and mechanisms of landslides is necessary in determining the  mitigation in order to the victim can be minimized. This paper is an analytical study {{of the causes of}} landslides at Kalitlaga Village, Pagentan Sub district, Banjarnegara Regency. Causes of  landslides determined by analyzing the results of field investigation and supporting data (topographic and geological maps at the research location). The analysis results, also be used to determine the proper method of handling landslides in the area. Based on the results investigation field, it can be concluded that the main cause of landslides at Kalitlaga is topographic factors. Kalitlaga Village is located in the mountain range with a fairly steep slope ranges from 20 o - 45 o. The other cause of landslides is a poor drainage system in the village. Besides, based on geological maps, geological structure in the area included breksi rock in tapak formation, which has a <b>sandstone</b> <b>soil</b> type, breksi andesite composition and the organic soil. The characteristics of this soil type have a low cohesion value with a high permeability, so that condition also supports the occurrence of landslides.
