Usually fighters who adopt this <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> takedowns only for scoring, easily allowing the adversary {{to stand up}} and continue the fight. They also want to land clear strikes and control the octagon. In order to win the fight by decision all score oriented fighters have to master perfect MMA defense techniques and avoid takedowns.|$|E

40|$|The aims of this {{research}} are to analyze learning <b>strategies</b> <b>used</b> by high, middle and low achiever students in reading to develop reading skill. The subjects of this case study are students who have high, mid and low achiever in reading subject. There are two sources of data namely event and informants. Methods of collecting data are observation and interview. Methods of analyzing data are data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing/verification. And the object {{is focused on the}} learning <b>strategies</b> <b>used</b> by students to develop reading skill. There are three results, they are: 1) The learning <b>strategies</b> <b>used</b> by high achiever student to develop vocabulary skill are 7 meta-cognitive and 10 cognitive strategies. Then, the learning <b>strategies</b> <b>used</b> by mid achiever student to increase vocabulary skill are 4 meta-cognitive, 7 cognitive, and 2 socio-affective strategies. And the learning <b>strategies</b> <b>used</b> by low achiever student to enrich vocabulary skill are 4 meta-cognitive, 4 cognitive, and 1 socio-affective strategy. 2) The learning <b>strategies</b> <b>used</b> by high achiever student to develop pronunciation skill are 6 metacognitive and 7 cognitive strategies. Then, the learning <b>strategies</b> <b>used</b> by mid achiever student to advance pronunciation skill are 4 meta-cognitive, 4 cognitive and, 2 socio-affective strategies.
