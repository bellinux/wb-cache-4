5|$|In {{contrast}} to organic <b>solid-phase</b> synthesis and peptide synthesis, {{the synthesis of}} oligonucleotides proceeds best on non-swellable or low-swellable solid supports. The two most often used <b>solid-phase</b> materials are controlled pore glass (CPG) and macroporous polystyrene (MPPS).|$|E
5|$|Currently, <b>solid-phase</b> {{oligonucleotide}} synthesis {{is carried}} out automatically using computer-controlled instruments (oligonucleotide synthesizers) and is technically implemented in column, multi-well plate, and array formats. The column format is best suited for research and large scale applications where a high-throughput is not required. Multi-well plate format is designed specifically for high-throughput synthesis on small scale to satisfy the growing demand of industry and academia for synthetic oligonucleotides. A number of oligonucleotide synthesizers for small scale synthesis and medium to large scale synthesis are available commercially.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, {{peptides}} are synthesized by {{a variety}} of reactions. One of the most-used in <b>solid-phase</b> peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support. The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using combinatorial chemistry) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through high-throughput screening.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotide {{synthesis}} is {{the chemical}} synthesis of relatively short fragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure (sequence). The technique is extremely useful in current laboratory practice {{because it provides}} a rapid and inexpensive access to custom-made oligonucleotides of the desired sequence. Whereas enzymes synthesize DNA and RNA only in a 5' to 3' direction, chemical oligonucleotide synthesis does not have this limitation, although it is, most often, {{carried out in the}} opposite, 3' to 5' direction. Currently, the process is implemented as <b>solid-phase</b> synthesis using phosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from protected 2'-deoxynucleosides (dA, dC, dG, and T), ribonucleosides (A, C, G, and U), or chemically modified nucleosides, e.g. LNA or BNA.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{synthesized}} many three-dimensional DNA complexes {{that each}} have the connectivity of a polyhedron, {{such as a}} cube or octahedron, meaning that the DNA duplexes trace the edges of a polyhedron with a DNA junction at each vertex. The earliest demonstrations of DNA polyhedra were very work-intensive, requiring multiple ligations and <b>solid-phase</b> synthesis steps to create catenated polyhedra. Subsequent work yielded polyhedra whose synthesis was much easier. These include a DNA octahedron made from a long single strand designed to fold into the correct conformation, and a tetrahedron that can be produced from four DNA strands in one step, pictured {{at the top of}} this article.|$|E
5|$|In <b>solid-phase</b> synthesis, an {{oligonucleotide}} being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. The solid support is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the solid support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E

25|$|The Angeli–Rimini {{reaction}} {{has recently}} been applied in <b>solid-phase</b> synthesis with the sulfonamide covelently linked to a polystyrene solid support.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{discovery}} of RNA enzymes predates that of DNA enzymes the latter have some distinct advantages. DNA has better cost-effectiveness and DNA {{can be made with}} longer sequence length and can be made with higher purity in <b>Solid-phase</b> synthesis.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} {{changing}} to particles that are half as big, keeping {{the size of}} the column the same, will double the performance, but increase the required pressure by a factor of four. Larger particles are used in preparative HPLC (column diameters 5cm up to >30cm) and for non-HPLC applications such as <b>solid-phase</b> extraction.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{physical}} circumstances {{do not allow}} molecules to be studied in solution, {{and at the same}} time not by other spectroscopic techniques to an atomic level, either. In <b>solid-phase</b> media, such as crystals, microcrystalline powders, gels, anisotropic solutions, etc., it is in particular the dipolar coupling and chemical shift anisotropy that become dominant to the behaviour of the nuclear spin systems. In conventional solution-state NMR spectroscopy, these additional interactions would lead to a significant broadening of spectral lines. A variety of techniques allows establishing high-resolution conditions, that can, at least for 13C spectra, be comparable to solution-state NMR spectra.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundations}} for which ligand binding assay {{have been built}} {{are a result of}} Karl Landsteiner, in 1945, and his work on immunization of animals through the production of antibodies for certain proteins. Landsteiner’s work demonstrated that immunoassay technology allowed researchers to analyze at the molecular level. The first successful ligand binding assay was reported in 1960 by Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Solomon Berson. They investigated the binding interaction for insulin and an insulin-specific antibody, in addition to developing the first radioimmunoassay (RIA) for insulin. These discoveries provided precious information regarding both the sensitivity and specificity of protein hormones found within blood-based fluids. Yalow and Berson received the Nobel Prize in Medicine {{as a result of their}} advancements. Through the development of RIA technology, researchers have been able to move beyond the use of radioactivity, and instead, use liquid- and <b>solid-phase,</b> competitive, and immunoradiometric assays. As a direct result of these monumental findings, researchers have continued the advancement of ligand binding assays in many facets in the fields of biology, chemistry, and the like.|$|E
500|$|In March 1982 a {{practical}} course was {{hosted by the}} Department of Biochemistry, Technische Hochschule Darmstadt, Germany. M.H. Caruthers, M.J. Gait, H.G. Gassen, H.Koster, K. Itakura, and C. Birr among others attended. The program comprised practical work, lectures, and seminars on <b>solid-phase</b> chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides. A select group of 15 students attended and had an unprecedented opportunity to be instructed by the esteemed teaching staff.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, groups led by R. Letsinger and C. Reese {{developed}} a phosphotriester approach. The defining {{difference from the}} phosphodiester approach was {{the protection of the}} phosphate moiety in the building block 1 (Scheme 4) and in the product 3 with 2-cyanoethyl group. This precluded the formation of oligonucleotides branched at the internucleosidic phosphate. The higher selectivity of the method allowed the use of more efficient coupling agents and catalysts, which dramatically reduced the length of the synthesis. The method, initially developed for the solution-phase synthesis, was also implemented on low-cross-linked [...] "popcorn" [...] polystyrene, and later on controlled pore glass (CPG, see [...] "Solid support material" [...] below), which initiated a massive research effort in <b>solid-phase</b> synthesis of oligonucleotides and eventually led to the automation of the oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E
500|$|Thirty years later, {{this work}} inspired, independently, two {{research}} groups {{to adopt the}} H-phosphonate chemistry to the <b>solid-phase</b> synthesis using nucleoside H-phosphonate monoesters 7 as building blocks and pivaloyl chloride, 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (TPS-Cl), and other compounds as activators. [...] The practical implementation of H-phosphonate method resulted {{in a very short}} and simple synthetic cycle consisting of only two steps, detritylation and coupling (Scheme 2). Oxidation of internucleosidic H-phosphonate diester linkages in 8 to phosphodiester linkages in 9 with a solution of iodine in aqueous pyridine is carried {{out at the end of}} the chain assembly rather than as a step in the synthetic cycle. If desired, the oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions. Alternatively, 8 can be converted to phosphorothioate 10 or phosphoroselenoate 11 (X = Se), or oxidized by CCl4 in the presence of primary or secondary amines to phosphoramidate analogs 12. The method is very convenient in that various types of phosphate modifications (phosphate/phosphorothioate/phosphoramidate) may be introduced to the same oligonucleotide for modulation of its properties.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} <b>solid-phase</b> array is {{a collection}} of orderly microscopic [...] "spots", called features, each with thousands of identical and specific probes attached to a solid surface, such as glass, plastic or silicon biochip (commonly known as a genome chip, DNA chip or gene array). Thousands of these features can be placed in known locations on a single DNA microarray.|$|E

CHF holds a variety of historical artifacts related to chemistry and chemical education, including instrumentation. It has one of the best public collections of chemistry sets, with approximately 100 different sets from all over the world, including Australia and Germany.

2500|$|Her {{interest}} in interferon {{led her to}} approach Dr. Sidney Pestka at Roche Pharmaceutical Company and be hired at Hoffman-La Roche. For a time, the Changs endured the difficulties of a commuter marriage: Nancy {{lived and worked in}} Parsippany, NY; Tse Wen commuted to Pennsylvania each week to work at Centocor. [...] Eventually Nancy joined Centocor as a bench-level diagnostician. Her heart was still in research, and she took part in Centocor's involvement in therapeutic research. She brought in several new projects, including HIV/AIDS research. [...] Nancy’s team participated in a consortium, which sequenced the HIV genome structure. Nancy was instrumental in developing the first diagnostic assay to detect HIV infection by employing a peptide segment of HIV as the <b>solid-phase</b> antigen in the immunoassay. [...] She was Director of Research at Centocor from 1982 to 1986.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} reported {{synthesis of}} a rotaxane in 1967 {{relied on the}} statistical probability that if two halves of a dumbbell-shaped molecule were reacted {{in the presence of}} a macrocycle that some small percentage would connect through the ring. To obtain a reasonable quantity of rotaxane, the macrocycle was attached to a <b>solid-phase</b> support and treated with both halves of the dumbbell 70 times and then severed from the support to give a 6% yield. However, the synthesis of rotaxanes has advanced significantly and efficient yields can be obtained by preorganizing the components utilizing hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic forces, covalent bonds, or coulombic interactions. The three most common strategies to synthesize rotaxane are [...] "capping", [...] "clipping", and [...] "slipping", though others do exist. Recently, Leigh and co-workers described a new pathway to mechanically interlocked architectures involving a transition-metal center that can catalyse a reaction through the cavity of a macrocycle.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} post-September 11 drive towards {{increased}} capability in {{homeland security}} and public health preparedness, traditional GC-MS units with transmission quadrupole mass spectrometers, {{as well as those}} with cylindrical ion trap (CIT-MS) and toroidal ion trap (T-ITMS) mass spectrometers have been modified for field portability and near real-time detection of chemical warfare agents (CWA) such as sarin, soman, and VX. [...] These complex and large GC-MS systems have been modified and configured with resistively heated low thermal mass (LTM) gas chromatographs that reduce analysis time to less than ten percent of the time required in traditional laboratory systems. [...] Additionally, the systems are smaller, and more mobile, including units that are mounted in mobile analytical laboratories (MAL), such as those used by the United States Marine Corps Chemical and Biological Incident Response Force MAL and other similar laboratories, and systems that are hand-carried by two-person teams or individuals, much ado to the smaller mass detectors. [...] Depending on the system, the analytes can be introduced via liquid injection, desorbed from sorbent tubes through a thermal desorption process, or with <b>solid-phase</b> micro extraction (SPME).|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{poppy seed}} {{consumption}} does {{not serve as}} a defense for heroin consumption. [...] This is because a unique metabolite (6-monoacetylmorphine) is produced from heroin use that is never produced from consuming any other substance, even other opiates like the ones present in poppy seeds. [...] Modern tests can thus readily determine whether it was heroin or some other opiate that was ingested, should someone who had used heroin try to claim he or she merely ate poppy seeds. It is widely believed {{that there is no}} way to distinguish between poppy seeds and any other kind of opiate. However a study published by the University of Connecticut's Department of Chemistry, proposed that Thebaine could be used as a marker of poppy seed consumption. They examined the urine of test subjects given 11grams of poppy seeds, the urine of heroin users and clean urine spiked with thebaine, as a reference for GC-MS. They also tested street heroin, 1 morphine tablet and 1 codeine tablet. Urine specimens were screened by EMIT and confirmed for thebaine by GC-MS using a <b>solid-phase</b> extraction method. Only the subjects who had consumed the poppy seeds had thebaine in their urine, with concentrations ranging from 2 to 81ng/mL with a limit of detection of 0.5ng/mL. Thebaine was not detected in any of the tested powdered drugs (street heroin, morphine tablet, codeine tablet) or the urine of the heroin users.|$|E
