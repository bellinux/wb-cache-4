5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
25|$|Social {{psychology}} is the {{scientific study of}} how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In this definition, scientific refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms thoughts, feelings, and behaviors include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may be imagined or implied <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms.|$|E
25|$|The {{lumped element}} model, for instance, <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> think of {{circuits}} {{in terms of}} components with connections between them, with signals flowing instantaneously along the connections. This is a useful view, but not the only possible one. A different ontology arises {{if we need to}} attend to the electrodynamics in the device: Here signals propagate at finite speed and an object (like a resistor) that was previously viewed as a single component with an I/O behavior may now have {{to be thought of as}} an extended medium through which an electromagnetic wave flows.|$|E

25|$|Boyer moves {{outside the}} leading {{currents}} in mainstream cognitive psychology and <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can use evolutionary biology {{to unravel the}} relevant mental architecture. Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's theory of evolution. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible {{to think that this}} is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those reproductive ends.|$|E
25|$|The way Kant <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should {{deal with}} this {{dialectic}} is through {{an appeal to the}} two perspectives we can take on ourselves. This is the same sort of move he made earlier in this section. On one perspective, the perspective of the world of understanding, we are free, whereas from the other, the perspective of the world of the senses or appearances, natural laws determine everything that happens. There is no contradiction because the claim to freedom applies to one world, and the claim of the laws of nature determining everything applies to the other. The claims do not conflict because they have different targets.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "This macabre musical {{about a young}} bridegroom who mistakenly weds a girl from beyond the grave is an endearingly schizoid Frankenstein of a movie, by turns relentlessly high-spirited and darkly poignant." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it [...] "A wondrous flight of fancy, a stop-motion-animated treat brimming with imaginative characters, evocative sets, sly humor, inspired songs and a genuine whimsy that seldom finds its way into today's movies." [...] Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The variety of its cadaverous style is never less than inspired; never has the human skull's natural grin been redeployed so exhaustively for yuks." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying [...] "As an achievement in macabre visual wizardry, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride has to be reckoned some sort of marvel." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "Cinema's reinvigorated fixation with the living dead <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are in the grip of an impossible longing, or perhaps it's just another movie cycle running its course. Whatever the case, there is something heartening about Mr. Burton's love for bones and rot here, if only because it suggests, despite some recent evidence, that he is not yet ready to abandon his own dark kingdom." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "What makes Corpse Bride sing, ultimately, is the breadth of imagination that it demonstrates; creating a cluttered, textured and mysteriously beautiful world that we're loathe to leave at the end." ...|$|E

2500|$|McGrew {{suggests}} {{a definition of}} culture that he finds scientifically useful for studying primate culture. He points out that scientists {{do not have access}} to the subjective thoughts or knowledge of non-human primates. Thus, if culture is defined in terms of knowledge, then scientists are severely limited in their attempts to study primate culture. Instead of defining culture as a kind of knowledge, McGrew <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> view culture as a process. He lists six steps in the process: ...|$|E

2500|$|Stevens <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> live in {{the tension}} between the shapes we take as the world acts upon us and the ideas of order that our {{imagination}} imposes upon the world. The world influences us in our most normal activities: [...] "The dress of a woman of Lhassa, / In its place, / Is an invisible element of that place / Made visible." [...] Likewise, were we to place a jar on a hill in Tennessee, we would impose an order onto the landscape.|$|E
2500|$|The {{piece is}} a {{meditation}} on death. Pärt's biographer, Paul Hillier, suggests that [...] "how we live depends on our relationship with death: how we make music depends on our relationship to silence." [...] It is significant that the piece begins and ends with silence—that the silence is written in the score. This silence creates a frame around the piece and has spiritual significance. It <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> come from silence, and return to silence; it reminds us that before we were born and after we die we are silent {{with respect to this}} world.|$|E
2500|$|Moltmann {{stresses}} the perichoresis of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This {{is to say}} that he believes the three dwell in one another. The three persons are differentiated in their characteristics, but related in their original exchange. Moltmann seeks to defeat a monotheistic Christianity that is being used as a tool for political and clerical absolute monarchism. He believes the doctrine of the Trinity should be developed as the [...] "true theological doctrine of freedom." [...] He <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> [...] "cease to understand God monotheistically as the one, absolute subject, but instead see him in a trinitarian sense as the unity of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit." ...|$|E

2500|$|This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{create a}} {{conditional}} prior {{of the mean}} on the unknown variance, with a hyperparameter specifying {{the mean of the}} pseudo-observations associated with the prior, and another parameter specifying the number of pseudo-observations. [...] This number serves as a scaling parameter on the variance, making it possible to control the overall variance of the mean relative to the actual variance parameter. [...] The prior for the variance also has two hyperparameters, one specifying the sum of squared deviations of the pseudo-observations associated with the prior, and another specifying once again the number of pseudo-observations. [...] Note that each of the priors has a hyperparameter specifying the number of pseudo-observations, and in each case this controls the relative variance of that prior. [...] These are given as two separate hyperparameters so that the variance (aka the confidence) of the two priors can be controlled separately.|$|E
2500|$|His {{other main}} {{conceptual}} contribution {{is the idea}} of the epoche: setting aside metaphysical questions and observing phenomena in and of themselves, without any bias or commitments {{on the part of the}} investigator. [...] The epoche, also known as phenomenological reduction or bracketing, involves approaching a phenomenon or phenomena from a neutral standpoint, instead of with our own particular attitudes. [...] In performing this reduction, whatever phenomenon or phenomena we approach are understood in themselves, rather than from our own perspectives. [...] In the field of religious studies, a contemporary advocate of the phenomenological method is Ninian Smart. He <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should perform the epoche as a means to engage in cross-cultural studies. [...] In doing so, we can take the beliefs, symbols, rituals etc. of the other from within their own perspective, rather than imposing ours on them. [...] Another earlier scholar who employs the phenomenological method for studying religion is Gerardus van der Leeuw. [...] In his Religion in Essence and Manifestation (1933), he outlines what a phenomenology of religion should look like: ...|$|E
2500|$|Miscellanies also {{presented}} themselves as performing an important cultural or curatorial role, by preserving unbound sheets, fragments and ephemera which {{otherwise would have}} been lost – and thus offering a unique insight into the vibrant literary life of the 18th century. A prime example of such curiosity-shop publications is The fugitive miscellany: a collection of fugitive pieces in prose and verse (1774), which includes nonsense rhymes, epitaphs, inscriptions, poems made out of newspaper cuttings, as well as wills written in verse. Late twentieth-century criticism has drawn attention to the cultural and literary importance of these non-canonical, lesser-known and ephemeral kinds of popular verse – such as the recent discovery of a poem spuriously attributed to John Milton, “An Extempore upon a Faggot”. [...] As the most prolific source of anonymous or pseudonymous publication, miscellanies provide insight into the unconventional history of English literature. Roger Lonsdale notes in his influential anthology, The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse (1984): “One of the most interesting poets [...] is the ubiquitous ‘Anonymous’, whose voice almost never registers in conventional literary history”. Crucially, he <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would know more about “the landscape of eighteenth-century poetry” if more attention was paid to “the innumerable miscellanies by several hands”.|$|E

2500|$|Francis {{has been}} in the {{forefront}} of insisting on the importance of helping refugees. His suggestion “to not raise walls but bridges" [...] was widely interpreted by the media as addressed to President Trump, and repeated by Francis with regards to Trump's immigration policy. [...] Francis has said that “to speak properly of our own rights, we need to broaden our perspective and to hear the plea of other peoples and other regions than those of our own country” (EG 190). More broadly he is concerned that [...] "a globalization of indifference has developed; ... the culture of prosperity deadens us; ... those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us" [...] (EG 54).He <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should find Jesus in others, in their faces, voices, pleas – redoubling our efforts to live in fraternity (EG 90). Lay ministries must go beyond serving our own community and show real commitment to transform every aspect of life in society with Jesus' values (EG 94). Only in this way can we respond to the evangelical mandate that we have God's love in us, if we do not refuse help to those in need (1 Jn 3:17 in EG 187).|$|E
2500|$|Giddens' {{theory of}} {{structuration}} explores {{the question of}} whether it is individuals or social forces that shape our social reality. He eschews extreme positions, arguing that although people are not entirely free to choose their own actions, and their knowledge is limited, they nonetheless are the agency which reproduces the social structure and leads to social change. His ideas find an echo in the philosophy of the modernist poet Wallace Stevens who <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> live in the tension between the shapes we take as the world acts upon us, and the ideas of order that our imagination imposes upon the world. Giddens writes that the connection between structure and action is a fundamental element of social theory, structure and agency are a duality that cannot be conceived of apart from one another and his main argument is contained in his expression [...] "duality of structure". At a basic level, this means that people make society, but are at the same time constrained by it. Action and structure cannot be analysed separately, as structures are created, maintained and changed through actions, while actions are given meaningful form only through the background of the structure: the line of causality runs in both directions making it impossible to determine what is changing what. In Giddens own words (from New rules...) : ...|$|E
