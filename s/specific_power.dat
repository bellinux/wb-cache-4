25|$|All {{commercial}} hybrid supercapacitors are asymmetric.

In such systems the faradaic pseudocapacitance electrode with their higher capacitance provides high specific energy while the non-faradaic EDLC electrode enables high <b>specific</b> <b>power.</b> An advantage of the hybrid-type supercapacitors compared with symmetrical EDLC's is their higher specific capacitance value {{as well as their}} higher rated voltage and correspondingly their higher specific energy.|$|E

25|$|Surprisingly, perhaps, {{considering}} the product particles not spherical, pastillation using a Rotoform steel-belt pastillator is gaining ground as a urea particle-forming {{process as a}} result of development work by Stamicarbon in collaboration with Sandvik Process Systems (Germany). Single-machine capacity is limited to 175 t/d, but the machines are simple and need little maintenance, <b>specific</b> <b>power</b> consumption is much lower than for granulation, and the product is very uniform. The robustness of the product appears to make up for its non-spherical shape.|$|E
25|$|In some thorium {{breeding}} scenarios, {{the intermediate}} product protactinium-233 would {{be removed from}} the reactor and allowed to decay into highly pure uranium-233, an attractive bomb-making material. More modern designs propose to use a lower <b>specific</b> <b>power</b> or a separate large thorium breeding blanket. This dilutes the protactinium {{to such an extent that}} few protactinium atoms absorb a second neutron or, via a (n, 2n) reaction (in which an incident neutron is not absorbed but instead knocks a neutron out of the nucleus), generate uranium-232. Because U-232 has a short half-life and its decay chain contains hard gamma emitters, it makes the isotopic mix of uranium less attractive for bomb-making. This benefit would come with the added expense of a larger fissile inventory or a 2-fluid design with a large quantity of blanket salt.|$|E
25|$|The load that {{a driver}} {{presents}} to an amplifier {{consists of a}} complex electrical impedance—a combination of resistance and both capacitive and inductive reactance, which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), {{and the effects of}} air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a <b>specific</b> <b>power</b> into an ideal resistive load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.|$|E

25|$|Stirling engines, {{especially}} those that run on small temperature differentials, are quite large {{for the amount of}} power that they produce (i.e., they have low <b>specific</b> <b>power).</b> This is primarily due to the heat transfer coefficient of gaseous convection, which limits the heat flux that can be attained in a typical cold heat exchanger to about 500W/(m2·K), and in a hot heat exchanger to about 500–5000W/(m2·K). Compared with internal combustion engines, this makes it more challenging for the engine designer to transfer heat {{into and out of the}} working gas. Because of the thermal efficiency the required heat transfer grows with lower temperature difference, and the heat exchanger surface (and cost) for 1kW output grows with (1/ΔT)2. Therefore, the specific cost of very low temperature difference engines is very high. Increasing the temperature differential and/or pressure allows Stirling engines to produce more power, assuming the heat exchangers are designed for the increased heat load, and can deliver the convected heat flux necessary.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{carburettors}} {{was calculated}} {{to give a}} higher <b>specific</b> <b>power</b> output, due to the lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems. However, the Merlin's float controlled carburettor meant that both Spitfires and Hurricanes were unable to pitch nose down into a steep dive. The contemporary Bf 109E, which had direct fuel injection, could [...] "bunt" [...] into a high-power dive to escape attack, leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been {{forced out of the}} carburettor's float chamber by the effects of negative g-force (g). RAF fighter pilots soon learned to [...] "half-roll" [...] their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents. [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice", a restrictor in the fuel supply line to restrict flow together with a diaphragm fitted in the float chamber to contain fuel under negative G, went some way towards curing the fuel starvation in a dive; however, at less than maximum power a fuel-rich mixture still resulted. Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet {{from the bottom of the}} S.U. carburettor to exactly halfway up the side, which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g.|$|E
