5|$|Federalist state legislatures, {{primarily}} those {{north of}} the Potomac River, sent the Kentucky General Assembly negative responses to the resolutions. Nicholas convinced Jefferson that Kentucky should adopt {{a second set of}} resolutions affirming the first, lest the lack of a reply be seen acquiescence. Jefferson refused to compose these resolutions, maintaining that there were sufficiently talented individuals in Kentucky to compose them and fearing <b>still</b> <b>that</b> he would be discovered as the author of the first set. Breckinridge, chosen Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives {{at the outset of the}} 1799 session, took on the task, drafting resolutions reasserting the original principles and endorsing nullification. The resolutions unanimously passed the House. The Federalist minority in the Senate opposed them, especially the endorsement of nullification, but that chamber also adopted the resolutions as written. Breckinridge's presumed authorship of the original resolutions and his subsequent defense of them caused his popularity to soar in Kentucky.|$|E

The gallery, which overflows into the royal apartments, contains works by Raphael, Titian, Perugino (Lamentation over the Dead Christ), Correggio, Peter Paul Rubens, and Pietro da Cortona.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the conflict, Bols {{retained}} his temporary rank {{of major}} general (and his war substantive rank was increased to colonel) and with it command of the 6th Airborne Division. On 21 September 1945 he traveled to Egypt with his HQ staff, arriving shortly after at his final destination, Tel Aviv. The rest of the division followed. He commanded the division whilst it conducted peace-keeping duties in Palestine. He attended the Imperial Defence College the following year, before returning to his division in December 1946, succeeding Major General James Cassels who had been in command. After almost three years service in the Middle East, Bols retired from the British Army with the honorary rank of major general (his actual regimental rank was <b>still</b> <b>that</b> of lieutenant colonel) on 8 January 1948.|$|E
25|$|This stage {{began its}} {{evolution}} as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European {{that had lost}} its laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels {{as well as one}} or two overlong vowels. The consonant system was <b>still</b> <b>that</b> of PIE minus palatovelars and laryngeals, but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from PIE proper. Mutual intelligibility might have still existed with other descendants of PIE, {{but it would have been}} strained, and the period marked the definitive break of Germanic from the other Indo-European languages and the beginning of Germanic proper, containing most of the sound changes that are now held to define this branch distinctively. This stage contained various consonant and vowel shifts, the loss of the contrastive accent inherited from PIE for a uniform accent on the first syllable of the word root, and the beginnings of the reduction of the resulting unstressed syllables.|$|E

25|$|On 28 (or 20) May Lieutenant James Robertson (Acting), {{took two}} of Fawns boats on a cutting out {{expedition}} to capture Spanish privateer schooner and three merchant vessels anchored {{under the protection}} of two batteries at the NE end of Porto Rico. The crew of the schooner ran her ashore and abandoned her. To get her off Robertson had to nail sheet lead over holes in her bows. As she pulled away he had the prize crew fire her guns at the privateersmen who were firing small arms from the shore. Suddenly the magazine on the prize exploded, throwing all but Robertson and two seamen into the water. The explosion killed one man, and injured four others. <b>Still,</b> <b>that</b> evening Robertson was able to rejoin Fawn with the schooner and the three merchant vessels. Unfortunately a squall the next day sank the captured schooner, killing five men.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, Abkhazia {{reported}} that around 10 am of that day, it had shot down another spy plane over {{the village of}} Gagida in Gali district. Georgian television station Mze TV {{reported that}} this had been confirmed by Georgian State Minister for Reintegration Temur Iakobashvili, while Georgian agency InterPressNews reported that an eyewitness had seen how an unmanned aeroplane flew over the coastline {{near the village of}} Primorskoe, followed by a jet, which then shot down the unmanned plane. <b>Still,</b> <b>that</b> day the Georgian Ministry of Defence initially denied that its spy plane had been shot down, stating that it was not conducting any flights over Abkhazia, and that Abkhazian reports were misinformation. In an interview to Mze TV, State Minister for Reintegration Iakobashvili stated that Abkhazia did not possess the technical capability for shooting down unmanned aircraft. According to Iakobashvili there was information that an incident involving an explosion had taken place in the Gali district, and he confirmed that eyewitnesses had seen aircraft, but since Georgia could not send people to the site, it was impossible to determine what had happened. He denounced what had taken place as further attempts to stage a military provocation.|$|E
25|$|Junior {{teams were}} {{originally}} {{banned from the}} race on safety grounds, but the pressure {{to allow them to}} compete resulted in the introduction of stages in 1953, originally two, but soon changed to three, with compulsory overnight stops at Newbury, Marlow and Ham, just below Teddington lock. There were two crews in the junior category in 1953, but this had risen to over 50 by 1961, and in 1970 there were 100 junior crews. Numbers after that gradually declined, but a schools trophy was set up in 1975, and school teams now account for most of the junior entries. Women were barred from the race at first, and it was not until 1971 that Sheila Burnett from Cambridge Canoe Club finished the race with Colin Dickens, only to be disqualified when it was discovered that she was a woman. In 1973, Anne-Marie Evans entered the race under a false name, in partnership with Jonathan Hutt, and was awarded a certificate for finishing, but the official policy was <b>still</b> <b>that</b> women should not enter the race. By the late 1970s attitudes had changed, and the first all-female crew finished the race in 31 hours 6 minutes in 1976. Trophies for ladies and mixed doubles classes were introduced in 1980. In 1995, Danielle Sellwood and Sandra Troop set the women’s record at 18 hours 47 minutes, and in 1997 Danielle Sellwood was placed third overall, becoming the first woman to hold the civilian trophy. A class for junior ladies was introduced in 1976, and a junior mixed doubles class in 1981.|$|E

[...] As the text of the amendment focuses on the government's abilities to make laws, it is the government's actions and motives, not the actual actions of citizens, which are proscribed by the Amendment.

500|$|Unlike {{many other}} Thanhouser productions, no {{details on the}} {{director}} or cast are cited by Q. David Bowers. Prompt Payment was likely shot at the Thanhouser Studio in New Rochelle, New York and Stealing a Ride was likely shot in the surrounding area. Identification of the cast for Prompt Payment may be possible due to a surviving film <b>still</b> <b>that</b> was used in a Thanhouser advertisement. Both films are listed as comedies, despite the more serious nature and dramatic element of two children being lost in the woods during the winter. A detail in a review from The New York Dramatic Mirror states that the children are tracked [...] "to shelter behind some rocks, where the boy had built a fire by which the little girl had gone to sleep. After reaching home each youngster was spanked, but the punishment was eased by hearty kisses." [...] The films are presumed lost because neither film is known to exist by any archive or collector.|$|E
500|$|On the contrary, Girlschool's {{change of}} musical style in 1984 and their sudden predilection for the US market were not well {{received}} by the British press and by their fans at home. The change of attitude and image, exemplified by the music video for [...] "Running Wild" [...] on rotation on MTV, which showed the girls playing with heavy make-up, combed hair and fancy costumes, imitating a trendy American glam outfit, alienated the love of British fans, whose perception of the band was <b>still</b> <b>that</b> of roughneck companions to Motörhead, instead of competitors of Mötley Crüe and Ratt. In the time span of two years, Girlschool passed from headliner act to having serious difficulty to find a gig in the UK: [...] "Nobody seems to want us in Britain anymore", confessed McAuliffe to journalist Malcolm Dome in 1984. The return of Girlschool {{to the sound of}} their beginnings came too late to win back the large fan base of their heyday and the band fell to cult status already in the late 1980s.|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} types of solar {{distillation}} <b>stills</b> <b>that</b> have been devised for converting available brackish or waste water into potable water. The horizontal basin-type still is one of these. And because of its low productivity, it is not commonly used. On the other hand, tilted solar stills heat up more rapidly, operate at higher mean temperatures, have lower thermal capacity, and produce somewhat more potable water. There are also other types of solar <b>stills</b> <b>that</b> have been evolved, such as multistage flash distillation stills and solar concentrator stills.

Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that [...] "the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul." [...] The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: [...] "I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying <b>still</b> <b>that</b> the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too."

500|$|Leaf {{did well}} in the preseason and led the Chargers to victory {{in the first two}} regular-season games. The Chargers won the season opener on September 6, 1998, 16–14 over the Buffalo Bills despite {{mistakes}} from Leaf such as fumbling his first snap and throwing two interceptions; Buffalo penalties voided two would-be interceptions from Leaf. In the game, Leaf's 6-yard touchdown pass to Bryan <b>Still</b> <b>that</b> followed a 67-yard pass to Still gave San Diego a 10–0 lead. However, late in the game, San Diego fell behind 14–13 after a Leaf interception. Leaf completed 16 of 31 passes for 192 yards in the opener and 13 of 24 passes for 179 yards (with 31 rushing yards in 7 carries) in the second game, a 13–7 win over the Tennessee Oilers. [...] In the third game of the season on September 20, Leaf completed only one of 15 passes for four yards, threw two interceptions and fumbled four times (losing three) in a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Thursday before that game, Leaf was hospitalized for a viral infection. Leaf later said that infected turf fibers entered his skin and lymph glands.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} {{on the actual}} {{production}} of the film, but the The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer provided {{some insight into the}} production. The review and the synopsis are at odds on several aspects including on whether or not the man was fired for drunkenness or for no reason. In this case, it can be assumed that a drunken state was either not depicted or done inadequately. The reviewer states the [...] "impossible parts of the plot are gracefully omitted" [...] in reference to the abduction of the little girl played by Marie Eline and the overpowering of the chauffeur. Here the synopsis also differs, saying the girl is enticed away instead of being kidnapped. Though the overpowering of the chauffeur is required and acknowledged in the synopsis, the reviewer makes clear the actual method is not depicted. The reviewer also had a keen eye for detail, stating that the passengers disembarked {{into the middle of the}} street instead of on the sidewalk. The final scene's setting is captured in a surviving film <b>still</b> <b>that</b> shows the little girl persuading her parents to hire Jim in the police station with three officers looking on in the background.|$|E
