50|$|Community ecology or <b>synecology</b> is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} between species in communities on many spatial and temporal scales, including the distribution, structure, abundance, demography, and interactions between coexisting populations. The primary focus of community ecology is on the interactions between populations as determined by specific genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Community ecology has its origin in European plant sociology. Modern community ecology examines patterns such as variation in species richness, equitability, productivity and food web structure (see community structure); it also examines processes such as predator-prey population dynamics, succession, and community assembly.|$|E
5000|$|The older term, {{autecology}} (from Greek: αὐτο, auto, [...] "self"; οίκος, oikos, [...] "household"; and λόγος, logos, [...] "knowledge"), {{refers to}} {{roughly the same}} field of study as population ecology. It derives from the division of ecology into autecology—the study of individual species {{in relation to the}} environment—and synecology—the study of groups of organisms in relation to the environment—or community ecology. Odum (1959, p. 8) considered that <b>synecology</b> should be divided into population ecology, community ecology, and ecosystem ecology, defining autecology as essentially [...] "species ecology." [...] However, for some time biologists have recognized that the more significant level of organization of a species is a population, because at this level the species gene pool is most coherent. In fact, Odum regarded [...] "autecology" [...] as no longer a [...] "present tendency" [...] in ecology (i.e., an archaic term), although included [...] "species ecology"—studies emphasizing life history and behavior as adaptations to the environment of individual organisms or species—as one of four subdivisions of ecology.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1868 and 1870, Möbius was {{commissioned}} by the Ministry of Agricultural Affairs in Prussia to conduct research on the Bay of Kiel oyster beds. At the time, the oysters were being gathered from the natural beds and sold at expensive prices to the wealthy elite. Once the railroad was constructed and more opportunities for exportation arose, the demand for the oysters grew exponentially. In turn, the Ministry tasked Möbius with exploring the potential for further exploitation of the beds. Möbius's research resulted in two landmark publications: Über Austern- und Miesmuschelzucht und Hebung derselben an der norddeutschen Küste (1870, in English: On oyster and blue mussel farming in coastal areas of Northern Germany), and Die Auster und die Austernwirtschaft (in English: Oyster and oyster farming), in which he concluded that oyster farming was not a realistic option for Northern Germany. More importantly, he was first to describe in detail the interactions between the different organisms in the ecosystem of the oyster bank, coining the term [...] "biocenose".

While the structure (physiognomy) of these stands is very homogenous and dominated by few species, the flora is heterogeneous, since ecotonal areas, where heaths are most frequently developed, represent a contact zone of elements of different syntaxa. Due to an abrupt reduction in pasture activities strong encroachments of shrubs and trees have become common, which additionally contribute to the floristic heterogeneity of the heaths. Although the identification and circumscription together with <b>synecology</b> and synchorology of heaths in general are more or less easily understood and straightforward, their floristic affinities, in relation to structure homogeneity and syndynamics, are complicated, which led to the proposal of several synsystematic schemes depending on interpretation of the relationship between flora and structure of stands. Dinaric heaths are classified into three classes, Erico-Pinetea, Vaccinio-Piceetea and Festuco-Brometea and a classification scheme is proposed together with nomenclatorial revision of the analyzed heaths with dwarf ericaceous shrubs and Alpine juniper (Juniperus alpina) in the Dinaric Alps...|$|E

In order {{to address this issue}} and to define the <b>synecology,</b> syndynamics and syntaxonomy of calcareous grasslands in this area, we considered 127 phytosociological relevés. Our sampling was performed in the Lazio region according to a stratified sampling scheme based on homogeneous land units, defined by means of an ecological land classification process. We analyzed the vegetation data using multivariate methods. Two new associations, whose typical aspects occur in the mesotemperate phytoclimatic belt, were identified:Erysimo pseudorhaetici-Dasypyretum villosi (Taenianthero-Aegilopion) and Scorpiuro muricati-Brometum erecti (Phleo-Bromion). Phytoclimatic belts within the Submediterranean region cause a significant degree of differentiation within Scorpiuro-Brometum, which was described at the subassociation and variant levels. The overall relevance of therophytes represents the most important feature distinguishing Scorpiuro-Brometum from the published Bromus erectus associations. At a finer scale, the presence of the two physiognomically different grassland communities is related to different soil types.

40|$|Individual planktonic {{microfossil}} species, or assemblage {{groups of}} different species, {{are often used}} to, qualitatively and/or quantitatively, reconstruct past (sub) surface-water conditions of the world's oceans and seas. Until now, little information has been available on the surface sediment distribution patterns and paleoenvironmental reconstruction potential of coccolith, calcareous dinoflagellate cyst and organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst assemblages of the South and equatorial Atlantic, especially at the species level. This paper (i) summarizes the distributions of these three phytoplanktonic microfossil groups in numerous Atlantic surface sediments from 20 °N- 50 °S and 30 °E- 65 °W and determines {{their relationship with the}} physicochemical and trophic conditions of the overlying (sub) surface-waters, and (ii) determines the <b>synecology</b> of the three phytoplankton groups by carrying out statistical analyses (i. e. detrended and canonical correspondence analyses) on all groups simultaneously. Ecological relationships are additionally strengthened by statistically comparing the distribution patterns of the phytoplankton groups with those of planktonic foraminifera (Pflaumann et al. 1996; Niebler et al. 1998), as the ecological preferences of the latter are much better known. Many of the analyzed phytoplanktonic microfossil species or groups of species in the surface sediments do show restricted distributions which primarily reflect the environmental conditions of the upper water masses above them (e. g. sea-surface temperature, productivity, stratification). The acquired 'reference' data sets are large and diverse enough to allow future development of transfer functions for the reconstruction of past surface-water conditions, and show that there is still an enormous paleoenvironmental reconstruction potential concealed in many fossil coccolith and dinoflagellate cyst assemblages...|$|E

But due to taphonomic and diagenetic processes only palaeocommunities are describable from {{the fossil record}} (BOY 1998). In this sense palaeoecosystems are complex interacting systems of palaeocommunities and abiotic environmental parameters. They show the following biotic features (SCHULZE & MOONEY 1993, BOY 1998) : ecological structure, ecological function and biodiversity. The ecological structure is determined by energy flow, what means {{that it is an}} interaction between all biotic components of the system (= <b>synecology)</b> and can be described through the trophic interactions (food chains, predator-prey interactions). Because of time averaging, succession is the only detectable (palaeo-) ecological function (BOY 1998). Palaeoecosystems analyses means therefore to investigate the biodiversity, trophic interaction and succession within and between palaeocommunities in relation to the abiotic environment. An important precondition for the analyses of palaeoecosystems is the reconstruction of the palaeocommunity. To reveal the taphonomic processes (diagenesis, time averaging, biostratinomy,) is an important first step. To detect autochthon/parautochthon components within a taphocoenosis a new method is presented which is based on teeth replacement quotients of cyprinid fishes and allows to distinguish sediments from permanent water bodies with an autochthon fish community (limnic and fluvial sediments) from sediments of temporal water bodies (pedogenic sediments, pond and floodplain sediments) with parautochthon/allochthon fishes.

Keyword analysis offered insight into forest ecology research areas of interest, while the abundance of less frequent keywords suggested a lack of continuity in research and a wide disparity in the focus of forest ecology research. The top 100 keywords in the keyword analysis were almost all included in the top 20 research areas in the article analysis, so one could conclude that keyword frequency analysis is consistent with article research area analysis. Their difference is the former is concrete and the latter is abstract.Appendix A(TS = (habitats) or TS = (species diversity) or TS = (biodiversity) or TS = (species richness) or TS = (environmental factors) or TS = (ecosystems) or TS = (plant communities) or TS = (landscape) or TS = (phenology) or TS = (environmental degradation) or TS = (plant) or TS = (populations) or TS = (animal) or TS = (ecological disturbance) or TS = (landscape) or TS = (<b>synecology)</b> or TS = (palaeo ecology) or TS = (community) or TS = (biogeography) or TS = (population) or TS = (ecotypes) or TS = (predator prey relationships) or TS = (microbial) or TS = (freshwater) or TS = (food webs) or TS = (lowland areas) or TS = (restoration) or TS = (fire) or TS = (food chains) or TS = (autecology) or TS = (marine) or TS = (chemical) or TS = (human) or TS = (bioenergetics) or TS = (ecological balance) or TS = (bio coenosis) or TS = (microenvironments) or TS = (dendro ecology) or TS = (climate) or TS = (soils) or TS = (physiography) or TS = (carbon balance) or TS = (nutrient cycling) and (TS = (forest).|$|E
40|$|Factors {{determining}} the total and relative abundance of oribatid mite communities {{have been well}} described. In contrast, the factors that determine species composition and species richness of this fauna are far less understood. We tested the hypothesis that oribatid species richness would increase in the secondary succession from heather moorland to birch woodland. This secondary succession {{is associated with a}} change in humus form from mor to mull and a complete change in the composition of the understorey vegetation. However, in contrast to most studies of the response of oribatid mites to secondary succession, the invasion of birch can occur without large-scale physical disturbance of the moorland. Our study examined oribatid communities in three replicates of heather moorland, 49 - and 58 -year-old birch stands at two sites in the Scottish uplands. There was a clear increase in population density and species richness of the oribatids per unit area, and a change in relative abundance of the species, in the birch compared with the heather moorland. However, multivariate analyses indicated that only a few species contributed to the separation of samples based upon changes in relative abundance. Overall, just two and four more oribatid species were found in the oldest birch compared with the heather moorland at the two sites. Some of these species have been found in heather moorland elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Consequently, our results suggest that many oribatid species are able to persist in two distinctly different habitats in this area. Further, a gradual onset of secondary succession arising from tree invasion, as opposed to, for example, the cessation of agriculture or tree harvesting, may not lead to an overall increase in oribatid species richness in this environment. Our results support <b>synecology</b> studies conducted in Europe that indicate that many oribatid species are able to persist {{in a wide range of}} humus forms and vegetation types...|$|E
