5|$|The {{political}} {{fallout from the}} disastrous Battle of Greece led to Blamey's appointment as deputy commander in Chief Middle East Command in April 1941. However, to ensure that command would not pass to Blamey {{in the event of}} <b>something</b> <b>happening</b> to Wavell, the British government promoted Sir Henry Maitland Wilson to general in June. Soon afterwards, Wavell was replaced by General Sir Claude Auchinleck. Blamey was subsequently promoted to the same rank on 24 September 1941, becoming only the fourth Australian to reach this rank, after Monash, Chauvel and White. During the Syrian campaign against the Vichy French, Blamey took decisive action to resolve the command difficulties caused by Wilson's attempt to direct the fighting from the King David Hotel in Jerusalem by interposing Lavarack's I Corps headquarters.|$|E

Olivia receives an email from someone who claims to be John Scott, listing an address for her to visit. Upon arriving she finds boxes, one of which contains a group of toads. At the lab, Walter finds that the toads contain a [...] "psychoactive compound", a hallucinogen that affects the fear center of the brain. They conclude that Mark’s brain was so convinced of <b>something</b> <b>happening</b> to his body that actual physical marks appeared. Mark was infected with a large dosage, leading them to attribute his death to murder.|$|E
2500|$|First, it is {{not clear}} where the {{interaction}} would take place. For example, burning one's finger causes pain. Apparently there is some chain of events, leading from the burning of skin, to the stimulation of nerve endings, to <b>something</b> <b>happening</b> in the peripheral nerves of one's body that lead to one's brain, to <b>something</b> <b>happening</b> in a particular part of one's brain, and finally resulting in the sensation of pain. But pain is not supposed to be spatially locatable. It might be responded that the pain [...] "takes place in the brain." [...] But evidently, the pain is in the finger. This may not be a devastating criticism.|$|E

Graham states, [...] "ecosystems {{in which there are}} high levels of nutrients ... provide nourishment for the small organisms on which jellyfish feed.

2500|$|Almost 40 years later, writer Peter Guralnick {{wrote that}} Presley found it [...] "good {{running around with}} Nick... there was always <b>something</b> <b>happening,</b> and the hotel suite was like a private clubhouse where you needed to know the secret {{password}} {{to get in and}} he got to change the password every day." [...] Presley's girlfriend June Juanico complained the singer was always talking about his friend Adams and James Dean. She also was upset that Adams had started inviting himself to see Elvis, and Juanico felt that she was trying to compete for Elvis' attention. Adams would talk often about Natalie Wood to Elvis, constantly discussing her figure and her beauty, something else that caused Juanico to feel that she would soon lose Elvis to the glitz of Hollywood. Presley's own mother even commented about Adams, [...] "He sure is a pushy little fellow".|$|E
