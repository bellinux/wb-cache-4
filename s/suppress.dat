5|$|After the Camp Jackson Affair, {{there were}} no more {{military}} threats to Union control until 1864, although guerrilla activity continued in rural areas {{for the duration of the}} war. Union General John C. Frémont placed the city under martial law in August 1861 to <b>suppress</b> sedition; after Fremont's dismissal, Union army forces continued to <b>suppress</b> pro-Confederate demonstrations. The war significantly damaged St. Louis commerce, especially after the Confederacy blockaded the Mississippi shutting off St. Louis's connection to eastern markets. War also slowed growth during the 1860s, with an increase of only 43,000 residents from 1860 to 1866.|$|E

5|$|Topical {{and oral}} {{preparations}} of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) {{have been suggested}} as alternative medical treatments. It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, {{and its ability to}} <b>suppress</b> sebum production, and promote wound healing. Topical and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to <b>suppress</b> sebum production.|$|E

5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to <b>suppress</b> their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. Children may <b>suppress</b> tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to <b>suppress</b> tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E

40|$|Rebound of {{thoughts}} after thought suppression is widely documented. Much less {{is known about}} the effects of suppression on rebound of behavior. The current studies show that <b>suppressing</b> thoughts (Experiment 1 and 2) and <b>suppressing</b> behavior (Experiment 3) may cause rebound of behavior. In Experiment 1 <b>suppressing</b> thoughts of thirst rebounded in enhanced drinking, in Experiment 2 <b>suppressing</b> aggressive thoughts rebounded in subsequent aggression, and in Experiment 3 <b>suppressing</b> laughter rebounded in enhanced subsequent laughing. Supporting the Motivational Inference Model of postsuppressional rebound, the studies show that behavioral rebound is reduced if participants are led to believe that suppression is difficult for everybody (Experiments 1 and 2). Also consistent with this model is the finding that motivation to do the <b>suppressed</b> behavior mediated rebound (Experiment 3). The implications for rebound of unwanted behaviors are discussed...|$|R

40|$|IgM {{allotype}} heterozygous F 1 mice were independently <b>suppressed</b> for Igh 6 a or Igh 6 b {{to evaluate}} the contribution of B- 1 and B- 2 cells to natural serum IgM levels and Ab responses. B- 2 B cells expressing IgM of the <b>suppressed</b> allotype were evident in the spleens of <b>suppressed</b> mice 4 to 6 weeks after cessation of the suppression regimen, whereas B- 1 B cells of the <b>suppressed</b> allotype were undetectable for up to 9 months. Although serum IgM of the <b>suppressed</b> allotype was initially depleted in mice <b>suppressed</b> for either allotype, by 7 months of age, there were detectable levels of IgM of the <b>suppressed</b> allotype in the serum; however, the levels were significantly below that found in nonsuppressed mice. When mice were immunized with either the T-independent or T-dependent form of phosphorylcholine, those <b>suppressed</b> for either allotype, and consequently depleted of B- 1 B cells of that allotype, did not respond with phosphorylcholine-specific IgM of the <b>suppressed</b> allotype. In contrast, when mice were immunized with 1 - 3 dextran, the Igh 6 a allotype-suppressed mice were able to produce dextran-specific IgM of that allotype. These results show that allotype-bearing B- 1 cells of both allotypes can be effectively <b>suppressed</b> by this suppression protocol and this produces long-lasting effects on B- 1 cell levels and serum IgM of the <b>suppressed</b> allotype. These observations reflect the derivation {{of the majority of}} B- 1 cells from fetal-neonatal precursors, which cannot be replaced by newly emerging B- 2 cells of adult origin. Their ablation by antibody treatment results in permanent alterations to the adult B-cell repertoire...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPerceptual {{learning}} of motion direction discrimination is generally thought {{to rely on}} the middle temporal area of the brain (MT/V 5). A recent study investigating {{learning of}} motion discrimination when MT was psychophysically <b>suppressed</b> found that learning was possible with <b>suppressed</b> MT, but only when the task was sufficiently easy [Lu, H., Qian, N., Liu, Z. (2004). Learning motion discrimination with <b>suppressed</b> MT. Vision Research 44, 1817 – 1825]. We investigated whether this effect was indeed due to MT suppression or whether it could be explained by task difficulty alone. By comparing learning of motion discrimination when MT was <b>suppressed</b> vs. un-suppressed, at different task difficulties, we found that task difficulty alone could not explain the effects. At the highest difficulty, learning was not possible with <b>suppressed</b> MT, confirming [Lu, H., Qian, N., Liu, Z. (2004). Learning motion discrimination with <b>suppressed</b> MT. Vision Research 44, 1817 – 1825]. In comparison, learning was possible with un-suppressed MT at the same difficulty level. At the intermediate task difficulty, there was a clear learning disadvantage when MT was <b>suppressed.</b> Only for the easiest level of difficulty, did learning become equally possible for both <b>suppressed</b> and un-suppressed conditions. These findings suggest that MT {{plays an important role in}} learning to discriminate relatively fine differences in motion direction...|$|R
