In a given water layer, the transport distances of eroded <b>soil</b> <b>fractions,</b> and thus {{that of the}} associated substances across landscapes, such as soil organic carbon (SOC) and phosphorous, {{are determined by the}} settling velocities of the eroded <b>soil</b> <b>fractions.</b> However, using mineral size distribution to represent the settling velocities of <b>soil</b> <b>fractions,</b> as often applied in current erosion models, would ignore the potential influence of aggregation on the settling behaviour of <b>soil</b> <b>fractions.</b> The destructive effects of raindrops impacting onto aggregates are also often neglected in current soil erosion models. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop a proxy method to effectively simulate aggregate breakdown under raindrop impact, and further identify the settling velocity of eroded sediment and the associated SOC. Two agricultural soils with different sandy and silty loam textures were subjected to rainfall using a raindrop aggregate destruction device (RADD). The aggregates sustained after raindrop impact were fractionated by a settling tube into six different classes according to their respective settling velocities. The same mass amount of bulk soil of each soil type was also dispersed and sieved into the same six classes, to form a comparison in size distribution. The SOC content was measured for each settled and dispersed class. Our results show the following: (1) for an aggregated soil, applying dispersed mineral grain size distribution, rather than its actual aggregate distribution, to soil erosion models would lead to a biased estimation on the redistribution of eroded sediment and SOC; (2) the RADD designed in this study effectively captures the effects of raindrop impact on aggregate destruction and is thus able to simulate the quasi-natural sediment spatial redistribution; (3) further RADD tests with more soils under standard rainfall combined with local rainfalls are required to optimize the method...|$|R

Sixteen priority PAHs were analysed in the soils using in situ pressurised fluid extraction (PFE) followed by gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The average total PAH concentration in the soils ranged from 9. 0 to 1, 404 mg/kg (<b>soil</b> <b>fraction</b> A) and from 6. 6 to 872 mg/kg (<b>soil</b> <b>fraction</b> B).

In most crops, the root fraction contained more than 50 % {{of the total number of}} P. penetrans.

We aimed to explore the selection of root-associated bacterial communities driven by different plant species spontaneously established in abandoned agricultural soils within a historical polluted site in north Italy.

The overall structure of the non-vegetated and root-associated <b>soil</b> <b>fractions</b> bacterial communities was described by high-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, {{and a collection of}} 165 rhizobacterial isolates able to use biphenyl as unique carbon source was assayed for plant growth promotion (PGP) traits and bioremediation potential.

PCR-based detection in the soil metagenome of bacterial bphA gene, encoding for the biphenyl dioxygenase a subunit, indicated that the soil in the site possesses metabolic traits linked to PCB degradation. Biphenyl-utilizing bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of the three different plant species showed low phylogenetic diversity and well represented functional traits, in terms of PGP and bioremediation potential.

It is necessary to understand the extent and magnitude of this drought-induced hickory disturbance through mapping its spatial distribution using remote sensing data. This paper proposes a new approach to examine hickory disturbance based on multitemporal Landsat imagery. Ratios of green vegetation to <b>soil</b> <b>fractions</b> were calculated, in which the green vegetation and <b>soil</b> <b>fractions</b> were extracted from Landsat multispectral imagery using the linear spectral mixture analysis approach. We used the differences between before-drought and after-drought ratios to detect hickory disturbances. Four disturbance levels—non-disturbance, light, medium, and severe—were grouped according to the field survey data. The spatial distribution of these four levels was developed using the ratio-based approach. The result indicates that this approach is effective to detect drought-induced hickory disturbance and may be transferred to detect other kinds of disturbances, such as forest disease and selective logging. Cautions should be taken to properly select image acquisition dates and the change detection period, in addition to the approach itself...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{characterisation}} of soil organic matter breakdown, soil organic matter is often divided into different fractions, {{each with its own}} decomposition rate. Thus far, no attempts had been made to quantify the methane production capacity of individual <b>soil</b> <b>fractions.</b> We aimed to improve our understanding of CH 4 emissions from peat soils by studying the CH 4 production capacity of individual <b>soil</b> <b>fractions</b> in parallel with their carbon mineralisation capacity. Samples from two wet grasslands on peat soil (0 - 60 cm) were fractionated into different size and density fractions (> 2. 0 mm; 0. 25 - 2. 0 mm, light; 0. 25 - 2. 0 mm, heavy; 150 - 250 μm, light; 150 - 250 μm, heavy; 2. 0 mm contributed 90 ␝o total CH 4 production capacity. Furthermore, CH 4 production capacity strongly decreased with depth; the layer 0 - 5 cm contributed 70 ␝o total CH 4 production capacity. This indicates that in the wet peat soils recent plant residues are a major substrate for methanogens...|$|R
