5|$|It is <b>straightforward</b> to show by {{induction}} {{that this is}} equivalent to the other definition.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>straightforward</b> to show that, if {{the ring}} is an {{integral}} domain, {{the set of the}} fractions form a field.|$|E
5|$|Most of the mashhads were <b>straightforward</b> square {{structures}} with a dome, {{but a few}} of the mausoleums at Aswan {{were more}} complex and included side rooms.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett's {{earliest}} Discworld novels {{were written}} largely to parody classic sword-and-sorcery fiction (and occasionally science-fiction); as the series progressed, Pratchett dispensed with parody almost entirely, and the Discworld series evolved into <b>straightforward</b> (though still comedic) satire.|$|E
5|$|Sanjay Dutt as Girish. Simple and <b>straightforward</b> {{character}} who plays Lalita's moral support with warmth and compassion.|$|E
5|$|The tightly rhymed lyrics {{comprise}} a <b>straightforward</b> set of comparisons that border on comic exaggeration.|$|E
5|$|Although space vector {{pulse-width}} modulation (SVPWM) {{is becoming}} increasingly popular, sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most <b>straightforward</b> method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed carrier signal with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency {{as well as in}} voltage (or current).|$|E
5|$|Among <b>straightforward</b> Silver Age superheroes from {{publishers}} {{other than}} Marvel or DC, Charlton Comics offered a short-lived superhero line with characters that included Captain Atom, Judomaster, the Question, and Thunderbolt; Tower Comics had Dynamo, Mercury Man, NoMan {{and other members}} of the superhero espionage group T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents; and even Gold Key had Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom.|$|E
5|$|As the {{structure}} of the back is complex and the reporting of pain is subjective and affected by social factors, the diagnosis of low back pain is not <b>straightforward.</b> While most low back pain is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must be separated from neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the spine, and infections, among others.|$|E
5|$|As well as <b>straightforward</b> {{details of}} each bird, Yarrell adds many stories, chosen {{from his own}} experience, from his correspondents, or from often {{recently}} published accounts, to enliven the description of each species according to his taste.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's mazurkas and waltzes {{are all in}} <b>straightforward</b> ternary or episodic form, {{sometimes}} with a coda. The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies {{and the use of}} drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example Op.63 No.3, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's études {{are largely}} in <b>straightforward</b> ternary form. He {{used them to}} teach his own {{technique}} of piano playing—for instance playing double thirds (Op.25, No.6), playing in octaves (Op.25, No.10), and playing repeated notes (Op.10, No. 7).|$|E
5|$|He was courageous in battle, {{open and}} <b>straightforward,</b> incorruptible and impeccable, and strict towards himself. He {{cared about the}} masses, and was never {{concerned}} about his own advantage. He was never afraid of difficulties, neither of carrying heavy loads. In his revolutionary work, he was dilligent, honest, and he had an utmost sense of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|In {{a country}} in which few women may take out loans from large {{commercial}} banks, Grameen has focused on women borrowers; 97% of its members are women. While a World Bank study has concluded that women's access to microcredit empowers them through greater access to resources and control over decision making, some other economists argue that the relationship between microcredit and women-empowerment is less <b>straightforward.</b>|$|E
5|$|In some locations, these ceremonies {{could prove}} controversial. Canada – ceremonies on Armistice Day in the 1920s not <b>straightforward</b> in Montreal; {{predominantly}} Anglican and English, with French and Catholic elements largely excluded until the end. The {{opening of the}} Vimy Memorial drew criticism for its secular nature-no clergy were invited to speak-despite the religious symbolism {{of much of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|In the All-Ireland semi-final against Armagh (who {{were meeting}} Tyrone {{for the third}} time that year), Canavan scored with the last kick of the game, winning the match for Tyrone. Kevin McStay, a former Mayo player, {{described}} it as the point of the season, despite the free kick being from a relatively <b>straightforward</b> position.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} {{possible}} for a mechanical part to vibrate {{in a number of}} different modes, however the design will be based on a particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode. As well as the <b>straightforward</b> longitudinal mode some others which are used include flexural mode, torsional mode, radial mode and drumhead mode.|$|E
5|$|Linear {{combinations}} combine multiplication and summation; {{they are}} sums {{in which each}} term has a multiplier, usually a real or complex number. Linear combinations are especially useful in contexts where <b>straightforward</b> addition would violate some normalization rule, such as mixing of strategies in game theory or superposition of states in quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Memento was re-released in the UK on a 3-disc Special Edition DVD on December 27, 2004. This release {{contains}} all the special {{features that are}} on the two US releases in one package plus a couple of new interviews. The menus appear as tattoos on a body and are more <b>straightforward</b> than the US 2-disc limited edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|Musically speaking, Hate {{is notable}} for its stripped-down, <b>straightforward</b> {{approach}} {{and the use}} of a drum machine, the latter sparking some controversy. Lamounier claimed to have no qualms about using this device, on the basis that most death metal drummers use trigger pads for recording purposes, which in the end produces the same homogenized sound as that of a drum machine.|$|E
5|$|One {{must prove}} that this {{operation}} is well-defined, dealing with co-Cauchy sequences. Once that task is done, all {{the properties of}} real addition follow immediately from the properties of rational numbers. Furthermore, the other arithmetic operations, including multiplication, have <b>straightforward,</b> analogous definitions.|$|E
5|$|The English voice acting for the series, {{commonly}} {{criticized as}} being poor, has remained in DW4. The English voice-overs of Dynasty Warriors series uses <b>straightforward</b> English pronunciations for the romanized pinyin names of characters and locations. The results tend to leave {{errors in the}} dialogue, with incorrect English pronunciations of originally Chinese text.|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of hurricane forecast models can vary significantly from storm to storm. For some storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are relatively <b>straightforward,</b> and the models {{are not only}} accurate but they produce similar forecasts, while for other storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are more complex and different models produce very different forecasts.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} and classification of AML can be challenging, {{and should be}} performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist. In <b>straightforward</b> cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as Auer rods) or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish AML from other leukemias; however, {{in the absence of}} such features, diagnosis may be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The flowers hold profuse {{amounts of}} nectar and are pollinated by honeyeaters. Although L.formosa is {{uncommon}} in cultivation, it is <b>straightforward</b> {{to grow in}} soils with good drainage and a partly shaded to sunny aspect. It is readily propagated by seed. Unlike all {{other members of the}} genus Lambertia, L.formosa is greatly resistant to the soil pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi.|$|E
5|$|The pavilion's {{construction}} was {{aided by the}} French CATIA software program and internet conferencing. Early plans to incorporate a surrounding waterfall and stairway were abandoned. In the end, budget limitations led to compromises with the original architectural plan that left many elements in their most <b>straightforward</b> form, such as exposed pipes and conduits, or rough concrete.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} the battle was <b>straightforward</b> for both sides. The Russians wanted {{to break through the}} Polish defences to Warsaw, while the Polish aim was to defend the area long enough for a two-pronged counteroffensive from the south, led by General Józef Piłsudski, and north, led by General Władysław Sikorski, to outflank the attacking forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} process was {{and still is}} chemically <b>straightforward,</b> effectively dissolving lead in aqua fortis (nitric acid), and subsequently harvesting the precipitate. However, the production remained small-scale for many centuries, and the commercial production of lead(II) nitrate as raw material for the manufacture of other lead compounds was not reported until 1835. In 1974, the U.S. consumption of lead compounds, excluding pigments and gasoline additives, was 642tons.|$|E
5|$|The public {{beta version}} {{received}} several reviews, citing its low resource usage, <b>straightforward</b> user interface and price point. Brian Krebs of The Washington Post {{reported that a}} quick scan on a Windows 7 computer took about 10 minutes and a full scan about 45 minutes. Ars Technica reviewed it positively, citing its organized interface, low resource usage, and its status as freeware.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{criticism}} of the SSHS for not taking rain, storm surge, and other important factors into consideration, but SSHS defenders say {{that part of the}} goal of SSHS is to be <b>straightforward</b> and simple to understand.|$|E
5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as <b>straightforward.</b> Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E
5|$|A titled Igbo {{chieftain}} himself, Achebe's novels {{focus on}} the traditions of Igbo society, the effect of Christian influences, and the clash of Western and traditional African values {{during and after the}} colonial era. His style relies heavily on the Igbo oral tradition, and combines <b>straightforward</b> narration with representations of folk stories, proverbs, and oratory. He also published a number of short stories, children's books, and essay collections.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the western}} slope that the Cog Railway ascends is <b>straightforward</b> from base to summit, the mountain's other sides are more complex. On the north side, Great Gulf—the mountain's largest glacial cirque—forms an amphitheater {{surrounded}} by the Northern Presidentials: Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and Madison. These connected peaks reach well into the treeless alpine zone. Massive Chandler Ridge extends northeast from the summit of Washington to form the amphitheater's southern wall and the incline is ascended by the Mount Washington Auto Road.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in his}} career, Vonnegut {{decided to}} model his style after Henry David Thoreau, who wrote as if from the {{perspective}} of a child, allowing Thoreau's works to be more widely comprehensible. Using a youthful narrative voice allowed Vonnegut to deliver concepts in a modest and <b>straightforward</b> way. Other influences on Vonnegut include The War of the Worlds author H. G. Wells, and satirist Jonathan Swift. Vonnegut credited newspaper magnate H. L. Mencken for inspiring him to become a journalist.|$|E
5|$|Football lore has {{numerous}} legends relating {{when and}} where the bicycle kick was first performed and who created it. According to Brazilian anthropologist Antonio Jorge Soares, the bicycle kick's origin is important only {{as an example of}} how folklore is created. Popular opinion continues to debate its exact origin, particularly in the locations where the manoeuvre was allegedly created (e.g., Brazil, Chile, and Peru). Regardless, the available facts and dates tell a <b>straightforward</b> narrative.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive {{so it would}} be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and <b>straightforward.</b>|$|E
