Three key fabrication parameters were studied to assess their effects on the performance of different <b>sensing</b> <b>pad</b> designs. These parameters included the FBG embedding depth (top, bottom, and neutral layers of the <b>sensing</b> <b>pad),</b> the <b>sensing</b> <b>pad</b> thickness (1, 2, and 3 mm), and finally, different embedding materials. Each <b>sensing</b> <b>pad</b> was studied while attached to Pe-lite and silicone prosthetic liners. Afterward, the <b>sensing</b> <b>pad</b> design that exhibited the best performance was employed to fabricate an expandable array of FBGs for interface pressure measurements within prosthetic sockets. One transtibial amputee participated in this paper to further assess the in situ performance of the <b>sensing</b> <b>pad.</b> To validate the findings, the results were also compared with the pressure measurements using the F-socket sensors. The results revealed that the FBGs embedded in the neutral layer of harder and thicker sensing pads exhibited the highest sensitivity as well as excellent accuracy. In addition, they could successfully measure the interface pressure inside the prosthetic socket. Higher pressure values were logged by the FBG sensors compared with the F-socket. Yet, the trend of pressure changes was similar for both sensor types. This paper is hoped to form a robust platform for the researchers intending to utilize the FBG sensors in such applications...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the first {{investigation into the}} capability of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors to measure interface pressure between the stump and the prosthetic sockets of a trans-tibial amputee. FBG element(s) were recoated with and embedded in {{a thin layer of}} epoxy material to form a <b>sensing</b> <b>pad,</b> which was in turn embedded in a silicone polymer material to form a pressure sensor. The sensor was tested in real time by inserting a heavy-duty balloon into the socket and inflating it by using an air compressor. This test was conducted to examine the sensitivity and repeatability of the sensor when subjected to pressure from the stump of the trans-tibial amputee and to mimic the actual environment of the amputee’s Patellar Tendon (PT) bar. The sensor exhibited a sensitivity of 127 pm/N and a maximum FSO hysteresis of around ~ 0. 09 in real-time operation. Very good reliability was achieved when the sensor was utilized for in situ measurements. This study may lead to smart FBG-based amputee stump/socket structures for pressure monitoring in amputee socket systems, which will result in better-designed prosthetic sockets that ensure improved patient satisfaction...|$|E

40|$|Limb {{amputation}} is {{a surgical}} procedure performed {{to remove a}} whole or {{a part of a}} limb in an attempt to save the residual limb from any further damage. Amputees typically use artificial limbs (also called “prostheses”) as rehabilitation tools to restore their daily activities and cosmetic appearance. Unfortunately, almost all amputees are dissatisfied with their existing prostheses because of the poor fitting of prosthetic sockets. Despite the considerable advances in the pressure measurement techniques employed over the past five decades to map pressure distribution within prosthetic sockets, these techniques still exhibit several limitations, including their bulkiness (i. e., strain gauge transducers) and vulnerability to hysteresis, drift, and creases (i. e., piezoresistive and capacitive transducers). Therefore, developing a new technique that offers valid and reliable pressure measurement within prosthetic sockets is deemed necessary to help prosthetic professionals fabricate better-designed sockets that provide a good fit and amputee’s satisfaction. This research aims to investigate the feasibility of optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors as a potential alternative to the aforementioned techniques to spot peak pressures within prosthetic sockets. First, a single FBG flexible <b>sensing</b> <b>pad</b> was designed and evaluated at the anterior proximal region of the residual limb to assess its performance in dynamic conditions. This sensor was tested in real time by inserting a heavy-duty balloon into the socket and inflating/deflating it using an air compressor to mimic the actual amputee’s gait. Promising results in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, and hysteresis were obtained. These findings encouraged me to fabricate a series of FBG sensing pads with full consideration of three key fabrication parameters: different FBG embedding depth, <b>sensing</b> <b>pad</b> thickness, and host material hardness. Results revealed that the FBGs embedded in the neutral layer of hard and thick sensing pads exhibited the highest sensitivity and excellent accuracy. This concept was subsequently employed to fabricate four new expandable sensing pads with at least two sensing sites each to cover the proximal and distal sub-regions of each socket aspect. An amputee was involved to evaluate the in situ performance of this technique. The results were compared with the pressure measurements obtained using the commercially available F-socket sensors to validate the findings. The results revealed the advantages of the new sensor design as it could successfully detect all the events of an amputee’s gait. Higher pressure values were logged by the FBG sensors compared with the F-socket, which was attributed to the thickness of the sensor. However, the trend on pressure changes was similar for both sensor types. Eliminating the thickness drawback was achieved by embedding an array of FBGs within a custom fabricated silicone liner that is typically inserted in prosthetic sockets to cushion the transfer of loads from the socket to the residual limb. This FBG instrumented liner was designed so it could function both as a cushioning material and a sensing tool. No previous studies have implemented such a technique in prosthetic applications. Therefore, this research was the first investigation into the potential use of such a technique in prosthetic applications...|$|E
40|$|Booksh, Karl S. Surface plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR) spectroscopy is {{a rapidly}} growing field for chemical detection. Various SPR sensor architectures can offer high sensitivity, tunability and selectivity {{over a wide range}} of applications. Enhancements to this technique are obtained by introducing novel and modified designs capable of probing different optical regions. The contributing efforts of this dissertation aim to identify and characterize several of these platforms for use in real-world sensing applications. Herein, three basic types of SPR architectures are developed, conducting polymers as a replacement for conventional materials, a MIR-SPR sensor pad and composite-SPR sensors for selective applications. Conductive polymers represent an exciting addition to plasmonics as they offer new ways to apply SPR sensing for a reduced cost, in particular Polyaniline (PAni) has been identified in literature a possible candidate for SPR. In this dissertation several deposition methods for PAni are presented to obtain specific film parameters capable of supporting plasmonic behavior, including vacuum deposition and solution cast methods. Vacuum deposition methods exhibit good control over the thin film parameters, with roughness values (R RMS) as low as 0. 5 nm and a reduced amount of observable pin-holes. Additionally, the deposition methods described herein are applicable to the demonstration of polymer plasmonics as well the improvement of non-plasmonic applications of conducting polymers. Theoretical modelling reveals that certain films demonstrate sufficient sensitivity (~ 3770 nm/RIU) for SPR sensor applications. Experimental validation performed in this dissertation does not substantiate theoretical evidence, however identifies innate difficulties is the experimental demonstration and will be essential for subsequent investigations. In an attempt to expand SPR to different analytes and demonstrate a highly tunable sensor, a MIR-SPR <b>sensing</b> <b>pad</b> is developed with the capability of probing various regions within a single sample. The sensitivities and plasmonic characteristics are quantified over the MIR region with the highest sensitivities occurring between 2800 cm - 1 and 2250 cm- 1 (~ 15, 200 +/- 2. 2 nm/RIU). For specific MIR wavelength regimes, a 22 +/- 4 % deviation is observed from theoretical values. Furthermore, discrepancies for determining the theoretical probing depth are identified and alleviated with a more robust method to verify experimental values with theoretical predictions. Finally, composite SPR materials are designed to promote further selectivity and tunability for SPR devices. Initially, a coupled waveguide plasmon resonance MIR-sensor is described that suggests high variability within the MIR regime and is successfully applied to quantitative and qualitative hydrocarbon detection in the ppb range. Moreover, a selective plasmon-plasmon sensor is optimized towards enhancement of sensitivity and modulation of signal by means of plasmon coupling. The optimization of a component parts reveals good tunability for future coupling experiments. Additionally, a deposition method for carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) is validated as a potential substrate for plasmonic coupling. Ultimately the studies described in this dissertation attempt to expand SPR spectroscopy to a wider array of analytes and increase the performance merits of SPR sensors.

40|$|A silicon-based fine {{granularity}} calorimeter is {{a potential}} technology for the future International Linear Collider ILC, the future circular collider CEPC, and is also the chosen technology for the upgraded CMS experiment of the Large Hadron Collider. Active silicon <b>sensing</b> <b>pads</b> are used as MIP counters and the standard calibration of the calorimeter uses weights based on the average energy loss, $dEdx$. In this work, {{the limitations of the}} dEdx calibration method in terms of energy linearity, scale and resolution are explored. In the case of a calorimeter with varying passive layer thickness as the one planned for CMS, the $dEdx$ method leads to a significant constant term in the resolution function and a non-linearity of energy response. For these reasons, a method based on the calorimeter sampling fraction that exploits the per-event measured shower depth is presented and shown to deliver superior absolute energy scale, linearity and resolution. Calorimetric designs in which the back of the shower is sampled less, offer reduced cost without loss in performance. Therefore, a proper calibration as proposed here is crucial in obtaining the most cost- and performance-effective silicon-sampling calorimeter design. Comment: Paper Accepted by JINS...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{development}} of the first integrated optical surface plasmon resonance sensor that combines an optical and electrochemical interrogating technique in sensing electrochemically addressed layers over a gold film. This device brings together the advantages of the analytical technique of surface plasmon resonance and of cyclic voltammetry on a single chip that exhibits portability, miniaturisation capability and compatibility with optical fibre. The integrated optical chip allows the potential introduction of a large number of <b>sensing</b> <b>pads</b> on a single chip thus allowing the acquisition of precise information about a test compound while simultaneously monitoring different test compounds in the same sensing area. The integrated optical surface plasmon resonance (IOSPR) devices fabricated were applied in the study of the oxidation of gold and the removal of the oxide layer in real time. The optical response to the oxidation process was similar to those reported in the literature using ellipsometry and or reflectance spectroscopy. Here the IOSPR device performed better, giving transmittance changes of 60 % in response to the formation of an oxide film. The introduction of a monolayer of copper onto the gold surface of the device via the underpotential deposition process was monitored for the first time using the surface plasmon technique. Here the response and performance of the device was compared with other reported studies in the literature, which combined an optical and electrochemical technique for similar analysis. The IOSPR device performed better with 10 % change in transmittance in comparison to a change of 1 % reported for reflectance measurements. Comparisons were also made with those predicted by a numerical waveguide model. The feasibility of potential applications in biological analysis was demonstrated by applying the device in analysing the adsorption and desorption of thiol and phospholipid layers onto the sensing surface of the device...|$|R
40|$|A {{micromachining}} {{process for}} the fabrication of vibratory microgyroscopes from silicon wafers, and aspects of the microgyroscope design that are inextricably linked with the fabrication process, have been modified {{in an effort to}} increase production yields from perspectives of both quantity and quality. Prior to the modifications, the effective production yield of working microgyroscopes was limited to one or less per wafer. The modifications are part of a continuing effort to improve the design and increase production yields to more than 30 working microgyroscopes per wafer. A discussion of pertinent aspects of the unmodified design and the unmodified fabrication process is prerequisite to a meaningful description of the modifications. The design of the microgyroscope package was not conducive to high yield and rapid testing of many microgyroscopes. One of the major impediments to high yield and testing was found to lie in vibration- isolation beams around the four edges of each microgyroscope, which beams were found to be unnecessary for achieving high resonance quality factors (Q values) characterizing the vibrations of petallike cantilevers. The fabrication process included an 8 - m-deep plasma etch. The purpose of the etch was to create 8 - m vertical gaps, below which were to be placed large gold evaporated electrodes and <b>sensing</b> <b>pads</b> to drive and sense resonant vibrations of the "petals. " The process also included a step in which bridges between dies were cut to separate the dies. The etched areas must be kept clean and smooth (free of debris and spikes), because any object close to 8 m high in those areas would stop the vibrations. However, it was found that after the etch, there remained some spikes with heights that were, variously, almost as high or as high as the etch depth. It also was found that the cutting of bridges created silicon debris, some of which lodged in the 8 - m gaps and some of which landed on top of the petals. The masses added to the petals by the debris altered resonance frequencies and/or Q values to unacceptable degrees. Hence, the spikes and the debris have been conjectured to cause most of the observed malfunctions of newly fabricated microgyroscopes. Another pertinent aspect of the unmodified design and process was the fabrication of electrodes and the 8 - m capacitance gap on a 500 - m-thick wafer, and the fabrication of a 3 -mm-thick baseplate from another wafer. It was necessary to bond these wafers to each other in an assembly step that was later found to be superfluous in that it could be eliminated by a suitable modification of the design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Brakes {{and tires}} {{are the major}} {{contributors}} for catastrophic failure of ground vehicles. Braking system is the utmost important besides tire {{to ensure the safety}} of users and vehicle. Ensuring good condition of brake lining is very crucial to ensure the efficiency of the braking system, where, the worn off brake lining not only endangers life but also damages the entire brake associated parts such as hub, disk, shaft, etc. In this paper, Malaysian made luxury car Proton Perdana V 6 brake pads were investigated to be embedded with a lining wear limit alert system. The current spring steel alert system has some drawbacks where, the alerting sound is only activated while the car moves and secondly, when the car is on move, rarely the alerting sound reaches the driver. Therefore, a critical investigation of the existing pads manufactured in Malaysia and their characterizations are conducted to identify the most suitable sensor spot on the brake pad. Later, a micro sensor is embedded into the pad and fully tested on a specially designed test rig. The evaluation of thickness, hardness, layer properties and critical wear region has enabled the spotting of exact sensor location. The embedment of the micro switch was successfully done and tested to be very efficient in alerting the driver upon reaching the maximum lining wear limit.

40|$|The {{identification}} of damage in structural systems, including characterization of damage location and severity, is of extreme {{interest to the}} structural engineering profession. To date, many damage detection methods have been proposed that utilize global structural response measurements in the time and frequency domains to hypothesize the existence of structural damage. The accuracy and robustness of current damage detection methodologies could be improved {{through the use of}} active sensors. Active sensors, such as piezoelectric pads, impart low-energy acoustic excitations into structural elements and can record the corresponding system behavior. In this study, a novel methodology utilizing the input-output behavior of actively sensed structural elements is proposed. The poles of ARX time-series models describing modal frequencies and damping ratios are plotted upon the discrete-time complex plane and Perceptron linear classifiers employed to determine if poles of the structural element in an unknown state (damaged or undamaged) can be separated with those of the undamaged structure. If poles of the unknown state are separable from those of the undamaged state, the system is diagnosed as damaged. A simple cantilevered aluminum plate damaged by hack saw cuts is actively <b>sensed</b> by piezoelectric <b>pads</b> to show the efficacy of the proposed damage detection methodology.

30|$|Mobile and unified sensing {{is another}} {{important}} challenge for creating mobile multi-device systems. So far, we see a fragmented input space for operating individual devices. For example, smartphones and smartwatches typically allow for touch input on their interactive surface or distance sensing with computer vision [59] or other sensors. Commercially available smartglasses often use indirect input via a touch <b>pad.</b> <b>Sensing</b> around individual devices has also been explored allowing above surface input on phones (e.g., Project Soli) and smartwatches [5] or mid-air input in front of smartglasses (e.g., Microsoft Hololens). Gestures using the devices themselves can also be realized, e.g., through inertial sensors or linear accelerometers. Some mobile phone (e.g., the Nokia N 900) posses multiple atenna {{which can be used}} for sensing the relative position of other devices [60] and which have been employed for multi-device, collocated interaction [30, 31] However, it remains unclear how to utilize these diverse sensing approaches to create a unified and seamless interaction space across devices. Also, tracking the full six degrees of freedom poses, from all multiple wearable devices, hence enabling a precise mutual spatial understanding of the display positions in space, has been not extensively explored in mobile scenarios and is so far often restricted to lab-based prototypes. For example, approaches such as MultiFi [4] or HuddleLamp [28] typically rely on stationary tracking systems. Only recently, we see the emergence of mobile sensing solutions, which so far are either restricted in the achievable degrees of freedom or the accuracy and precision of sensing [61, 62]. Similarly, when using head-mounted displays in a spatially registered multi-device environment, we need better and more robust means for calibrating them relative to the user’s eye [63, 64].|$|R
