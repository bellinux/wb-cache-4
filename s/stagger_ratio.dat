40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} the staggered pulse repetition time (PRT) technique on NOAA’s research and development WSR- 88 D in Norman, Oklahoma. The prototype algorithm incorporates a novel rule for the correct assignment of Doppler mean velocity that is needed to accommodate arbitrary <b>stagger</b> <b>ratios.</b> Description of the rule, consideration of errors, and choice of appropriate <b>stagger</b> <b>ratios</b> are presented. The staggered PRT algorithm is integrated with the standard processing on the WSR- 88 D, some details of which are included in the paper. A simple ground clutter canceller removes the pure complex time series mean (DC) component from autocovariance estimates; censoring of overlaid echoes and thresholding are equivalent to those used on the WSR- 88 D. Further, a cursory verification of statistical errors indicates good agreement with theoretical expectations. Although the staggered PRT algorithm operates in real time, it was advantageous to collect several events of staggered PRT time series data for further scrutiny. Results presented from one of the events demonstrate the potency of the staggered PRT to mitigate range and velocity ambiguities. 1...|$|R

40|$|Published online: 02 Oct 2013 A {{series of}} static 1 : 5 -scale tests on dry stone masonry walls were {{performed}} with the main objective to verify existing analytical expressions for computation of resistance to horizontal loading proportional to the self-weight of masonry. The resistance is expressed {{by means of a}} collapse load multiplier, and the experiments were conceived to reproduce various out-of-plane bending failure mechanisms using an inclined plane machine built with steel profiles and with an aluminum platform. The collapse multiplier was calculated from the inclination angle of the platform that caused collapse. Since the walls were constructed without mortar, the shear strength along the joints was given purely by friction. The “bricks” were cut from marble—the selection criteria being the accuracy for the cutting, the hardness and durability of the material, and an appropriate friction coefficient. In total, 42 configurations were tested, varying the length of the walls, the presence and position of openings, the <b>staggering</b> <b>ratio,</b> the quality of the connection between walls, the existence of vertical overburden loads in the walls, and the number of stories. The test results are presented in terms of the measured collapse load multipliers and detailed descriptions of the associated collapse mechanisms.

It is shown that the influence of unequal sweepback and unequal dihedral in upper and lower wings may be properly provided for by utilizing the concepts of average stagger and average gap/chord ratio, respectively. The effect of other variables is discussed, but they have not been included in the charts either because their influence was obviously small or because insufficient data existed to make possible a complete determination of their influence.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the numerical study of two-dimensional forced convection heat transfer for staggered tube banks in cross flow under incompressible, steady-state conditions. This system is solved for body-fitted coordinates using the finite volume method for flow over {{a bundle of}} cylindrical tubes. A constant heat flux is imposed {{on the surface of}} the tubes as the thermal boundary condition. The type of arrangement considered is a set of <b>staggered</b> tubes. <b>Ratios</b> of longitudinal pitch to tube diameter (ST/D) of 1. 25, 1. 5, and 2 are considered. Reynolds numbers are varied from 25 to 250 and the Prandtl number is taken as 0. 71. Velocity field vectors, temperature contours, and the local and average Nusselt numbers are analyzed in this paper. It can be seen that the predicted results are in good agreement with experimental and numerical results obtained previously. The obtained results show that the heat transfer rate increases with a reduction in the step of the longitudinal tube diameter. The local heat transfer depends strongly on the Reynolds number. The highest values are obtained at the surface opposite to the direction of flow. The heat transfer rate is insignificant in the areas of recycling...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe flow of a {{silicone}} oil of high viscosity along {{a block of}} staggered kneading discs of a co-rotating twin screw extruder was investigated {{with the use of}} an acrylic transparent barrel. A digital video camera recorded the flow path of a red dye, dispersed in the {{silicone oil}}, along the screws and in the intermeshing zone. Different geometrical configurations were studied, namely various staggering angles (+ 30 degrees, 90 degrees and - 30 degrees) and thicknesses (7. 5, 15. 0 and 22. 5 mm) of kneading blocks. The effects of these geometrical parameters on the pressure generation and filling ratio were investigated. It was observed that, even for negative <b>staggering,</b> the filling <b>ratio</b> of the kneading block was lower than one.

50|$|Gender {{role for}} females {{is to become}} more unnoticeable, a {{follower}} that {{does not need to}} stand out. Because of their condition to be more docile and dependent, the instinctive need to gain precedence is not as highly valued. Even respect {{comes in the form of}} different terms, as it is through how appropriately she conducts herself that seems innocent. This is also influenced by fellow peers such as mothers and other female figures apart from the authoritative male figure. In this instance, there is no need to urge to commit delinquency as the female is expected to rely on the male for his expected role as provider. It is through the act of needing to become dependent that enforces the feminine characteristics to seem as an alternative to delinquency. In fact, it has been largely stated that while masculinity induces such violent behavior, femininity is seen as the antithesis to delinquency. Furthermore, it is assumed that because femininity and masculinity are portrayed to be opposites, they contain a bipolarity in society that forms an explanation to the <b>staggering</b> disproportionate <b>ratio</b> between convicted delinquents. A sociological study conducted and recorded in the article Gender Role Expectations of Juveniles, both a masculine and feminine test was created to be answered by kindergartners until high school, indicating what role expectations were among the sexes. The answers were predominantly that males were to provide through aggressive terms, while females should be the more docile, bolstering the bipolarity assumption. This is because gender-role socialization produces an absolutist stance toward rules and a receptiveness toward generalized moral standards among girls while boys tend to develop a more individualistic and relativistic view of rules. The bipolarity assumption suggests that masculinity and femininity are opposites, and the assumption of unidimensionality implies that gender differences form a single scale.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} noise {{radiated}} by {{a cascade of}} flat-plate airfoils interacting with homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. An analytic formulation for the spectrum of acoustic power of a two-dimensional flat-plate is derived. The main finding {{of this paper is}} that the acoustic power spectrum from the cascade of flat airfoils may be split into two distinct frequency regions of low frequency and high frequency, separated by a critical frequency. Below this frequency, cascade effects due to the interaction between neighboring airfoils are shown to be important. At frequencies above the critical frequency, cascade effects are shown to be relatively weak. In this frequency range, acoustic power is shown to be approximately proportional to the number of blades. Based on this finding at high frequencies, an approximate expression is derived for the power spectrum that is valid above the critical frequency and which is in excellent agreement with the exact expression for the broadband power spectrum. The formulation is used to perform a parametric study on the effects on the power spectrum of the blade number, <b>stagger</b> angle, gap-chord <b>ratio,</b> and Mach number. The theory is also shown to provide a close fit to the measured spectrum of rotor-stator interaction...|$|R

These phenomena are investigated by means of velocity and pressure measurements, {{as well as with the}} aid of extensive visualization of the unsteady flow structure at the presence and absence of acoustic resonance. Vorticity shedding excitation is shown to be generated by either jet, wake, or shear layer instabilities. The tube layout pattern (in-line or <b>staggered),</b> the spacing <b>ratio,</b> and Reynolds number determine which instability mechanism will prevail, and thereby the relevant Strouhal number for design against vorticity shedding and acoustic resonance excitations. Strouhal number design charts for vortex shedding in tube bundles are presented for a wide range of tube patterns and spacing ratios. Regarding the acoustic resonance mechanism, it is shown that the natural vorticity shedding, which prevails before the onset of resonance, is not always the source exciting acoustic resonance. This is especially the case for in-line tube bundles. Therefore, separate "acoustic" Strouhal number charts must be used when appropriate to design against acoustic resonances. To this end, the most recently developed charts of acoustic Strouhal numbers are provided...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 40 % of {{personal}} autos in the United States are {{over ten years}} of age. Older vehicles generally pollute more and are less fuel-efficient. In an effort to meet air quality standards, vehicle replacement programs, which purchase and scrap older vehicles, have shown benefits of reduced emissions and fuel use.

Safety technology continues to improve including air bags, seat belts, child restraints, crumple zones, and vehicle handling. This along with wear and tear makes older vehicles relatively less safe. Many studies have identified vehicle age as {{a significant factor in}} crash probability.

40|$|Ensuring a {{high degree}} of {{commonality}} among a range of products can dramatically decrease development costs. This paper aims to generate a highly versatile compressor airfoil family that covers most applications in the core compression system of aircraft engines and stationary gas turbines. This airfoil family is generated by filling a database with optimized airfoil shapes. The database is structured in seven dimensions, denominated as 'design requirements': blade <b>stagger</b> angle, pitch-chord <b>ratio,</b> profile area and the following design point properties: inlet Mach number, Reynolds number, streamtube contraction and aerodynamic loading. Additional constraints are imposed to ensure that feasible airfoils exist for each set of requirements. These constraints include limitations for profile area depending on inlet Mach number and limits for axial Mach number. To fill this seven-dimensional space, a large number of airfoils is generated by means of numerical optimization at discrete points in this space. The target is to find airfoil shapes that have low losses and ensure stable operation over wide incidence ranges. Design and off-design performance is evaluated with the blade-to-blade flow solver MISES. The solver is well established among industry and research and it is validated to {{a high degree}} by experiments. To verify the optimization strategy, it is tested on a set of existing compressor airfoils. The optimized geometries of four of the airfoils under investigation are found in the appendix. The database offers a wide variety of airfoils for different applications. Airfoils for sub- and supersonic inflow are covered as well as airfoils suited for placement at hub or casing. The benefit of using airfoils optimized for their specific purpose over having generic airfoil shapes is discussed as well.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{activity}} pattern {{of patients with}} chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) with healthy sedentary subjects and {{examine the relationship between}} the different parameters of performed activity (registered by an accelerometer device) and symptom severity and fluctuation (registered by questionnaires) in patients with CFS. Design: Case-control study. Participants were asked to wear an accelerometer device on the nondominant hand for 6 consecutive days. Every morning, afternoon, and evening patients scored the intensity of their pain, fatigue, and concentration difficulties on a visual analog scale. Setting: Patients were recruited from a specialized chronic fatigue clinic in the university hospital, where all subjects were invited for 2 appointments (for questionnaire and accelerometer adjustments). In between, activity data were collected in the subject's normal home environment. Participants: Female patients (n= 67) with CFS and female age-matched healthy sedentary controls. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Accelerometry (average activity counts, peak activity counts, ratio peak/average, minutes spent per activity category) and symptom severity (intensity of pain, fatigue, and concentration difficulties). Results: Patients with CFS were less active, spent more time sedentary, and less time lightly active (P. 05), peak activity, and the <b>staggering</b> of activities (<b>ratio</b> peak/average) on 1 day were not different between groups (P>. 05). Negative correlations (-. 242 varying to -. 307) were observed for sedentary activity and the ratio with symptom severity and variation on the same and the next day. Light, moderate, and vigorous, as well as the average activity and the peak activity, were positively correlated (. 242 varying to. 421) with symptom severity and variation. Conclusions: The more patients with CFS are sedentary and the better activity is dispersed, the fewer symptoms and variations they experience on the same and next day. Inversely, more symptoms and variability is experienced when patients were more active that day or the previous day. The direction of these relations cannot be determined in a cross-sectional study and requires further study...|$|R
