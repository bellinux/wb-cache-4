40|$|Research on lateral {{exchange}} of streamwise momentum between parallel flows in open channels has mainly {{been focused on}} compound channels composed of a main channel and a floodplain, on mixing layer development downstream of river confluences, and on partially vegetated channels. This study aims to establish the mechanisms responsible for streamwise momentum exchange between concurrent parallel flows subject to different bed roughnesses. The contribution of momentum {{exchange of}} each mechanism is determined {{on the basis of}} flume experiments. For an initially uniform flow that experiences a bed with two parallel lanes of different roughnesses, three mechanisms for exchange of streamwise momentum can be distinguished: cross?channel <b>secondary</b> <b>circulations,</b> turbulent mixing resulting from vortices acting in the horizontal plane, and mass transfer from the decelerating flow over the rough?bottomed lane to the accelerating flow in the parallel smooth?bottomed lane. The mass transfer and associated momentum transfer across the channel cause a gain in longitudinal momentum. The <b>secondary</b> <b>circulations</b> are driven by turbulence anisotropy and feature a main cell that extends over the full water depth, which is centered at the smooth side of the smooth?to?rough transition. The gain of momentum corresponding to the mass transfer in the developing reach is on the same order of magnitude as the momentum exchange by turbulent mixing and of that by <b>secondary</b> <b>circulations</b> in the most downstream position, where the flow is nearly developed.

500|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone's {{primary energy}} source is heat from the evaporation {{of water from the}} ocean surface, which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to saturation. The energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric Carnot heat engine. First, inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water (i.e. latent heat) at the temperature of the warm ocean surface (during evaporation, the ocean cools and the air warms). Second, the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content (latent heat is simply converted to sensible heat during condensation). Third, air outflows and loses heat via infrared radiation to space at the temperature of the cold tropopause. Finally, air subsides and warms at {{the outer edge of the}} storm while conserving total heat content.

The long-term goal {{of this research is}} an understanding of the roles that rotation and friction play in the transport and water-mass mixing of flows through oceanic straits, channels, and canyons. OBJECTIVES Ocean exchange flows that are wide or slow enough are subject to the Coriolis force owing to planetary rotation.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Flow mechanisms of compound meandering channels are recognised {{to be far more}} complicated than compound straight channels. The compound meandering channels are mainly characterised by the continuous variation of mean and turbulent flow parameters along a meander wavelength; the existence of horizontal shear layer at the bankfull level and the presence of strong helical <b>secondary</b> flow <b>circulations</b> in the streamwise direction. The <b>secondary</b> flow <b>circulations</b> are very important as they govern the advection of flow momentum, distort isovels, and influence bed shear stress, thus producing a complicated and fully three-dimensional turbulent flow structures. A great deal of experiments has been conducted in the past, which explains flow mechanisms, mixing patterns and the behaviour of <b>secondary</b> flow <b>circulations.</b> However, a complete understanding of secondary flow structures still remains far from conclusive mainly because the secondary flow structures are influenced by the host of geometrical and flow parameters, which are yet to be investigated in detail. The three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and continuity equations were solved using a standard Computational Fluid Dynamics solver to predict mean velocity, secondary flow and turbulent kinetic energy. Five different flow cases of various model scales and relative depths were considered. Detailed analyses of the measured and predicted flow variables were carried out to understand mean flow mechanisms and turbulent secondary flow structures in compound meandering channels. The streamwise vorticity equation was used to quantify the complex and three-dimensional behaviour of <b>secondary</b> flow <b>circulations</b> in terms of their generation, development and decay along the half-meander wavelength. The turbulent kinetic energy equation was used to understand energy expense mechanisms of <b>secondary</b> flow <b>circulations.</b> The strengths of <b>secondary</b> flow <b>circulations</b> were calculated and compared for different flow cases considered. The main findings from this research are as follows. The shearing of the main channel flow as the floodplain flow plunges into and over the main channel influences the mean and turbulent flow structures particularly in the crossover region. The horizontal shear layer at the inner bankfull level generates <b>secondary</b> flow <b>circulations.</b> As the depth of flow increases, the point of generation of <b>secondary</b> flow <b>circulations</b> moves downstream. The secondary shear stress significantly contributes towards the generation of streamwise vorticity and the production of turbulent kinetic energy.

40|$|Recently, several {{laboratory}} experiments on vortex dynamics and quasi-two-dimensional turbulence {{have been performed}} in thin (stratified) fluid layers. Commonly, it is tacitly assumed that vertical motions, giving rise to a three-dimensional character of the flow, are inhibited by the limited vertical dimension. However, shallow water flows, which are vertically bounded by a no-slip bottom and a free surface, necessarily possess a three-dimensional structure due to the shear in the vertical direction. This shear may lead to significant <b>secondary</b> <b>circulations.</b> In this paper, the three-dimensional (3 D) structure and the decay properties of vortices in shallow layers of fluid, both homogeneous and stratified, have been studied in detail by 3 D direct numerical simulations. The quasi-two-dimensionality of these flows {{is an important issue}} if one is interested in a comparison of experiments of this type with purely two-dimensional theoretical models. The influence of several flow parameters, like the depth of the fluid and the Reynolds number, has been investigated. In general, it can be concluded that the flow loses its two-dimensional character for larger fluid depth and larger Reynolds number. Furthermore, it is possible to construct a regime diagram that allows the assessment of the parameter regime, where the flow can be considered as quasi-two-dimensional. It is found that the presence of <b>secondary</b> <b>circulations</b> within a planar vortex flow results in a deformation of the radial profile of axial vorticity.

During ebb, anti-clockwise circulations persisted, as predicted by classical theory. These data were analysed with a 3 D and a 1 DV-model. The 3 D simulations reveal that the anomalous circulations are found when salinity is included in the computations—without salinity “normal” circulations were found. From analytical and 1 DV simulations, it is concluded that a longitudinal salinity gradient may induce a near-bed maximum in flow velocity reversing the direction of the secondary currents. The 1 DV-model was then used to assess the contribution of various processes one by one. It was found that because of a reduction in vertical mixing, the vertical velocity profile is not at equilibrium during the first phase of accelerating tide, further enhancing the effects of.

The {{central part of the}} experimental domain presented a cyclonic eddy in the ocean, which corresponded to a cold sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly. Winds were weaker within the eddy than outside of it, with lower latent and sensible heat loss. In order to analyze the relationship between the SST and wind anomalies, three numerical experiments were conducted with a regional atmospheric model. Three 3 -month runs of the model were performed, using a realistic SST field, a smoothed SST field in which the cold SST was not present (reference run), and an SST field where the cold anomaly was increased by two degrees, successively. The fields simulated with the realistic SST were consistent with satellite sensor derived observations. In particular, the weak wind area over the cold SST anomaly was successfully rendered, whereas it was not present in the forcing fields.
