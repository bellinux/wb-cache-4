5|$|A <b>survey</b> <b>in</b> 1932 {{found that}} the roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961. A <b>survey</b> <b>in</b> 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the doors and wall plate.|$|E

5|$|A {{fluxgate}} gradiometer <b>survey</b> <b>in</b> July 2009 investigated standing {{stones in}} the garden of the Druids Arms public house known as The Cove, which showed that the stones date from nearly a thousand years before the stone circles. The conclusion from the study was that these upright stones are likely to have been the portals or façade of a chambered tomb.|$|E
5|$|A further <b>survey</b> <b>in</b> late 2015 by {{watchdog}} Transport Focus, {{found that}} satisfaction levels had increased; 89% of passengers {{surveyed said they}} were either ‘very’ or ‘fairly’ satisfied with their overall journey, up from 83% in 2013, but still {{below the national average}} of 92%. It also found that 58% felt the service was value for money. The national average rating for value for money on all tram networks was 69%.|$|E

5|$|A <b>survey</b> <b>in</b> 1454, {{undertaken}} {{against the}} background of another French invasion scare, shows that the 1377 system for maintaining the walls was still in operation. A town gunner had also been appointed by the 15th century, earning the highest salary of any local official and was responsible for maintaining the guns and manufacturing gunpowder. As late as the mid-16th century, additional improved rectangular gunports, similar to those on the Device Forts along the Channel, were added to the West Gate by the quays.|$|E
5|$|A <b>survey</b> <b>in</b> 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire {{recorded}} seven 17th and 18th century memorials {{within the}} church, {{the oldest in}} memory of a Thomas Owen who died in 1646. The tombs in the churchyard include one of a Sidney Griffith (died 1618) and more than 20 others from the 17th and 18th centuries. The survey also noted some oak dog tongs, likely {{to be from the}} 19th century, and three 17th-century chairs.|$|E
5|$|A <b>survey</b> <b>in</b> 2005 of 88 {{paediatric}} neurologists in the US {{found that}} 36% regularly prescribed the diet after {{three or more}} drugs had failed; 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort; 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases; and 16% had never prescribed the diet. There are several possible explanations for this gap between evidence and clinical practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians, who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.|$|E

5|$|A <b>survey</b> <b>in</b> 2012 {{revealed}} that 12%, or around one in 10 people in Greater Manchester use Metrolink {{to travel to}} work, and 8% use the system every day. The system is most commonly used by 21- to 30-year olds, and was used most markedly by residents of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury — accounting for around {{a third of their}} commuter journeys.|$|E
5|$|A <b>survey</b> <b>in</b> 2012 {{revealed}} that passengers who used Metrolink everyday for commuting rated service levels as poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions. TfGM recognised {{that the older}} vehicles in its fleet – the T68/T68As — were outdated {{and the cause of}} much disruption, and agreed to replace them with M5000s by 2014. Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better in the survey. A <b>survey</b> <b>in</b> 2013 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom – Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, NET, Midland Metro and Blackpool tramway – Metrolink had the lowest overall satisfaction rating in the United Kingdom. Respondents were surveyed on value for money, punctuality, seating availability, tram stops and overall satisfaction. Metrolink was below average on all criteria, and 47% believed Metrolink was value for money compared to a national average of 60%.|$|E
