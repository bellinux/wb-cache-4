Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani stated, [...] "The melodramatic, string-laden ballad 'Unfaithful' is, if nothing else, an ambitious second single {{for an artist}} like Rihanna, and with lyrics like 'I don't {{want to be a}} murderer/Our love, his trust/I might as well take a gun and put it to his head,' it earns bonus points just for being <b>so</b> <b>fucking</b> weird".|$|E
500|$|Lucas Bros. Moving Co. is an {{animated}} television series created by twins Kenny and Keith Lucas of [...] "The Lucas Brothers", a Brooklyn-based comedy duo. The series, featuring {{the voices of}} the twins as their animated counterparts, originally had them working as installers for a cable company, a job which the Lucas brothers occupied in real life. This idea was scrapped according to Keith, who felt the premise too close to that of The Cleveland Show, another animated series aired by Fox. Kenny insisted that [...] "moving was just more Brooklyn", a sentiment which Keith echoed, thinking that [...] "it would be funny if we were movers because we've never moved a thing in our lives and we're <b>so</b> <b>fucking</b> weak and we hate physical labor". Keith complemented the nature of the premise, finding it to be flexible with any character or setting.|$|E

The final scene, also censored from television airing, involved Chris laughing excessively at one of his own jokes, concluding with [...] "Oh, I peed and pooped." [...] These scenes were removed from FOX, but not from Adult Swim or the DVD. Another scene involves a man driving in a Hummer, while watching the 2005 film Madagascar in his car.

In the picture, Madonna was seen sitting with Kills in front of two microphones, and as noted by Keith Caulfield of Billboard, [...] "n the foreground is Martin Kierszenbaum, the founder and chairman of Cherrytree Records and senior executive of A for Interscope Records". In an interview for Paper, Kills revealed that Madonna's dancers used to play Kills' songs during their rehearsals and workouts every week, which interested Madonna to collaborate with her.

500|$|She {{described}} the music as [...] "dirty south hip-hop" [...] and combining the genres of hip-hop and country, which she felt was a [...] "good hybrid". To achieve this sound, Cyrus worked with various hip hop producers including Mike Will Made It, Mac Miller, Pharrell Williams, and Tyler, the Creator in cities including Atlanta, Georgia. They {{helped her to}} incorporate hip hop music elements into the project, which Cyrus acknowledged resulted in a [...] "really different sound". Cyrus further commented that her project would [...] "shut everyone up", and later compared the record to Bad (1987) by Michael Jackson, in that [...] "people still are listening to [...] because it's <b>so</b> <b>fucking</b> dope" [...] and [...] " [...] people to listen to [...] album like that." [...] She also expressed her desire to [...] "set a new standard for pop music". Producer Sean Garrett called the record [...] "fun [...] exciting", and stated that a collaboration that Cyrus recorded with Britney Spears would appear on the final track listing. Mike Will Made It explained that the title for the album was decided upon after realizing that [...] "whole album was bangers".|$|E

There has never been any mystery to why Spears became such a superstar, but these songs probably would have been huge even if Britney wore burlap sacks in all of her videos." [...] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone gave the album two stars out of five, and compared the album's sound to early hits of Debbie Gibson, Mariah Carey, and Samantha Fox. Walters also said that [...] "while several Cherion-crafted kiddie-funk jams serve up beefy hooks, shameless schlock slowies, like 'E-Mail My Heart', are pure spam." [...] A NME reviewer rated ...Baby One More Time 1 out of 10, saying that [...] "we seem to have reached crisis point: pubescent pop is now so rife that 17-year-old Britney 'lizard-lounge' Spears is already halfway through her lucrative showbiz career". He also found the album premature, commenting, [...] "hopefully, if she starts to live the wretched life that we all eventually do, her voice will show the scars, she'll stop looking <b>so</b> <b>fucking</b> smug, she'll find solace in drugs and we'll be all the more happier for it. Now grow up, girl. Quick!" [...] Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic felt that, [...] "with the exception of the terrific title track, ...Baby One More Time is a collection of either competent pop songs underwhelmingly executed or underwhelmingly written pop songs competently executed." ...|$|E

It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with...

One member of the audience posed the question: Going by your Nazi joke and your odd Israeli joke, have you ever been accused of being antisemitic? Tiernan responded: Have I ever been accused of being anti-Semitic? I certainly have, yeah. In America, these two people waited for me after a show. I used to do this joke about… the Jews say they never killed Jesus, and the joke was, I would say the line, [...] "Well, it wasn't the fucking Mexicans", was the joke, like. Yeah, Jewish people came up to me afterwards... Have you ever seen people whose eyes are so aflame with righteousness… The whites of their eyes are <b>so</b> pure and <b>fucking</b> white.

Randal loses his temper and verbally explodes, saying that Dante deserves the blame, as Dante, closed the store to play hockey, closed it again to go to the wake, and closed it yet again to try to hook up with his ex-girlfriend, cheating on his current one in the process. He then says that Dante came to work of his own free will and [...] "overcompensates for having a monkey's job".

Many of her large-scale appliqués are made on hotel linens, for example, It Always Hurts (2005), Sometimes I Feel <b>So</b> <b>Fucking</b> Lost (2005), Volcano Closed (2001) and Helter Fucking Skelter (2001). Hate And Power Can Be A Terrible Thing (2004), part of the Tate's collection of Emin's work, is a large-scale blanket inspired in part by Margaret Thatcher due to her involvement in [...] "an attack on 800 boys and men in the Argentinian navy" [...] and other women for example women who steals their friends' boyfriends, Emin says of this work [...] "about the kind of women I hate, the kind of women I have no respect for, women who betray and destroy the hearts of other women".|$|E

[...] Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words [...] "kids" [...] and [...] "Columbine" [...] from the line [...] "I take seven [...] from , stand them all in line" [...] from [...] "I'm Back", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a [...] "curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, [...] "That Columbine shit is <b>so</b> <b>fucking</b> touchy. As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked {{at it from the}} fuckin' {{point of view of the}} kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I've been that mad." [...] The full line appears uncensored in Eminem's song [...] "Rap God" [...] from The Marshall Mathers LP 2.

My information is broken and that's what makes China wonky and interesting, because it's what's <b>so</b> <b>fucking</b> wrong about college." [...] Similarly, in the series, Neely parodies popular culture elements that he knows only through passing mentions. The season two episode, [...] "The Diamond Castle", parodies the Mad Men episode, [...] "The Other Woman", which Neely stated he had never watched before; he explained that [...] "We do that often where we'll just take my ignorance and run with it." [...] The A.V. Club interview also has Neely describe aspects of the series inspired by his Arkansan upbringing; he admits that he [...] "talk about [...] all the time, it turns out.

It's happening all over southern United States, where wild boars are just overpopulating—they tear up the land and land owners and cattle ranchers have to hunt these things and put Kevlar vests on their dogs because they have horns and shit." ...|$|E
