5000|$|He {{moved to}} England with First Division side Port Vale on a three-month loan in November 1996, during the <b>Swedish</b> winter <b>break.</b> He played 11 league {{games in the}} 1996-97 season, and scored his first goal in the Football League at Vale Park on 19 January, in a 4-4 draw with Queens Park Rangers. Back with Norrköping, he scored two goals in nine games in the 1997 season. Port Vale manager John Rudge signed him {{permanently}} {{during the summer of}} 1997 for a £200,000 fee. He scored five goals in 32 league and two League Cup appearances in the 1997-98 season, the last two of which helped to secure a 4-0 win over Huddersfield Town at the Alfred McAlpine Stadium {{on the final day of}} the season - the victory kept the [...] "Valiants" [...] out of the relegation zone. However, he featured just eight times in the 1998-99 season before being released by new manager Brian Horton in February.|$|R
50|$|At Molineux Dodd helped Wolves's gain {{promotion}} in 1982-83, but a poor 1983-84 campaign {{saw them}} {{make a quick}} return to the second tier and with back to back relegations looming he returned to Stoke in January 1985. Stoke were enduring a truly woeful campaign themselves and Dodd who had now lost his pace was regularly exposed by {{the speed of the}} forwards in the First Division as Stoke suffered an embarrassing relegation. Prompted by journalist Peter Keeling, Dodd moved to Sweden playing for IF Elfsborg, GAIS and Landskrona BoIS over a six-year period. He helped Elfsborg win promotion out of the Division 2 Södra into the Allsvenskan in 1985. He achieved the same feat with GAIS in 1987 (though the division had been renamed Division 1 Södra). He returned to Staffordshire in December 1986, playing three times on loan at Third Division side Port Vale during the <b>Swedish</b> mid-winter <b>break</b> and also played in Ireland for Cork City in December 1987. He later played non-league football in Staffordshire for Rocester, Goldenhill Wanderers and Ball Haye Green.|$|R

50|$|The first {{championship}} {{was held}} in Portugal in June 1994. The host nation had not managed to qualify for any World Championship thus far, and they finished 12th and last after losing all six games, including 21-38 to Romania in the 11th-place play-off. Sweden became the first European champion after defeating Russia by 34-21 in the final, Russia's heaviest loss in their international history. Both teams {{had gone through the}} tournament without loss, but Sweden's fast breaks became the key in the final; they scored 14 of their 34 goals on fast <b>breaks.</b> <b>Swedish</b> middle back Magnus Andersson was named the event's best player and Russian left back Vasily Kudinov was top scorer with 50 goals.|$|R

September later released her third single [...] "Flowers on the Grave", which was released on 1 March 2006. The song was unsuccessful in Sweden, as it did not manage to chart on any important charts. After it did not manage to chart, it was released additionally as a promotional single outside Scandinavia and Europe. After releasing the single, she later released her fourth single [...] "It Doesn't Matter". The song {{was not meant to}} release in Sweden, instead in other parts of Europe. It had minor success in Russia and Romania, where it peaked at 121 and 66 respectively. It had success through Poland, where it peaked at number 20. September released her fifth single from In Orbit entitled [...] "Cry for You" [...] on 29 November 2006.

The song was certified Gold by International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) in Sweden.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1380s, a {{civil war}} in the Scandinavian part of Sweden brought unrest to Finland as well. The victor of this {{struggle}} was Queen Margaret I of Denmark, who brought the three Scandinavian kingdoms of Sweden, Denmark and Norway under her rule (the [...] "Kalmar Union") in 1389. The next 130 years or so were characterized by attempts of different <b>Swedish</b> factions to <b>break</b> out of the Union. Finland was sometimes involved in these struggles, but in general the 15th century {{seems to have been a}} relatively prosperous time, characterized by population growth and economic development. Towards the end of the 15th century, however, the situation on the eastern border became more tense. The Principality of Moscow conquered Novgorod, preparing the way for a unified Russia, and from 1495–1497 a war was fought between Sweden and Russia. The fortress-town of Viborg stood against a Russian siege; according to a contemporary legend, it was saved by a miracle.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} Bachelor {{thesis is}} analysing how the Swedish armed forces promotes women {{in order to}} attract them to their organisation. Specifically it investigates (1) "How does the <b>Swedish</b> armed forces <b>break</b> the social norms {{of what it means to}} be a soldier?" (2) "How do they present a gender equal division of labour?" (3) "How do they try to affect women´s attitude towards the organisation?" This study investigates the Swedish armed forces, an organisation with a great underrepresentation of women. The underrepresentation of women is something that the Swedish armed forces openly tries to change through their marketing. This thesis is a single case study with both qualitative and quantitative approach, using Harding´s gender process theory in a descriptive design. By gathering television commercials from the Swedish armed forces user page on YouTube, I explore how the Swedish armed forces tries to minimize the underrepresentation of women. Their strategies are analysed by using Harding´s three gender processes. The results show that the organisation is active in all three processes, but focuses on breaking the social norms of what it means to be a soldier...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine the Taiwanese Tone Sandhi Group domain. Replicating Carlson et al. 's (2005) {{perception}} study, an experiment was conducted aiming to see whether Taiwanese listeners were able to predict the occurrence and strength of upcoming boundaries - Word, Tone Sandhi Group and Utterance. Stimuli were selected from a corpus of spontaneous Swedish speech and Taiwanese read speech, so as to vary in Boundary types (no break vs. weak break vs. strong break), Fragment size (long vs. short), and Filtering (normal vs. low-pass filtered). These fragments were presented to two Taiwanese listeners who were instructed to guess which a prosodic break would follow each fragment. Results revealed that Boundary type is a factor that influenced the judgments when stimuli with all boundary types, fragment sizes and filtering conditions were combined. Taiwanese listeners are able to differentiate strong break vs. weak break vs no <b>break</b> in <b>Swedish</b> and strong <b>break</b> vs. weak break in Taiwanese, but not weak break vs. no break in Taiwanese. In addition, Taiwanese listeners, like American English listeners in Carlson et al's study, were able to hear the boundaries in Swedish in normal speech. Acoustic and prosodic correlates from the Taiwanese stimuli were also examined. There was a significant but small correlation found between judgments and the pause duration. Final-word duration ratio and Energy seem to be the most reliable cues to differentiate all Boundary types. Moreover, voice quality analysis suggests that breathiness, rather than creakiness, was potentially used to distinguish Tone Sandhi Group boundaries from Utterance boundaries...|$|R
2500|$|The {{first major}} {{overseas}} deployment came in 1960, when Irish troops {{were sent to}} the Congo as part of the UN force ONUC. The Belgian Congo became an independent Republic on 30 June 1960. Twelve days later, the Congolese government requested military assistance from the United Nations to maintain its territorial integrity. On 28 July 1960 Lt-Col Murt Buckley led the 32nd Irish Battalion to the newly independent central African country. This was the most costly enterprise for the Army since the Civil War, as 26 Irish soldiers lost their lives. Nine died in a single incident called the [...] "Niemba Ambush", in which an eleven-man Irish patrol was ambushed by local tribesmen. Nine Irish soldiers and some 25 tribesmen were killed. A Niemba Ambush commemoration is hosted annually by the Irish Veterans Organisation (ONET) in Cathal Brugha Barracks, on the nearest Saturday to the actual date of the ambush. One of the largest ONUC engagements in which Irish troops were involved was the Siege of Jadotville. During this action, a small party of 150 Irish soldiers ("A" [...] Company, 35th Battalion) was attacked by a larger force of almost 4,000 Katangese troops, as well as French, Belgian and Rhodesian mercenaries, and supported by a trainer jet (a Fouga CM.170 Magister), equipped for ground attack. The Irish soldiers repeatedly repelled the attackers, and knocked out enemy artillery and mortar positions using 60mm mortars. An attempt was made by 500 Irish and <b>Swedish</b> soldiers to <b>break</b> through to the besieged company, but it failed. The Irish commander eventually surrendered his forces. A small number of Irish soldiers were wounded, but none killed. It is estimated that up to 300 of their attackers were killed, including 30 white mercenaries, and up to 1,000 wounded. A total of 6,000 Irishmen served in the Congo from 1960 until 1964.|$|R
40|$|Our {{starting}} point {{has been to}} use the football player Zlatan Ibrahimovic as a model person for individualism that seams to break the ordinary socialization pattern in Sweden. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine how the team leaders handle the socialization of more individualistic focused individuals/young persons into groups, since the Swedish School Curriculum is designed to meet each individual on his or hers former experiences. Is the socialization of individuals within team sports affected by their cultural background? And, in that case, should those facts have consequences for the sport subject at school? Those are the questions we want to explore. Besides a survey of documents, we have been seeking answers to our questions through interviews with the team leaders Roland Nilsson and Peter Bergander, the pedagogues/teachers Karin Jutterström and Håkan Jensgård and the professional football player Abgar Barson. Our study shows that the leaders and teachers of today have begun to change their view about individualists. Further, our study shows that young persons with other ethnic origin/foreign background that choose their own ways can be disqualified by a national view that is different from the perception of the ethnic <b>Swedish,</b> when they <b>break</b> the unwritten and unspoken rules and standards. Our conclusion is that a change seems to be happening in the mentality of the mainstream Swedish society. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has become an object of identification for many young people in Sweden during the last years. It´s our point of view that the concept of “being a Zlatan” stands for a person that dares to be an extreme individualist. We believe that we stand upon a change of paradigm on the notion of individualism in Sweden since the collective thinking in Swedish society seems to be developing towards a higher acceptance for an individualistic behaviour. This is, as we see it, a development within team sports as well as a development in the rest of Swedish society, for instance, within the educational system...|$|R
