Black's deduction is correct, and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning.|$|E

Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E

30|$|Generally speaking, the {{security}} of such lightweight block ciphers for the resource-constrained environment has their own properties. Usually, security for these applications is just needed to be achieved moderately, {{and that is to}} say, the demanded ciphers for constrained environment do not require high-level security, and this is essential in the Internet. On the other hand, attackers in this cryptography environment may be lack of information that is needed to implement cryptanalysis and they themselves can be energy-constrained sometimes, causing the attackers to adopt optimized algorithms and to be <b>smarter</b> <b>enough</b> to effectively implement their attacks [49]. Note that {{there is no need for}} lightweight block ciphers to encrypt a great large number of data, and the length of these data is always delimited into short segments as it is typical in the context of Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks. Lastly, {{the security}} performance of each block cipher should be deeply analyzed when the cipher can be practically used in the real environment. Both hardware performance and software performance for lightweight ciphers must be considered, and the hardware performance for some applications, especially for RFID, is the primary consideration. For the specific application, there are some relevant metrics and criteria to measure whether cipher algorithms are good.|$|R
