40|$|Highly tunable diodes and multidiode biasing {{configurations}} can {{be employed}} to enhance the tuning range of frequency selective surfaces (FSS). The paper considers a variety of such diodes and configurations, demonstrating experimentally a wideband tuning that can be in excess of 500 MHz. However, the presence of varactor biasing electrodes leads to the distortion of the FSS response. The paper describes how the problem can be eliminated through the novel use of <b>surface-mount</b> <b>resistors.</b> The experimental results are obtained in a waveguide setup, within the 1. 6 - 2. 7 -GHz range.

40|$|With the {{industry}} striving for smaller devices, new technologies are developed to further miniaturize electronics devices. To this end, realization of 3 D/non-planar interconnects, which aim at miniaturizing the interconnects formed between components {{on the same}} device, has attracted many researchers. This thesis focuses on a feasibility analysis for developing non-planar interconnects on various flexible substrates using laser assisted maskless microdeposition (LAMM), which is a pressure-less process. There {{are two types of}} flexible substrates that are used: double-sided copper substrates separated by a layer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as well as a polyethylene terephthalate flexible substrate with <b>surface-mounted</b> <b>resistors.</b> For both substrates, multiple types of experiments were conducted to discover procedures which result in the highest rate of success for forming conductive interconnects. Optimal process parameters and deposition techniques were determined after multiple experiments. After experiments were completed, the resultant substrates were subject to various characterization methodologies including optical and scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and profilometery. The results of these methodologies are documented in this thesis. After many types of experiments involving substrate manipulation of the double-sided copper substrates, it was shown that the silver nano-particles were more likely to form a conductive interconnect when a polished slant was fabricated on the substrate. Many deposition patterns were used for the flexible substrates with <b>surface-mounted</b> <b>resistors.</b> Of these patterns, the two patterns, the ‘zigzag’ and ‘dot solder’ patterns, proved to have a much higher success rate for creating conductive interconnects compared to the other patterns. During this study, the results of the experiments using the LAMM process show that this technology has great potential for creating non-planar interconnects on flexible substrates. The experiments however suggest that the process is very sensitive to the material composition and process parameters. As such, with a small change in parameters, the 3 D interconnects can fail to be produced. It was also observed that the possibility of silver interconnect fractures is higher where dissimilar materials with different thermal expansion rates are used for the underlying substrates...|$|R
40|$|<b>Surface-mounted</b> <b>resistors</b> on {{electronic}} circuit board are inexpensive and accurate, but resistors embedded in circuit boards can attain the same accuracy only after costly post-deposition trimming. Improved low cost methodologies of resistor fabrications are needed for cost effective embedding of resistors into polymeric substrates. Polymer Thick Film Resistors (PTFRs) are low temperature processable, low cost resistors with a wide resistivity range. The electrical resistance variation of these resistors is approximately +/- 10 % after deposition and additional trimming procedure to tune the resistances to meet specifications. This adds. to the cost and complicates the fabrication process when the resistors are embedded. In this study, the influences of PTFRs geometries on the resistance tolerances were investigated. Results indicated that the accuracy of stencil printed resistors was markedly higher than the screen-printed resistors. The screen printed resistor edge geometries were observed to be rough. FEM analyses revealed that the resistance tolerances were associated with edge roughness. Remedies to the variations were proposed {{and the relationship between}} resistance tolerances and aperture orientations was also outlined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{thermal noise}} of the {{resistive}} vee dipole (RVD) has been analyzed using a numerical model based on the method of moments. The RVD analyzed in this paper has curved arms and is loaded with <b>surface-mount</b> chip <b>resistors,</b> which approximate a modified Wu-King profile. The total noise power delivered to a 200 Ω feed line and the contribution of individual resistors to the total noise power are presented. The {{results show that the}} noise temperature of the RVD is very high and the resistors close to the drive point contribute more to the total noise power than do the resistors close to the open ends of the antenna arms. 1...|$|R

50|$|Usually a thin {{nichrome}} wire is used. Some applications {{also use}} platinum-silver alloy; other bridgewire materials in use are platinum, gold, silver, tungsten, etc. Care {{has to be}} taken when selecting the material as it is in direct contact with the pyrotechnic composition and should not undergo corrosion in such conditions. Another material, able to actively release chemical energy, is Pyrofuze, aluminium wire clad with palladium; when being heated it undergoes strongly exothermic reaction as the molten metals form an alloy. A variant with the same function consists of laminated thin alternate layers of aluminium and nickel. Carbon bridge is a thin spot of colloidal graphite used as the bridgewire. Some variants use a conductive pyrotechnic composition as the resistive material. In amateur rocketry, grossly overloaded low wattage metal film <b>resistors</b> and 0805 <b>Surface-mount</b> technology <b>resistors</b> are also used.|$|R
5000|$|For example, a <b>surface-mounted</b> 0805 size <b>resistor</b> of 0.003 ohms, {{rated at}} 1/2 watt can, in theory, safely pass up to 12.9 amperes of current. In practice, when {{approaching}} the power limit {{for a given}} package, it is good practice to either use an even lower-ohm product (more power-efficient but more expensive) or go up one package size larger (same power efficiency but cost may be kept lower). The [...] "cost" [...] associated with taking up more board space for the larger package {{may also be a}} consideration. In this example, for 12 amperes to pass through the jumper, a lower resistance or a bigger surface-mount package (such as a 1206) are usually specified. In contrast, a [...] "worst-case zero-ohm" [...] real-world jumper with 0.05-ohm impedance in a similar 0805 package could only pass 3.1 amperes maximum. The use of specific tolerance resistances is a much safer design practice for higher currents than the [...] "zero-ohm" [...] option, although the bill-of-materials cost can be higher for low-ohm devices.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{efforts have been}} devoted to developing technologies for fabricating electronic circuits in three dimensions using ink-jet processes. The management of generated heat in such circuits will require them to incorporate specialized design features for promoting the removal of unwanted heat from key areas and the limiting of component temperatures to safe levels. Hence, effective tools for predicting the heat transfer characteristics of three-dimensional circuits are required to develop optimum designs. This research encompasses a course of investigation including the development of such design tools and their verification using experimental methods. These experimental methods consisted of thermal tests conducted with prototype circuits constructed in three dimensions, with materials appropriate to the overarching design concept. After the verification process, the investigation proceeded {{with the construction of}} numerical models to compare a range of design features expected to enhance passive heat rejection in the discrete resistive component. The relative impact of each of these structures as well as the impact of specific material choices is comparatively evaluated using the developed tools. Further research centered on the fabrication and testing of a circuit which more fully incorporated the 3 -D architecture by employing a <b>surface-mount</b> technology (SMT) <b>resistor</b> and by embedding the resistor and conductive components within a cast polymer matrix. Experiments with this circuit and corresponding finite-element models showed that for the power dissipation levels investigated, the presence of the embedding medium actually results in lower temperatures at the resistive component. It was shown {{in the course of this}} latter investigation that film coefficients calculated by standard methods do not effectively account for interactions between adjacent convective surfaces in these circuit architectures. A numerical model featuring thermal/fluid dynamics capability and simplified geometry compared to the actual circuit was shown to correlate well with live tests. These model results can be used to calculate improved values for the film coefficients to be applied to models not featuring fluid capability. The models with improved film coefficients similarly provided resistor temperature values which correlated well with the live test results...|$|R
