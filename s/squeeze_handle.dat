50|$|Engineers {{designed}} the EASEP to deploy with one <b>squeeze</b> <b>handle,</b> and the Laser Ranging Retro Reflector (LRRR) also deployed within ten minutes. Despite the simpler design, the seismometer was sensitive enough to detect Neil Armstrong's movements during sleep.|$|E
50|$|A Johnson bar is a {{hand lever}} with several {{distinct}} positions {{and a positive}} latch to hold the lever in the selected position. The latch is typically activated with a spring-loaded <b>squeeze</b> <b>handle</b> on the lever so that only one hand is needed to release the latch, move the lever, then re-engage the latch in a different position. This is an American English term; in British English, the lever is named for its function.|$|E
40|$|Lever-action {{quick-release}} pin operated more easily. Mechanism operated with gloved hand. In modified version, lever added to handle to facilitate actuation. Lever action reduces actuation force. Lever-action pin operated by squeezing on any point of moveable ends of lever and handle together between {{thumb and forefinger}} or by simply grasping and <b>squeezing</b> <b>handle</b> and lever with entire hand in more natural grasp...|$|R

50|$|Burette {{can be held}} by methods {{suggested}} below. Fix the burette on a stand, <b>squeeze</b> the <b>handle,</b> rubber knob {{will then}} separate from each other. Burette will be put between the rubber knob. The rubber knob are typically soft and sticky due to properties of rubber, so the burettes {{are not likely to}} break or slip during the experiment.|$|R
50|$|A flint spark lighter {{works by}} rapidly rubbing {{a small piece}} of ferrocerium upon the sharp edge of any {{substance}} that is harder than the rod, However carbon steel works better than most any other material {{in much the same way}} flint and steel are used. This manual rubbing action, done by <b>squeezing</b> the <b>handle,</b> creates a spark which then lights the gaseous fuel.|$|R
50|$|The user {{holds the}} gripper {{in one hand}} and <b>squeezes</b> the two <b>handles</b> {{together}} until they touch. Once touched, the handles are released and the movement is repeated. Variations of this basic movement include negatives below, and a variety of partial movements. For example, if the strength of the gripper is beyond that of the user, the user might apply maximum force, moving the handles as far as possible, even if the handles cannot be made to touch. Another partial movement involves using two hands to <b>squeeze</b> the <b>handles</b> within approximately 19 mm (3/4 inch) of each other, releasing one hand and then using the other hand to make the handles of the gripper touch each other. Negatives involve starting the gripper handles touching and then resisting as the gripper opens up, in an eccentric contraction.|$|R
40|$|Wrench {{converts}} gripping {{action of}} hand to rotary motion without imparting reactive moments or forces on part being turned or on operator. Wrench should {{be useful in}} undersea operations and other delicate work where reactive forces and torques have to be controlled. In design for valve tightening, tool resembles cross between conventional spanner wrench and pilers. One handle engages valve body; second handle has ratchet pawl that engages toothed coupling ring on perimeter of valve <b>handle.</b> When operator <b>squeezes</b> wrench <b>handles,</b> valve handle rotates with respect to valve body...|$|R
5000|$|A {{mechanically}} powered flashlight is {{a flashlight}} that {{is powered by}} electricity generated by the muscle power of the user, so it does not need replacement of batteries, or recharging from an electrical source. There are several types which use different operating mechanisms. They use different motions to generate the required power; such as <b>squeezing</b> a <b>handle,</b> winding a crank, or shaking the flashlight itself. These flashlights can also be distinguished by the technique used to store the energy: a spring, [...] a flywheel, a battery or a capacitor.|$|R
40|$|New tool makes installation, adjustment, {{and removal}} of self-clamping arc-light reflectors on welding torches easy and simple. Consists of two arms {{reaching}} around from back of torch. Lip on each arm hooks into slot of arc-light reflector clamp. When <b>handles</b> <b>squeezed</b> together, slot spreads enabling easy installation, adjustment, or removal of reflector without disassembly of welding apparatus...|$|R
50|$|A dyno torch, dynamo torch, or squeeze {{flashlight}} is {{a flashlight}} or pocket torch which stores energy in a flywheel. The user repeatedly <b>squeezes</b> a <b>handle</b> to spin a flywheel inside the flashlight, {{attached to a}} small dynamo, supplying electric current to an incandescent bulb or light-emitting diode. The flashlight must be pumped continuously during use, with the flywheel turning the generator between squeezes to keep the light going continuously. Because electrical power is produced only when the <b>handle</b> is <b>squeezed,</b> a switch is not needed. Dyno torches were issued to soldiers during World War II, and were popular in Europe during the war because the electrical power supply to homes was not very reliable. A version using a pull-cord was used in World War I.|$|R
5000|$|At one time, several {{manufacturers}} made a [...] "crushable wafer tumbler" [...] {{for these}} locks, {{the idea being}} to simplify the task of rekeying for locksmiths and {{reduce the number of}} different wafers that needed to be manufactured and stocked. To rekey such a lock, the locksmith simply replaced all the wafers with identical [...] "crushable wafers", cut the new key, inserted the key into the plug, inserted the plug into a special [...] "crushing" [...] tool, and <b>squeezed</b> the <b>handle</b> of the tool, crushing the wafers to fit the key. It was quick and easy but had reliability problems: debris from the crushed wafers often remained in the plug causing wear and occasional jamming of wafers or the plug, and sometimes wafers crushed unevenly making them weak and causing them to break later in use. This system was eventually abandoned.|$|R
40|$|Arborjet {{systems were}} 0. 15, 0. 09, and 0. 1 g a. i. / 2. 5 cm DBH, respectively. The {{application}} {{rate in the}} fall with the Wedgle System could not be confirmed, {{as there is no}} component to the application device that permits monitoring of active ingredient placement in the tree. Therefore, plugging of the needle orifice (a common occurrence) led to <b>squeezing</b> the <b>handles</b> without actually placing any product in the tree. Two modifications of the Wedgle method were required for successful springtime trunk injections. To prevent plugging of the needle orifice, a 7 / 6 -inch hole was drilled {{into the center of the}} hole left by the bark corer. The injection plug was then inserted as before, and the needle inserted through the plug into the small diameter hole. Unlike the fall application, the application in the spring resulted i...|$|R
50|$|Salt, pepper, {{and spice}} mills, {{essentially}} the same as coffee mills, usually do not have a handle, the entire top rotating instead. While this is less convenient, only a few turns are required to grind enough. The ground product falls directly onto the food being seasoned; the mill has no container. A few designs have abrasive surfaces which do not rotate; each <b>squeeze</b> of the <b>handles</b> moves one flat plate past another, then the plates are restored to their original position by a spring. Many hard spices are available in containers incorporating a simple cone burr grinder, intended to be discarded when empty.|$|R
5000|$|The saw is {{generally}} played seated with the <b>handle</b> <b>squeezed</b> between the legs, {{and the far}} end held with one hand. Some sawists play standing, either with the handle between the knees and the blade sticking {{out in front of}} them. The saw is usually played with the serrated edge, or [...] "teeth", facing the body, though some players face them away. Some saw players file down the teeth which makes no discernable difference to the sound. Many—especially professional—saw players use a handle, called a Cheat, {{at the tip of the}} saw for easier bending and higher virtuosity.|$|R
50|$|A mysterious sorcerer, {{seeing how}} desperate the two ducks are, shows up {{and tries to}} sell Scrooge a {{shrinking}} potion to use on Flintheart's pile of money, but Scrooge refuses, saying he'll win honestly or won't win at all. Flintheart is thinking about his mother, whose hopes he betrayed when he became dishonest, when the sorcerer shows up trying to sell him the potion. Flintheart agrees to buy five gallons of the potion for five gallons of coins. Flintheart then gets the potion in a sack made of crocodile skin, the only thing besides duck skin that the potion does not affect and is also given crocodile skin <b>squeeze</b> bottles to <b>handle</b> the potion out of the sack.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{previously}} that after removal of premotor cortex, monkeys are poor at selecting movements {{on the basis of}} a visual contextual cue. In those experiments, the monkeys had to pull or turn a handle depending on the color of a cue presented in the foreground or background. In the present experiments, it is shown that animals with lesions that include premotor cortex can select movements correctly if the cue is given by information about the handle itself. In the first experiment, the cue was provided by the direction in which the monkey had last moved the handle; the monkeys had been required to <b>squeeze</b> a <b>handle</b> if they had been forced to squeeze it 5 s earlier, and they were required to turn it if they had been forced to turn it. In the second experiment, the cue was provided by the identity of the handle itself: When presented with a blue handle, they had to pull the handle; when presented with a yellow handle, they had to turn it. It is argued that the animals are impaired only when the task is a true conditional task...|$|R
5000|$|Historically, users {{trained with}} {{grippers}} by doing high repetitions, {{but it has}} been argued that while this was necessary in the days before more challenging grippers were available, this is an inefficient way to increase strength, and that lower repetitions are preferred, consistent with other strength-training protocols [...] Joe Kinney, the first man certified for closing the Captains of Crush No. 4 gripper, is credited with introducing the idea of negatives to gripper training. [...] The idea of starting a gripper from the [...] "deep set" [...] position (approximately 19 mm space in between the handles) originated from an ebook that was inspired by Kinney's success, but then focussed on training principles and techniques developed by the author, not Kinney. [...] Randall Strossen has argued that the generally accepted principles of effective strength training apply to grippers, just as they do to any other movement.Performing strongman John Brookfield developed strap holds, the idea of hanging a small weight from a strap or belt which is kept in place by <b>squeezing</b> the <b>handles</b> of a gripper hard enough to keep the weight from falling one of many training innovations he pioneered. [...] Armwrestlers were among the first to establish specific training protocols using grippers, as part of a larger strength training program for their sport.|$|R
40|$|Military and {{aerospace}} industries use Mil-Spec type electrical connections on bulkhead panels that require inline access for mate and demate operations. These connectors are usually in tight proximity to other connectors, or recessed within panels. The pliers described {{here have been}} designed to work in such tight spaces, and consist of a mirrored set of parallel handles, two cross links, two return springs, and replaceable polyurethane-coated end effectors. The polyurethane eliminates metal-to-metal contact and provides a high-friction surface between the jaw and the connector. Operationally, the user would slide the pliers over the connector shell until the molded polyurethane lip makes contact with the connector shell edge. Then, by <b>squeezing</b> the <b>handles,</b> the end effector jaws grip the connector shell, allowing the connector to be easily disconnected by rotating the pliers. Mating the connector occurs by reversing the prescribed procedure, except the connector shell is placed into the jaws by hand. The molded lip within the jaw allows the user to apply additional force for difficult-to-mate connectors. Handle design has been carefully examined to maximize comfort, limit weight, incorporate tether locations, and improve ergonomics. They have been designed with an off-axis offset for wiring harness clearance, while placing the connector axis of rotation close to the user s axis of wrist rotation. This was done to eliminate fatigue during multiple connector panel servicing. To limit handle opening width, with user ergonomics in mind, the pliers were designed using a parallel jaw mechanism. A cross-link mechanism was used to complete this task, while ensuring smooth operation...|$|R
50|$|When engaged, an {{automatic}} wire stripper first simultaneously grips the wire in {{one side and}} in the other side closes its shaped blades cutting the insulation around the conductor. After the sides have completed their strokes {{the two sides of the}} mechanism spread apart to push the cut tube of insulation from the end of the conductor. To use it, one simply places the wire in the jaws at the cutting slot matching the size of the conductor and <b>squeezes</b> the <b>handles</b> together. This device allows even a novice to strip most wires very quickly. The automatic wire stripper's cutter must be short, because it causes the jaws to twist, as described by Wood in the 1943 patent. All wire strippers are inherently limited to those wire sizes the cutting jaw notches will accommodate. An automatic wire stripper's short cutter limits it to fewer notches and a smaller range of wire sizes than most other types of wire strippers. The accuracy of the cutting blade opening determines the smallest conductor that can be reliably stripped. If the cutter opening is to small it will impinge on the conductor causing excess friction and more tension than the wire can withstand. If the cutter opening is too large the tension required to tear the remaining annulus of uncut insulation may be greater than the wire can withstand. Some models have an adjustable grip tension, to adjust the clamping force of the gripping jaw. The knob below the jaw on the yellow automatic strippers in the image below is a grip tension adjustment. Although in principle applicable to wire of any size, automatic wire strippers that are widely available have cutters that can accommodate conductors in a range of sizes no larger than 8 AWG nor smaller than 26 AWG, but not the entire range.|$|R
60|$|Carley made {{no further}} comment. She assuredly {{recognized}} {{that what she}} had been accustomed to could not be expected out here. What she most wished to do at the moment was to get close to the big open grate where a cheery red-and-gold fire cracked. It was necessary, however, to follow the clerk. He assigned her to a small drab room which contained a bed, a bureau, and a stationary washstand with one spigot. There was also a chair. While Carley removed her coat and hat the clerk went downstairs {{for the rest of her}} luggage. Upon his return Carley learned that a stage left the hotel for Oak Creek Canyon at nine o'clock next morning. And this cheered her so much that she faced the strange sense of loneliness and discomfort with something of fortitude. There was no heat in the room, and no hot water. When Carley <b>squeezed</b> the spigot <b>handle</b> there burst forth a torrent of water that spouted up out of the washbasin to deluge her. It was colder than any ice water she had ever felt. It was piercingly cold. Hard upon the surprise and shock Carley suffered a flash of temper. But then the humor of it struck her and she had to laugh.|$|R
40|$|Classical {{thinking}} in endocrine physiology <b>squeezes</b> our diagnostic <b>handling</b> into a simple negative feedback mechanism with a controller and a controlled variable. In {{the case of}} the thyroid this is reduced to TSH and fT 3 and fT 4, respectively. The setting of this tight notion has no free space for any additions. In this paper we want to challenge this model of limited application by proposing a construct based on a systems approach departing from two basic considerations. In first place since the majority of cases of thyroid disease develop and appear during life it has to be considered as an acquired condition. In the second place, our experience with the reversibility of morphological changes makes the autoimmune theory inconsistent. While medical complexity can expand into the era of OMICS as well as into one where manipulations with the use of knock-outs and -ins are common in science, we have preferred to maintain a simple and practical approach. We will describe the interactions of iron, magnesium, zinc, selenium and coenzyme Q 10 with the thyroid axis. The discourse will be then brought into the context of ovarian function, i. e. steroid hormone production. Finally the same elemental players will be presented in relation to the basic mitochondrial machinery that supports the endocrine. We propose that an intact mitochondrial function can guard the normal endocrine function of both the thyroid {{as well as of the}} ovarian axis. The basic elements required for this function appear to be magnesium and iron. In {{the case of the}} thyroid, magnesium-ATP acts in iodine uptake and the heme protein peroxidase in thyroid hormone synthesis. A similar biochemical process is found in steroid synthesis with cholesterol uptake being the initial energy-dependent step and later the heme protein ferredoxin 1 which is required for steroid synthesis. Magnesium plays a central role in determining the clinical picture associated with thyroid disease and is also involved in maintaining fertility. With the aid of 3 D sonography patients needing selenium and/or coenzyme Q 10 can be easily identified. By this we firmly believe that physicians should know more about basic biochemistry and the way it fits into mitochondrial function in order to understand metabolism. Contemplating only TSH is highly reductionistic. Outline: • Author's profiles and motivation for this analysis • The philosophical alternatives in science and medicine • Reductionism vs. systems approach in clinical thyroid disease guidelines • The entry into complexity: the involvement of the musculoskeletal system • Integrating East and West: teachings from Chinese Medicine and from evidence based medicine (EBM) • Can a mathematical model represent complexity in the daily thyroid practice? • How effective is thyroxine treatment? • Resolving the situation of residual symptoms in treated patients with thyroid disease • Importance of iron, zinc and magnesium in relation to thyroid function • Putting together new concepts related to thyroid function for a systems approach • Expanding our model into general aspects of medicin...|$|R
