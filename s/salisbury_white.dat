[...] Later during the evening, Colonel Sam <b>Salisbury,</b> a <b>white</b> leader of the town who was a native-New Yorker as well as former chief of police of Orlando, was called upon to lead a lynch mob to “find and punish Mose Norman.” [...] He would later proudly confess to the following events that took place.|$|R

Destroy the white men from over the big water; restore the land to the Matabele. Kill all in <b>Salisbury,</b> {{especially}} the <b>white</b> women. Witches--all witches. They give charms to the men; cook lions' hearts for them; make them brave with love-drinks." ...|$|R
