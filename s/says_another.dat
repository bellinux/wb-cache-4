500|$|Accounts of McCool in his Somerset period portray {{him as a}} {{thoughtful}} but slightly aloof character. [...] "Off the field he was a quiet man," [...] wrote David Foot. He was [...] "a contemplative pipe-smoker {{in the corner of}} the dressing room," [...] <b>says</b> <b>another</b> account, and somewhat intolerant of others who appeared less committed than he was. [...] "Occasionally some of the younger pros didn't relish the way he treated them. Maybe they also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meher Baba {{says that}} at all times on Earth there are 56 incarnate God-realized souls, but that of these only five are deemed the five Perfect Masters of their era. When {{one of the five}} Perfect Masters [...] "drops" [...] his {{physical}} body, Baba <b>says,</b> <b>another</b> God-realized soul among the 56 incarnate at that time replaces him by taking up that office in that moment. Thus, Meher Baba says there are 56 God-realized souls on Earth at all times, but only and exactly five hold the office of Perfect Master.|$|E
2500|$|All groups talk a {{particular}} language. Thus begins the fifth essay of the book. It {{is the natural}} way {{of things that you}} say something one way which the lawyer <b>says</b> <b>another</b> way. Same with doctors. A doctor who can only talk like a text book may leave you in serious doubt as to your state of health, Sykes says. Same with sailors, same with all other craftsmen. Then he comments from Shakespeare, for whom language was a vast instrument at his command, to what he calls the irrational little vocabulary of the movements of fashion: newspaper fashion, pub fashion, cinema fashion, popular song fashion. But, for this English author, the great, the most desired fashion has always been that of “the best society,” of “the fashionable”, of “the chic”, which is kept by snobbism. After further analyzing the use of U and non-U habits and its progress, reflecting either by stress or reaction the mood of any time. Pursuing his argument he introduces Topivity — T-manners and T-customs etc., meaning the likely social conventions of a remote future in which the peerage has survived by infiltrating the trade union movement on a large scale. Abandoning [...] "U", he ends the article with [...] "T" [...] stating that one big T-point remains constant: nobody wants a really poor peer: it is very un-T not to be rich. However, T and non-T do not seem to have become popular though.|$|E
