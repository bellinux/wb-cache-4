Among technologies for existing steam power plants, feedwater repowering is considered one of the less-intrusive and cost-effective option to expand capacity, improve efficiency and reduce the pollutants emissions. This paper aims to evaluate the effects of feedwater repowering operating conditions on energy, environmental and economic system performances. Considering a 600 MW coal fired power plant as a study case, two feedwater repowering configurations are investigated. In the first case, a simple throttling of high pressure regenerative <b>steam</b> <b>extractions</b> is operated; in the second configuration, the feedwater upstream the boiler inlet is partially preheated using the waste heat of an additional gas turbine.

30|$|Due to the <b>steam</b> <b>extraction</b> in {{the turbine}} the yield of {{electrical}} power is reduced, see (3) and (5). The reduction {{depends on the}} pressure of the <b>steam</b> <b>extraction</b> which is again influenced by the required feed flow temperature in the district heating system. The concept of the approach is that the loss of electrical power due to heat extraction can be estimated by the increase of the exergy in the district heating flow. Consequently the influence of the temperatures in the district heating system is accounted for. Even if the power loss coefficient (β) is available for a realized CHP plant, this influence is rarely available.|$|E
