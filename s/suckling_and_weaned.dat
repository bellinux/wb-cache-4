40|$|Worldwide {{infectious}} diarrhoea, mainly {{caused by}} rotavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), accounts for {{a large part of}} deaths in children. ETEC is also the main cause of traveller's diarrhoea. Probiotics are promising for prevention and treatment of diarrhoea, but there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific probiotic or probiotics in general. Because of the sensitivity of <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> piglets for ETEC, piglets are a good model for infectious diarrhoea in infants and traveller's diarrhoea. Just as in human the efficacy of probiotics in diminishing diarrhoea and improving growth in <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> piglets is not uniform. A piglet model of infectious diarrhoea provides access to intestinal compartments that are not easily accessible in infants. In an in situ piglet model of secretory diarrhoea, the functional physiological response to ETEC and the concomitant host genome response to ETEC and probiotics may be tested. This will provide new insights in the complex crosstalk between ETEC, probiotics and the gut in the future...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of chelated iron supplementation on gestating and lactating sows and on their <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> piglets. Reproductive traits, piglet performance, hematological parameters, and the iron concentrations in colostrum, milk, and stillborn livers were measured. Ninety-six sows were subjected to one of three treatment groups. Group T 1 comprised pregnant and lactating sows treated with diets supplemented with inorganic iron (551 mg Fe/kg) and suckling piglets administered 200 mg of injectable iron dextran. Group T 2 was the same as T 1, except that sows after 84 days of gestation, lactating sows, and suckling piglets were fed a diet supplemented with 150 mg Fe/kg of chelated iron, and suckling piglets were administered injectable iron dextran. Group T 3 was the same as T 2 but without injectable iron dextran for suckling piglets. During the nursery phase, all of the weaned piglets were penned with their original groups or treatments and received isonutritive and isocaloric feeds. Piglets from the T 2 and T 3 groups also received an additional 150 mg Fe/kg of chelated iron via their feed. There were no differences among the treatments for reproductive traits or the iron concentrations in the colostrum, milk, or liver. The piglets that did not receive the injectable iron dextran showed the poorest performance during the pre-and post-weaning phases and showed the poorest hematological parameters of the suckling piglets. The chelated iron supplementation is insufficient to meet piglet demand. The iron dextran supply is necessary for <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> piglets...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma suis (formerly {{known as}} Eperythrozoon suis) is an epicellular {{bacterium}} that affects porcine red blood cells. M. suis infections occur worldwide and {{are associated with}} weakness and anemia in <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> pigs, and reproductive disorders in sows. The present field report describes the detection of M. suis in anemic piglets originating from a Belgian farrow-to-finish herd. The herd was experiencing increased piglet mortality (16 %) in the farrowing unit and had {{a high percentage of}} repeat breeders (22 %). A control program using antimicrobials and hygienic and sanitary measures significantly decreased the number of clinically anemic piglets and the mortality rate in the farrowing unit. However, it did not have any significant influence on the reproductive failure of the farm. The lack of a significant effect on reproductive failure was probably due to the circulation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) on the farm. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Early {{postnatal}} development {{is associated with}} quantitative and qualitative changes of colonic Na transport. The increased Na absorption during the <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaning</b> period reflects {{the activity of the}} electrogenic amiloride-sensitive Na transport, i. e. Na movement into colonocytes occurs across the apical membrane through amiloride-sensitive Na channels and is combined with a Na extrusion process mediated by Na+, K+-ATPase in the basolateral membrane. The capacity of the Na transport pathway increases during the suckling period, reaches a peak during <b>weaning</b> <b>and</b> entirely disappears after weaning. Electrogenic Na transport seems to play a physiological role in rats, and probably also in other omnivorous and carnivorous mammals, but only during the <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaning</b> period. In older rats, the electrogenic Na transport operates only if dietary Na intake decreases below minimal Na requirements that are necessary for growth, development and reproduction. This threshold Na intake is far below the usual value of Na intake in the omnivorous rat and the electrogenic Na transport is therefore not expressed in the mature colon after weaning. Because the sources of Na in the milk are limited during the <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaning</b> period <b>and</b> the growing pups have to accumulate Na in bones and other tissue, animals are threatened by relative Na deficiency and hence the electrogenic Na transport pathway has to be activated.

40|$|Septicemia and endotoxemia {{initiated}} by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are relatively common in <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> piglets. Maternal milk {{is a source}} of both nutrition and immune protection for piglets. Passive transfer of colostral antibodies is necessary for protection of neonatal piglets against diseases, but the concentration of immunoglobulins in milk rapidly declines during the 1 st wk of lactation in all mammals. We hypothesized, therefore, that nonimmunoglobulin substances in milk contribute to the innate protection of neonates against septicemia during the suckling period. Using LPS-affinity chromatography for isolation of LPS-binding proteins and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry for their identification, we identified in porcine milk the following proteins with LPS-binding capacity: lactoferrin, soluble CD 14, serum amyloid A, α-S 1 casein, β-casein, and κ-casein. For lactoferrin, α-S 1 casein, and κ-casein, in vitro pepsin digestion did not inhibit LPS-binding activity, whereas combined digestion with pepsin and pancreatin abolished it. The biologic functions of these LPS-binding proteins and peptides were not determined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} use of high protein plant feed- Ekofish meal in {{nutrition}} of sows in lactation, sucking piglets and weaned piglets were investigated in this paper.

Investigated feed was produced according to specific technology in production facilities of the firm Bankom in Serbia. Investigations were carried out on the Experimental pig farm of the Institute for Animal Husbandry, Belgrade-Zemun in Serbia. Obtained results showed that in isonitrogen mixtures the introduction of studied feed as substitute for fish meal had positive effects: by 6, 18 % lower losses of body mass of sows during lactation, by 1, 6 shorter service period, with almost identical gain (difference of 2 g) in suckling piglets, increased consumption of pre-starter by 1, 1 kg/litter in piglets during creep feeding...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{previously}} shown that spermine, shortly after its ingestion, can induce the alteration of the morphology {{of the small}} intestine of suckling rats. It was proposed that this alteration is due to polyamine accumulation inside the epithelial cells. This could also {{be related to the}} fact that the intestine of the suckling rat is in an immature state. To shed light on this issue, disaccharidase and alkaline phosphatase activity assays, protein, DNA and RNA content measurements and polyamine concentration analysis were performed on the small intestine of <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> Wistar rats treated with spermine. Spermine did not induce the same intestinal alterations in weaned rats compared to suckling animals. Indeed, in sucklings, spermine administration induced a decrease of the protein, DNA, putrescine and spermidine intestinal content, suggesting a cell loss. The cell loss impaired the activity of intestinal enzymes: lactase, maltase and alkaline phosphatase. In weaned rats, the same treatment did not alter these parameters. Exogenous spermine by itself is not sufficient to induce the alterations described here and previously. The maturity degree of the small intestine could be the basis of this process...|$|E
40|$|Pseudorabies (PR) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} and fatal viral disease in swine. The clinical symptoms and mortality depend on the age of affected swine. However, PR infection is more often to become imperceptible in growing to finishing pigs but will induce high mortality in <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaning</b> piglets when antibody titer is impairment. For controlling this disease, vaccination of the pregnant sows can mount good protective maternal antibody to prevent <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaning</b> piglets from PR infection. In addition, Progressive atrophic rhinitis (PAR) is an important respiratory disease and causes the snout deformation, turbinate atrophy, septum deviation, and growth retardation in swine. PAR can affect all ages of swine but piglets are most susceptible. Both diseases and the following complication of porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) will induce tremendously economic loss on production in a pig farm. Multivalent vaccine is a good strategy for immunization and {{can be applied to}} reduce the stress and the cost of management during vaccination. The purpose of this project is to develop the bivalent of gE(-) PR/PAR of recombinant subunit PMT vaccine, and test its efficacy and safety in mice, rabbits, swine and field trials in order to control PR and PAR for decreasing the diseases outbreak in pig farms. 豬假性狂犬病(Pseudorabies; PR) 為高傳染性及高致死性的疾病,特別若爆發於哺乳仔豬及離乳幼豬之時期,感染後的死亡率甚至可高達 100 %. 此外,豬進行性萎縮性鼻炎(progressive atrophic rhinitis; PAR) 為豬隻重要呼吸道疾病,感染豬隻之鼻黏膜會急速壞死且造成鼻甲骨萎縮,導致呼吸系統第一道防禦機制嚴重受損,因而其他病原十分容易長驅直入,為豬隻罹患呼吸道綜合感染症(procine respiratory disease complex; PRDC) 之主因. 本計畫為預防此二種疾病發生,除可減少因PR或AR本身所造成之直接經濟損失外,亦可降低所繼發各種PRDC的發生,並大幅降低豬隻因呼吸道疾病死亡的損失及因治療或預防添加藥物所需的成本. 豬假性狂犬病與萎縮性鼻炎具有相同的免疫適期,均需藉由免疫懷孕母豬產生的移行抗體以保護仔豬免於早期之感染. 本計畫的主要目的即先以小白鼠進行免疫攻毒之安全性試驗及田間母豬隻免疫試驗,進行PR與PAR雙價疫苗免疫效力的評估. 而最終則是開發新一代的gE基因缺損PR與PAR重組次單位PMT毒素雙價疫苗,並藉由本實驗能成功移轉高安全、高效率及成本低廉並具競爭之PR與PAR雙價疫苗,以減少養豬業之經濟損失...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Liver {{regeneration}} is {{a complex}} process {{that has not been}} completely elucidated. The model most frequently used to study this phenomenon is 70 % hepatectomy in adult rats; however, no papers have examined this effect in developing animals. The aims of the present study were: 1) to standardize two models of partial hepatectomy and liver regeneration in newborn <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaning</b> rats, <b>and</b> 2) to study the evolution of remnant liver weight and histological changes of hepatic parenchyma on the days that follow partial hepatectomy. METHODS: Fifty newborn <b>and</b> forty-four <b>weaning</b> rats underwent 70 % hepatectomy. After a midline incision, compression {{on both sides of the}} upper abdomen was performed to exteriorize the right medial, left medial and left lateral hepatic lobes, which were tied inferiorly and resected en bloc. The animals were sacrificed on days 0 (just after hepatectomy), 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 after the operation. Body and liver weight were determined, and hepatic parenchyma was submitted to histological analysis. RESULTS: Mortality rates of the newborn <b>and</b> <b>weaning</b> groups were 30 % and 0 %, respectively. There was a significant decrease in liver mass soon after partial hepatectomy, which completely recovered on the seventh day in both groups. Newborn rat regenerating liver showed marked steatosis on the second day. In the weaning rat liver, mitotic figures were observed earlier, and their amount was greater than in the newborn. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaning</b> rat models of partial hepatectomy are feasible and can be used for studies of liver regeneration.

40|$|Background: Insulin-like {{growth factor}} (IGF) -I {{is present in}} the milk of various species. A {{prerequisite}} for any biological activity of milk-borne IGF-I in the suckling young is to survive the gastrointestinal luminal digestion. In the present study, the stability of IGF-I was examined in the gastrointestinal lumen in neonatal pigs. Methods: Iodine-labeled IGF-I was incubated in the gastrointestinal luminal fluids of 3 -day-old suckling and 45 -day-old weaned pigs at 37 °C for 20 minutes. Degradation of the peptide was analyzed by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation, liquid chromatography, and receptor binding assay. Results: IGF-I remained unchanged in the gastric fluids of <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> pigs when determined by TCA precipitation. IGF-I degraded 3 %, 18 %, and 37 % in the luminal fluids of the proximal, mid and distal small intestine in suckling piglets compared with 53 %, 62 %, and 54 % in weaned pigs. The results were supported by the chromatography and receptor binding analysis. Porcine colostrum had a capacity to protect IGF-I from gastrointestinal luminal digestion in weaned pigs. Conclusion: Milk-borne IGF-I is stable in the gastrointestinal lumen in suckling pigs and {{may play a role in}} regulating postnatal development in the suckling young.

40|$|Grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, pups in the {{breeding}} colony at Froan, Norway, have a bimodal pattern of early aquatic behaviour. About 40 % of the pups {{spend their time}} ashore to save energy, which can be allocated to growth or deposition of energy-rich adipose tissue. The other 60 % of the pups enter the sea during suckling and the early postweaning period, and disperse to other locations within {{the breeding}} colony. Pups may swim distances up to 12 km. Neonatal aquatic dispersal behaviour may lead to increased energy expenditure for thermoregulation and swimming, and thus lead to a low rate of body mass gain during suckling and {{a high rate of}} body mass loss after weaning. Thus, we examined relationships between natal aquatic dispersal behaviour and change in body mass (DeltaBM) in <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> pups. Suckling pups that had dispersed > 2000 m had a significantly lower DBM than suckling pups that dispersed < 2000 m or that did not disperse. In weaned pups, there were no effects of aquatic dispersal behaviour on DBM. We suggest that the bimodal natal aquatic dispersal behaviour in grey seals at the study site reflects two different strategies for postweaning survival: to stay ashore and get fat, or to take a swim and acquire diving and feeding skills...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: prebiotics, piglets, gut healthPrebiotics are non-digestible {{carbohydrates}} {{that are}} not metabolized in the small intestine and fermented in the large intestine. Oligofructose are non-digestible oligosaccharides which may stimulate beneficial bacteria in the gut and may affect the gut ecosystem. Prebiotic effects will depend largely on their chemical structure (degree of polymerization). Dietary inclusion of probiotics in young pig diets may beneficially affect gut microbiota. Synbiotics, a combination of prebiotics and probiotics may also stimulate the gut ecosystem. The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the effects of pre-, pro- and synbiotics on the gut ecosystem, and some performance parameters. A series of in vivo and in vitro experiments were carried out using <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> piglets. The experimental results are discussed in this thesis. Overall, {{it was concluded that}} synbiotics, a combination of multi-strain probiotics and oligofructose, can positively affect performance especially feed intake, and can improve the gut health. However, we did not observe a clear synergistic effect compared to supplementing oligofructose or probiotics alone. A combination of high and low polymer inulin will probably be more beneficial for the intestinal ecosystem and health than using either high- or low polymer inulin alone. The present studies show that the pre-, pro- and synbiotic treatments affect gut microbiota and performance of young pigs...|$|E

Blood was collected from sows during treatment <b>and</b> after <b>weaning,</b> <b>and</b> various hormones were measured.

40|$|Age-specific {{changes in}} {{glycosylation}} of rat intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase {{were analyzed using}} enzyme immunoprecipitated from microvillus membranes of <b>suckling,</b> <b>weaning,</b> <b>and</b> adult rats, and carbohydrate moieties were examined by lectin affinity binding, metabolic labeling, and neuraminidase treatment. Lectin binding indicated the presence of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharide chains containing mannose and galactose throughout development. An age-dependent shift in sialic acid and fucose was seen {{during the period of}} weaning; no fucose was detectable in lactase-phlorizin hydrolase until after the rats were 20 days of age, whereas sialic acid was reduced in adult lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. The presence of sialic acid in <b>suckling</b> intestines <b>and</b> fucose in adult was confirmed by metabolic labeling with appropriate radioactive precursors. Sodium dodecyl phosphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of immunoprecipitated lactase-phlorizin hydrolase from the proximal and mid small intestine showed two bands of approximately 220 and 130 kilodaltons in all age groups. In the distal part of the adult small intestine, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase appeared as two bands of similar size to those found in the proximal and mid portions. In contrast, during the <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaning</b> periods, these distal bands were approximately 225 and 135 kilodaltons. [35 S]-methionine labeling and fluorography of neonatal intestines confirmed these observations. The size difference between proximal and distal small intestines was virtually eliminated by neuraminidase treatment. These data indicate that the core structure of microvillus membrane lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, consisting of both N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides, remains constant during development, although terminal sugars shift from predominantly sialic acid during the suckling period to fucose in adulthood. This alteration in glycosylation of the protein occurs in a different pattern from the postweaning decline in lactase specific activity. Consequently, age-dependent changes in glycosylation cannot account for the decrease in lactase-phlorizin hydrolase-specific activity observed during developmen...|$|R

Normal mice 1 to 40 days old were inoculated by gastrin intubation with {{high doses of}} EDIM and subsequently evaluated for rotavirus infection by solid-phase radioimmunoassay, by electron microscopy of intestinal tissue sections or by both. Radioimmunoassay and electron microscopy showed a concordance of 89. 5 % in the detection of rotavirus infection.

At 3 to 6 days after cortisone acetate treatment, susceptibility to EDIM infection decreased to 60 % compared with 94 % in age-matched controls.

Chromatographic analysis and receptor binding study were also undertaken. The results showed that hEGF was quite stable in the gastric fluids in both <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> pigs with less than 20 % degradation after 20 min incubation. The degradation rate in the intestinal fluids varied with {{the region of the}} small intestine and the age of the animals. At the proximal and mid regions of the small intestine in suckling pigs the degradation rate of hEGF after 20 min incubation was 5 and 20 % respectively, while the degradation rate at the distal region was up to 50 %. In the small intestinal lumen in weaned pigs the degradation rate of hEGF was much greater than that in suckling pigs, and the degradation rates at the proximal, mid and distal regions were 33, 51 and 56 % respectively. Addition of acid soluble or casein fractions of porcine colostrum markedly reduced the degradation of hEGF in the intestinal fluids.

40|$|The {{issue of}} mycotoxins and mycotoxicosis in {{veterinary}} medicine is {{directly connected to}} the usage of mouldy and/or adversely stored grains (corn, wheat, barley) used in animal feed. In swine production, in our geographical region, the most common are mycotoxicosis caused by zearalenon (F- 2 toxin), but aflatoxins, ochratoxin and trichothecenes can also be found. For the known mycotoxins of clinical importance, the response is usually subacute or chronic and the presenting clinical signs are often vague. Mostly the problems are expressed only as alterations of the reproductive cycle, reduced feed intake and slow growth. However, if we consider the clinical signs and pathomorphological picture of mycotoxicosis in different swine categories (breeding animals, <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> piglets, fatteners), the age dependent changes can be found. Some mycotoxins have hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic and immunosuppressive effects, which further complicate the clinical and pathomorphological picture and diagnosis of mycotoxicosis in swine. The material for this research included the samples provided from ten swine farms. In different swine categories health disorders, resembling to the problem with mycotoxins were detected. The applied research methods included clinical evaluation and pathomorphological examination and laboratory microbiological feed testing, {{in order to examine}} the presence of fungi and some mycotoxins (aflatoxins, zearalenon, ochratoxin A and trichothecenes). On the basis of the obtained results, it may be concluded that the most frequently detected mycotoxin in the examined feed samples was zearalenon. The presence of mycotoxin in feed was directly connected to the reproductive failures and diagnosed health disorders in the examined swine categories (vulvovaginitis, skin necrosis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis) ...|$|E

However, less {{is known about}} the effects of maternal prebiotic consumption on offspring intestinal defences and immune system responsiveness. We investigated the effects of maternal short-chain fructo-oligosaccharide (scFOS) supplementation on mucin-secreting cells, ileal secretory IgA and cytokine secretion of weaned offspring and their humoral response to an oral vaccine against obligate intracellular Lawsonia intracellularis. Sows were fed a control diet (CTRL) or scFOS-supplemented diet during the last third of gestation and throughout lactation. At weaning, each litter was divided into two groups receiving a post-weaning CTRL or scFOS diet for a month. Pigs from the four groups were either non-vaccinated (n 16) or vaccinated (n 117) at day 33. Biomarkers related to intestinal defences and immune parameters were analysed 3 weeks later. SCFA production was assessed over time in <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> pigs. Maternal scFOS supplementation improved ileal cytokine secretions (interferon (IFN) -γ, P< 0 · 05; IL- 4, P= 0 · 07) and tended to increase caecal goblet cell number (P= 0 · 06). It increased IgA vaccine response in the serum (P< 0 · 01) and ileal mucosa (P= 0 · 08). Higher bacterial fermentative activity was observed during lactation (total faecal SCFA, P< 0 · 001) and after weaning (colonic butyrate, P= 0 · 10) in pigs from scFOS-supplemented mothers. No synergistic effect between maternal and post-weaning scFOS supplementation was observed. Therefore, maternal scFOS supplementation has long-lasting consequences by strengthening gut defences and immune response to a vaccine against an intestinal obligate intracellular pathogen. Prebiotic consumption by gestating and lactating mothers is decisive in modulating offspring intestinal immunity...|$|E

40|$|Antibiotic use in food-producing animals has {{considerable}} {{impact on}} public health, especially {{with respect to}} the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. Pigs represent one of the main species in which antibiotics are frequently used for different purposes. Surveillance of antibiotic consumption and dose appropriateness, through novel approaches based on defined daily doses, is strongly needed to assess farms’ antibiotic risk, in terms of spread of antibiotic resistance and possibile presence of residues in meat. In this study, antibiotic consumption was monitored in 14 swine reproduction farms, together with managerial, structural, and health aspects. Most of the controlled farms (65 %) were classified as at medium antibiotic risk, 21 % at high antibiotic risk, and 14 % at low antibiotic risk. Critical aspects of antibiotic administration concerned treatments for <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaner</b> piglets, oral antibiotic administration, treatment and diagnosis of gastroenteric infections, and use of critically important antimicrobials for human medicine, especially colistin. These aspects could be considered critical aspects of antibiotic use in from-farrow-to-wean/finish swine farms in the Umbria region and must be controlled to minimize risks. Even though a small number of farms in Umbria region are at high antibiotic risk, the risk of antibiotic resistance should be minimized, and management and biosecurity of the farms should be improved by extending the use of antimicrobial susceptibility tests and optimizing the diagnostic methods for infectious diseases. Furthermore, farmers’ and veterinarians’ knowledge of antibiotic resistance should be improved and the prudent use of antibiotics encouraged to prevent the development and spread of resistant microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|Modulating the mucosal {{immune system}} of {{neonates}} by probiotic treatment {{of their mothers}} is a promising approach {{which can only be}} investigated through the use of animal models. Here, we used sows and their piglets to investigate the impact of a bacterial treatment on the sow´s milk and on the neonate piglet intestinal immune system. In previous experiments, feed supplementation of sows with the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 during pregnancy and lactation had been shown to affect intestinal microbiota and cytokine expression of the offspring during the <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaning</b> periods. We therefore investigated the composition of the milk from treated sows in comparison to samples from a control group. In treated sows, the amount of lactose increased, and the somatic cell numbers were reduced. In all milk samples, the percentage of cells expressing membranous CD 14 (mCD 14) was greater than the fractions of immune cells, indicating expression of mCD 14 on mammary epithelial cells. However, in the milk of E. faecium-treated sows, mCD 14 + cells were reduced. Furthermore, the number of CD 14 + milk cells was positively correlated with the percentages of B cells and activated T cells in the ileal MLN of the piglets. This study provides evidence for the expression of mCD 14 by the porcine mammary epithelium, and suggests an immunological effect of mCD 14 + milk cells on the piglets’ intestinal immune system. Our study further suggests that mCD 14 + mammary epithelial cell populations can be modulated by probiotic feed supplementation of the sow.

40|$|Background & Aims: Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that iron absorption in suckling mammals is refractory to stimuli that normally would decrease absorption in adults. To better understand the regulation of iron absorption during suckling, we have characterized the relationship between hepcidin, ferroportin, and iron absorption at this crucial stage of life. Methods: To determine whether ferroportin is involved in iron absorption during suckling, absorption was measured in intestine-specific ferroportin knockout mice. The effect of constitutive hepcidin overexpression on intestinal iron absorption also was investigated in suckling transmembrane serine protease 6 knockout mice. Finally, suckling mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide to induce hepcidin expression. Blood was collected for serum iron analysis, and liver tissue and duodenal enterocytes were collected for gene and protein expression profiles. Results: Iron absorption was very low in suckling ferroportin knockout mice, indicating that ferroportin is responsible {{for the majority of the}} iron absorbed at this time. However, increases in hepcidin during suckling, as seen in transmembrane serine protease 6 knockout mice and in mice injected with lipopolysaccharide, did not affect enterocyte ferroportin levels. Immunofluorescent localization of ferroportin showed that the protein localized to the basolateral membrane of duodenal enterocytes in both <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> mice. Conclusions: These data show that the high iron absorption occurring during suckling is mediated by ferroportin. However, enterocyte ferroportin is hyporesponsive to hepcidin at this time, despite being expressed on the basolateral membrane. Alterations to ferroportin that prevent hepcidin binding during suckling may allow iron absorption to remain high regardless of hepcidin expression levels, reducing the likelihood of iron deficiency during development.

40|$|Correct {{feeding and}} {{management}} of the young pig for optimum lifetime performance is a key goal of pig producers, although the associations between these variables are often difficult to quantify. It is well recognised that commercial growth rates of <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> pigs are less than those that can be achieved when pigs are reared independently of the sow and/or fed greater quantities of a more nutritious source of nutrients such as bovine milk. However, such management interventions for attaining greater postnatal growth rates are not commonplace in the pig industry; {{the most common form of}} supplementary feeding of young pigs is creep/starter feed. A frequent question asked by producers and the feed manufacturing industry is whether pigs that achieve a ‘good start’ during the weaning period extend the growth advantage through to slaughter. Data presented in this paper suggest that the weight of the pig at birth explains a substantial proportion of the variation in postnatal growth. An array of different dietary and management interventions has been used to manipulate weaning weight and growth rate after weaning with the aim of maintaining a weight advantage through to slaughter. However, in many cases, the ‘control’ pigs appear to compensate and there are no differences in performance and carcass indices at slaughter. Despite this, recent data from experiments conducted in Western Australia show that processes occurring before and after weaning could influence carcass weight and dressing percentage of pigs that weigh more than 105 kg at slaughter. In particular, the effects of the rearing environment during suckling, the type of creep diet fed during suckling and the housing system after weaning appeared to influence carcass weights and dressing percentages...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePeripartum {{nutrition}} {{is crucial}} for developing the immune system of neonates. We hypothesized that maternal short-chain fructooligosaccharide (scFOS) supplementation could accelerate the development of intestinal immunity in offspring. Thirty-four sows received a standard or a scFOS supplemented diet (10 g scFOS/d) for the last 4 weeks of gestation and the 4 weeks of lactation. Colostrum and milk immunoglobulins (Ig) and TGFβ 1 concentrations were evaluated {{on the day of}} delivery and at d 6 and d 21 postpartum. Piglet intestinal structure, the immunologic features of jejunal and ileal Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph node cells were analysed at postnatal d 21. Short-chain fatty acid concentrations were measured over time in the intestinal contents of <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaned</b> piglets. Colostral IgA (P< 0. 05) significantly increased because of scFOS and TGFβ 1 concentrations tended to improve (P< 0. 1). IFNγ secretion by stimulated Peyer's patch and mesenteric lymph node cells, and secretory IgA production by unstimulated Peyer's patch cells were increased (P< 0. 05) in postnatal d 21 scFOS piglets. These differences were associated with a higher proportion of activated CD 25 +CD 4 α+ T cells among the CD 4 + helper T lymphocytes (P< 0. 05) as assessed by flow cytometry. IFNγ secretion was positively correlated with the population of activated T lymphocytes (P< 0. 05). Total short-chain fatty acids were unchanged between groups during lactation but were higher in caecal contents of d 90 scFOS piglets (P< 0. 05); specifically propionate, butyrate and valerate. In conclusion, we demonstrated that maternal scFOS supplementation modified the intestinal immune functions in piglets in association with increased colostral immunity. Such results underline the key role of maternal nutrition in supporting the postnatal development of mucosal immunity...|$|E

40|$|Glutamine and {{glutamate}} are {{not considered}} essential amino acids but they play important roles in maintaining growth and health in both neonates and adults. Although glutamine and glutamate are highly abundant in most feedstuffs there is increasing evidence {{that they may be}} limiting during pregnancy, lactation and neonatal growth, particularly when relatively low protein diets are fed. Supplementation of diets with glutamine, glutamate or both at 0. 5 to 1. 0 % to both <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> recently <b>weaned</b> piglets improves intestinal and immune function and results in better growth. In addition such supplementation to the sow prevents some of the loss of lean body mass during lactation, and increases milk glutamine content. However, a number of important questions related to physiological condition, species under study and the form and amount of the supplements need to be addressed before the full benefits of glutamine and glutamate supplementation in domestic animal production can be realized...|$|R
40|$|To date {{few studies}} have {{addressed}} the development and function of the porcine gastric mucosal immune system {{and this is a}} major limitation to understanding the immunopathogenesis of infections occurring in young pigs. The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) mediates the transport of secretory immunoglobulins until luminal surface of the gut mucosa and the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the time course of pIgR expression and to determine its localization in three functionally different porcine gastric sites during the <b>suckling</b> period <b>and</b> after <b>weaning.</b> An additional goal was to investigate the time course expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in relation to pIgR expression. Gastric samples were collected from the cardiac-to-oxyntic transition (Cd), the oxyntic (Ox), and the pyloric (Py) regions in 84 pigs, slaughtered before <b>weaning</b> (14, 21 <b>and</b> 28 days of age; 23, 23 and 19 pigs, respectively) and 14 days post-weaning (42 days of age, 23 pigs). PIgR was expressed in the mucosa of all the three gastric sites, and its transcript levels were modulated during <b>suckling</b> <b>and</b> after <b>weaning,</b> with regional differences. PIgR expression increased linearly during suckling (P= 0. 019) and also increased post-weaning (P= 0. 001) in Cd, it increased post-weaning in Py (P= 0. 049) and increased linearly during suckling in Ox (P= 0. 036). TLRs expression was also modulated during development: in Cd, TLR 2 increased linearly during suckling (P= 0. 003); in Ox, TLR 2 decreased after weaning (P= 0. 038) while TLR 4 increased linearly during suckling(P= 0. 008). The expression of TLR 2, 3 and 4 in Ox was positively correlated with pIgR expression (P< 0. 001). Importantly, both pIgR protein and mRNA were localized, by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, in the gastric glands of the lamina propria. These results indicate that pIgR is actively synthesized in the gastric mucosa and suggest that pIgR could play a crucial role in gastric mucosal immune defense of growing pigs...|$|R
