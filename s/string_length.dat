25|$|The first {{mention of}} equal {{temperament}} {{related to the}} twelfth root of two in the West appeared in Simon Stevin's unfinished manuscript Van de Spiegheling der singconst (ca 1605) published posthumously three hundred years later in 1884; however, due to insufficient accuracy of his calculation, many of the numbers (for <b>string</b> <b>length)</b> he obtained were off by one or two units from the correct values.

25|$|The {{differences}} between the two models are the scale length (445mm of free <b>string</b> <b>length</b> in Lisboa guitars and 470mm in Coimbra guitars), body measurements, and other finer construction details. Overall, the Coimbra model is of simpler construction than the Lisboa model. Visually and most distinctively, the Lisboa model can easily be differentiated from the Coimbra model by its larger soundboard and the scroll ornament that usually adorns the tuning machine, in place of Coimbra's teardrop-shaped motif. Lisboa guitars usually employ a narrower neck profile as well. Both models have a very distinct timbre, the Lisboa model having a more bright and resonant sound, and the choice between the both of them falls upon each player's preferences.|$|E
25|$|According to Athanasius Kircher, tiorba was a {{nickname}} in Neapolitan dialect for a grinding board used by perfumers for grinding essences and herbs. It is possible {{the appearance of}} this new large instrument (particularly in a crowded ensemble) resulted in jokes and a humour induced reference with popular local knowledge becoming lost over time and place. Robert Spencer has noted the confusion the two names were already leading to in 1600: Chitarone, ò Tiorba che si dica (chitarrone, or theorbo as it is called). By the mid-17th century {{it would appear that}} tiorba had taken preference – reflected in modern practice, helping to distinguish the theorbo now from very different instruments like the chitarrone moderno or guitarrón. Similar adaptations to smaller lutes (c.55+ cm <b>string</b> <b>length)</b> also produced the arciliuto (archlute), liuto attiorbato, and tiorbino, which were differently tuned instruments to accommodate a new repertoire of small ensemble or solo works. In the performance of basso continuo, theorboes were often paired with a small pipe organ.|$|E
25|$|While most violins {{have four}} strings, there are violins with {{additional}} strings. Some {{have as many}} as seven strings. Seven strings is generally thought to be the maximum number of strings that can be put on a bowed string instrument, because with more than seven strings, {{it would be impossible to}} play a particular inner string individually with the bow. Instruments with seven strings are very rare. The extra strings on such violins typically are lower in pitch than the G-string; these strings are usually tuned to C, F, and B. If the instrument's playing length, or <b>string</b> <b>length</b> from nut to bridge, is equal to that of an ordinary full-scale violin; i.e., a bit less than , then it may be properly termed a violin. Some such instruments are somewhat longer and should be regarded as violas. Violins with five strings or more are typically used in jazz or folk music. Some custom-made instruments have extra strings which are not bowed, but which sound sympathetically, due to the vibrations of the bowed strings.|$|E

25|$|Vibrato is a {{technique}} of the left hand and arm in which the pitch of a note varies subtly in a pulsating rhythm. While {{various parts of the}} hand or arm may be involved in the motion, the end result is a movement of the fingertip bringing about a slight change in vibrating <b>string</b> <b>length,</b> which causes an undulation in pitch. Some violinists oscillate backwards, or lower in pitch from the actual note when using vibrato, since it is believed that perception favors the highest pitch in a varying sound. Vibrato does little, if anything, to disguise an out-of-tune note; in other words, misapplied vibrato is a poor substitute for good intonation. Scales and other exercises meant to work on intonation are typically played without vibrato to make the work easier and more effective. Music students are often taught that unless otherwise marked in music, vibrato is assumed. However, it has to be noted that this is only a trend; there is nothing on the sheet music that compels violinists to add vibrato. This can be an obstacle to a classically trained violinist wishing to play in a style that uses little or no vibrato at all, such as baroque music played in period style and many traditional fiddling styles.|$|E
25|$|Theorbos were {{developed}} during the late sixteenth century in Italy, inspired by the demand for extended bass range instruments for use in opera developed by the Florentine Camerata and new musical works utilising basso continuo, such as Giulio Caccini's two collections, Le nuove musiche (1602 and 1614). For his 1607 opera L'Orfeo, Claudio Monteverdi lists duoi (two) chitaroni among the instruments required for performing the work. Musicians originally used large bass lutes (c. 80+ cm <b>string</b> <b>length)</b> and a higher re-entrant tuning; but soon created neck extensions with secondary pegboxes to accommodate extra open (i.e. unfretted) longer bass strings, called diapasons or bourdons, for improvements in tonal clarity and an increased range of available notes. Although the words chitarrone and tiorba were both {{used to describe the}} instrument, they have different organological and etymological origins; chitarrone being in Italian an augmentation of (and literally meaning large) chitarra – Italian for guitar. The round-backed chitarra was still in use, often referred to as chitarra Italiana to distinguish it from chitarra alla spagnola in its new flat-backed Spanish incarnation. The etymology of tiorba is still obscure; it is hypothesized the origin may be in Slavic or Turkish torba, meaning 'bag' or 'turban'.|$|E

2500|$|Research by Vincenzo Galilei (father of Galileo) {{demonstrated}} that, when <b>string</b> <b>length</b> {{was held}} constant, varying its tension, thickness, or composition could alter perceived pitch.

He also claimed that the differences between various tuning systems were not perceivable, thus the disputes were unnecessary.|$|E
2500|$|The archlute (Spanish archilaúd, Italian arciliuto, German Erzlaute, Russian Архилютня) is a European plucked string {{instrument}} developed around 1600 as {{a compromise between}} the very large theorbo, the size and re-entrant tuning of which made for difficulties {{in the performance of}} solo music, and the Renaissance tenor lute, which lacked the bass range of the theorbo. [...] Essentially a tenor lute with the theorbo's neck-extension, the archlute lacks the power in the tenor and the bass that the theorbo's large body and typically greater <b>string</b> <b>length</b> provide.|$|E
2500|$|Like the mandora {{described}} above, {{it is in}} [...] "lute" [...] form, {{but it is a}} tenor {{instrument of}} five paired courses. The <b>string</b> <b>length</b> is variable, like all of the lute family, but generally in the range of 32 to 36cm. Tuning patterns are unique, the intervals between courses being alternating fourths and fifths, for example d-g-d'-g'-d", as Pretorius Syntagma Musicum mandore's tuning (1619). There is a book of tunes in French tablature from about 1620 called The Skene Mandora Book, available on microfilm as a loan to members of the Lute Society of America, or as part of The Ancient Melodies of Scotland, available through Google Books.|$|E
5000|$|English piano maker Samuel Wolfenden {{presented}} a construction for determining {{all but the}} lowest sounding plain <b>string</b> <b>lengths</b> in a piano in A Treatise on the Art of Pianoforte Construction published in 1916; like Sievers, he did not explain whether this was an original procedure or one in common use, commenting only that it was [...] "a very practical method of determining <b>string</b> <b>lengths,</b> and in past years I used it altogether". He added {{that at the time}} of writing he found calculating the lengths directly [...] "somewhat easier" [...] and had preceded the description with a table of computed lengths for the top five octaves of a piano. He included frequencies in equal temperament, but only published aural tuning instructions in his 1927 supplement.|$|R
50|$|With fretless string {{instruments}} such as violins or cellos, intonation {{depends on}} the exact places the musician's fingers press the strings against the instrument's fingerboard, {{as well as any}} pull or push the musician exerts on the string, either along the <b>string's</b> <b>length</b> or perpendicular to it.|$|R

2500|$|The {{study of}} sound and musical {{phenomenon}} prior to the 19th century was focused primarily on the mathematical modelling of pitch and tone. The earliest recorded experiments date from the 6th century BCE, most notably {{in the work of}} Pythagoras and his establishment of the simple <b>string</b> <b>length</b> ratios that formed the consonances of the octave. [...] This view that sound and music could be understood from a purely physical standpoint was echoed by such theorists as Anaxagoras and Boethius. An important early dissenter was Aristoxenus, who foreshadowed modern music psychology in his view that music could only be understood through human perception and its relation to human memory. Despite his views, the majority of musical education through the Middle Ages and Renaissance remained rooted in the Pythagorean tradition, particularly through the quadrivium of astronomy, geometry, arithmetic, and music.|$|E
2500|$|Playing {{the cello}} is done while seated with the {{instrument}} {{supported on the}} floor by the endpin. The left hand fingertips stop the strings on the fingerboard, determining the pitch of the fingered note. The right hand plucks or bows the strings to sound the notes. The left hand fingertips stop the strings along their length, determining the pitch of each fingered note. Stopping the string closer to the bridge results in [...] higher-pitched sound, because the vibrating <b>string</b> <b>length</b> has been shortened. In the neck positions (which use just {{less than half of the}} fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in thumb position (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tones of}} qin can be {{categorized}} as three characteristic [...] "sounds." [...] The first type is san yin (音), which literally means [...] "scattered sound". It's the ground frequency produced by plucking a free string with right hand fingers.. Plunking a string with right hand and gently tapping specific note positions on the string with left hand will create a crisp and mellifluous soundnamed [...] "fan yin" [...] (音), or overtune harmonics. The important note scale, called [...] "hui" [...] and marked by 13 glossy white dots made of mica or seashell in the front side of qin, are places of positive integer dividends of the <b>string</b> <b>length.</b> Crystal concordant overtune can't be evoked unless strings are precisely tapped to these [...] "hui"s. The third is an yin (音 / 音 / 音 / 音), or [...] "changing sounds."It consists major cadences of most qin pieces. To play, the musician presses a string to a specific pitch on surface board with a thumb, middle or ring finger of his left hand(depending on the distance from him), then strike it with his right hand, sliding left hand up and down to verify the note. This technique is similar to playing a slide guitar across the player's lap, however, the manipulation of qin is much more multifarious {{than that of a}} guitar, which has only around 3 or 4 main techniques[...] According to the book Cunjian Guqin Zhifa Puzi Jilan, there are around 1,070 different finger techniques used for the qin, with or without tablature. Therefore, qin is probably the one with the most playing techniques in both Chinese and Western instrument family. Most of qin's techniques are obsolete, but around 50 of them still exist in modern performance.|$|E

50|$|The {{instrument}} {{also features}} special metallic levers or latches under each course called mandals.
