50|$|The human {{sewage and}} the process waste from the {{manufacturing}} industries are the two major sources of the waste water. In Thailand, the total volume of the wastewater from industries {{is much greater than}} that of the domestic sewage. As a result, an effective method is needed. Microbial remediation of xenobiotics has shown to be effective and the low cost technology, but it still has several limitations. Consequently, the genetic engineering approaches are used to create the new strain of microbes (Genetically engineered microorganisms, GEMS) which have better catabolic potential than the wild type species for bioremediation. There are four major approaches to GEM development for the bioremediation application which include the modification of enzyme specificity and affinity, pathway construction and regulation, bioprocess development, monitoring and control and lastly, bio-affinity bio-receptor <b>sensor</b> <b>application</b> for chemical sensing, toxicity reduction and end point analysis. These allow the extensive use of genetically engineered microorganism. In the far future, the genetically engineered microorganisms could possibly be used to control the green house gases, convert the waste to the value-added product as well as to reduce and capture the carbon dioxide gases from the atmosphere (carbon sequestration), but lots of research still need to be done in order to make these potential become true. There is a concern regarding the use of genetically engineered microbes for the remediation of pollutants. Once the genetically microorganisms has been added, it may disperse uncontrollably and hard to be removed. However, the serious majorconcern that leads to the limitation of GEMs development seem to be the lack of information on gene as well as the regulatory constraints.|$|E

It is presented in five parts dealing with <b>sensor</b> <b>applications,</b> nonlinear properties, stress-optic and electrooptic properties, stacks and arrays, and publications. The Rainbow actuator technology is a relatively new materials development which had its inception in 1992. It involves a new processing technique for preparing pre-stressed, high lead containing piezoelectric and electrostrictive ceramic materials. Ceramics fabricated by this method produce bending-mode actuator devices which possess several times more displacement and load bearing capacity than present-day benders.
