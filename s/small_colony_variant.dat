40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} subinhibitory concentrations of cell wall active antibiotics on virulence gene expression and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus Newman and in laboratory strains. Methods: Promoter regions of spa, lukE and agr RNAIII were cloned upstream of a modified luxABCDE reporter. Using disc diffusion assays, the effects of antibiotics were observed on gene expression and quantitative real-time PCR was employed to confirm the results. Assays were performed to measure biofilm formation in wild-type S. aureus and respective spa-deficient and <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variant</b> mutants {{in the presence of}} subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. Results: Expression of spa and lukE was stimulated by subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin and cefalotin, while agr RNAIII expression was not affected. Denser biofilms were formed by S. aureus Newman and its <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variant</b> in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of cefalotin. Conclusions: Subinhibitory concentrations of certain antibiotics have been shown to stimulate virulence gene expression in S. aureus; this may alter the progression of infection and thus render antimicrobial therapy unreliable. The use of appropriate combinations of antibiotics might be an approach to avoiding this situation. Promoter-lux reporters are sensitive tools for studying the modulation of transcription by antibiotic inhibitors, and could be used to predict novel therapeutic combinations for the treatment of infection...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variants</b> of Staphylococcus aureus tend {{to persist}} despite {{antimicrobial}} therapy, especially when involved in implant-associated infections. Methods. We analyzed 5 cases of hip prosthesis-associated infections due to <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variants,</b> including their course prior to {{identification of the}} pathogen. Biopsy investigations included microbiological examination and, in 1 case, transmission electron microscopy to detect intracellular bacteria in nonprofessional phagocytes. A treatment concept was elaborated {{on the basis of}} a published algorithm and patients were managed accordingly. Results. The patients' mean age was 62. 2 years. All patients experienced treatment failures prior to isolation of <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variants,</b> despite as many as 3 surgical revisions and up to 22 months of antibiotics. Transmission electron microscopy performed on biopsy specimens from periprosthetic tissue revealed intracellular cocci in fibroblasts.

40|$|TiO 2 {{photocatalysis}} {{has demonstrated}} efficacy {{as a treatment}} process for water contaminated with chemical pollutants. When exposed to UVA light TiO 2 also demonstrates an effective bactericidal activity. The mechanism of this process {{has been reported to}} involve attack by valence band generated hydroxyl radicals. In this study when three common bacterial pathogens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were exposed to TiO 2 and UVA light a substantial decrease in bacterial numbers was observed. Control experiments in which all three pathogens were exposed to UVA light only resulted in a similar reduction in bacterial numbers. Moreover, exposure to UVA light alone resulted in the production of a <b>smaller</b> than average <b>colony</b> phenotype among the surviving bacteria, for all three pathogens examined, a finding which was not observed following treatment with UVA and TiO 2. <b>Small</b> slow growing <b>colonies</b> have been described for several pathogenic bacteria and are referred to as <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variants.</b> Several studies have demonstrated an association between <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variants</b> and persistent, recurrent and antibiotic resistant infections.

40|$|Background: Small colony {{variants}} {{have been}} implicated {{as the cause}} of several chronic disease states unmanageable by antibiotic therapy. Thus, this review evaluates the mechanisms employed by this subpopulation in the propagation of nosocomial infections involving the staphylococcal species. Furthermore, we propose several hypotheses for the evolutionary role this phenotype may play in clinical settings. Results: Research suggests that a combined effort of certain auxotrophies contributes to a reduced metabolic rate within <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variant</b> bacteria. This minimizes the effect of antibiotics used against them and allows this phenotype to endure as an intracellular infection. Additionally, numerous studies have suggested that perhaps these variants alter the mechanisms of the immune system that are normally fashioned against such invasive pathogens. Studies have shown that although these variants possess reduced virulence factors compared with parental strains, they exhibit an increased ability to attach and colonize intracellularly in the host cells, making eradication difficult. Conclusions: The formation of a <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variant</b> phenotype {{has been found to be}} a vital mode of existence for nosocomial bacteria, as it offers numerous survival options without expending valuable metabolic resources while sustaining severe chronic infections. It is suggested that intracellular survivability is the major role played by this variant.

40|$|Persistent Staphylococcus aureus {{infection}} despite appropriate {{antibiotic therapy}} is a well-recognized, difficult to treat condition that is frequently {{reported in the}} medical literature. These persistent S. aureus infections {{may be associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality, and in some cases are associated with the in vivo evolution of enhanced antimicrobial resistance. However, the molecular basis for persistence is not well understood. This project aimed to characterise the molecular basis for persistence and enhanced antimicrobial resistance in a series of clinical S. aureus isolates obtained from a patient that had a methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection lasting over 115 days. The final clinical isolate (JKD 6229) showed extensive phenotypic diversity compared to the first clinical isolate (JKD 6210), including a <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variant</b> phenotype associated with significantly reduced growth rate, and acquired resistance to a number of antimicrobials including rifampicin and ciprofloxacin, and reduced susceptibility to last-line agents, vanconycin and linezolid. Detailed phenotypic and genomic characterisation of 47 clinical isolates obtained from 23 positive blood culture specimens and one spinal aspirate was undertaken. Whole genome sequencing was used to uncover molecular mechanisms for persistence and resistance, accompanied by detailed analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, analysis of isolate susceptibility to innate immune factors, microarray transcriptional analysis and genetic manipulation experiments to investigate the impact of specific mutations. Comparative genomic and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis demonstrated prominent DNA changes within the bacterial population, highlighted by both transient and conserved mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance or innate immune evasion. Mutations important for the adaptation of the organism during infection included a RelA F 128 Y mutation that led to an activated bacterial stringent response and partially explained the <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variant</b> phenotype and innate immune resistance; a codon insertion in a methyltransferase (RlmN) that altered ribosomal methylation and linezolid susceptibility; and a RpoB H 481 Y mutation that resulted in high level rifampicin resistance but also reduced susceptibility to human innate immune factors. This thesis has also uncovered a link between antibiotic resistance and resistance to innate immune factors caused by large chromosomal duplications. These duplications represent a previously unrecognized adaptive strategy employed by S. aureus to overcome antimicrobial exposure and host immune responses.

40|$|Abstract Background Staphylococcus aureus {{is a major}} human {{pathogen}} causing significant morbidity and mortality. The S. aureus colonies in osteomyelitis, in patients with cystic fibrosis and patients with endoprosthesis rejection frequently have an atypical morphology, i. e. staphylococcal small-colony variants, which form a naturally occurring subpopulation of clinically important staphylococci. Identification of these <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variants</b> is difficult, because {{of the loss of}} typical phenotypic characteristics of these variants. We wanted to improve and simplify the diagnosis of staphylococcal infection using a diagnostic preparation, consisting of 5 μg batumin paper disks. Batumin possesses a unique selective activity against all studied Staphylococcus spp., whereas all other species tested thus far are batumin resistant. We assessed the efficacy of the batumin diagnostic preparation to identify staphylococcal <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variants,</b> isolated from osteomyelitis patients. Findings With the batumin diagnostic preparation, all 30 tested staphylococcal small-colony variants had a growth inhibition zone around the disk of minimum 25 mm, accordant with the inhibition zones of the parent strains, isolated from the same patients. Conclusions The batumin diagnostic preparation correctly identified the small-colony variants of S. aureus, S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis as belonging to the genus Staphylococcus, which differ profoundly from parental strains and are difficult to identify with standard methods. Identification of staphylococcal small-colony variants with the batumin diagnostic preparation is technically simple and can facilitate practical laboratory work. </p...|$|R

Over {{many years of}} chronic lung colonization, P. aeruginosa undergoes extensive adaptation to the lung environment, evolving both toward a persistent, low virulence state and simultaneously diversifying to produce a number of phenotypically distinct morphs. These lung-adapted P. aeruginosa strains include the <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variants</b> (SCVs), <b>small,</b> autoaggregative isolates that show enhanced biofilm formation, strong attachment to surfaces, and increased production of exopolysaccharides. Their appearance in the sputum of CF patients correlates with increased resistance to antibiotics, poor lung function, and prolonged persistence of infection, increasing their relevance as a subject for clinical investigation. The evolution of SCVs in the CF lung is associated with overproduction of the ubiquitous bacterial signaling molecule cyclic-di-GMP, with increased cyclic-di-GMP levels shown {{to be responsible for}} the SCV phenotype {{in a number of different}} CF lung isolates. Here, we review the current state of research in clinical P. aeruginosa SCVs. We will discuss the phenotypic characteristics underpinning the SCV morphotype, the clinical implications of lung colonization with SCVs, and the molecular basis and clinical evolution of the SCV phenotype in the CF lung environment.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{is known}} to {{generate}} <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variants</b> (SCVs) that are resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics and can cause persistent and recurrent infections. The SCV phenotype is unstable, and compensatory mutations lead to restored growth, usually with loss of resistance. However, the evolution of improved growth, by mechanisms that avoid loss of antibiotic resistance, is very poorly understood. By selection with serial passaging, we isolated and characterized different classes of extragenic suppressor mutations that compensate for the slow growth of <b>small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variants.</b> Compensation occurs by two distinct bypass mechanisms: (i) translational suppression of the initial SCV mutation by mutant tRNAs, ribosomal protein S 5, or release factor 2 and (ii) mutations that cause the constitutive activation of the SrrAB global transcriptional regulation system. Although compensation by translational suppression increases growth rate, it also reduces antibiotic susceptibility, thus restoring a pseudo-wild-type phenotype. In contrast, an evolutionary pathway that compensates for the SCV phenotype by activation of SrrAB increases growth rate without loss of antibiotic resistance. RNA sequence analysis revealed that mutations activating the SrrAB pathway cause upregulation of genes involved in peptide transport and in the fermentation pathways of pyruvate to generate ATP and NAD(+), thus explaining the increased growth. By increasing {{the growth rate of}} SCVs without the loss of aminoglycoside resistance, compensatory evolution via the SrrAB activation pathway represents a threat to effective antibiotic therapy of staphylococcal infections. IMPORTANCE <b>Small</b> <b>colony</b> <b>variants</b> (SCVs) of Staphylococcus aureus are a significant clinical problem, causing persistent and antibiotic-resistant infections. However, SCVs are unstable and can rapidly evolve growth-compensated mutants. Previous data suggested that growth compensation only occurred with the loss of antibiotic resistance. We have used selection with serial passaging to uncover four distinct pathways of growth compensation accessible to SCVs. Three of these paths (reversion, intragenic suppression, and translational suppression) increase growth at the expense of losing antibiotic resistance. The fourth path activates an alternative transcriptional program and allows the bacteria to produce the extra ATP required to support faster growth, without losing antibiotic resistance. The importance of this work is that it shows that drug-resistant SCVs can evolve faster growth without losing antibiotic resistance...|$|R
