5|$|The First World War {{effectively}} {{ended the}} dreadnought race, as all three countries <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> themselves unable to acquire additional warships. After the conflict, the race never resumed, but many plans for post-war naval expansions and improvements were postulated by the Argentine, Brazilian, and Chilean governments.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{the still}} poorly {{developed}} peninsula <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> {{itself in a}} strategic position, as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast remained {{the only means of}} sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was only partially completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of {{the speech}} {{appeared}} in The New Yorker on June 10. Several weeks later, The New York Times printed the whole text, quickly followed by Life magazine and Reader's Digest. Hand's message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> himself a folk hero. Though he enjoyed the acclaim, he thought it unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the agnostic Hand's use of religious overtones, suggests that the most challenging aspect {{of the speech}} was {{that the spirit of}} liberty must entertain doubt.|$|E

5|$|The 20-year-old {{king was}} inexperienced and {{considered}} ill-served amidst {{what has been}} called the anarchy in the nation. He dedicated autumn in his newly formed camp in Scania to arm the Swedish nation for battle in the Scanian War. The Swedish soldiers in Scania were outnumbered and outequipped by the Danes. In May 1676, they invaded Scania, taking Landskrona and Helsingborg, then proceeding through Bohuslän towards Halmstad. The King had to grow up quickly. He <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> himself alone and under great pressure.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Sally Sparrow enters Wester Drumlins, an {{abandoned}} house, {{to look for}} subjects to photograph. Instead she finds eerie statues and {{a message from the}} Doctor behind peeling wallpaper addressed to her, warning her about the Weeping Angels. Sally returns the next day with her friend Kathy Nightingale to explore further but Kathy disappears {{at the same time a}} young man knocks at the door. He claims to be Kathy's grandson and delivers a letter to Sally. The letter, written by Kathy, explains that she <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> herself in the 1920s in Hull. She settled down with a husband and led a peaceful life and requests that Sally tell Kathy's brother Larry of her disappearance. Sally sees a Yale key hanging from the hand of one of the statues and takes it before leaving.|$|E

5|$|A counterattack {{developed}} on 8 October, composed of an infantry regiment, the 1st Assault Battalion, a battle {{group of the}} 108th Panzer Brigade, and some 40 armored fighting vehicles scavenged from available units. Although hindered by American artillery, the left wing of the attack managed to cut off an American platoon, while the right wing reached a road junction north {{of the town of}} Alsdorf. A platoon of Shermans supporting an attack on the town of Mariadorf <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> themselves being attacked from the rear, and were able to repel the Germans only after heavy fighting. Two German Sturmgeschütz IV self-propelled assault guns and a squad of infantry entered Alsdorf, where they were heavily counterattacked. Although the two lumbering vehicles somehow eluded American tanks, they were finally engaged by American infantry and forced back to their starting point. With casualties mounting and the Americans drawing closer, the German high command transferred the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division to Aachen, followed by the I SS Panzer Corps, which included the 116th Panzer Division and SS Heavy Panzer Battalion 101, an element of the 1st SS Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|After Wimbledon, Murray {{returned}} to Queen's Club, {{to play for}} Great Britain against France in their Davis Cup quarterfinal tie. Great Britain went 1–0 down when James Ward lost to Gilles Simon in straight sets, however Murray levelled the tie with a victory against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Murray then teamed up with his brother Jamie to win the doubles rubber, coming back from a set down to defeat Tsonga and Nicolas Mahut in four sets, giving Britain a crucial 2–1 lead going into the final day. He then faced Simon in the fourth rubber and after initially being a set and a break down, he <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> his form again {{towards the end of}} the second set and eventually won in four sets, winning 12 of the last 15 games in the process (with Simon struggling from an ankle injury). With a 3–1 lead over France, this resulted in Great Britain reaching their first Davis Cup semi-final since 1981.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the NHL faced {{competition}} from the newly formed World Hockey Association (WHA). The WHA lured many players away from the NHL. The WHA's biggest coup was to lure Bobby Hull from the Black Hawks {{to play for the}} Winnipeg Jets. He signed a $2.75million contract, and lent instant credibility to the new league. After Hull signed, several other players quickly followed suit and the NHL <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> itself in a war for talent. By the time the 1972–73 WHA season began, 67 players had switched from the NHL to the WHA. The NHL also found itself competing with the WHA for markets. Initially, the league had no intention to expand past 14 teams, but the threat the WHA represented caused the league to change its plans. The league hastily announced the creation of the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames as 1972 expansion teams. Following the 1972–73 season, the NHL announced it was further expanding to 18-teams for the 1974–75 season, adding the Kansas City Scouts and Washington Capitals. In just eight years, the NHL had tripled in size to 18 teams.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} abruptly, {{to conceal the}} too-revealing fact that his limbs were shaking. He pulled a {{handkerchief}} from his pocket to mop his brow, which had grown damp. And then, quite <b>suddenly,</b> he <b>found</b> himself weeping.|$|R
60|$|<b>Suddenly</b> he <b>found</b> himself confronted in {{the bush}} by a man on horseback, whom he at once {{recognized}} as Georgie Brownbie. He forgot for a moment where he was and began to question the reprobate as to his presence at that spot.|$|R
60|$|Outside the window, a {{blaze of}} color, Mervo smiled up at him, and <b>suddenly</b> he <b>found</b> himself loathing its exotic beauty. He felt stifled. This {{was no place for}} a man. A vision of clean winds and wide spaces came to him.|$|R
5|$|Rosebeary, flying Cobra Blue Ghost 28, {{called a}} Mayday but {{was able to}} safely exit the area and landed his {{severely}} damaged helicopter. His aircraft was totaled. He and Gunner Warrant Officer Charles Gorski were {{picked up by a}} HH-53C helicopter (Jolly Green 67), without incident. Rosebeary warned other aircraft against crossing the river. When Morse in Sandy 07 learned that the quick-snatch had failed, he and his wingman Sandy 08 broke off engaging the North Vietnamese and returned to Da Nang. Both Sandys were found to be so damaged they would take several days to repair. At 9:00p.m., Nail 59, {{a new version of the}} OV-10A Bronco aircraft equipped with the Pave Nail LORAN radar piloted by Gary Ferentchak, took over FAC duties. The SAR efforts were suspended for the night and the U.S. and ARVN forces remained unaware of the true strength of the NVA offensive. Advised by the FAC to remain in place, Hambleton moved to a safer spot in the jungle and dug a hole to hide in until morning. During the night, Nail 59 and King 27, an HC-130 commanded by Maj. Dennis Constant, stayed. They <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> themselves painted by Fan Song radar and narrowly missed getting shot down as well. At 53 years old, Hambleton was not a prime candidate to survive the cold, wet weather conditions.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of the Qing Dynasty of China in 1911, the Hongmen <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> themselves without purpose. From then on the Hongmen diverged into various groups.

25|$|Cuba's tourism {{policies}} of the early 1990s, which were driven by the government's pressing need to earn hard currency, had {{a major impact on}} the underlying egalitarianism espoused by the Cuban revolution. Two parallel economies and societies quickly emerged, divided by their access to the newly legalized U.S. dollar. Those having access to dollars through contact with the lucrative tourist industry <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> themselves at a distinct financial advantage over professional, industrial and agricultural workers.|$|E
25|$|With his arm injured, Paige <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> himself unemployable. He {{looked for}} {{work as a}} manager or coach, but was unsuccessful. One ballclub owner {{was willing to give}} him a chance to play ball again—J.L. Wilkinson of the Monarchs. Wilkinson offered him the modest {{opportunity}} to play, not for the Negro American League Monarchs, but for a second-string barnstorming team called the Travelers, which was now renamed the Satchel Paige All-Stars. Paige would pitch when he could and play first base when he could not.|$|E
50|$|A hyūganatsu sapling {{was said}} to have <b>suddenly</b> been <b>found</b> in a Miyazaki garden {{sometime}} in the 1820s, after which it became widely cultivated throughout the region.

25|$|The {{withdrawal}} of drum and bass {{from the mainstream}} {{was not only a}} result of its growing fascination with its own (progressively darker) sound, but also resulted from the explosive birth and growing popularity of UK garage (2 step and 4x4 garage, aka speed garage), a musical genre heavily influenced by jungle, with similar beats, vocal and basslines but slower speeds and more friendly (or at least radio-friendly) beats. Drum and bass <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> itself losing popularity and established drum and bass producers expressed shock at its sudden alienation and abandonment by the general public. This turn fuelled the harder sound of techstep.|$|E
25|$|Despite being a {{relatively}} low-profile politician, Toledo <b>suddenly</b> <b>found</b> himself {{the leader of}} the opposition to Fujimori's presidency. Toledo promised to uphold and strengthen the market program that had been put in place, while also mitigating inequality issues attributed to it. He promised to pursue democratic reforms and reinvigorate Peru's social infrastructure. During the campaign, he promised to raise the wages of civil servants, which had been stagnant under Fujimori, and to create 400,000 jobs a year through programs designed to encourage agriculture, tourism, and small business. Toledo repeatedly called for the expansion of investigations into government, including investigations into allegations that the Fujimori administration had stolen billions from government coffers.|$|E
