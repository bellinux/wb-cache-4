The situation reached a climax in the aftermath of Treasurer Peter Costello's 2006 Budget, whereby {{for the first time in}} recent Australian political history, the opposition leader and his colleagues ceased inquiry on the budget papers after just six questions, before resuming further questioning on the AWB scandal. The media criticised the ALP, although many ministers acknowledged the need for the Government to be held accountable for the AWB scandal.|$|E

2500|$|On September 17, Allen and Webb {{appeared}} on NBC's Meet the Press for a debate. Part of the program's debate {{series on the}} midterm elections, the debate heavily discussed both the original Gulf War and the present war in Iraq. Host Tim Russert questioned Webb about his initial support for Allen's 2000 U.S. Senate run, {{as well as what}} led him to later oppose Allen. Russert also questioned Allen about a remark Webb made concerning his interactions with Allen {{at the start of the}} Iraq conflict. Webb asserted that he approached Allen regarding U.S. involvement in the region and cautioned against military action. Webb also claimed that Allen responded to this by saying [...] "You’re asking me to be disloyal to the president." [...] After being questioned on this by Russert, Allen clarified by saying [...] "No, it’s loyalty to this country, and making sure that our country is unified in, in this, in this effort to disarm <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> <b>That</b> was the point." [...] Allen also addressed what he saw as a weakness in Webb, claiming his opponent wanted to withdraw from Iraq. Webb clarified his belief that the U.S. has a commitment to ensure Iraq is stable before withdrawing, but also reasserted that a permanent U.S. presence in Iraq is not an option.|$|E

50|$|Syria’s {{opposition}} to the Iraq War deteriorated relations. Serious contention arose because the Syrian Government failed to prevent foreign fighters from using Syrian borders to enter Iraq and refused to deport the elements from the former <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> government <b>that</b> support Iraqi insurgency.

5000|$|After the August 1990 {{invasion}} of Kuwait by Iraqi forces, due to Iraqi demands, the Soviet Union evacuated its embassy in Kuwait. A {{spokesman for the}} Soviet Foreign Ministry noted that the embassy, under international law, was still open, albeit vacant, and that the evacuation of the 882 Soviets in Kuwait did not alter the Soviet stance on the illegality of the Iraqi invasion. The President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev explained that the Iraqi {{invasion of}} Kuwait had created an [...] "extraordinary and extremely dangerous" [...] situation in Persian Gulf. Furthermore, Gorbachev warned Iraqi President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>that</b> refusal to abide by United Nations Security Council resolutions would see the Council introducing further measures against Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|Murray {{was summoned}} to the FCO in London and on 8 March 2003 was reprimanded for writing to his employers, in {{response}} to a speech by President of the United States George W. Bush criticising human rights violations by <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> <b>that</b> [...] "when it comes to the Karimov regime, systematic torture and rape appear to be treated as peccadilloes, not to affect the relationship and to be downplayed in the international fora. Double standards? Yes." [...] The human rights abuses were worse in Uzbekistan than in Iraq, thought Murray in the run up to the invasion of Iraq, but the latter was being invaded while the government of the former was being supported.|$|E
5000|$|The former Iraqi President, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> wrongly {{believed}} <b>that</b> {{the disease}} could be spread through casual contact {{and felt that}} infected Iraqis should be exterminated or imprisoned.

5000|$|When the AIDS-HIV {{pandemic}} reached Iraq in 1986, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> believed <b>that</b> {{the disease}} could be spread by casual contact, and thus ordered all Iraqis {{with the disease}} to be relocated to a special prison facility. Widespread ignorance about the disease meant that all Iraqis with hemophilia, along with homosexuals, were often suspected of carrying the disease.

50|$|In March 2003, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland {{had invaded}} Iraq to depose its Ba'ath Party {{government}} led by <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> and, when <b>that</b> was accomplished, in May 2003 {{decided to stay}} on in Iraq to “bring order to parts of that country that remain dangerous”.|$|R
5000|$|On April 9, 2003 Sharif had {{his chance}} to take revenge. Hearing that the Saddam regime had fallen he took a 10 kg (22 lb) {{sledgehammer}} {{and went to work}} on the statue of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>that</b> stood in Firdos Square in Baghdad. The square is {{directly in front of the}} Palestine Hotel where the world's journalists had been staying. Seeing a crowd and a story, the reporters and their cameras streamed out of the hotel and video taped the falling of Saddam Hussein's statue. While Sharif's actions with the sledgehammer only resulted in a small dent in the statue base and bloody hands, he does claim to have handed over the Iraqi flag that was placed on the statue.|$|E
5000|$|Groupthink {{can have}} a strong hold on {{political}} decisions and military operations, which may result in enormous wastage of human and material resources. Highly qualified and experienced politicians and military commanders sometimes make very poor decisions when in a suboptimal group setting. Scholars such as Janis and Raven attribute political and military fiascoes, such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Vietnam War, and the Watergate scandal, {{to the effect of}} groupthink. More recently, Dina Badie argued that groupthink was largely responsible for the shift in the U.S. administration's view on <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>that</b> eventually led to the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States. After the September 11 attacks, [...] "stress, promotional leadership, and intergroup conflict" [...] were all factors that gave rise to the occurrence of groupthink. Political case studies of groupthink serve to illustrate the impact that the occurrence of groupthink can have in today's political scene.|$|E
5000|$|Firdos Square (ساحة الفردوس) is {{a public}} open space in Baghdad, Iraq. It is named after the Persian word Firdows, which means [...] "paradise". The 17 Ramadan Mosque {{and two of the}} best-known hotels in Baghdad, the Palestine Hotel and the Sheraton Ishtar, are located on the square. The {{roundabout}} in the center of Firdos Square has been the site of several monuments beginning with the completion of the monumental arch The Unknown Soldier in 1959. It was subsequently replaced by the statue of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>that</b> was torn down by U.S. coalition forces during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. A green, abstract sculpture by Bassem Hamad al-Dawiri was commissioned to replace the Saddam statue. In 2009, the architect of the Monument to the Unknown Soldier Rifat Chadirji expressed interest in rebuilding the monument on its original site. As of 2013, the al-Dawiri statue and the surrounding columns have been removed from Firdos Square.|$|E
50|$|Baker {{concluded}} that Kelly's death {{was probably a}} revenge killing by Iraqi supporters of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> and <b>that</b> it was crudely disguised as a suicide by Thames Valley police - who appeared to have known of an assassination plot in advance - because the British government was fearful of the political consequences. He noted {{that many of those}} apparently involved have since received promotions or unusual awards. Baker later stated that more detail about this had to be removed from the book.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, {{the government of}} <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> had asserted <b>that</b> Iran fired dozens of Scud missiles at the People's Mujahedin (MKO) in Iraq in 1999 and 2001, with the MKO itself claiming that Iran fired more missiles at Iraq in 2001 than it did during the entire Iran-Iraq war.|$|R
50|$|Snake Party (also called Snake's Head Movement or Harakat Ras Al Afa) is {{composed}} substantially of former Baath Party and <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> loyalists <b>that</b> {{are engaged in}} the Iraqi insurgency. This group originated from the Ba’ath Party in Hawija and aspired {{to be a political}} party to oppose the multinational forces' presence in Iraq. Some have alleged that the party has links to tribes around Falluja and Ramadi. Al-Ahram reported in 2003 that the organization was one of several that target those who collaborate with occupation forces.|$|R
