The immersion time of the tubes was 569 days. Tarnishing originated by biofouling was assessed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses in conjunction with argon ion sputtering. The EIS diagrams showed a semicircle that was better defined as the experimental time increased, indicating the decreasing tarnishing resistance of the immersed specimens. The EIS results were validated using Kramers-Kronig relationships. SEM micrographs of biofouling indicated that the number of microorganisms on the SS surfaces increased with immersion time.

Dry storage has been used elsewhere in the world for Zircaloy and aluminium clad fuel and has been proposed for use in the UK, however since the UK’s fuel is predominantly stainless steel (SS) clad, testing will need to be carried out to ensure that drying methods are suitable.

Despite the recognition of potential biases associated with sorptive loss reaction, the interaction of reactive BVOC with a sorbent tube (ST) sampler has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, the extent of such a loss on a sampling device was studied against the sorbent holder materials by comparing stainless steel (SS; main target) and quartz (QZ; reference). To this end, three bed STs (Tenax TA, Carbopack B, and Carbopack X) were prepared using both holding materials (SS vs. QZ). The extent of BVOC loss was then tested for each material against two different phases (liquid and vapor) of ten monoterpenes. Accordingly, the soptive loss on the SS holder ranged from 10 % (vapor) to 20 % (liquid). If a vapor phase BVOC was forced to pass through an empty <b>SS</b> <b>tube,</b> the extent of their loss increased further in a range of 21. 1 % (β-P) to 43. 5 % (α-T). Likewise, similar loss rates (about 10 % reductions) were also observed when analyzing some environmental samples (pine needle) from the SS holder relative to QZ.

30|$|A Ni–Al {{coating of}} three {{different}} thicknesses was successfully prepared on the outer surface of a stainless steel 316 L tube (<b>SS</b> <b>tube)</b> using a flame spray technique with Ni- 5 wt%Al powder as the starting material. SEM and EDX analyses of the cross-section area of the Ni–Al coating confirm that all three thicknesses consist of Ni, Al and O elements with a non-uniform chemical distribution. The O element distributes over the cross-sectional area of the sample and is predominantly in the Al-rich area. Ni, Al, NiO and Al 2 O 3 phases are indexed on the Ni–Al solar absorber. The spectral R of all thicknesses are identical values over the whole wavelength range of UV–VIS-NIR and IR regions, indicating that the spectral selectivity of this coating is independent of its thickness. According to the thermal efficiency equation of the PTC based on the intercept (FRηo) and slope lines (−FRUL/C), the thermal performance of the PTC increases with increasing thickness of the Ni–Al coating, while the heat loss transfers from the PTC to the surroundings decreases. In conclusion, the Ni–Al coating prepared using the flame spray technique is a very promising candidate for a solar absorber material to use in concentrating solar collectors.|$|E

Three thicknesses of Ni–Al coating for use as solar absorber material were successfully prepared on the outer surface of a stainless steel 316 L (<b>SS)</b> <b>tube</b> by flame spray. The phase, morphology, and reflectance (R) of the Ni–Al coatings were characterized using several techniques. The PTC and solar receiver tube were specially designed and constructed for observing the collector thermal performance by following ASHRAE 93 - 1986. Looking at the results, the actual average thicknesses of the three Ni–Al coatings {{turn out to be}} 195, 215, and 299  μm. The morphology and chemical composition of all three thicknesses are similar. The chemical composition in the cross-sectional view exhibits non-uniform distribution. The three thicknesses of the coating are composed of NiO and Al 2 O 3 phases, which also corresponded to the results of SEM–EDX mapping. The differences in a solar absorptance (α) of the three thicknesses of Ni–Al coating are not statistically significant, with an average α value of 0.74 – 0.75. However, there are differences in thermal efficiency of the PTC depending on the thickness of the Ni–Al coating. Of the three samples, the thickest one (299  µm) demonstrates the highest ability to convert solar radiation into thermal energy.|$|E

SST- 1 vacuum vessel consists of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatible sixteen sectors in which U-shaped baking channels are embedded on inner surfaces of each of them. Similarly, PFCs are comprised of modular graphite diverters and movable graphite based limiters and stainless steel (<b>SS</b> 304 L) <b>tubes</b> are brazed on the back plate of PFC for baking. Baking of SST- 1 vacuum vessel and plasma facing components are carried out using nitrogen gas heating and supply system. SST- 1 main vacuum vessel is baked at 150 °C by circulating hot nitrogen gas at 250 °C at 4. 5 bar gauge (g) pressure through these U-shaped channels. The plasma facing components (PFC) are baked at 250 °C or more in the similar fashion by passing hot nitrogen gas through these <b>SS</b> brazed <b>tubes.</b> Thermal analysis shows that the temperature of 150 °C at the vacuum vessel is achieved within ten hours if hot nitrogen gas is passed at the ramp rate of 50 °C/h while thermal shields are maintained at 85 K.

40|$|The type VI {{secretion}} system (T 6 SS) is {{a widespread}} machine used by bacteria to control their environment and kill or disable bacterial species or eukaryotes through toxin injection. The T 6 SS comprises a central tube formed of stacked hexamers of hemolysin co-regulated proteins (Hcp) and terminated by a trimeric valine-glycine repeat protein G (VgrG) component, the cell puncturing device. A contractile tail sheath, formed by the TssB and TssC proteins, surrounds this tube.

Schott is a new manufacturer of trough HCEs. The Schott HCEs are 4 m long; therefore, two were joined and mounted on the LS- 2 collector module for the test.

40|$|As each {{production}} process introduces residual stresses in the material, cold-rolled steel tubes are not delivered stress-free. The motivation o f this research {{can be traced}} back to the laser cutting of tubes. During the cutting process, residual stresses are relieved, which causes defor mation of the tube and a reduction of the precision of cut. Residual str esses also play a role in stress corrosion and sudden collapse of tubula r structures. This work concentrates on the residual stresses in cold-rolled steel tub es due to the welding process. Insight into the origin, influencing para meters, distribution and magnitude is gained with a finite element (FE) simulation of the welding process. An FE model allows for the visualisat ion of these aspects in the entire tube. A welding simulation requires t he quantification of numerous input parameters: thermal and thermomechan ical material properties (and their evolution at elevated temperatures), thermal and mechanical boundary conditions, and a model for the heat-in put of the welding torch. The simulation is split up into a thermal anal ysis which calculates the temperature field in the tube during the weldi ng and subsequent cooling and a thermomechanical simulation which calcul ates the deformation and stress. Since welding simulations require an appropriate value for numerous para meters, validation of the simulation results is of utmost importance. Fo r this purpose, a laboratory setup which allows measuring the temperatur es and deformations during the welding of the tube is built. The tempera tures are measured with 5 thermocouples. The deformation is measured wit h strain gauges and the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Although DIC has some advantages over other techniques measuring deforma tions during welding, to the author's knowledge it is the first time tha t DIC is used in a welding application. First, it is investigated whethe r it is possible to measure the thermal expansion of the types of stainl ess steel used in this work (austenitic SS 304 and ferritic SS 409) on 3 D objects. It is shown that this is possible up to 600 &# 176;C. From these measu rements the thermal expansion coefficient is determined, and this is use d as input in the thermomechanical simulations. Although the strain that occurs in the welding is rather small compared to common DIC applicatio ns, the strain evolution during the welding and subsequent cooling of th e tube can be recognised easily. These strain evolutions are in agreemen t with the strain evolution measured with the strain gauges. Strain gaug es have in this application the disadvantage that the measured strain mu st be compensated for the actual material temperature, which makes their result dependent on this temperature measurement. In the thermal simulation, the predicted temperature field is brought in agreement with the measured temperature field. For this purpose, the va lue of three poorly known input parameters was optimised: (i) the effici ency of the welding process; (ii) the actual room temperature around the setup; and (iii) the convection film coefficient. This procedure result s in physically acceptable values for these parameters. The difference b etween the measured and the simulated temperature curves at the thermoco uple points is minimised, but they are certainly not yet coincident, whi ch is directly reflected in the simulated strain evolutions. In the thermomechanical simulation, the thermal field is combined with t he thermal dilatation of the material to calculate the stress and strain evolution during the welding process. The tube in the experiments was s ubjected to a stress relief treatment before the experiment was started and also the simulations start from a stress-free tube. The simulated st rain evolutions are compared with the measured ones. The residual stress profile in the middle section of the tube is compared to an X-ray diffr action residual stress measurement. A sensitivity analysis shows that pa rameter variations are visible in both the strain evolution and in the r esidual stress profile. Validating the simulations with the strain evolu tion is preferred to a residual stress measurement as in this way the wh ole process is checked and not just the final state. The methodology developed for a <b>SS</b> 304 <b>tube</b> with a diameter of 60 mm and w all thickness of 1. 5 mm is applied to a <b>SS</b> 409 <b>tube</b> with a diameter of 60 m m and wall thickness of 2 mm. Especially the larger heat input and the lo wer thermal expansion coefficient define this case study. The results ar e similar to the <b>SS</b> 304 <b>tube,</b> but a better material characterisation of t he SS 409 steel is necessary to improve the results. Finally, the effect of an initial residual stress field on the strain ev olution during and the residual stress after the welding is investigated. For that reason the stress/strain state inferred from exploratory roll ing simulations was implemented as initial field in the welding simulati ons. From these simulations it is concluded that the final residual stre ss pattern is mainly determined by the welding process. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{first wall}} (FW) of ITER blanket {{includes}} beryllium (Be) armor tiles joined to CuCrZr heat sink with stainless steel (<b>SS)</b> cooling <b>tube</b> and backing plate {{in order to}} improve plasma performance and reduce thermal stress. Since these joints must withstand thermal and mechanical loads caused by the plasma and electromagnetic force, it is important to evaluate the strength and thermal fatigue life of the joints. Qualification tests of the FW fabrication technology are performed in order to qualify the joining technologies. The Japan Domestic Agency (JADA) has fabricated the qualification mock-up with a hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) technique and carried out the materials testing and the non-destructive examinations. When the dissimilar materials joints are subjected to external force and thermal load, the stress distribution shows singularity and large stress concentration at the interface edges caused by discontinuity of the elastic properties. The characteristics of stress singularity were analyzed for the Be/CuCrZr and SS/CuCrZr joints. The results of tensile test showed that the Be/CuCrZr joint fractured at the interface because of large stress concentration at the interface edges. For the SS/CuCrZr joint, however, the joint fractured at CuCrZr apart from the interface. There was insignificant stress concentration at the interface edges, because those elastic properties are almost same. Since Charpy impact strength of the SS/CuCrZr joint was inferior to the CuCrZr, elasto-plastic finite element analyses were also carried out to clarify the deformation characteristics and fracture of the tensile and Charpy specimens. Those fracture behavior were caused from the plastic deformation properties of both materials. 1...|$|R

The objective of this experiment was {{the investigation of the}} behavior of a Russian type PWR fuel element (VVER- 1000) during early core degradation. The main difference between a Western type and a Russian type PWR bundle is the B_ 4 C absorber rod instead of AgInCd. Measured quantities are boundary conditions, bundle temperature, hydrogen generation and the final bundle configurations after cooldown. Due to the large number of participants the comparisons between experimental and analytical results could be grouped by codes and examined separately. The thermal behavior up to significant oxidation has been predicted quite well by most of the participants and all codes. Larger deviations have been observed for the oxidation-induced temperature escalation, both time of onset and maximum temperature as well. The bundle behavior is greatly influenced by chemical interactions involving B_ 4 C absorber rod material, which failed relatively early at low temperature due to eutectic interaction between B_ 4 C and SS cladding as well as the <b>SS</b> guide <b>tube.</b> Regarding the complex material interaction larger differences can be recognized between calculated and measured results because of inappropriate models for material relocation and solidification processes and the lack of models describing the interactions of absorber rod materials with the fuel rods.

40|$|The Type VI {{secretion}} system (T 6 SS) is {{a widespread}} weapon dedicated to the delivery of toxin proteins into eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The 13 T 6 SS subunits assemble a cytoplasmic contractile structure anchored to the cell envelope by a membrane-spanning complex. This structure is evolutionarily, structurally and functionally related to the tail of contractile bacteriophages. In bacteriophages, the tail assembles onto a protein complex, {{referred to as the}} baseplate, that not only serves as a platform during assembly of the tube and sheath, but also triggers the contraction of the sheath. Although {{progress has been made in}} understanding T 6 SS assembly and function, the composition of the T 6 SS baseplate remains mostly unknown. Here, we report that six T 6 SS proteins-TssA, TssE, TssF, TssG, TssK and VgrG-are required for proper assembly of the T 6 <b>SS</b> tail <b>tube,</b> and a complex between VgrG, TssE,-F and-G could be isolated. In addition, we demonstrate that TssF and TssG share limited sequence homologies with known phage components, and we report the interaction network between these subunits and other baseplate and tail components. In agreement with the baseplate being the assembly platform for the tail, fluorescence microscopy analyses of functional GFP-TssF and TssK-GFP fusion proteins show that these proteins assemble stable and static clusters on which the sheath polymerizes.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to study the influence of curvature on local boiling heat transfer coefficient and two-phase pressure drop in helically coiled tubes with water as the working medium. In helically coiled tubes, the geometric parameters like pipe diameter and coil diameter vary the curvature and hence secondary flow which affects the heat transfer distribution and pressure drop. The present work investigates the characteristics of flow boiling in helically coiled tubes. Very less information {{is available on the}} influence of curvature on flow boiling system. The local wall temperature is measured not only in the axial direction (along the length of coil) but also in the circumferential direction using thermal imaging technique. Experiments are performed with six helically coiled test sections made of <b>SS</b> 304 <b>tubes</b> having inner diameters varying from 6 to 10 mm. The coil diameter to the tube diameter ratio ranges from 14 to 58 and coil pitch is 50 mm. The effect of geometric and operating parameters like tube diameter, coil diameter, heat flux and mass flux on local boiling heat transfer coefficient and two-phase pressure drop is analysed. In the subcooled region and in a low quality region, boiling heat transfer coefficient in helical coils is much higher (12 %- 100 %) than in straight tubes. However, in a high quality region, the boiling heat transfer coefficient in helical coils is same as in straight tubes. A correlation is suggested for two-phase pressure drop in helical coils.

40|$|Comparison of {{material}} usage {{and cost of}} two types of cross-flow steam condensers is reported in this study {{which can be used}} for water desalination in conjunction with a parabolic trough solar energy concentrator plant. Traditional shell and tube condensers (where steam flows inside the tubes) and surface condensers (where steam flows in the shell and cooling water flows in the tubes) are considered in this study. It has been found that the energy production from the PTC of dimensions 4. 5 m × 4. 8 m with an aperture area of 21. 6 m 2 was 19. 4 kW. It has been calculated that the distilled water production capacity of the solar energy harnessing system per day is 55. 6 l, assuming solar irradiance to be 0. 9 kW m- 2 and the efficiency of solar energy harnessing system as 50 % if the sun is available for four hours. The cooling water input temperature was assumed to be 30 °C. The minimum length required for a <b>SS</b> 304 <b>tube</b> of Ø 9. 5 mm was 7. 16 m for the traditional condenser and 1. 30 m for the surface condenser. The efficiency of the traditional condenser reduced due to the formation of a condensed water layer {{on the surface of the}} tube, as it acts as a thermal barrier. However, in the surface condenser, efficiency was enhanced due to easy condensation while increasing the system pressure. Further, efficiency is enhanced due to density separation of wet vapour by changing the flow direction near the wet sump. Fabrication cost and maintenance cost are also found to be less in the surface condenser. As such, it can be concluded that use of surface condenser is the most cost effective method, which uses a smaller amount {{of material}} making the condenser smaller and lighter...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to investigate the heat transfer and pressure drop in flow boiling at low pressure with water as the working medium. The effect of pipe diameter, heat flux and mass flux on boiling pressure drop and local heat transfer coefficient is studied. In the present work, the available correlations are revisited for low pressure flow boiling. Comparison of local heat transfer coefficient with the existing correlation is carried out to identify an appropriate correlation which performs well in complete flow boiling range (subcooled regions and saturated regions) for water at low system pressure. Experiments are performed with eight test sections made of thin walled stainless steel (<b>SS</b> 304) <b>tubes</b> having inner diameters from 5. 5 mm to 12 mm and length varying from 550 mm to 1000 mm. The system pressure is varying form 1 bar to 3 bar. No change in slope of heat transfer curve is found for subcooled regions. Heat transfer in all the three regions of subcooled boiling namely partial subcooled boiling, fully developed subcooled and net vapour generation are predicted by a single correlation. Tube diameter {{has no effect on}} boiling heat transfer distribution. However, tube diameter affects two phase pressure drop. Increase in mass flux increases the convective heat transfer coefficient. However, mass flux has no influence on subcooled and nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient. Heat flux increases the boiling heat transfer coefficient. Increase in tube diameter and mass flux decreases the two-phase pressure drop. Most of all the correlations in the subcooled region predict heat transfer coefficient with reasonable accuracy. Kandlikar and Shah correlations perform well in the low pressure saturated boiling i. e. nucleate and convective. None of the available two-phase pressure drop correlations are able to predict the pressure drop in a low pressure system. A correlation is developed to predict two-phase pressure drop in low pressure flow boiling system with a reasonably good accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of non-biodegradable plastic waste without further upgrading/downgrading is not environmentally acceptable and many methods {{to overcome the}} problem have been proposed. Herein we indicate a simple method to make high-value nanomaterials from plastic waste as a partial solution to the environmental problem. Laboratory-based waste centrifuge tubes made of polypropylene were chosen as a carbon source to show the process principle. In the process, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized from plastic waste in a two-stage stainless steel 316 (<b>SS</b> 316) metal <b>tube</b> that acted as both reactor vessel and catalyst. The steel reactor contains Fe (and Ni, and various alloys), which act as the catalyst for the carbon conversion process. The reaction and products were studied using electron probe microanalysis, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Optimization studies {{to determine the effect}} of different parameters on the process showed that the highest yield and most graphitized MWCNTs were formed at 900 °C under the reaction conditions used (yield 42 %; Raman ID/IG ratio = 0. 48). The high quality and high yield of the MWCNTs that were produced in a flow reactor from plastic waste using a two stage SS 316 chemical vapor deposition (CVD) furnace did not require the use of an added catalyst...|$|R
40|$|Environmentally {{assisted}} cracking (EAC) of lightwater reactor (LWR) materials {{has affected}} nuclear reactors {{from the very}} introduction of the technology. Corrosion problems have afflicted steam generators from the very introduction of pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology. Shippingport, the first commercial PWR operated in the United States, developed leaking cracks in two Type 304 stainless steel (<b>SS)</b> steam generator <b>tubes</b> as early as 1957, after only 150 h of operation. Stress corrosion cracks were observed in the heat-affected zones of welds in austenitic SS piping and associated components in boiling-water reactors (BRWs) as early as 1965. The degradation of steam generator tubing in PWRs and the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of austenitic SS piping in BWRs {{have been the most}} visible and most expensive examples of EAC in LWRs, and the repair and replacement of steam generators and recirculation piping has cost hundreds of millions of dollars. However, other problems associated with the effects of the environment on reactor structures and components am important concerns in operating plants and for extended reactor lifetimes. Cast duplex austenitic-ferritic SSs are used extensively in the nuclear industry to fabricate pump casings and valve bodies for LWRs and primary coolant piping in many PWRs. Embrittlement of the ferrite phase in cast duplex SS may occur after 10 to 20 years at reactor operating temperatures, which could influence the mechanical response and integrity of pressure boundary components during high strain-rate loading (e. g., seismic events). The problem is of most concern in PWRs where slightly higher temperatures are typical and cast SS piping is widely used...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: A {{significant}} rise {{of blood}} pressure {{in response to a}} given salt load is a weak indication of high salt sensitivity, supposed to foster the development of arterial hypertension and related diseases in later life. In search of an alternative method we recently developed the salt blood test (SBT), a new concept for quantifying salt sensitivity (SS). Based on this concept, namely that red blood cells (RBC) report on salt sensitivity, the SBT-mini was developed. Methods: The SBT-mini utilizes a droplet of capillary blood mixed with a ‘smart' Na+ cocktail. Red blood cells (RBC) of this mixture are allowed to sediment by gravity in a glass <b>tube.</b> <b>SS</b> is quantified by measuring RBC sedimentation rate. 90 healthy volunteers (39 males, 51 females; mean age: 23 ± 0. 5 years) were evaluated and ‘standard values' for males and females were derived. Results: Sodium buffer capacity of female blood is about 20 % smaller as compared to male blood due to the lower hematocrit of females. SS of an individual is related to the mean standard value (set to 100 %) of the respective male/female cohort. High SS (> 120 %) has been found in 31 % of males and 28 % of females. Conclusions: SS can be estimated derived from the individual RBC sodium buffer capacity as measured by the SBT-mini. About one third of a healthy test cohort exhibits a high sensitivity to salt. Reduction of sodium consumption to at least two grams per day (equals five grams of NaCl per day as suggested by the WHO) is recommended, particularly for individuals with high salt sensitivity...|$|R
