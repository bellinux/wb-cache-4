5|$|Nefarious: Merchant of Souls is a 2011 American {{documentary}} film about modern human trafficking, specifically <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery.</b> Presented from a Christian worldview, Nefarious covers human trafficking in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, alternating interviews with re-enactments. Victims of trafficking talk about having been {{the objects of}} physical abuse and attempted murder. Several former prostitutes talk about their conversion to Christianity, escape from sexual oppression, and subsequent education or marriage. The film ends with the assertion that only Jesus can completely heal people from the horrors of <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{twenty-four years}} the Indonesian {{government}} subjected {{the people of}} East Timor to routine and systematic torture, <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery,</b> extrajudicial executions, massacres, and deliberate starvation. The 1991 Santa Cruz Massacre caused outrage around the world, and reports of other such killings were numerous.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to territorial disputes, the League {{also tried to}} intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery,</b> and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the Nansen passport, {{which was the first}} internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.|$|E

50|$|Gary Becker (1930-2014) was a Nobel Prize-winner from 1992 and {{was known}} in his work for {{applying}} economic methods of thinking to other fields, such as crime, <b>sexual</b> relationships, <b>slavery</b> and drugs, assuming that people act rationally. His work was originally focused in labor economics. His work partly inspired the popular economics book Freakonomics. He {{is considered one of}} the founding fathers of Chicago political economy.|$|R

5|$|Nefarious: Merchant of Souls {{documents}} modern human trafficking, specifically <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery.</b> While {{there are}} men and boys who are trafficked around the world, the United States Department of State (DoS) estimates that about 80% of human trafficking victims are female, and the film focuses on them. Information is presented from a Christian worldview—despite the subject matter, there is no profanity or nudity in the film, although there are scenes showing alcohol consumption and women wearing skimpy clothing.|$|E
5|$|Habré {{consolidated}} his dictatorship {{through a}} power system that relied on corruption and violence {{with thousands of}} people estimated to have been killed under his rule. The president favoured his own Toubou ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the Zaghawa. His general, Idriss Déby, overthrew him in 1990. Attempts to prosecute Habré led to his placement under house arrest in Senegal in 2005; in 2013, Habré was formally charged with war crimes committed during his rule. In May 2016, he {{was found guilty of}} human-rights abuses, including rape, <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery,</b> and ordering the killing of 40,000 people, and sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
5|$|In Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, Lohan meets and {{interviews}} victims of human trafficking in Delhi, Kolkata and {{a village in}} West Bengal. They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery,</b> physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family did not have enough food, and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, at least she was fed.|$|E

2500|$|In India, the {{trafficking}} in persons for commercial sexual exploitation, forced labor, forced marriages and domestic servitude is considered an organized crime. The Government of India applies the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013, active from 3 February 2013, as well as Section 370 and 370A IPC, which defines human trafficking and [...] "provides stringent punishment for human trafficking; trafficking of children for exploitation in any form including physical exploitation; or any form of <b>sexual</b> exploitation, <b>slavery,</b> servitude or the forced removal of organs." [...] Additionally, a Regional Task Force implements the SAARC Convention on the prevention of Trafficking in Women and Children.|$|R
5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into someone. The leader {{of an organization}} working to rescue girls from prostitution in Cambodia {{says that it is}} not the poorest parents who sell their children into <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> but rather the parents who are looking to buy luxury goods. He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American man who had been a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Raya, a young Ukrainian woman, and {{her friend}} Luba are sold to a Bosnian sex-trafficking ring by a relative. Raya escapes with Irka, another girl forced into prostitution, and they are sent to a women's shelter for victims of human trafficking. While {{investigating}} their case, Kathryn uncovers a large-scale <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> ring utilized by international personnel (including Americans). She persuades Raya and Irka to testify against their traffickers in court, guaranteeing their safety; however, an indifferent UN official drops Irka at the border between Bosnia and Serbia when she cannot produce a passport. A corrupt peacekeeper tips off the traffickers, and Raya is recaptured and tortured. Although rescued from the woods by Kathryn, Irka is too afraid {{to proceed with the}} trial.|$|E
5|$|She Has a Name is a {{play about}} human {{trafficking}} written by Andrew Kooman in 2009 as a single act and expanded to full length in 2010. It is about the trafficking of children into <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> and {{was inspired by the}} deaths of 54 people in the Ranong human-trafficking incident. Kooman had previously published literature, but this was his first full-length play. The stage premiere of She Has a Name was directed by Stephen Waldschmidt in Calgary, Alberta in February 2011. From May to October 2012, She Has a Name toured across Canada. In conjunction with the tour, A Better World raised money to help women and children who had been trafficked in Thailand as part of the country's prostitution industry. The first performances of She Has a Name in the United States took place in Folsom, California in 2014 under the direction of Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time.|$|E
50|$|Abandoned by his American lover, a poor, gay {{teenager}} {{from the}} mountains is forced to support {{himself and his family}} by entering into the underground urban world of male strippers, prostitution, illegal drugs, <b>sexual</b> exploitation and <b>slavery,</b> as well police oppression, corruption and murder. His only real friend is a successful call boy, who acts as his mentor.|$|R
40|$|Slaveholders {{believed}} {{women could}} both labour {{and care for}} their children simultaneously, and they routinely exploited enslaved mothers as both workers and as reproducers. Using Stephanie Camp’s conceptualization of enslaved women’s bodies as sites of resistance, this article argues that despite slavery’s arduousness motherhood provided a place of refuge for enslaved women to enjoy their children and the camaraderie of their peers. However, women sometimes lamented bringing enslaved children into the world and strove not to do so, especially when pregnancy resulted from <b>sexual</b> assault. <b>Slavery’s</b> unique burdens meant many women participated in shared and more communal forms of mothering than their white counterparts...|$|R
50|$|For decades, missionaries {{had very}} little {{influence}} over Māori in the north. Missionaries were appalled at the violent, seemingly arbitrary nature of Māori behaviour. They had no influence on warfare, <b>slavery,</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse of women, killing of female children or revenge killings. Cannibalism continued as before, except that increasingly Māori learnt to be less boastful about this act. However, by 1840, the custom was all but abolished.|$|R
5|$|With the {{assistance}} of hundreds of volunteers, Aruban investigators conducted an extensive search and rescue operation. American special agents from the FBI, fifty Dutch soldiers and three specially-equipped Dutch Air Force F-16 aircraft participated in the search. In addition to the ground search, divers searched the ocean floor for Holloway's body. Her remains were not found. On December 18, 2007, Aruban prosecutors announced that the case would be closed without any charges made. The Aruban prosecutor's office reopened the case on February 1, 2008, after receiving video footage of Van der Sloot, {{under the influence of}} marijuana, saying that Holloway died on the morning of her disappearance, and that a friend had disposed of her body. Van der Sloot later denied that what he had said was true, and in an interview said that he had sold Holloway into <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery.</b> He later retracted his comments. In 2012, Van der Sloot was convicted of the May 30, 2010, murder of Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru.|$|E
5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E

50|$|Sexual {{violence}} {{is often used}} as a tactic in war, and many women, particularly women from indigenous tribes, often become sex slaves to soldiers and are subjected to rape {{and other forms of}} sexual violence. When a community is occupied or destroyed, an entire community of women may be subjected to rape and <b>sexual</b> or domestic <b>slavery,</b> affecting the prosperity and health of the community after a conflict’s end.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} laws that {{touch on the}} theme of trafficking; {{historically}} the Ley Palacios of 1913 was the first law in the protection to protect victims of <b>sexual</b> exploitation and <b>slavery,</b> as well as to punish those responsible. It was the first legislation in the entire American continent and signified a great advance in human rights in the country.

5000|$|The female [...] "tragic octoroon" [...] was a stock {{character}} of abolitionist literature: a light-skinned woman raised as if {{a white woman}} in her father's household, until his bankruptcy or death has her reduced to a menial position and sold. She may even be unaware of her status before being so reduced. This character allowed abolitionists {{to draw attention to}} the <b>sexual</b> exploitation in <b>slavery,</b> and unlike the suffering of the field hands, did not allow slaveholders to retort that the sufferings of Northern mill hands were no easier, since the Northern mill owner would not sell his own children into slavery.|$|R

25|$|Widespread and {{systematic}} rape (e.g., war rape) and <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> can occur during international conflict. These practices are {{crimes against humanity}} and war crimes.

50|$|The Government of Nicaragua {{sustained}} modest {{efforts to}} combat human trafficking through law enforcement activities during the reporting period. Nicaragua criminalizes {{all forms of}} human trafficking. Article 182 of the Penal Code prohibits trafficking in persons {{for the purposes of}} <b>slavery,</b> <b>sexual</b> exploitation, and adoption, prescribing penalties of 7 to 10 years’ imprisonment. A separate statute, Article 315, prohibits the submission, maintenance, or forced recruitment of another person into slavery, forced labor, servitude, or participation in an armed conflict; this offense carries penalties of five to eight years imprisonment. These prescribed punishments are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.|$|R
50|$|The Redemptive Film Festival is {{not just}} {{interested}} in promoting redemptive films, {{but they are also}} actively involved in the process of redemption. Proceeds from the festival are donated to helping to rescue and empower the victims of modern-day slavery. Today there are more than 27 million slaves in the world, more than the number of people extracted from Africa throughout the 400 years of the slave trade. Towards this end, the Redemptive Film Festival partners with the International Justice Mission, a human rights agency that secures justice for victims of <b>slavery,</b> <b>sexual</b> exploitation and other forms of violent oppression. IJM lawyers, investigators and aftercare professionals work with local officials to ensure immediate victim rescue and aftercare, to prosecute perpetrators and to promote functioning public justice systems.|$|R
50|$|Rape laws in {{the south}} {{embodied}} a race-based double standard. Black men accused of rape {{during the colonial period}} were often punished with castration, and the penalty was increased to death during the antebellum period; however, white men could rape female slaves without fear of punishment. Men were also sexually abused by slaveholders. Thomas Foster says that although historians have begun to cover <b>sexual</b> abuse during <b>slavery,</b> few focus on sexual abuse of men because of the assumption that only enslaved women were victimized. Foster suggests that men may have also been forced into unwanted sexual activity; one problem in documenting such abuse is that men did not bear mixed-race children. Both masters and mistresses were thought to have abused male slaves.|$|R
