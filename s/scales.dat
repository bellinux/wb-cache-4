5|$|In reptiles, {{features}} of the <b>scales</b> are important in distinguishing among species and groups of species. In the Noronha skink, the supranasal <b>scales</b> (located above the nose) are in contact, as are the prefrontal <b>scales</b> (behind the nose) in most individuals. The two frontoparietal <b>scales</b> (above and slightly behind the eyes) are not fused. Unlike in T.maculata, the parietal <b>scales</b> (behind the frontoparietals) are in contact with each other. There are four supraocular <b>scales</b> (above the eyes) in almost all specimens and five supraciliary <b>scales</b> (immediately above the eyes, below the supraoculars). The dorsal <b>scales</b> (on the upperparts) have three keels, two fewer than in T.maculata. There are 34 to 40 (mode 38) midbody <b>scales</b> (counted around the body midway between the fore- and hindlimbs), 58 to 69 (mode 63–64) dorsal, and 66 to 78 (mode 70) ventral <b>scales</b> (on the underparts). Mabuya species and T.maculata generally have fewer midbody <b>scales</b> (up to 34). There are 21 to 29subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe, more than in T.maculata, which has 18. The Noronha skink has 26presacral vertebrae (located before the sacrum), similar to most Trachylepis, but unlike American Mabuya, which have at least 28.|$|E
5|$|In the holotype of C. casuarius, {{the sides}} and tail of the body are covered in <b>scales</b> of several types.

Separating the polygonal <b>scales</b> of C. casuarius are shieldlike <b>scales,</b> arranged close together in rows. Ossified tendons are present on all the vertebrae, except for those in the cervical region. On no vertebrae do the tendons extend below the transverse processes. Each tendon is flattened at its origin, and transversely ovoid in the central rod, ending at a rounded point.|$|E
