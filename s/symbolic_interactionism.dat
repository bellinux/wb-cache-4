5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, <b>Symbolic</b> <b>Interactionism,</b> and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> {{originated}} out {{of ideas}} of George Herbert Mead and Max Weber. In this framework meanings are constructed during social interaction, and constructed meanings influence {{the process of}} social interaction. Many symbolic interactionists see the self as a core meaning constructed through social relations, and influencing social relations.|$|E
25|$|McIntosh was {{critical}} of the orthodox view of criminology and in 1967 {{became one of the}} co-founders of the National Deviancy Symposium following the Third National Conference of Teaching and Research on Criminology at the University of Cambridge. Influenced by sociological approaches and American <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism,</b> the Symposium aimed to challenge dominant orthodoxies of crime and deviance and to instigate radical and critical approaches to criminology.|$|E
25|$|Process <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> {{stems from}} the Chicago School and {{considers}} the meanings underlying social interactions to be situated, creative, fluid, and often contested. Researchers in this tradition frequently use qualitative and ethnographic methods. A journal, Symbolic Interaction, was founded in 1977 by the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction as a central outlet for the empirical research and conceptual studies produced by scholars in this area.|$|E
25|$|Willard Motley, a {{resident}} artist of Hull House, extracting from Addams' central theory on <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism,</b> used {{the neighborhood and}} its people to write his 1948 best seller, Knock on Any Door. His novel later became a well known court-room film in 1949. This book and film brought attention to how {{a resident}} lived an everyday life inside a settlement house and his relationship with Jane Addams, herself.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{school of}} <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> uses shared social knowledge from a macro-level culture, natural language, social institution, or organization to explain relatively enduring patterns {{of social interaction}} and psychology at the micro-level, typically investigating these matters with quantitative methods. Identity theory, affect control theory, and the Iowa School are major programs of research in this tradition. Identity Theory and Affect Control Theory both focus on how actions control mental states, thereby manifesting the underlying cybernetic nature of the approach, evident in Mead's writings Affect Control Theory provides a mathematical model of role theory and of labeling theory.|$|E
25|$|A second {{exception}} {{is to be}} found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> in studying legal settings. This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science can address the content of legal practice.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{sociology}} expanded in the U.S., including developments in both macrosociology, {{concerned with the}} evolution of societies, and microsociology, concerned with everyday human social interactions. Based on the pragmatic social psychology of George Herbert Mead (1863–1931), Herbert Blumer (1900–1987) and, later, the Chicago school, sociologists developed <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism.</b> In the 1920s, György Lukács released History and Class Consciousness (1923), while a number of works by Durkheim and Weber were published posthumously. In the 1930s, Talcott Parsons (1902–1979) developed action theory, integrating the study of social order with the structural and voluntaristic aspects of macro and micro factors, while placing the discussion within a higher explanatory context of system theory and cybernetics. In Austria and later the U.S., Alfred Schütz (1899–1959) developed social phenomenology, which would later inform social constructionism. During the same period members of the Frankfurt school, such as Theodor W. Adorno (1903–1969) and Max Horkheimer (1895–1973), developed critical theory, integrating the historical materialistic elements of Marxism with the insights of Weber, Freud and Gramsci—in theory, if not always in name—often characterizing capitalist modernity as a {{move away from the}} central tenets of enlightenment.|$|E
500|$|By the 1980s, most functionalisms in Europe had broadly been {{replaced}} by conflict-oriented approaches and to many in the discipline, functionalism was considered [...] "as dead as a dodo." [...] "According to Giddens, the orthodox consensus terminated in the late 1960s and 1970s as the middle ground shared by otherwise competing perspectives gave way {{and was replaced by}} a baffling variety of competing perspectives. This third 'generation' of social theory includes phenomenologically inspired approaches, critical theory, ethnomethodology, <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism,</b> structuralism, post-structuralism, and theories written in the tradition of hermeneutics and ordinary language philosophy." ...|$|E
500|$|Goffman's book Strategic Interaction (1969) is his {{contribution}} to game theory. It discusses the compatibility of game theory with {{the legacy of the}} Chicago School of sociology and with the perspective of <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism.</b> It is one of his few works that clearly engage with that perspective. Goffman's view on game theory was shaped by the works of Thomas Schelling. Goffman presents reality as a form of game, and discusses its rules and the various moves that players can make (the [...] "unwitting", the [...] "naive", the [...] "covering", the [...] "uncovering", and the [...] "counter-uncovering") while trying to get or hide an information.|$|E
500|$|Urban {{sociology}} {{involves the}} analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making. After the industrial revolution, works such as Georg Simmel's The Metropolis and Mental Life (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The Chicago School produced a major body of theory {{on the nature of}} the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilizing <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> as a method of field research. Contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of globalization, for instance, in Saskia Sassen's study of the [...] "Global city". Rural sociology, by contrast, is {{the analysis of}} non-metropolitan areas. As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists.|$|E
500|$|The first {{college course}} {{entitled}} [...] "Sociology" [...] was {{taught in the}} United States at Yale in 1875 by William Graham Sumner. In 1883 Lester F. Ward, {{the first president of}} the American Sociological Association, published Dynamic Sociology—Or Applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences and attacked the laissez-faire sociology of Herbert Spencer and Sumner. Ward's 1200 page book was used as core material in many early American sociology courses. In 1890, the oldest continuing American course in the modern tradition began at the University of Kansas, lectured by Frank W. Blackmar. The Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago was established in 1892 by Albion Small, who also published the first sociology textbook: An introduction to the study of society 1894. George Herbert Mead and Charles Cooley, who had met at the University of Michigan in 1891 (along with John Dewey), would move to Chicago in 1894. Their influence gave rise to social psychology and the <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> of the modern Chicago School. The American Journal of Sociology was founded in 1895, followed by the American Sociological Association (ASA) in 1905. The sociological [...] "canon of classics" [...] with Durkheim and Max Weber at the top owes in part to Talcott Parsons, who is largely credited with introducing both to American audiences. Parsons consolidated the sociological tradition and set the agenda for American sociology at the point of its fastest disciplinary growth. Sociology in the United States was less historically influenced by Marxism than its European counterpart, and to this day broadly remains more statistical in its approach.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Frederick Suppe {{considered}} Sexual Preference a {{very important}} study that failed to duplicate the findings of Bieber et al. or the predictions of <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism,</b> labeling theory, and societal reaction theory approaches. Suppe considered Bell et al.′s sample of homosexuals, while highly biased, to nevertheless be the most representative ever made, and argued that biased samples can be adequate {{for the purposes of}} refuting theories propounded in other studies [...] "so long as the types of subjects used in those other studies constitute a subsample of the replicative study′s sample and the latter's population does not go beyond the claimed scope of the replicated studies." [...] He maintained that Bell et al.′s study meets these requirements, that their use of path analysis was appropriate, and that their procedures for developing a composite etiology model, which contained [...] "virtually all paths advanced in the literature", are legitimate. He argued that the only plausible basis for disputing that the study definitively refutes [...] "social learning theories of homosexual etiology" [...] is to challenge the adequacy of Bell et al.′s models and the questions they used. However, he questioned some of the details of Bell et al.′s methodology, including the questions asked. He wrote that while Bell et al. did not use the same specific questions that Bieber et al. employed, they did use [...] "questions directed at the same concerns." [...] He noted that Bell et al.′s data regarding subjects′ negative feelings toward and relationships with their fathers were based on open-ended interview questions, adding {{that it would have been}} preferable had they employed the same [...] "structured-answer questions" [...] used in Bieber et al.′s earlier study. He rejected Bell et al.′s claim that their study supports a biological explanation of sexual orientation. He wrote that since Bell et al.′s study, research into the [...] "social causes of homosexuality" [...] has become [...] "moribund." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{currents}} of theory in this area sprang from work by philosopher and sociologist George Herbert Mead at the University of Chicago from 1894 forward. [...] Mead generally is credited as the founder of <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism.</b> Mead's colleague and disciple at Chicago, sociologist Herbert Blumer, coined {{the name of the}} framework in 1937.|$|E
2500|$|Simmel {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{generation}} of German sociologists: his neo-Kantian approach laid the foundations for sociological antipositivism, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?', presenting pioneering analyses of social individuality and fragmentation. For Simmel, culture referred to [...] "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". Simmel discussed social and cultural phenomena in terms of [...] "forms" [...] and [...] "contents" [...] with a transient relationship; form becoming content, and vice versa, dependent on the context. In this sense he was a forerunner to structuralist styles of reasoning in the social sciences. With his work on the metropolis, Simmel was a precursor of urban sociology, <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> and social network analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Ibn Khaldun can be {{regarded}} as the earliest scientific systematic sociologist. The modern sociology, emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world. Among many early sociologists (e.g., Émile Durkheim), the aim of sociology was in structuralism, understanding the cohesion of social groups, and developing an [...] "antidote" [...] to social disintegration. Max Weber was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of rationalization, which he believed would trap individuals in an [...] "iron cage" [...] of rational thought. Some sociologists, including Georg Simmel and W. E. B. Du Bois, utilized more microsociological, qualitative analyses. This microlevel approach {{played an important role in}} American sociology, with the theories of George Herbert Mead and his student Herbert Blumer resulting in the creation of the <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> approach to sociology.|$|E
2500|$|American {{sociology}} in the 1940s and 1950s {{was dominated}} largely by Talcott Parsons, {{who argued that}} aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore [...] "functional". This structural functionalism approach was questioned in the 1960s, when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities present in the status quo. In reaction, conflict theory was developed, which was {{based in part on}} the philosophies of Karl Marx. Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which different groups compete for control over resources. <b>Symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> also came to be regarded as central to sociological thinking. Erving Goffman saw social interactions as a stage performance, with individuals preparing [...] "backstage" [...] and attempting to control their audience through impression management. While these theories are currently prominent in sociological thought, other approaches exist, including feminist theory, post-structuralism, rational choice theory, and postmodernism.|$|E
2500|$|A course {{entitled}} [...] "sociology" [...] {{was taught}} {{for the first}} time in the United States in 1875 by William Graham Sumner, drawing upon the thought of Comte and Herbert Spencer rather than the work of Durkheim. In 1890, the oldest continuing sociology course in the United States began at the University of Kansas, lectured by Frank Blackmar. The Department of History and Sociology at the University of Kansas was established in 1891 and the first full-fledged independent university department of sociology was established in 1892 at the University of Chicago by Albion W. Small (1854–1926), who in 1895 founded the American Journal of Sociology. American sociology arose on a broadly independent trajectory to European sociology. George Herbert Mead and Charles H. Cooley were influential in the development of <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> and social psychology at the University of Chicago, while Lester Ward emphasized the central importance of the scientific method with the publication of Dynamic Sociology in 1883.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> {{draws on}} the {{phenomenology}} of Edmund Husserl and George Herbert Mead, as well as subcultural theory and conflict theory. [...] This school of thought focused {{on the relationship between}} the powerful state, media, and conservative ruling elite and other less powerful groups. The powerful groups had the ability to become the [...] "significant other" [...] in the less powerful groups' processes of generating meaning. The former could to some extent impose their meanings on the latter; therefore they were able to [...] "label" [...] minor delinquent youngsters as criminal. These youngsters would often take on board the label, indulge in crime more readily, and become actors in the [...] "self-fulfilling prophecy" [...] of the powerful groups. Later developments in this set of theories were by Howard Becker and Edwin Lemert, in the mid-20th century. Stanley Cohen who developed the concept of [...] "moral panic" [...] describing societal reaction to spectacular, alarming social phenomena such as post-World War Two youth cultures (e.g. the Mods and Rockers in the UK in 1964, AIDS and football hooliganism).|$|E
5000|$|There {{are five}} central ideas to <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> {{according}} to Joel M. Charon, author of <b>Symbolic</b> <b>Interactionism</b> An Introduction, An Interpretation, An Integration: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> is “a micro- level {{theory in}} which shared meanings, originations, and {{assumptions}} form the basic motivations behind peoples’ actions." [...] In <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism,</b> face-to-face interaction creates the social world. Individuals act on perceived meanings {{that appear to}} be self-constituting. Group membership {{is one of the major}} determinations if individual interpretations of reality, which enables <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> to explain crime, and thus terrorism.|$|E
50|$|Many {{will claim}} that <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> has grown {{directly}} {{from the work of}} Thomas and Znaniecki. <b>Symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> grew out of structural functionalism. <b>Symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> views society as consisting of interactions among individuals. Hence the focus on individuals and the organization and patterns found in their everyday activities. It seeks to deal with problems like identity. Problems found in <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism,</b> such as inadequate analysis of social structure, led to a fork in the road of social science. The school of sociology most influenced by the humanistic model developed by Znaniecki and Thomas {{led to the development of}} ethnomethodology. The other branch led to post-modernism via poststructuralism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> is a sociological {{perspective}} {{which developed}} {{around the middle}} of the twentieth century and that continues to be influential in some areas of the discipline. It is particularly important in microsociology and social psychology. <b>Symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> is derived from the American philosophy of pragmatism and particularly from the work of George Herbert Mead. <b>Symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> is an American theory that develops from practical considerations and that alludes to people's particular utilization of dialect to make images, normal implications, for deduction and correspondence with others.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> {{is often}} related and {{connected}} with social structure. This concept suggests that <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> is a construction of people’s social reality. It also implies {{that from a}} realistic point of view, the interpretations {{that are being made}} will not make much difference. When the reality of a situation is defined, the situation becomes a meaningful reality. There are many aspects and factors that go into this theory. This includes methodological criticisms, and critical sociological issues. A number of symbolic interactionists have addressed these topics, the best known being Sheldon Stryker's structural <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> and the formulations of interactionism heavily influenced by this approach (sometimes referred to as the [...] "Indiana School" [...] of <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism),</b> including the works of key scholars in sociology and psychology using different methods and theories applying a structural version of interactionism that are represented in a 2003 collection edited by Burke et al. Another well-known structural variation of <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> that applies quantitative methods is Manford H.

5000|$|In 1975, Parsons {{responded to}} an article by Jonathan H. Turner, [...] "Parsons as a Symbolic Interactionist: A Comparison of Action and Interaction theory." [...] Parsons {{acknowledged}} that action theory and <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> should not be regarded as two separate, antagonistic positions but have overlapping structures of conceptualization. Parsons regarded <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> and the theory of George Herbert Mead as valuable contributions to action theory that specify {{certain aspects of the}} theory of the personality of the individual. Parsons, however, criticized the <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> of Herbert Blumer since Blumer's theory had no end to the openness of action. Parsons regarded Blumer as the mirror image of Claude Lévi-Strauss, who tended to stress the quasi-determined nature of macro-structural systems. Action theory, Parsons maintained, represented a middle ground between both extremes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> (SI), {{a phrase}} coined by Herbert Blumer {{as early as}} 1937, was derived from lectures of early {{philosophy}} and sociologist theorist George Herbert Mead’s student notes. Mead’s notes from a course he taught in social psychology were posthumously transcribed into the book Mind, Self, and Society; 1934. Mead, born in 1863, arguably {{laid the foundation for}} the <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> concept of how the individual mind arises out of the social process. Mead’s description of language as communication through significant symbols and concepts of “me” and “I” are examples of his contributions to symbolic behavior perspective. Symbolic behavior perspective stems from <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> perspective. Blumer (1962) summarizes the perspective as how people act towards things based on the meaning those things have for them. These meanings are derived from social interaction and modified through interpretation. The <b>symbolic</b> <b>interactionism</b> perspective relates to the organization by describing how employees form a concept of self in relationship to their organization as they interact with individuals, subordinates, and superiors within the organizational architecture. Individuals learn appropriate behavior within an organization as the code of values, roles, attitudes, and norms of behavior of that work environment become apparent (Wood, 1999).|$|E
