5000|$|Sung’s poems, {{generally}} involving abstract {{themes and}} ideas like much Korean poetry from the 50s an 60s, heavily employ the {{tool of the}} metaphor. In his famous poem “The Screw Bolt” (Nasa), the poet, according to one critic, employs the stray <b>screw</b> <b>bolt</b> {{as a metaphor for}} a lost soul, or a relic of civilization which, like a 'word out of context', must be reconciled with some sort of an organic order. These metaphors, so crucial to Sung’s poetry, go beyond the standard of a way of comparison, and comprise his fundamental orientation, as is expressed in his poem [...] "I Love Metaphors" [...] (Eunyureul saranghanda).|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} few years of wooden boat construction, glue and screws took over, but until the 1950s, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost, and perhaps transom would be {{fastened}} together by bolts set in white lead and grease. There are three kinds of bolt, of which, nowadays, the <b>screw</b> <b>bolt,</b> with its nut and washer, {{is by far the most}} common. The second type of bolt is the pin bolt or cotter bolt, which, instead of a thread, has a tapered hole forged through the end away from the head, into which a tapered pin or cotter is knocked. The taper is in effect a straight thread. In conjunction with a washer, this draws the bolt tight, as a nut does on a <b>screw</b> <b>bolt.</b> The third type of bolt is the clench bolt. It has some of the features of a rivet but was usually much longer than the normal rivet; in a wooden ship, perhaps a metre or more. For a shipwright's use, it is of copper. A head is formed by upsetting one end using a swage. It is then knocked through a hole bored through the work to be fastened, and through a washer. The head is held up with a dolly and the other end is upset over the washer in the same way as the head. Until well into the nineteenth century, this is what held the great ships of the world together, though some may have used iron. Until the late 1950s, the centre-line assembly of British Admiralty twenty-five foot motor cutters were fastened this way.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Neck Joint is a {{very special}} and mostly totally {{neglected}} sound influencing element. It is responsible for the dynamic and speed (Attack) of the bass and also for the string amplitude power consumption (Sustain). After comparing different constructions (identical wood from the same tree), I developed my ”Multi <b>screw</b> <b>Bolt</b> on Neck Joint”. I always use the maximum possible amount of screw per available area. If you compare this connection physically, you will identify a much faster attack, longer Sustain and a different mid-frequency-range of the instrument. If you compare this connection acoustically, you will recognize a better dynamic, a faster response and a greater presence within your band. The reason is a lower absorption of the string amplitude energy, because the absorption area (vibrations-system) is divided into 2 “oscillation-arms” with different lengths, which hardly move with the string frequency."

50|$|National Lockwasher owned U.S. Patent 1,655,018, which covered split-ring, compression-spring {{lock washers}} with a {{construction}} {{preventing them from}} interlinking with one another when handled in bulk. The washer accomplishes this by making the helical ring-shaped washer extend more than 360 degrees in circumference, cutting {{the ends of the}} washer so that the end faces make an angle with the top and bottom faces of the washer, and making the spaces between the ends of the washer smaller than the thickness of the washer stock but large enough to allow compression to flatten the washer. (If the space is smaller than the thickness (cross-section height) of the washer stock, one washer cannot pass through the end space of another washer and entangle it.) A lock washer is used to prevent a <b>screw,</b> <b>bolt,</b> or nut from loosening under vibration. It operates as a spring under compression having sufficient elasticity to neutralize the play between the assembled parts that vibration causes.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, fatigue {{strength}} of the engine damper cap <b>screw</b> <b>bolt</b> is determined. Engine damper cap screw is critical fastener. Critical fastener is a term used to describe a cap screw that, upon failure, causes immediate engine shutdown or possible harm to person. So, determination of {{fatigue strength}} is important. S-N method is used for cap screw fatigue strength determination by testing number of samples at different alternating load keeping mean load constant. Alternating load is increased until cap screws begin to fail. But for measurement of axial load in fasteners, ultrasonic bolt gauging method is used. It has been observed that fatigue failure takes place on the thread of cap <b>screw</b> <b>bolt</b> due to high stress concentration on the thread...|$|E

30|$|For a {{more clear}} issue, we {{consider}} {{how to move}} a bolt while being wound on a wooden surface. If a bit of pressure put on it {{just the tip of}} the bolt rotates (two-dimensional motion) on a wooden surface, and in this case, it just means a twirl. But if we put more pressure on it, along with the rotation of bolt tip, it can also penetrate into the wooden surface (third dimension of the transition can move perpendicular to the surface or not). Obviously, with increasing the pressure on the <b>screw</b> <b>bolt,</b> the bolt goes into the wood; and in this case, we see only a hole on the wooden surface. In this example, the rotary motion to add a transitional move can represent that torsion is more accurate. Note that the concepts of this example can be generalized to the super surface and space-time with the higher dimensions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} the model and simulation of dynamic cutting forces for high speed end mills, performed frequency spectrum analysis of dynamic cutting forces, and propounded the model and failure criterion of high speed end mills with indexable inserts. According to results of modal analysis and stress field analysis, the safety prediction and experiment of high speed end mills for machining aluminum alloy were done. Results indicate that more teeth of cutter and greater cutting contact angle make the energy more dispersible, higher cutting speed and greater rake of cutter can depress dynamic cutting forces. The rigidity failure rotational speed is higher the strength failure rotational speed, the connection strength between cutter body and <b>screw</b> <b>bolt</b> affects directly the safety of cutter. The model of high speed end mills based on spectrum simulation for dynamic cutting forces, and the safety prediction based on finite element analysis should {{be applied to the}} development of high speed end mills as an effective means...|$|E
40|$|The Fastener Starter is a {{creative}} solution {{to prevent the}} loss of small fasteners during their installation. This is the only currently available tool that can firmly grip and hold a single <b>screw,</b> <b>bolt,</b> nut, washer, spacer, or any combination of these parts. Other commercially available fastener starters are unable to accommodate a variety of parts simultaneously. The Fastener Starter is a more capable and easier tool to use than prior tools. Its compact size allows it to be used effectively in cramped, difficult-to-see locations. Its design also allows it {{to be used with}} or without handles and extenders in other difficult-to-reach locations. It provides better protection against cross threading and loss of fasteners and associated parts. The Fastener Starter is non-magnetic and does not off-gas, thus meeting flight hardware requirements. The Fastener Starter incorporates a combination of features of several commercially available tools, providing an improved means of installing small fasteners. The Fastener Starter includes a custom molded insert that can be removed easily and replaced with a conventional tool bit (e. g., a screwdriver or hex-driver bit). When used with the insert, the Fastener Starter prevents cross threading and damage to internal threaded holes. This is achieved by allowing the fastener to slip within the tool insert when used without a conventional tool bit. Alternatively, without the insert and with a tool bit, the Fastener Starter can torque a fastener. The Fastener Starter has a square recess hole that accepts a conventional square drive handle or extension to accommodate a variety of applications by providing flexibility in handle style and length...|$|E

40|$|We {{purified}} a {{large amount}} of dynamin with high enzymatical activity from rat brain tissue by a new procedure. Dynamin 0. 48 mg was obtained from 20 g of rat brain. The purity of dynamin was almost 98 %. Dynamin plays a role of GTPase rather than ATPase. In the absence of microtubules, Michaelis constant (Km) and maximum velocity (Vmax) for dynamin GTPase were 370 microM and 0. 25 min- 1, respectively, and in their presence, both were significantly accelerated up to 25 microM and 5. 5 min- 1. On the other hand, the ATPase activity was very low in the absence of microtubules, and even in their presence, Km and Vmax for dynamin ATPase were 0. 2 mM and 0. 91 min- 1. Despite slow GTPase turnover rate in the absence of microtubules, binding of GTP and its nonhydrolizing analogues was very fast, indicating that GTP binding step is not rate limiting. Dynamin did not cause a one-directional consistent microtubule sliding movement just like kinesin or dynein in the presence of 2 mM ATP or 2 mM GTP. We observed the molecular structure of dynamin with low-angle rotary shadowing technique and revealed that the dynamin molecule is globular in shape. Gel filtration assay revealed that these globules were the oligomers of 100 -kDa dynamin polypeptide. Dynamin bound to microtubules with a 1 : 1 approximately 1. 2 molar ratio in the absence of GTP. Quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy of the dynamin-microtubule complex showed that dynamin decorates the surface of microtubules helically, like a <b>screw</b> <b>bolt,</b> very orderly and tightly with 11. 4 +/- 0. 9 (SD) nm period. Contrary to the previous report, microtubules make bundles by the attachment of the dynamin helixes around each adjacent microtubule, and no cross-bridge formation was observed...|$|E
