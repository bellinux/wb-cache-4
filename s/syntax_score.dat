40|$|Aims: The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> {{is a tool}} to {{quantify}} the complexity of coronary artery disease. We investigated {{the relation between the}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and the occurrence of a periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) according to the historical definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the recently updated universal definition of MI. Methods and results: The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was calculated in 1, 243 patients enrolled in TWENTE, a randomised trial which assessed second-generation drug-eluting stents. PMI was defined by the WHO definition and the third universal definition of MI. Patients were divided into tertiles of the SYNTAX score: ≤ 7 (n= 430); > 7 and < 15 (n= 390); ≥ 15 (n= 423). PMI according to the WHO definition occurred more frequently in patients in the highest <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> tertile (7. 3 % vs. 3. 1 % vs. 1. 6 %, p< 0. 001) compared to the mid and lowest tertile. Similar findings were seen for universal PMI (9. 9 % vs. 7. 7 % vs. 3. 7 %, p< 0. 01). After multivariate analysis, <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was a significant independent correlate of PMI for both definitions: the highest <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> tertile had an almost five times higher risk for WHO PMI, and a three times higher risk for universal PMI.

40|$|Abstract Background: The revascularization {{strategy}} of the left main disease is determinant for clinical outcomes. Objective: We sought to 1) validate and compare {{the performance of the}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 1 and 2 for predicting major cardiovascular events at 4 years in patients who underwent unprotected left main angioplasty and 2) evaluate the long-term outcome according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> 2 -recommended revascularization strategy. Methods: We retrospectively studied 132 patients from a single-centre registry who underwent unprotected left main angioplasty between March 1999 and December 2010. Discrimination and calibration of both models were assessed by ROC curve analysis, calibration curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results: Total event rate was 26. 5 % at 4 years. The AUC for the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 1 and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 for percutaneous coronary intervention, was 0. 61 (95 % CI: 0. 49 - 0. 73) and 0. 67 (95 % CI: 0. 57 - 0. 78), respectively. Despite a good overall adjustment for both models, the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 tended to underpredict risk. In the 47 patients (36 %) who should have undergone surgery according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2, event rate was numerically higher (30 % vs. 25 %; p= 0. 54), and for those with a higher difference between the two <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 scores (Percutaneous coronary intervention vs. Coronary artery by-pass graft risk estimation greater than 5. 7 %), event rate was almost double (40 % vs. 22 %; p= 0. 2).

40|$|Aim. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether the automated carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) identified by using automated software could predict the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> for coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Methods. Three-hundred-seventy consecutive patients (males 218; median age 69 11 years) who underwent carotid-ultrasound and coronary angiography were analyzed. Two experienced interventional cardiologists calculated the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> from the carotid angiograms. After ultrasonographic examinations were performed, the plaque score (PS) was calculated and automated carotid IMT analysis was obtained by a fully automated algorithm. Correlation and stepwise logistic regression analysis were calculated and also the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was computed. Results. The mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was 8. 1 +/- 14. 4; the PS was 7. 1 +/- 14. 4 and the mean CIMT was 0. 86 +/- 0. 23 mm (Normality rejected with a P-value of 0. 001). A statistically significant correlation was found between the CIMT and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (r= 0. 323; P= 0. 0001) and between the PS and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (r= 0. 583; P= 0. 0001). The area under the ROC curve (Az) between CIMT and coronary artery disease was 0. 648 (P= 0. 0001) and the CIMT of 1 mm or more was associated with the presence coronary artery disease with a specificity of 90. 5 %. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the association between CIMT and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (P= 0. 0002). Conclusions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> is a lesion-based {{angiographic}} scoring system, originally {{devised to}} grade the anatomic complexity of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) and thereby facilitate consensus {{in the study of}} a diagnostic angiogram between surgeons and interventional cardiologists. Suitable biology marker to predict the severity of CAD and to have a treatment decision for revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or bypass surgery, is still unknown. Which biology marker can be a predictor for higher <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> remains unknown as well. METHODS: Severity of 105 patients who underwent coronary angiography, were evaluated with <b>Syntax</b> <b>score.</b> Laboratory tests were conducted for routine blood test, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney function, creatinine and hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c). RESULTS: Ureum had significant correlation with <b>Syntax</b> <b>score,</b> p= 0. 016 and 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 05 - 0. 55. Result of logistic regression analysis showed that HDL and haematocrit had significant correlation with <b>Syntax</b> <b>score,</b> with cut off point 34 (p= 0. 02, p= 0. 0033, respectively). Based on multi-variate analysis, <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> 34 = 16 (HDL ≤ 40 + Ureum ≥ 23) + 10 (Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ≥ 3. 789) + 10 (HbA 1 c ≥ 7) + 13 (monocyte ≥ 9 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: There {{are limited}} data {{comparing}} long-term outcomes of {{coronary artery bypass}} graft surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) in patients with high surgical risk. We evaluated 5 -year outcomes following CABG versus PCI with DES in 598 patients with left main or multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and a high surgical risk [EuroSCORE (European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation) >= 6]. METHODS: Databases were merged from the BEST, PRECOMBAT and SYNTAX trials. The primary outcome was a major adverse cardio-cerebral event (MACCE), defined as the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke or repeat revascularization. RESULTS: During 5 -year follow-up, the rates of MACCE were 29. 4 % in the CABG group and 43. 8 % in the PCI group [hazard ratio (HR), 0. 64; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 49 - 0. 84; P = 0. 001]. The MACCE was significantly better with CABG than with PCI in patients with high and intermediate <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> (34. 9 % vs 46. 3 %, P = 0. 039, and 29. 7 % vs 47. 6 %, P = 0. 010, respectively), but comparable between the two groups in those with low <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores.</b> The rates of all-cause death and stroke were similar between the two groups. However, CABG was associated with fewer myocardial infarctions (HR, 0. 50; 95 % CI, 0. 27 - 0. 93; P = 0. 027) and repeat revascularizations (HR, 0. 32; 95 % CI, 0. 20 - 0. 52; P < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Percutaneous {{coronary}} intervention (PCI) is {{a necessary}} procedure commonly performed for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the impact of diabetes and hypertension on long-term outcomes of patients after receiving PCI {{has not yet been}} determined. Methods The data of 1234 patients who received PCI were collected prospectively, and patients were divided into four groups, including patients with and without DM and those with either DM or hypertension alone. Baseline characteristics, risk factors, medications and angiographic findings were compared and determinants of cardiovascular outcomes were analyzed in patients who received PCI. Results Patients with DM alone had the highest all-cause mortality (P 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001), cardiovascular mortality and myocardial infarctions (MI) (both P 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 01) compared to the other groups. However, no differences were found between groups in repeat PCI (P 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 32). Cox proportional hazard model revealed that age, chronic kidney disease (CKD), previous MI and stroke history were risk factors for all-cause mortality (OR: 1. 05, 1. 89, 2. 87, and 4. 12, respectively), and use of beta-blockers (BB) and statins reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0. 47 and 0. 35, respectively). Previous MI and stroke history, P 2 Y 12 inhibitor use, and <b>syntax</b> <b>scores</b> all predicted CV mortality (OR: 4. 02, 1. 89, 2. 87, and 1. 04, respectively). Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), beta-blockers (BB), and statins appeared to reduce risk of CV death (OR: 0. 37, 0. 33, and 0. 32, respectively). Previous MI and <b>syntax</b> <b>scores</b> predicted MI (OR: 3. 17 and 1. 03, respectively), and statin use reduced risk of MI (OR: 0. 43). Smoking and BB use were associated with repeat PCI (OR: 1. 48 and 1. 56, respectively).

The objective {{of this study is to}} determine plasma levels of miR- 10 a in CAD and analyze its association with the severity of CAD. Materials and Methods. Plasma miR- 10 a levels in 60 CAD patients including stable angina pectoris (SAP) (n= 29), unstable angina pectoris (UAP) or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI) (NSTEMI) (n= 17), or ST elevation MI (STEMI) (n= 14) and 20 non-CAD subjects were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and associations of miR- 10 a levels with risk factors of CAD and its severity were analyzed. Results. The qRT-PCR results showed that plasma miR- 10 a levels were decreased in CAD patients, and CAD with high <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> or STEMI was significantly associated with lower miR- 10 a levels. Conclusions. Lower plasma miR- 10 a levels were negatively associated with the presence as well as severity of CAD, and plasma miR- 10 a can act as a potential biomarker for estimating the presence and severity of CAD...|$|R

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the expres-sion level of vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) in the aortic tissues of atherosclerotic patients and to explore the associated clinical implications. Full-thickness aortic wall tissue samples were collected from atherosclerotic patients. Biochemical analysis was used for the detection of the serum levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a) ], apolipoprotein (Apo) AI and Apo-B. Coronary angiography and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scoring</b> were used to determine the extent and severity of the disease. Immunohistochemistry was employed for the detec-tion of the VCAM- 1 protein expression levels in the arterial tissues. Significant differences were observed in the blood lipid levels between atherosclerotic patients and control subjects. Immunohistochemistry indicated that the aortic VCAM- 1 expression level in atherosclerotic patients was 0. 23 ± 0. 06 optical density (OD)   units,  which was significantly higher than that in the control subjects (0. 08 ± 0. 03 OD units).

40|$|ObjectiveThe SYNergy between {{percutaneous}} {{intervention with}} TAXus drug eluting stents and cardiac surgery (<b>SYNTAX)</b> <b>Score</b> {{is a tool}} for risk stratification of patients according {{to the complexity of}} coronary lesions developed during the SYNTAX trial. We examined the influence of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> on the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. MethodsAll patients with de novo left main or 3 -vessel disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting from January 2005 to December 2008 at our institution (Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain) were retrospectively assessed, and their <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was calculated. The influence of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> on postprocedural and follow-up mortality and combined major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (including death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and repeat revascularization) was identified by multivariate analysis. Balancing score analysis was performed to eliminate the effect of potential confounders. ResultsA total of 716 patients were enrolled. Mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was 34. 5 (standard deviation, 6. 7; range,  11. 5 – 76). Three groups of patients were identified according to the score terciles: low (≤ 33), intermediate (33 – 37), and high (> 37). These terciles scores differed greatly from those reported by the SYNTAX trial investigators. The multivariate analysis identified that the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was associated with follow-up mortality (hazard ratio =  1. 046, P = . 015) and combined early and follow-up major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio =  1. 079, P < . 001; and hazard ratio =  1. 034, P = . 026, respectively). Balancing score-adjusted analyses demonstrated that the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was independently associated with early and late major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio =  1. 65, P < . 001; and hazard ratio =  1. 034, P = . 027, respectively). ConclusionsSYNTAX Score was remarkably high among patients undergoing surgical off-pump myocardial revascularization at our institution. In this subset of patients, a higher <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was associated with a higher incidence of in-hospital and follow-up major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events after coronary artery bypass grafting, but not with early or late mortality...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundPercutaneous {{coronary}} intervention (PCI) is {{well established}} procedure for management of coronary artery disease. However, up to 50 % of cases associated with myocardial injury with subsequent increased mortality. Currently there is no reliable method to predict this injury. Aim of the workto investigate {{the ability of the}} <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> to predict peri-procedure myocardial injury (PMI) in patients undergoing PCI. Patients and Methods: This study included 60 patients. They are divided into two groups (1 =Non-diabetics) and (2 =Diabetics) and subjected to: History and physical examination, ECG, echocardiography, calculation of <b>syntax</b> <b>score,</b> PCI and troponin T. ResultsOur study shows highly significant elevation in the troponin level in both groups after PCI, this elevation was more in group (2) (< 0. 001). In all study population the incidence of PMI was low in patients with low <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> and increased proportionally with the increase in <b>syntax</b> <b>score.</b> We found the <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> cutoff value for prediction of PMI to be 15 with calculated sensitivity of 95. 3 %, specificity 88. 2 %, predictive value positive 95. 3 % and Predictive value negative 88. 2 %. ConclusionSyntax score has the ability to predict the occurrence of PMI with accepted sensitivity. It can assess the patient risk for development of PMI which could help to rationalize the use of adjunctive therapies as distal embolic protection devices in high risk patients. Also, diabetic patients have higher incidence of complicated coronary lesions, higher <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> and they are more labile for PMI...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTBACKGROUNDThe <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was {{developed}} as an angiographic tool to grade {{the complexity of}} coronary artery disease in patients with three-vessel and/or left main disease. We evaluated its role in predicting clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in non-selected patients, treated in the daily clinical practice of a reference center. METHODSAnalysis of patients undergoing PCI from March to September 2009 and followed-up for up to 12 months. Patients were divided in tertiles according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> The primary endpoint included major adverse cardiac events (MACE) – death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and target-vessel revascularization. The ability of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> in predicting MACE was assessed by the ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) curve. RESULTSTwo hundred and thirty-four patients with a mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> of 11. 6 ± 6. 2 points were included. Tertile I had a <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 9 (average 5. 9); tertile II, > 9 and≤ 13 (average 10. 8); and tertile III, > 13 (average 18. 3). In the clinical follow-up of 7. 2 ± 4. 9 months, the incidence of MACE was greater in tertile III when compared to tertiles I and II (2. 5 % vs. 6. 4 % vs. 14. 1 %; P= 0. 0075). The ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0. 667 (P= 0. 012) indicating a moderate ability to anticipate the occurrence of MACE in this population. CONCLUSIONSThe <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> proved to be useful in predicting the occurrence of MACE after PCI in real world patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Trace {{elements}} such as manganese {{have an important role}} in the maintenance of the normal structure and physiology of cells. Manganese is involved in many biological processes. Therefore, an evaluation of the manganese in the atherosclerotic disease is important. Materials and Methods: In this cross sectional study, 334 subjects, without recent cardiac event and history of collagen vascular or infectious disease were investigated. All patients divided into 4 groups to evaluate severity of coronary artery disease according to <b>Syntax</b> <b>scoring</b> system. All groups were matched in cardiovascular risk factors. Results: The serum level of manganese in normal coronary group was 1. 47 ± 0. 23 µg/L and in total atherosclerotic groups was 1. 06 ± 0. 37 µg/L. The serum level of manganese was significantly lower in total atherosclerotic groups than normal group (p= 0. 001) and significantly decreased with severity of atherosclerosis. The serum level of manganese was significantly lower in sever atherosclerosis patients than mild and moderate coronary artery disease groups (p= 0. 001). Conclusion: The finding indicated that the serum level of manganese is lower in atherosclerotic patients and it decreases with severity of atherosclerosis. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Diabetes {{mellitus}} increases {{adverse outcomes}} after coronary revascularization; however, {{the impact of}} metabolic syndrome is unclear. We examined the impact of diabetes and metabolic syndrome on {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery (CABG) and stenting outcomes to determine the optimal revascularization option for the treatment of complex coronary artery disease. METHODS: Patients (n = 1, 800) with left main or three-vessel disease or both were randomly allocated to treatment with a TAXUS Express(2) paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) or CABG, and were included in predefined nondiabetic (n = 1, 348) or diabetic subgroups (n = 452); 258 patients with diabetes also had metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: Among diabetic patients, the 3 -year major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) rate (22. 9 % CABG, 37. 0 % PES; p = 0. 002) and revascularization rate (12. 9 % CABG, 28. 0 % PES; p < 0. 001) were higher after PES treatment. Diabetes increased MACCE rates among PES-treated patients, but had little impact on results after CABG. Compared with CABG, PES treatment yielded comparable MACCE in diabetic patients (30. 5 % versus 29. 8 %, p = 0. 98) and nondiabetic patients (20. 2 % versus 20. 3 %, p = 0. 99) with low Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (<b>SYNTAX)</b> study <b>scores</b> of 22 or less. For patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Scores</b> of 33 or greater, MACCE rates were lower with CABG (18. 5 % versus 45. 9 %, p < 0. 001 diabetic; 19. 8 % versus 30. 0 %, p = 0. 01 nondiabetic). Metabolic syndrome did not significantly predict MACCE or repeat revascularization. CONCLUSIONS: These exploratory analyses suggest that among diabetic patients with complex left main or three-vessel disease, or both, 3 -year MACCE is higher after PES compared with CABG. Although PES is a potential treatment option in patients with less complex lesions, CABG should be the revascularization option of choice for patients with more complex anatomic disease, especially with concurrent diabetes. Metabolic syndrome had little impact on 3 -year outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Aims To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and Clinical <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (CSS) to predict very long-term outcomes in an all-comers population receiving drug-eluting stents. Methods and results The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was retrospectively calculated in 848 patients enrolled in the SIRolimus-eluting stent compared with pacliTAXel-Eluting Stent for coronary revascularization (SIRTAX) trial. The CSS was calculated using age, and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction and creatinine clearance. A stratified post hoc comparison was performed for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), definite stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1 - and 5 -year follow-up. Tertiles for <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and CSS were defined as SSLOW ≤ 7, 7 14 and CSSLOW ≤ 8. 0, 8. 0 17. 0, respectively. Major adverse cardiac events rates were significantly higher in SSHIGH compared with SSLOW at 1 - and 5 -year follow-up, which was also seen at 5 years for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and TLR. Stratifying outcomes across CSS tertiles confirmed and augmented these results. Within CSSHIGH, 5 -year MACE increased with use of paclitaxel- compared with sirolimus-eluting stents (34. 7 vs. 21. 3 %, P= 0. 008). <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and CSS were independent predictors of 5 -year MACE; CSS was an independent predictor for 5 -year mortality. Areas-under-the-curve for <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and CSS for 5 -year MACE were 0. 61 (0. 56 - 0. 65) and 0. 62 (0. 57 - 0. 67), for 5 -year all-cause mortality 0. 58 (0. 51 - 0. 65) and 0. 66 (0. 59 - 0. 73) and for 5 -year cardiac death 0. 63 (0. 54 - 0. 72) and 0. 72 (0. 63 - 0. 81), respectively.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between HbA 1 c levels and the complexity of coronary artery lesions among the older patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled a total of 3805 consecutive type 2 DM patients aged 60 years and older who underwent their first elective coronary angiography and had their HbA 1 c levels measured at the Chinese PLA General Hospital between December 2005 and December 2012. The complexity of the coronary artery lesions was evaluated using the <b>Syntax</b> <b>score,</b> and the subjects were divided into three groups according to their HbA 1 c levels. Logistic regression and Pearson correlation were used to analyze the association between the measured HbA 1 c levels and <b>Syntax</b> <b>score.</b> RESULTS: The mean age was 72. 3 ± 10. 6 years. The higher HbA 1 c levels were significantly associated with higher <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> (p< 0. 001). The unadjusted correlation coefficient of HbA 1 c levels and the <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> was 0. 371 (p< 0. 001). In addition, the higher HbA 1 c categories were able to independently predict patients with intermediate or high <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> (<b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> ≥ 23) after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia and creatinine levels in the logistic regression analysis.

METHODS: Three-hundred-seventy consecutive patients (males 218; median age 69 ± 11 years) who underwent carotid-ultrasound and coronary angiography were analyzed. Two experienced interventional cardiologists calculated the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> from the carotid angiograms. After ultrasonographic examinations were performed, the plaque score (PS) was calculated and automated carotid IMT analysis was obtained by a fully automated algorithm. Correlation and stepwise logistic regression analysis were calculated and also the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was computed. RESULTS: The mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was 8. 1 ± 14. 4; the PS was 7. 1 ± 14. 4 and the mean CIMT was 0. 86 ± 0. 23 mm (Normality rejected with a P-value of 0. 001).

In {{this study we}} evaluate differences for males (M) and females (F) in 2 -year target lesion failure (TLF) in an unselected consecutive series of patients treated with everolimus-eluting stents (EES) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) at a tertiary medical center. Methods: Data on 348 consecutive patients (M 221, F 127) stented with EES and PES were retrospectively analyzed. The primary end point {{of the study was}} to compare sex-related outcomes in TLF, defined as the combined end point of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization (TLR). Secondary end points included TLR, target vessel failure, target vessel revascularization, acute stent thrombosis as defined by the Academic Research Consortium, and cardiac death. The cineangiograms of the first consecutive 162 patients (M 105, F 57) were independently reviewed by a cardiologist blinded to clinical outcome, and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scoring</b> was performed. Follow-up was achieved using medical records and/or phone calls and was censored at 2 years. Descriptive analysis was performed on all variables. Univariate analysis compared the M and F cohorts. Multivariate analysis using Cox regression was performed to determine independent predictors of TLF with time, including sex as an independent variable in the model. Results: M had more prior percutaneous coronary interventions and restenotic lesions and a higher prevalence of smoking. They also had longer length of disease and received more stents than F. F were older and had a higher prevalence of prior stroke. Angiographic complexity was not statistically different between the two groups, as judged by <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scoring</b> (M 20. 8 ± 13. 8, F 19. 7 ± 13. 9, P= 0. 650). At 2 -year follow-up, TLF was 27. 4 % and 24. 8 % (P= 0. 614) with no statistical difference between TLR (23. 3 % versus [vs] 21. 6 %), cardiac death (2. 8 % vs 3. 2 %), and definite and probable stent thrombosis (2. 3 % vs 0. 0 %) in M and F, respectively. Cox regression analysis using backward elimination showed that the number of stents per patient was the only independent predictor of TLF with time (hazard ratio 1. 201, 95 % confidence interval 1. 126 – 1. 280, P= 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is {{the most}} {{important}} cause of mortality in the world. About half of cardiovascular risk factors have not been completely understood. Oxidation of LDL by oxidants such as iron plays a central role in atherogenesis. As a result, evaluation of the iron stores is important in the risk evaluation of the atherosclerotic disease. Materials and Methods: This cross sectional study was performed on 337 patients with chronic stable angina hospitalized in Sari heart center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences from February 2010 to July 2012. Coronary angiography was performed and the angiograms were evaluated by two cardiologists. Moreover, blood samples were collected after a 14 -hour fast immediately before the coronary angiography in order to measure the total cholesterol, HDL- cholesterol, and glucose. The patients were divided into four groups to evaluate the severity of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) according to <b>Syntax</b> <b>scoring</b> system. Results: The study results revealed a significant difference among the four study groups regarding the iron serum level. It was significantly higher in the sever atherosclerosis group compared to the normal (P= 0. 0122), mild (P= 0. 023), and moderate CAD groups (P< 0. 001). Conclusions: The findings indicated that the serum level of iron was higher in the atherosclerotic patients and increased with the severity of CAD. Therefore, a basic relationship probably exists between the serum iron level and CAD.
