She also attempts to buy an apartment located above hers. Meanwhile, Jack falls for two women and is forced to choose one of them - his high school sweetheart (Julianne Moore), or <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is similarly successful as him (Elizabeth Banks) while trying to impress the Kabletown executives.|$|E

Johnson, {{director of the}} Maine Office of Substance Abuse http://www.maine.gov/dhhs/osa/, after she had seen Salvia divinorum on sale in her home town of Gorham. Johnson indicated {{that she would not}} be satisfied with only the enforcement of age restrictions to control salvia, asserting—"This drug is just as dangerous to <b>someone</b> <b>who's</b> 30 as <b>someone</b> <b>who's</b> 17". http://bangordailynews.com/news/t/news.aspx?articleid=144637&zoneid=500 ...|$|R
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist is <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> {{is certain}} that God does not exist, <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
5|$|According to Dasgupta, {{the term}} yoga {{can be derived}} from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). <b>Someone</b> <b>who</b> {{practices}} yoga or follows the yoga philosophy {{with a high level of}} commitment is called a yogi (may be applied to a man or a woman) or yogini (traditionally denoting a woman).|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the iconic}} cowboy, gunfighters {{have become a}} {{cultural}} image of the American people abroad, and also as an idealized image of violence, frontier justice, and adventure. Even outside of the Western genre, the term 'gunslinger' {{has been used in}} modern times to describe <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is fast and accurate with pistols, either in real life or in other fictional action genre.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th-century, the act {{of suicide}} had shifted from being viewed as caused by sin to being caused by {{insanity}} in Europe. Although suicide remained illegal during this period, it increasingly became the target of satirical comments, such as the Gilbert and Sullivan musical The Mikado that satirized the idea of executing <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> had already killed himself.|$|E
5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because {{at that time in}} the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{experiment}} with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the Jain scholar Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai. Rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion. Gandhi began abstaining from cow's milk in 1912, {{and did so}} even when doctors advised him to consume milk. According to Sankar Ghose, Tagore described Gandhi as <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> did not abhor sex or women, but considered sexual life as inconsistent with his moral goals.|$|E

5|$|In Ancient Rome {{people did}} not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> was {{affected}}. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|John Surratt stood {{trial in}} Washington in 1867.

The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian's {{candidacy}} {{for the head}} coaching job at Notre Dame was unusual {{because he was not}} a Notre Dame graduate, as every head coach since Knute Rockne had been. Parseghian was also an Armenian Presbyterian, making him the first non-Catholic coach since Rockne, who converted in 1925. Joyce made it clear before his hiring that he did not care about Parseghian's religion, but simply wanted <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> could lead the football team to success.|$|E

5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{criticism}} of Eddy is considerable. She {{is portrayed as}} greedy, uneducated and deceitful, <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> regularly revised her life story and was interested only in making money. The authors produce witness statements from Eddy's childhood alleging that she engaged in repeated fainting spells to gain attention or avoid punishment, particularly from her father, and that, as an adult, she developed a habit of appearing to be seriously ill only to recover quickly.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, {{there is no}} cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E
