500|$|After the Lakers {{lost to the}} Houston Rockets in {{the first}} round of the playoffs, Johnson {{initially}} expressed a desire to return to the team for the 1996–97 NBA season, but he also talked about joining another team as a free agent, hoping to see more playing time at point guard instead of power forward. A few days later Johnson changed his mind and retired permanently, saying, [...] "I am going out on my terms, something I couldn't <b>say</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> aborted a comeback in 1992." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} its sexually {{explicit}} nature, the singer responded: [...] "Erm, yeah. I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to <b>say.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E
2500|$|I must <b>say</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> bowled at Len I felt a {{sense of}} {{personal}} grudge I have never known against any other batsman. [...] Ray did too. I suppose Len suffered a greater barrage from the two of us than any other player in the world. We both put in that little bit extra against Len, and he had to take it time after time... he had a poker face and never expressed either elation or disappointment. I tried my wickedest bumpers, hoping that I would have the satisfaction of seeing him look scared.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What ails you, Cathy?' he was <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> entered: 'you look as dismal as a drowned whelp. Why {{are you so}} {{damp and}} pale, child?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is some queer-looking animal of {{whom they}} {{say that he is}} better than he looks, and I always think of that <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think of my uncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, la, la!" [...] she laughed. [...] "That's what Sidney <b>says</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> tease him. I know I am {{only the}} mouse, but I could gnaw through very strong cords. Look!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In October 1941, {{her husband}} wrote, [...] "Certainly {{more than a}} {{thousand}} people are murdered in this way every day, and another thousand German men are habituated to murder... What shall I <b>say</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am asked: And what did you do during that time?" [...] In the same letter he said, [...] "Since Saturday the Berlin Jews are being rounded up. Then they are sent off with what they can carry.... How can anyone know these things and walk around free?" [...] In 1941 von Moltke gave birth to their second son, Konrad, at Kreisau.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} incident, Yang Biao (楊彪), the Grand Commandant, {{was arrested and}} imprisoned for {{allegedly}} conspiring with Yuan Shu, a warlord who rebelled against the Eastern Han dynasty. Man Chong, {{who was in charge}} of interrogating Yang Biao, received requests from his colleagues Xun Yu and Kong Rong to refrain from using torture on Yang Biao during the interrogation. However, Man Chong ignored them and did everything by the book. A few days later, Man Chong reported to Cao Cao: [...] "Yang Biao had nothing to <b>say</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> interrogated him. Before executing a criminal, we must first produce evidence of his guilt and show it to the public. Yang Biao is a reputable man. If we execute him without sufficient evidence to show that he is guilty, the people will lose faith in us. I hope you will reconsider your decision carefully and not be too hasty in ordering Yang Biao's execution." [...] Cao Cao then released Yang Biao. Xun Yu and Kong Rong were initially angry with Man Chong when they found out that he tortured Yang Biao during the interrogation. However, they became more amiable towards him after they heard what he told Cao Cao.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gee, boss! There's bin doin's to-night fer fair. Me coco's still buzzin'. Sure t'ing! Why, <b>say,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was to Sir Tummas' dressin'-room dis afternoon--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “But I {{dare not}} stay ashore all night alone,” Maud was <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{came back to}} myself. “It {{would be so much}} nicer if he would be {{friendly}} with us and help us. We could all live comfortably aboard.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what <b>I</b> <b>says</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heerd on it!" [...] {{said the}} landlord, and I {{found that for}} one poor soul at least this world had proved excessive, {{and there had been}} a throat-cutting. I went on with a new twist to my thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|... '--Of shoes, sir,' said Giles, turning upon him, {{and laying}} great {{emphasis}} on the word; 'seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room. [...] "Brittles," [...] <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had woke him, [...] "don't be frightened!"' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. Therefore, I {{call upon}} you both--as I {{was about to}} <b>say</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was {{interrupted}} by my clerk--to find bail.' 'Good bail,' whispered Mr. Jinks.|$|E
6000|$|... "What did I <b>say,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came in?" [...] Miss Ladd asked. [...] "Speak out plainly; and try--it's not easy, I know--but try {{to begin}} at the beginning." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked at}} her sternly, and answered: [...] "I have said all upon that point that is {{necessary}} to <b>say.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> love a woman, I love her forever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> may be back. It may {{be three}} nights, {{it may be}} six, or, for all that I know, it may be longer than that. You may be sure that if I get a clue I shall follow it up {{wherever}} it leads me." ...|$|R
60|$|That was {{excellently}} observed, <b>say</b> <b>I,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> read {{a passage}} in an author, where his opinion agrees with mine. When we differ, there I pronounce him to be mistaken.|$|R
5000|$|Rohal <b>says</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{looked around}} and saw {{different}} paths of the Beloved, ...|$|R
6000|$|What shall I <b>say</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come there? You shall speak {{her soft}} and fair: See - you shall say - the love they send To greet their unforgotten friend! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must believe}} what I <b>say</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{tell you that}} there never was another woman; that there is nothing for me to regret, and nothing but my enemies to remember." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what I thought. But I {{decided that}} first I {{would listen to}} what the two men had to <b>say.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> got closer to the pair I made another discovery.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not that I am vain of it, now, you mocking boy,' she <b>says,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> smile; 'but {{because you}} used to say you thought it so beautiful; and because, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first {{began to think about}} you, I used to peep in the glass, and wonder whether you would like very much to have a lock of it. Oh what a foolish fellow you were, Doady, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> gave you one!' ...|$|R
60|$|Be {{it enough}} to <b>say,</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went back to Browndown, Lucilla went with me.|$|R
60|$|LORD LOAM. A {{very fine}} boy. <b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>saying</b> so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw him; nice little fellow.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sir,' {{replied the}} wit, 'you're very welcome, I'm sure. The honour is reciprocal, sir, as I usually <b>say</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> dramatise a book. Did {{you ever hear}} a {{definition}} of fame, sir?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got {{to it at}} last, an' now we'll {{see what}} Teddy an' Dan have to <b>say</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> flash the whole lot of stuff up with nobody to help me. I reckon----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary {{can spare}} you,--and I cannot. Mary is staying with you, and I shall be gone,--almost immediately. I {{go back to}} Newton to-morrow, and who can <b>say</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> shall see you again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be nice, but I haven't {{anyone to}} do so for me. Papa is too busy, and Mama always <b>says</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ask question, 'Don't trouble your head with such things, child,' so I don't. What did you learn about matches turning out well? I'm {{interested}} in that, because I want mine to be quite perfect in all respects." ...|$|R
6000|$|Is it needful to <b>say</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{mentioned}} {{what had}} occurred to Dr McTougall that amiable little man opened his eyes to their widest? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Mr. Carnegie, how can <b>I</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> haven't {{yet made}} up my own mind about it? Why, I hardly know you yet from your brother." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{will not}} be the worse of another bolting," [...] said the Miller; [...] "it is always best to be sure, as I <b>say</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> chance to take multure twice from the same meal-sack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, very well. Difficult to {{reconcile}} what Geoffrey told us, with Miss Silvester's manner and appearance. What next? You {{had something else}} to <b>say,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was so rude as to interrupt you. What was it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it {{was like}} this. I was a-doing of my hair {{in the kitchen with}} the curling-iron, when down comes Miss Julia. 'Oh, you are frizzing your hair!' she says. 'Yes, miss,' I says, 'have you any objection?' I says. 'Ma won't let you have a fringe,' she <b>says.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> loses my temper, and I says, 'Well, Miss Himperence, you can go and tell your ma that she can find a servant as can do without a fringe.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Always, about everything," [...] said Adam, promptly. [...] "They <b>say</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am {{an officer}} I shall {{know as much}} as my father." [...] "God forbid, little one!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Jane,' <b>says</b> <b>I</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found her, 'I've got {{a friend}} from Texas here. He's all right, but--well, he carries weight. I'd like {{to give him a}} little whirl after the show this evening--bubbles, you know, and a buzz out to a casino for the whitebait and pickled walnuts. Is it a go?' ...|$|R
