40|$|The tuning {{system for}} XFEL [1, 2] SRF {{cavities}} is a device {{based on a}} double lever driven by a stepping motor with a gear box and a <b>screw-nut</b> system. The cavity is stretched by the tuner thus changing its resonant frequency. The tuner is also provided with fast tuning capability by means of two piezo-ceramic actuators (piezos), which compensate for cavity deformations that are responsible of frequency detuning. During industrial phase is mandatory to ensure a correct tuner assembling both for mechanical parts and actuators. This is provided by an automated device able to check the correctness of piezo-tuner installation on the cold mass string first and after installation in the cryostat, with very simple mounting requirements for the Module Assembling Team.

If this condition is not provided in necessary quality and tightness is insufficient or too big, it may cause threaded joint’s damage. The most popular methods for the threaded joint’s assembly control in machine manufacturing are as following: 1) measurement of the screw’s prolongation; 2) control of the <b>screw-nut’s</b> turning angle; 3) measurement of the <b>screw-nut’s</b> tightness moment. The most exact results provide the measurement of the screw’s prolongation. This method is widely used when controlling threaded joint’s tightness for very responsible assembly units, for example, for pitman screw joints...|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{function}} of <b>screw-nut</b> transmissions (powerscrews). Two aspects of this function have been investigated. Owing to different running parameters, primarily sliding speed and average pressure between the sliding surfaces of the thread, the coefficient of friction and the efficiency will vary within wide limits. The running parameters can be summarized in a dimensionless number, the Sommerfeldt number S. The problem, which has reference to boundary lubrication, is solved by a theoretical model. The model is based on two types of interaction between the sliding surfaces, namely solid friction at asperity peaks and liquid friction in the voids between the asperities. An optimal interval of the Sommerfeldt number, where the coefficient of friction is at its minimum, has been established: 0. 025 < S opt < 0. 042. As a result of friction between the sliding surfaces, heat is developed, which is conducted through the material of the screw and nut. The developed heat can cause high temperatures on the sliding surfaces of the thread. The capability of performance {{is limited by the}} development of high temperatures in the thread, where the running temperature of the actual lubricant must not be exceeded. Physically, the phenomenon relates to heat conduction. A theoretical model is put forward. In the model the screw is replaced by a cylindrical rod and a hollow cylinder corresponds to the nut. The equation of heat conduction is stated and solved for the case ofsteady state in the actual regions. It is shown that an infinitely thin wall of the hollow cylinder is the most severe case with a maximum rise in temperature. The result is presented {{in the form of a}} diagram with dimensionless temperature, rod speed and length of cylinder. The report ends with recommendatons for how the results can be used for designing <b>screw-nut</b> transmissions. In this context three numerical examples are given.

40|$|International audienceFriction {{modeling}} {{is essential}} for joint dynamic identification and control. Joint friction is composed of a viscous and a dry friction force. According to Coulomb law, dry friction depends linearly on the load in the transmission. However, in robotics field, a constant dry friction is frequently used to simplify modeling, identification and control. That is not accurate enough for joints with large payload or inertial and gravity variations and actuated with transmissions as speed reducer, <b>screw-nut</b> or worm gear. A new joint friction model taking dynamic and external forces into account is proposed in this paper. A new identification process is proposed, merging all the joint data collected while the mechanism is tracking exciting trajectories and with different payloads, to get a global LS estimation in one step. An experimental validation is carried out with a prismatic joint composed of a Star high precision ball screw drive positioning unit...|$|E
30|$|Fracture of {{abutments}} or abutment screws can be {{contributed to}} acute trauma, chronic overload, production flaws, or errors in <b>screw-nut</b> design. If fractured screw components cannot be removed, it may render the implant unrestorable or forces the dentist to creative solutions, such as cementable components. Fortunately, fractured screw components will generally be loose because the preload {{has not been}} retained. In that case, they may be removed by manipulating them counter clockwise with a straight probing instrument. On occasion, screw remnants cannot be mobilized, and removal remains a clinical challenge. Careful instrumentation when attempting to remove them should prevent damage to the internal thread of the implant and its surrounding tissues. The use of a fine-tipped hand instrument, a round burr turning counter clockwise, or drilling a slot in the screw {{in order to get}} more grip can be attempted to loosen the fragment. Specific instrumentation to remove broken screws from implants is available from most implant suppliers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an autonomous robot for painting the interior walls of buildings. The robot consists of a painting arm with an end effector roller that scans the walls vertically and a mobile platform to give horizontal feed to paint the whole area of the wall. The painting arm has a planar twolink mechanism with two joints. Joints are driven from a stepping motor through a ball <b>screw-nut</b> mechanism. Four ultrasonic sensors are attached to the mobile platform and used to maintain a certain distance from the facing wall and to avoid collision with side walls. When settled on adjusted distance from the wall, the controller starts the painting process autonomously. Simplicity, relatively low weight and short painting time were considered in our design. Different modules constituting the robot have been separately tested then integrated. Experiments have shown successfulness of the robot in its intended tasks.

40|$|Robot {{programming}} by demonstration {{simplifies the}} task of robot programming. Our implemented vision based robot system makes use of this approach {{and is able to}} arrange objects in a 2 D-scene (e. g. a conveyor belt). To perform this task, the video camera takes images from two relevant objects and the movement of the robot hand is determined {{in such a way that}} both objects are arranged in a desired manner. The taught relation between two objects, e. g. a screw-wrench at a <b>screw-nut,</b> can be restored automatically, independent of their initial position and orientation. Almost all necessary information is extracted from images of the scene (very little a priori knowledge). The procedure of object recognition is based on the contour of the objects and derived features. The recognition procedure is invariant w. r. t. scaling, rotation and position of the objects, and actually this implies the generalization ability. 1 Introduction The subject of this project was to implement a vision based syst [...] ...|$|E
30|$|With {{respect to}} the {{etiology}} of screw loosening, several causes are to be considered [8]. <b>Screw-nut</b> systems generally become unstable when the load that {{is applied to the}} system exceeds that of the preload of the screw that causes a clamping force preventing separation of the joint [9]. Preload is proportional to the tightening torque at placement. Hence, tightening torque on the one hand has a significant effect on screw loosening [10]. Embedment relaxation or settling can be overcome by retorquing abutment screws after a certain period of time, increasing joint stability [9, 11]. On the other hand, the magnitude of forces applied to the system is of major influence. The transfer of high forces can be generated by bruxers, through non-occlusal loading or because of a non-passive fit of suprastructures [8, 12 - 15]. Other factors that are of influence of a systems’ resistance to screw loosening include lubrication, screw design, screw material, and surface characteristics [16 - 20]. Especially implant designs with an external hex configuration are prone to abutment screw loosening [21].|$|E

The disk and board are kinematically connected by a transmission mechanism, consisting of a worm and complex gear drive and a tightening <b>screw-nut</b> with correcting device, and it is run by a synchronous type motor. The dynamic errors in the system depend, first, on irregularities in rotation of the disk, fluctuations in its axis and vibrations of the table in the plane parallel to the plane of the disk. The basic sources of the fluctuations referred to above are residual disbalance of the rotor and other rotating masses, the periodic component of the driving torque of the synchronous motor, variability in the resistance, kinematic errors in the drive and other things. The fluctuations can be transmitted to the operating units through the kinematic link as a flexural-torsional system, as well as through vibrations of the housing of the device...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUsually, {{the joint}} {{transmission}} friction model for robots {{is composed of}} a viscous friction force and of a constant dry friction force. However, according to the Coulomb law, the dry friction force depends linearly on the load driven by the transmission. It follows that this effect {{must be taken into}} account for robots working with large variation of the payload or inertial and gravity forces, and actuated with transmissions as speed reducer, <b>screw-nut</b> or worm gear. This paper proposes a new inverse dynamic identification model for n degrees of freedom (dof) serial robot, where the dry friction force is a linear function of both the dynamic and the external forces. A new identification procedure groups all the joint data collected while the robot is tracking planned trajectories with different payloads to get a global least squares estimation, in one step, of inertial and new friction parameters.

40|$|This {{study is}} to explore the {{application}} of electrorheology (ER) to the real-time control of damping forces that are transmitted through the nose landing gear for an F- 106 B aircraft. The {{main part of the}} landing gear is a strut that consists of a pneumatic spring and an ER controlled damper that is situatted on the strut centerline and applies a force directly opposing the vertical displacement of the nose wheel. The damping element rotates in response to strut displacement, employing a co-axial arrangement of stator and rotor plates connected to the opposing electrodes in the control circuit. The vertical displacement is conveted into rotation of the damper through a <b>screw-nut</b> mechanism. The ER fluid between the electrodes is thus engaged in shear along circumferential lines of action. This design results in a fast time response and a high ratio of strut forces achieved under Er-vs. zero-field control. Compact size and simplicity in fabrication are also attained. The analysis shows that when using an ER fluid of a yield stress of 7 kPa, the energy absorption efficiency of the landing gear can reach almost 100 % at various sink rates...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{ignition}} of a confined explosive {{submitted to}} an impact strongly {{depends on the}} friction conditions between the explosive and the confinement material (generally steel). A test has been developed to study the friction between steel and a material mechanically representative of an explosive. The scope of interest is that of high pressures and high relative velocities (respectively 20 MPa and 10 m/s). The friction device consists of making a cylinder, formed of the material, slide through a steel tube. Axial prestress enabling the steel-material contact stress to be generated is performed {{by means of a}} <b>screw-nut</b> system. This confinement state avoids any fracture of the material from occurring throughout the test. Two kinds of tests are carried out: low-velocity (around 1 mm/min) and high-velocity (around 10 m/s). The relative displacement is obtained using a testing machine during the low-velocity tests, and thanks to a Hopkinson bars system during the high-velocity tests. Examination of the measurements obtained during high-velocity tests shows that a workable steady state of equilibrium has been reached. As the interface stresses cannot be measured, the friction coefficient must be determined using indirect data: force measurements obtained from the 2 machine or from the Hopkinson bars and strain measurements made on the exterior of the tube. The procedure to identify the steel-material friction coefficient from these measurements entails analytical modelling and finite element simulations of the mechanical behaviour of the tube-specimen assembly. The friction coefficient identified during the high-velocity tests is far higher than the coefficient identified during the low-velocity tests...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{describe}} the modelling of large flexible objects in which bolted joints are used and also to present a new FEM calculation methodology of these objects. Design/methodology/approach: In bolted flange joints of flexible constructional elements, bolts are subject not only to tension and torsion but also to bending. Identification of straining of each bolt is only possible by means of numerical methods e. g. the finite element method FEM. In case of large objects, the calculation problem is faithful projection of the phenomena taking place in direct zone of the contact of <b>screw-nut</b> pair. The application of global equivalent models of the whole joint is necessary, to make it possible to precisely determine internal loads in individual bolts and then local models to determine stress fields necessary to assign durability. Calculation methodology based on the construction of two coherent models has been described: global - of an entire flange joint, and local - of a single bolt joint. Findings: The elaborated methodology was applied to estimate the flange joint in the heat exchanger with rotating heating surfaces that was subject to damage. The causes of damage of flange joint were found. Practical implications: Used methodology of FEM modelling of bolted flange joints based on two coherent models may be applied for different similar objects. The paper provides detailed description of methodology steps. Originality/value: The described methodology may be successfully applied to the analysis of large objects, however, significant geometric features with dimensions small in relation to dimensions of the whole object. Thanks to the application of two coherent models, it is possible to reflect all essential phenomena in the FEM model, both in the global scale - of the entire object, and local – a significant fragment of the joint...|$|E
40|$|Tungsten Inert Gas welding {{is a very}} {{effective}} welding process widely used in many industries for joining of sheets, stainless steel pipes, automobile parts and many other manufacturing processes. This welding process has an additional advantage of protecting the weld bead {{with the help of}} shielding gas or inert gas which avoids the oxidation of the bead, making the joint wear resistant and slag free. This has increased the demand of TIG welding extensively. Generally, it is done manually by holding filler rod in one hand and the TIG torch with other. Thus, the process requires a high amount of skill and human labor. Automation of TIG welding will not only reduce human labor but also improve accuracy. The project aims to develop and design an automated filler rod feeding system for TIG welding. To fulfil this purpose, a number of mechanisms are considered namely rack-pinion mechanism, slider-crank mechanism and <b>screw-nut</b> mechanism. The advantages and limitations of each mechanism are weighed against each other to decide the best mechanism that can be implemented. The mechanism is then designed and fabricated so as to fulfil the objectives of the project. It has also been ensured that the product at the completion of this project is industry oriented and has commercial value. After a rigorous analysis of the different mechanisms possible, screw and nut mechanism was chosen to be fabricated. The feeding of the filler rod is coordinated with the movement of the TIG torch. The suggested mechanism is one of its first in this particular field and can prove to be a worthy replacement of the presently used wire-feeding arrangement. With proper research in this area, it can be expected that better mechanisms and arrangements will emerge or materializ...|$|E
