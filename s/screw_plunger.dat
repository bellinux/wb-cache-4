40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the process of retronasal olfaction, flavor release from skimmed milk and full fat milk (containing 3. 75 % fat) was {{investigated}} using a model mouth system with a <b>screw</b> <b>plunger.</b> Large differences were determined in the quantity of flavor released using two different methods: with <b>screw</b> <b>plunger</b> movement, which represents "retronasal" flavor release, and without the <b>screw</b> <b>plunger,</b> which represents "orthonasal" flavor release. The <b>screw</b> <b>plunger</b> motion accelerated the release of diacetyl and 2 -heptanone in both skimmed and full fat milk. The amount of diacetyl released was not influenced by the fat content of the milk in either case (with or without <b>screw</b> <b>plunger</b> operation), while the amount of 2 -heptanone released was lower in full fat milk both with and without <b>screw</b> <b>plunger</b> motion. The influence of fat content {{on the amount of}} flavor released was explained by the lipophilicity of the flavor components, and mass transfer also contributed to release of the hydrophilic flavor compoun...|$|E
40|$|An {{adjustable}} systemic-pulmonary artery (SPA) shunt {{is being}} developed that consists of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft with a <b>screw</b> <b>plunger</b> mechanism. This device would allow full control of flow through SPA shunts used to augment pulmonary blood flow in neonates born with single ventricle physiology. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the changes this mech-anism has on flow fields for a 4 mm and 5 mm adjustable SPA shunt. Two in vitro models were examined; an idealized model with an axisymmetric constriction and a model developed from 3 -D reconstruction of the actual shunt under asymmetric constriction. These models were used to mea-sure the instantaneous velocity and vorticity fields using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) under both steady and pulsatile flow conditions. Recirculation regions and maximum values of velocity, vorticity, and shear stress are compared between the 4 mm and 5 mm models. The results indi-cate that for the idealized model of both shunts, separation regions are much smaller, persisting for approximately 0 - 1. 75 diameters downstream of the constriction, while for the realistic models separation regions of 2. 5 diameters downstream were observed. Additional models of a 4 mm and 5 mm shunt were tested under pulsatile conditions matching Re of 1061 and 849 and a Womersley number of 4. 09 and 5. 12, respectively, as seen in vivo. The maximum shear rates observed in bot...|$|E
40|$|A {{vertical}} micro-injection machine {{includes a}} plasticizing unit, {{in which a}} feeding channel is provided and a <b>screw</b> or a <b>plunger</b> for transporting the molten material is provided in the feeding channel; an injection unit adapted to receive a metered amount of molten material from the plasticizing unit; an injection mold adapted to receive the metered amount of molten material from the injection unit; at least two thrust cylinders adapted to close the injection mold before injection and open the injection mold after injected parts solidified; and the injection unit includes an injection cylinder, the injection cylinder is connected with the feeding channel of the plasticizing unit, and a vertically reciprocating plunger is provided in the injection cylinder, which can expel air above the molten material in the injection cylinder by its upward advancement and then push the molten material into the injection mold. The vertical micro-injection machine according to the invention can {{eliminate the need for}} valves, avoids air entrapment in the molten plastic, provides a very high speed injection and reduces dead zones in the injection process that trap and degrade the material quality.

5000|$|Although {{there were}} various plans for submersibles or {{submarines}} during the Middle Ages, the Englishman William Bourne designed {{one of the}} first prototype submarines in 1578. This was to be a completely enclosed boat that could be submerged and rowed beneath the surface. Comprising a completely enclosed wooden vessel sheathed in waterproofed leather, it was to be submerged by using hand operated wooden <b>screw</b> thread adjustable <b>plungers</b> pressing against flexible leather bags located at the sides in order to increase or decrease the volume of water to adjust the buoyancy of the craft. The sketch (left) suggests that the depth adjustment was by means of a crankset projecting above the surface. There is no obvious accommodation for crew. The first submersible to be actually built in modern times was constructed in 1605 by Magnus Pegelius. Its fate was to become buried in mud. In 1596 the Scottish mathematician and theologian John Napier wrote in his Secret Inventions the following: [...] "These inventions besides devises of sayling under water with divers, other devises and strategems for harming of the enemyes by the Grace of God and worke of expert Craftsmen I hope to perform."It's unclear whether or not Napier ever carried out his plans. Henry Briggs, who was professor of mathematics at Gresham College, London, and later at Oxford, was a friend of Napier, whom he visited in 1615 and 1616, and was also an acquaintance of Cornelius Jacobszoon Drebbel, a Dutchman in the service of James I of England, who designed and built the first successful submarine in 1620. Hence, it is not impossible that {{it was because of the}} interest taken by Napier in the submarine that Briggs came in touch with Drebbel.Drebbel's submarine was propelled by oars and is thought to have incorporated floats with tubes to allow air down to the rowers. The precise nature of this submarine is unclear, it may be possible that it resembled a bell towed by a boat. Two improved types were tested in the River Thames between 1620 and 1624. Of one of these tests Constantijn Huygens reports in his autobiography of 1651 the following: ...|$|R
