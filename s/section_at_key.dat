30|$|Chon and Olsen [13 : 213] {{state that}} “… today’s tourism {{environment}} is increasingly competitive and complex … and tourism organizations at the national, {{state and local}} levels must make estimates about what is likely to happen in the future and decide how to adjust to future events”. This statement implies a need to explore global challenges and threats of the external environment and structure future options for each single tourist destination that are adjustable to external signs noticed. In this respect, the present <b>section</b> aims <b>at</b> grasping <b>key</b> drivers of the external environment (see Fig.  1) which will, to a certain extent, frame decision-making on the future development of the tourist sector in the specific case study.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} three main sections. The first section {{provides}} a general characterisation of presentism, eternalism and growing blockism. It presents {{a pair of}} core, defining claims that jointly capture {{each of these three}} views. This makes clear the respects in which the different views agree, and the respects in which they disagree, about the nature of time. The second section takes these characterisations and considers whether we really do have three distinct views, or whether defenders of these views are somehow talking past one another when they claim to disagree. The third <b>section</b> looks <b>at</b> the <b>key</b> objections to each view and considers some of the replies that can be made to those objections. The paper concludes by offering some thoughts about how future research might help us resolve the debate between defenders of these three views...|$|R

40|$|How can grantmakers {{cross the}} divide between philanthropy and business?

Seeking Common Ground with Business: Primarily for grantmakers working outside the corporate sector, this <b>section</b> looks <b>at</b> several <b>key</b> questions. How much business involvement in philanthropy is realistic? What kind of involvement should you seek?

25|$|The {{arrival of}} bodies at {{multiple}} times <b>at</b> <b>Key</b> West {{has led to}} confusion over how many bodies from the Maine are buried there.
