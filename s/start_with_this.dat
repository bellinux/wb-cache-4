25|$|Further {{advances}} in computing led to greater advancements in interactive computer graphics. In 1959, the TX-2 computer was developed at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. The TX-2 integrated {{a number of}} new man-machine interfaces. A light pen could be used to draw sketches on the computer using Ivan Sutherland's revolutionary Sketchpad software. Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed {{in front of a computer}} screen and the screen's electron gun fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{garnered}} {{a largely}} positive reception from critics. Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "Powerfully depicts both Mulder's gnawing sense of defeat and his bond with Scully, strangely growing stronger with separation" [...] before concluding that the episode was [...] "fairly standard." [...] The site ultimately gave the episode a B. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club positively compared and contrasted the episode to the cartoon Scooby Doo, Where Are You? writing that, [...] "I {{used to be a}} huge [...] "Scooby Doo" [...] fan. [...] Of course, none of [...] were really monsters. [...] The X-Files exploited a simple truth: we all want to believe. We might be afraid of what's lurking in the dark, but isn't there always a bit of wishing inside that fear? A hope that what we think we know isn't everything there is to know. That just once it might be nice to reach for a zipper and instead find nothing but cool scales." [...] Handlen ultimately called the episode [...] "Essential." [...] Reviewer Dan Barrett from the 400 Club wrote that [...] "The X-Files is off to a stonking good <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> season 2 opening." [...] Bob Curtright, writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, called the episode [...] "an engrossing chiller about potential contact from outer space." [...] He compared the episode positively to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and noted that the episode was [...] "both scary and wondrous" [...] and [...] "offer no pat answers that might tend to blow the credibility." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, writing that the episode was not [...] "what the fans were expecting, and its reputation isn't great. But I think this clever and claustrophobic little take, which does so much not only to refresh the show but to analyze what it's actually about, is one of the very best." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{the meaning}} of usury, I would add a few words. I <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> proposition. There is nothing {{contrary}} {{to the will of}} God for one free man to buy from another free man anything he wants. I have two houses,--one I live in, one I let. My tenant pays the market rent of houses to me, and so both parties are benefited. I have two thousand pounds. I have no capacity, or opportunity, or desire to use more than one thousand pounds in trade on my own account. My neighbour has energy and activity to use more money than he has in trade. He gladly offers me five per cent. for my spare thousand pounds. I willingly lend it on those terms. He makes ten per cent. by using it. He gives me five pounds and has five pounds for himself. If this be usury, it is lawful and right.|$|E
60|$|It may be {{that the}} enemy will occupy {{positions}} back from the city, out of range of the gunboats, so as to make it desirable to run past Grand Gulf and land at Rodney. In case this should prove the plan, a signal will be arranged and you duly informed, when the transports are to <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> view. Or, it may be expedient for the boats to run past, but not the men. In this case, then, the transports would have to be brought back to where the men could land and move by forced marches to below Grand Gulf, re-embark rapidly and proceed to the latter place. There will be required, then, three signals; one, to indicate that the transports can run down and debark the troops at Grand Gulf; one, that the transports can run by without the troops; and the last, that the transports can run by with the troops on board.|$|E

For it is no explanation of the existence of genius {{to say that it is}} hereditary. You only put the difficulty one place back.

The elephant supports the earth, and the tortoise supports the elephant, but who, pray, supports the tortoise?
