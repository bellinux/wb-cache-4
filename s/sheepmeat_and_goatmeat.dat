40|$|In recent years, Australian <b>sheepmeat</b> <b>and</b> wool {{producers}} {{have been exposed}} to more volatile and less secure market environments, placing greater pressure on producer-funded investments to be efficient and profitable. Knowledge about the size and distribution of the potential returns from alternative broad types of R&D and promotion investments permits strategic-level decisions about resource allocation, both within and across research programs. This is particularly important for the Australian <b>sheepmeat</b> <b>and</b> wool industries because they are characterised by strong crosscommodity relationships due to the joint product nature of the industries. Mounter et al. (2007) developed an equilibrium displacement model (EDM) of the Australian <b>sheepmeat</b> <b>and</b> wool industries to account for these relationships and any indirect benefits and costs arising from spillover and feedback effects between the industries as a result of research-induced innovation or promotion. However, the values for many of the economic parameters in the EDM had to be specified subjectively due to the absence of relevant empirical estimates. Uncertainty about true parameter values raises concerns over the robustness of the results generated from the EDM. In this paper we use the EDM to estimate the potential annual returns and their distribution among the various industry sectors for nine hypothetical investment scenarios. Initially, the EDM is solved for the base set of parameter values. A formal stochastic sensitivity analysis is then undertaken to account for the uncertain parameter values in the model. The results were found to be relatively robust to different parameter values, indicating that the model as specified provides a credibl...|$|R

40|$|New Zealand {{has always}} been a nation {{strongly}} reliant on international trading. From the mid-nineteenth century wool was a major export commodity and with the advent of refrigeration in the 1880 s <b>sheepmeat</b> <b>and</b> dairy products, especially butter,gained prominence. These three commodity types became the export staples of New Zealand, and remained so in 1960. Britain, in turn, was clearly the most prominent importer of these products. New Zealand exports of wool, <b>sheepmeat</b> <b>and</b> dairy products to Britain therefore became imbedded as the 'traditional' pattern of trade. An interest in how these traditions survived {{to the end of the}} twentieth century was the stimulus for this thesis, which is an historical investigation into New Zealand's recent export trade with the countries of today's European Union. Agreements made between New Zealand and Britain in the first half of the twentieth century consolidated what had been established since 1890 as a regular pattern of trade. The 1932 Ottawa Agreement gave New Zealand free and preferred access over non-Commonwealth countries for its agricultural products into Britain. 1 1. A comprehensive outline of New Zealand's trading history over this period can be found in, Muriel F. Lloyd Prichard, An Economic History of New Zealand to 1939, Auckland: Collins, 1970. The relationship was further tightened in the bulk purchase agreements of World War II.

Complementary national direct payments would remain in force until 2013. The second scenario assumes the full decoupling of direct payments from 2007 and the introduction of modulation from 2013 onwards in the 2004 enlargement new Member States (EU- 8). The baseline scenario projections suggest that the introduction of direct payments would expand EU- 8 aggregate production, mainly of oilseeds, grains, <b>sheepmeat</b> <b>and</b> cheese, while beef and veal production would also increase. Consumption of more expensive beef and veal meat would be substituted by poultry and pigmeat.

40|$|The use of {{alternating}} frequencies during stimulation {{can increase}} stimulation response of a medium voltage electrical stimulation unit (MVS) {{by increasing the}} rate of pH decline. Various combinations of frequency modulation were tested in experiment 1 to determine the treatment resulting in the greatest stimulation response; the lowest initial pH, fastest rate of pH decline, highest temperature at pH 6 and {{the highest number of}} carcasses with a pH of 6 by 25 oC and the treatment achieving the highest number of carcasses in the pH temp window (temperature at pH 6 between 18 - 25 oC). The objective meat quality of these treatments compared to an unstimulated treatment was tested in experiment 2. Modulating the frequency (Hz) across the 6 segmented electrodes of the MVS by 10, 15, 25, 10, 15, 25 Hz (Treatment 6, using a pulse width: 2. 5 ms, current: 1 A) resulted in the greatest stimulation response. This treatment may be suitable for abattoirs that hot bone <b>sheepmeat</b> <b>and</b> require fast pH declines to ensure minimal cold shortening of meat. However, this treatment did not result in the tenderer meat despite the higher stimulation response. This treatment may have induced a greater number of contractions overall and therefore a greater pH decline response but resulted in less myofibrillar disruption compared to the other treatments due to a concomitant decreased force of contraction thus reducing potential tenderisation. Maintaining a constant frequency of 15 Hz (Treatment 1; pulse width: 2. 5 ms, current: 1 A) resulted in a higher number of carcasses in the pH temp window required (temperature at pH 6 between 18 – 25 oC) in part A (P < 0. 05) and in addition to the higher tenderness levels this treatment may be more appropriate to satisfy the overall demands of abattoirs using these systems.

40|$|In {{partnership}} with AREN Agribusiness Research and Education Network. This study {{is one of}} four studies of New Zealand agribusiness success. In 2006 and 2007, The Agribusiness Research and Education Network researched the success of the New Zealand dairy, kiwifruit, <b>sheepmeat</b> <b>and</b> venison industries. These studies are all business history studies focusing on issues of industry strategy, structure, conduct and performance as perceived by industry participants and the AREN research team. New Zealand is a major player in world dairy markets. New Zealand exports six categories of dairy products: Milk and cream (not concentrated); Milk and cream (concentrated); Buttermilk and related products; Whey and related products; Butter and related products; and Cheese and curd. Concentrated milk (particularly whole milk powder and skim milk powder is the largest product category. Cheese and curd is currently the second most important product category having taken over from butter which has declined in relative importance but remains the third most important category. Non-concentrated milk, buttermilk and whey products are smaller categories but whey products have increased in importance in recent years. The business context for dairy industry participants has been characterised by significant change over the last three decades. Contextual changes have been significant. European and North American subsidies have distorted markets for much of the period. Low cost producers have emerged in China and Latin America. Dairying has had to respond to animal welfare, and environmental challenges. Industry structure has evolved considerably over the last three decades. Structural change has occurred throughout the dairy industry. A key change was the Dairy Industry Restructuring Act 2003 associated with the dissolution of the NZ Dairy Board, the establishment of Fonterra and the removal of statutory monopoly power. The Act was proceeded by a long period of industry concentration and has been followed by industry evolution at a fast pace. Industry conduct and performance have evolved in response to legislative change, business opportunities and business capabilities. Key developments within the industry have included: enhanced farm productivity, uptake of labour saving technologies, the use of nitrogen fertiliser and supplementary feeds, and ongoing adaptation to new technologies and larger farm size. Interviews with industry participants identified eight key success factors. The eight critical success factors identified were: development of international markets; effective political support in international markets; effective political support within New Zealand; effective evolution of industry structure; farmer engagement in policy, strategy, structure and operations; continuing technological advance; maintaining disease free status; and the development of economies of scale. The dairy industry continues to evolve and faces numerous challenges. Key challenges identified by industry participants were: increasing animal welfare demands; enhancing animal health; meeting environmental challenges; managing intergenerational transfers; achieving appropriate research investment in pastures; achieving sustainable and efficient industry structures; and sustaining effective international marketing strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{developments}} in the European Union and its environmental policy {{have important implications for}} New Zealand. While the importance of the European Union as a market for New Zealand produce has diminished, it is still significant, accounting for 17 per cent of exports (6 per cent of which are to the United Kingdom), especially as a high value market and in commodities such as <b>sheepmeat,</b> fruit <b>and</b> dairy. It is because of the importance of primary products in New Zealand's trade with the European Union (hereafter, EU) and the fact that much EU environmental policy intervention and market changes are in the primary products sector that this paper will concentrate upon EU environmental policy and its impact on agriculture. The implications of changes in the EU on New Zealand are both indirect and direct. Indirect impacts include the influence the EU has in the outcome of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, particularly in relation to agricultural trade, which of course is of vital importance for New Zealand. Policy and market changes in the EU also affect New Zealand indirectly by impacting on other potential New Zealand export markets. Direct impacts of changes in the EU include the rise in demand for produce produced in an environmentally friendly manner (henceforth referred to as 'green' produce) particularly at the high value end of the market. Other important factors include the continuing access for New Zealand exports to the EU market especially under preferential arrangements...|$|R
40|$|In New Zealand's {{agricultural}} sector, {{the dominant}} position of pastoral enterprises {{has resulted in}} relatively little importance being attached {{to the production of}} arable crops. At times of strong demand and remunerative prices for milk, <b>sheepmeat,</b> beef <b>and</b> wool, the comparative advantage of New Zealand producers of these products over those in other countries has justified the general lack of any strong concern {{for the development of the}} arable sector. When, however, the market for livestock and livestock products is weak, the further expansion of other farm products, including cereals, becomes a much more attractive proposition. It is not perhaps always appreciated that the proportion of total agricultural land in New Zealand devoted to cereal production is very small. Over the past decade, the area under cereals has fluctuated around 200, 000 ha with the trend over these years being slowly downwards, from an average of 210, 000 ha during the five year period 1973 - 77 to an average of 190, 000 over the period 1979 - 83 (although the 1983 - 84 out turn has shown a sharp reversal of this trend). This area under cereals represents less than one per cent of the total agricultural land in the country, although the quality of the land involved is above that for the country as a whole. Cereals account for less than ten per cent of the proportion of the 2. 5 m hectares of land of high actual or potential value for the production of food. This paper is concerned with the production and utilisation of the four cereals produced commercially in New Zealand - wheat, barley, oats and maize, and the official policies which influence them...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{established}} in 1948 as the Primary Producers Cooperative Society based initially in the South Island of New Zealand as a meat marketing cooperative, predominantly of sheep. It became known as PPCS Limited but remained a minor player in the meat industry until the early 1970s when a new management team was appointed. The removal of subsidies to farmers, the New Zealand Meat Board ceding its monopoly on <b>sheepmeat</b> marketing, <b>and</b> meat processing industry over-capacity gave the cooperative opportunities to utilise its profitability built up over the previous decade. So in the 1980s it expanded from only minor processing operations by taking over meat processing cooperatives and companies in initially the South Island and later the North Island. In 1986 released asset value was returned to the farmer shareholders by {{the creation of a}} holding company Apex Limited. Apex was a vehicle that allowed the acquisition of Canterbury Frozen Meat. [...] Major consolidation of the New Zealand meat industry continued through the 1990s with PPCS actively involved but not getting caught out like competitors such as AFFCO Holdings. However, in 2006 it was forced to take over Hawkes Bay based Richmond Meats to resolve issues resulting from a secret investment that had commenced in the late 1990s. This saddled the cooperative with debt. It was renamed Silver Fern Farms in 2008 based upon one of its long standing brands. A takeover by PGG Wrightson fell through due to the 2008 financial crisis. In June 2008, PGG Wrightson had made an unconditional offer to buy half of Silver Fern Farms for NZ$220 million, but in September was unable to complete the equity raising required to finance the offer and defaulted. It had to pay $42 million in compensation to Silver Fern and wrote off a total of $50 million for the compensation and due diligence costs. By 2013 the cooperative had accumulated significant losses leading to a company restructuring. The company is currently just profitable.|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand export meat {{industry}} has been through {{a considerable number of}} changes in the 1980 s. The deregulation of export slaughter facilities, Supplementary Minimum Prices, Producer Board intervention, declining livestock numbers and domestic cost pressures have all affected the performance of the domestically based processing sector. Major changes in market access and demand have influenced off-shore marketing operations, particularly for sheepmeats. Additionally, there has been a change in the type of meat exported with a greater proportion of further processed product shipped in recent years. As an example of the impact of these developments on livestock producers, the producer share of the United Kingdom wholesale market return for a representative prime lamb carcase has fallen from 40 per cent in 1978 to 25 per cent in 1988. In this article the pattern of intervention in the New Zealand pastoral meat industries from the mid- 1960 s is detailed, emphasising the different environments of the beef <b>and</b> <b>sheepmeat</b> enterprises. Then the principal factors influencing domestic processing margins for these products are empirically examined. Alternative model specifications and alternative estimation techniques are compared and contrasted. The results of these analyses are discussed in terms of the historical patterns of assistance and structural change, and in terms of current rationalisation pressures on the meat processing sector.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{physicochemical}} and sensory characteristics of fermented, cured sausages made from equivalent muscle groups of beef, pork, <b>and</b> <b>sheepmeat.</b> The last has no commercial examples and represents an unexploited opportunity. Using seven replicates of shoulder meat and subcutaneous fat, sausages were made with 64 %, 29 %, 4 %, 2 %, 0. 2 %, and 0. 01 % of lean meat, fat, NaCl, glucose, sodium pyrophosphate, and lactic culture, respectively. Following anaerobic fermentation (96  h, 30 °C), there were no significant differences between the species in mean texture (hardness, springiness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness) and pH, and only minor differences were seen in color. However, although not consumer tested, it is argued that consumers would be able to pick a texture difference due to different fat melting point ranges, highest for sheepmeat. This work was followed by a sensory experiment to find out if characteristic sheepmeat flavors could be suppressed to appeal to unhabituated consumers. To simulate a very strongly characteristic sheepmeat, beef sausage mixtures (above) were spiked, or not, with 4 -methyloctanoic, 4 -methylnonanoic acid, and skatole (5. 0, 0. 35, and 0. 08  mg kg(- 1), respectively). Sodium nitrite (at 0. 1  g kg(- 1)) and a garlic/rosemary flavor were variably added to create a 2 (3) factorial design. In a randomized design, 60 consumers found that spiked sheepmeat flavors caused an overall significant decrease in mean liking on a 1 - 9 scale (5. 83 vs. 5. 35,P =  0. 003), but this was completely negated by the garlic/rosemary addition (5. 18 vs. 6. 00,P <  0. 001). Nitrite had no effect on liking (5. 61 vs. 5. 58,P =  0. 82), although nitrite might be included in commercial examples to minimize fat oxidation and suppress growth of clostridia. Thus, sheepmeat flavors could be suppressed to appeal to unhabituated consumers. Commercial examples could thus be made for these consumers, but the mandatory use of the name "mutton" in some markets would adversely affect prospects...|$|R
40|$|Dairy {{products}} and beef are New Zealand's main export commodities, accounting for 22 per cent of total merchandise exports (Statistics New Zealand, 2005). The European Union (EU) is commonly known for distorting {{international trade in}} these products through subsidised production and exports. This leads to lower world market prices and hence lower export revenues for New Zealand. On the other hand, New Zealand benefits from high domestic EU prices through preferential access to the butter, cheese <b>and</b> <b>sheepmeat</b> markets. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU has already undergone several reforms in recent years. The 2003 CAP reform replaced the coupled direct support schemes by a Single Farm Payment (SFP), which will be mainly delivered to farmers irrespective of what they produce (hence 'decoupled' from production). The level of decoupling differs among the EU Member States. This report assesses {{the implementation of the}} SFP across Member States and how far it has been decoupled. The expected changes in the European Union's and New Zealand's trade in dairy {{products and}} beef resulting from the 2003 reform of the CAP are simulated, using a partial equilibrium trade model (Lincoln Trade and Environment Model; LTEM). The hypothesis is that a higher degree of decoupling of direct payments leads to a lower production and less EU exports. Hence, opportunities for NZ exports of dairy products and beef could increase. The results from the dairy sector are the opposite of the hypothesis: EU exports in dairy products are predicted to increase following the reform and this implies New Zealand exports to fall by 1. 5 per cent to 2. 0 per cent. This is due to a rise of the internal milk production quota {{in the course of the}} reform which outweighs the impact of the decoupling of the dairy premium. In the beef sector, EU outputs will be reduced as a result of the 2003 CAP reform. The market changes in the EU, however, are only partly transmitted to New Zealand because other beef producers also benefit. The returns to New Zealand beef producers increase by more if full decoupling in all EU Member States is applied then in case of only partial decoupling...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years {{there have been a number}} of studies carried out of {{agricultural}} supply response in New Zealand. The parameters estimated in these studies are an essential ingredient in a wide variety of policy and forecasting studies. One example of such work is the study currently being carried out at the O. E. C. D. (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) to examine the medium term impacts of multilateral adjustments in agricultural protection policies. Of necessity these studies involve the simultaneous examination of changes in production, consumption and trade for a number of countries for a range of major agricultural commodities. The countries include the E. E. C., United States, Japan, other Western European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The O. E. C. D. has developed a framework with which to carry out the analysis. From New Zealand's perspective the major products involved include beef, wool, <b>sheepmeats,</b> dairy products <b>and</b> grain. These are generally exportable products as far as New Zealand is concerned. If protection in these products was reduced by importing regions, domestic prices around the world would be reduced because export supply functions from countries like New Zealand are elastic. The responsiveness of New Zealand's export supply in turn, depends upon the elasticities of New Zealand's domestic supply and demand. These are complex relationships that have important time, regional and quality dimensions. There are limits, however, to the extent to which these dimensions will be incorporated into the multi country, multi product model. The analysis will explore the impacts of trade policy changes from a medium term perspective. For this reason, the review of past studies focuses on medium term supply response parameters. The approach being used by the O. E. C. D. adopts an overall perspective of the agricultural sector in each country involved. This aggregate view of the sector is still a partial equilibrium approach in that factor and product market relationships with the rest of the economy are not included in a detailed fashion. Nevertheless, the aggregate sector view does require that the supply response parameters are consistent in the sense that they respect intermediate usage of agricultural products between subsectors within agriculture and that the total output supply response respects the supply response of primary factors. The first set of relationships is particularly important in countries where a high proportion of grain output is fed to livestock. The second is important where the availability of land and land sowing technology are major constraints in the medium term. Most previous supply response studies in New Zealand have been done on commodity lines and encompass a limited set of possible products. In surveying this literature there is a concern that response parameters selected may be biased in relation to the sector wide model which underpins the O. E. C. D. framework. One approach that can be used to overcome this problem is to select parameters from individual studies subject to overall sector restraints imposed by economic theory. Zeitsch (1985) has surveyed these restrictions on supply elasticities. In the case of New Zealand, it is not appropriate to assume that the supply of farm land and land saving technology is fixed and so the homogeneity condition derived from Diewert (1974) is not used in this survey. Furthermore, grain production and feeding is not a major activity for dairy, beef and sheep production. The second section of this report and Appendix 1 consists of the review of selected past studies at the national level. The third section contains a selection of these parameters for medium term policy forecasting purposes...|$|R
40|$|This {{evaluation}} and economic assessment is {{of a project}} funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) aimed at improving economic knowledge of the Chinese wool industry. The project was carried out jointly by Australian agricultural economists at the Universities of Queensland and Sydney and their Chinese colleagues attached to the Institute of Agricultural Economics within the Chinese Academy of the Agricultural Sciences and the Institute of Rural Development within the Chinese Academy of the Social Sciences. The research has concentrated on understanding the supply side of the Chinese wool industry and links between wool production and the marketing system within China. However, the research has consequences for Chinese and Australian understanding of the demand for local and imported wool within China and for Australian wool on the world market. The research also has implications for farm management within China and economic policy decisions within both countries. In particular, the research is relevant to the future course of the trade in raw wool and wool semi-manufactures between Australia and China. In some recent years, China {{has been the most}} important buyer of Australian wool. In broad terms, exports of greasy wool and semi-manufactures (scoured wool and wool tops) from Australia to China now account for around one-fifth of Australian production (detailed information on Australian wool exports and world production and trade in wool is presented in section F of the Australian Wool Compendium published by Wool International). Within China, the wool industry is specially important because of its economic and political significance to ethnic minorities living in the pastoral region. This region is vulnerable to overgrazing and land degradation. Wool is the major source of cash income in some districts. Sheepmeat {{is an important part of}} the food supply for ethnic minorities. The balance between wool <b>and</b> <b>sheepmeat</b> in the sheep industry affects the total quantity of wool produced and, even more so, the type of wool produced. The quality composition of the wool clip determines the types of products into which wool can be processed and thus the extent of competition between domestic wool and imported wool. Developments in Chinese wool production are important to Australia because China is both a major wool consumer and a processor of domestic and imported wool for the Chinese market and export. The clothing and textile industries are already an important component of the Chinese economy and significant in its overall development strategy. China is now the world’s largest exporter of clothing and second largest exporter of textiles, despite severe handicaps incurred from widespread restrictions on trade in clothing and textiles reflected in the Multi-fibre Arrangement that regulates world trade in clothing and textiles (Drysdale 1997). Zhong Chuanshi and Yang Yongsheng (1997) have recently reviewed economic issues surrounding Chinese exports of clothing and textiles. These products have been a driving force behind the surge in China’s exports that have accompanied the opening of the Chinese economy over the last two decades. From 1980 to 1994, textile and clothing exports rose from US$ 4. 4 billion to US$ 35. 5 billion, an increase more than eight-fold (Zhong and Yang 1997). Furthermore, these industries have created the basis upon which imports of technology, machinery and equipment essential for the development of other sectors of the economy can be financed. While it is obvious that wool in aggregate competes with synthetic fibres, artificial fibres and cotton in markets for clothing and textiles, it is less clear how wool of different origins competes in determining the shares of Australian wool and other wool in Chinese output of clothing and textiles. This is because wool processing uses specialised assets. Firms in the wool processing business in China and elsewhere are interested in maintaining the throughput of their operations. Blending wool from different countries may also have positive effects on processing performance. In economic terms, the issue is whether Chinese wool and imported wool are substitutes or complements. Formulation of other Australian policies for the wool industry depends upon knowledge of the economic interaction of domestic Chinese wool production and wool imported from other countries, principally Australia. Australia has an ongoing interest in maintaining access to the Chinese market, the emerging role of China in the world textile industry, and Chinese participation in world trade generally. Chinese demand for Australian wool has been most unstable over recent years—both cause and effect of the profound difficulties for the Australian wool industry associated with the demise of the reserve price scheme and the protracted recovery following that Australian-induced debacle. Knowledge of the supply side of the Chinese wool industry is obviously critical to Australian understanding of the short-term and long-term outlook for wool upon which many private investments and government decisions are based. Moreover, understanding (if not resolution) of perennial Australian disputes in the wool industry concerning exports of Australian Merino sheep largely depends on economic information on wool supply in major wool producing countries. On closer inspection, the long-running conflict over the export of Merino sheep to China and elsewhere is a variant of a far wider debate concerning the effects on Australian farmers of assistance by Australia to agricultural development in Third World countries. In the case of wool, the argument hinges on the economics of wool supply versus sheepmeat in the wool industry in the Chinese pastoral region as well as the competitiveness (or complementary position) of Australian wool and Chinese wool in processing and final demand. Of far greater financial significance to Australian woolgrowers than the controversial controls over exports of Merino sheep is their compulsory participation in generic promotion of wool that does not (and could not) distinguish wool by country of origin. The component of domestic Chinese wool in Chinese exports of semi-processed wool and wool endproducts is one ingredient in the complex economics of wool promotion. The emerging Chinese wool processing industry is a major beneficiary of the current Australian approach to promotion because Chinese wool endproducts, whatever the origin of wool, attract Woolmark certification and promotion, increasing their competitiveness with wool end-products produced by established processing firms in other countries. Wool promotion is an important public policy and commercial issue for the Australian wool industry (Haszler 1997). Over 1995 – 96 and 1996 – 97 Australian woolgrowers contributed a total of over $ 230 m towards the world-wide promotion effort managed by the International Wool Secretariat, largely through their current 3. 5 per cent promotion tax. Arguably, the Woolmark ‘brand’ that is the basis of generic promotion of wool has substituted for firm-specific brands and made it easier for new firms and emerging countries in the wool trade such as China to become established in the markets of developed countries (Watson 1997). There are practical and theoretical differences between economic assessment of scientific versus economic research into agricultural production. Economic research is generally less costly than scientific research because it have expensive requirements such as capital equipment and land for research stations. Like other agricultural research, the adoption of economic analysis leading to improvements in farm management depends upon decisions by farmers. The benefits of research can then be observed directly in higher (net) farm incomes. The rate of adoption is an important determinant of the research profitability. According to the nature of the research, on-farm research may require capital investment by farmers. The connection between economic research and economic benefit is less where that research leads to decisions by Governments on agricultural policy. Often, policy decisions are re-inforced by economic research but also based on other evidence or a priori economic reasoning. Therefore, while changes in economic policy bring about a range of actions by economic agents, not all of the associated costs and benefits can be directly linked to the underlying research. Moreover, adoption of policies by Government is generally discrete rather than continuous. Judging the specific contribution of this project to the changes in economic policy that have taken place in the Chinese wool industry is perhaps the most difficult and problematic component of this assessment. In the present case, the gains from research on Chinese wool production mainly relate to increased gains from trade that are occurring because the research has reduced impediments to the import of Australian wool. In addition, liberalisation of the wool trade is part of the process by which Chinese aspirations to join the World Trade Organisation are responded to by Australia. wool, china, production, trade, Australia, industry, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management, International Development, Livestock Production/Industries, Production Economics,...|$|R

ResultsLand needsAll consumption change scenarios reduce {{the total amount of}} land estimated as required to support the UK food system. A switch from red to white meat increases the need for overseas arable land, although a larger area of UK land that can be tilled is released. Under a reduction scenario, the amount of extra land required for the direct consumption of plant products is less than the amount of arable land released from livestock feed production. The net effect on total overseas arable land needs is a reduction of about 311, 000 ha and a net release of about 265, 000 ha arable land in the UK. The need for grassland is greatly reduced. The release of grassland with some arable potential ranges between 1. 6 to 3. 7 million ha depending on where remaining production is concentrated. The release of grassland with no arable potential ranges from 0. 7 to 6. 9 million ha. Under a reduction scenario, concentrating remaining production on better quality land would almost entirely eliminate sheep and beef production for the UK from the hills, most uplands and less productive lowland areas. Under Consumption Scenario 2 (a shift from beef <b>and</b> <b>sheepmeat</b> to white meat from pigs and poultry), the diet needs of pigs and poultry result in a net increase in demand for overseas grown crops, although considerably more potentially arable land is released in the UK. More arable cropping is needed both in the UK (an additional 55, 000 ha) and to a much greater extent overseas (about an additional 466, 000 ha), driven largely by soy. However, the release of arable quality grassland in the UK exceeds the increase in overseas arable landed needed for producing this feed. The result is a net release of between 1. 6 and 2. 9 million ha potentially arable land in the UK plus the release of 1. 3 to 6. 6 millionha of land suitable only for grassland. Under Consumption Scenario 3 (a 50 % reduction in white meat consumption balanced by an increase in plant products) the changes are much less complex with no changes in grassland needs. Increases in demand for arable land for direct human consumption amounted to about 154, 000 and 172, 000 ha (domestic and overseas respectively), but these are more than compensated for by the release of arable land from feed production (341, 000 and 668, 000 ha domestic and overseas respectively). Focusing a reduced cattle and sheep industry on non- arable land would result in the release of substantially more tillable land (currently grassland). In a 50 % livestock production consumption reduction scenario, maximising the use of lower grade land (semi-natural grassland, hill land etc.) releases 3. 7 million of tillable grassland (including 1. 3 million ha of good arable land). The opposite approach of withdrawing production from less capable land releases just 1. 7 millionha of potentially arable land, with almost no release of the grassland well suited for to arable production. The land-use trade-off is therefore clear. Under a 50 % livestock consumption reduction scenario, 2 million ha of tillable grassland is required to compensate for the withdrawal of cattle and sheep production from 6. 9 million ha of non-tillable grassland. A 50 % reduction in livestock product consumption opens up the opportunity to release about half of UK land currently used for UK food supplies if remaining production is concentrated on the more capable land. If land is released uniformly, almost two-thirds of this release takes place on grassland not suited to arable production and the remaining third is grassland with some arable potential. There would be with higher levels of land release in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland than in England. Depending on where the remaining production takes place, a large proportion of land released may be very unproductive, but it can be assumed that about 5 million ha with potential for other agricultural uses would be available, for example for the production of livestock for export (if they did not reduce their livestock consumption), for producing arable biofuel crops, planted woodland and re-wilding (to natural woodland in many cases). Greenhouse gas emissionsAll consumption scenarios reduce greenhouse gas emissions from primary production. The largest reduction is from a livestock reduction scenario (Consumption Scenario 1) : from 81 to 66 MtCO 2 e (19 % reduction). The switch from red to white meat reduces emissions by 9 % and a 50 % reduction in white meat consumption by only 3 %. The net effect on emissions depends greatly on the alternative use of the grassland released from food production. The study indicates the range of possible consequences on soil and biomass fluxes. If all tillable grassland released from food production was converted to arable use, 8 to 17 MtCO 2 e per year would be released over 20 years through the effects of land use change. Converting all released land with the potential to support good tree growth to woodland would cause a net carbon uptake equivalent to about 7. 5 to 9. 5 MtCO 2 e per year in soil and wood per year over 20 years. Land use preference (e. g. focusing remaining production on high quality land) has little effect on emissions. This is an important result indicating that supply chain emissions are unresponsive to changes in industry structure with respect to the land used. The location of emissions reductions (UK or overseas) was identified. Currently, we estimate that 36 % of primary production emissions are overseas. All scenarios reduce UK emissions while Consumption Scenario 1 has little effect on overseas emissions and Consumption Scenario 2 reduces overseas emissions by 5 %. None of the scenarios involve a net export of emissions and the GHG reduction benefits in the UK are proportionally greater than those overseas because of the tight link between UK livestock consumption and production. OTHER EFFECTS Other emissions All consumption scenarios are expected to reduce other emissions. Consumption Scenario 1 halves ammonia emissions. Reductions in nitrate emissions, eutrophication emissions generally, and acidification are almost as large (ca 45 %). Biodiversity and carbon sequestration It is widely asserted that grassland, especially semi- natural grassland, has a higher biodiversity value compared with other types of vegetation, natural climax vegetation for example. It is often claimed that the retention of these grasslands is important for the continued delivery of some ecosystem services, for example, carbon sequestration. In many other European countries, the uplands and hills are usually wooded. For example, 32 % and 29 % of the land area in Germany and France respectively are wooded compared with 12 % in the UK. Thus conversion to climax woodland or other forms of forestry is one obvious alternative use for released grassland. Our study has identified benefits for carbon sequestration in soil when grassland is converted to woodland (there should also be potential benefits in the use of harvested wood). Our analysis of land use statistics reveals the large proportion of UK land currently occupied by cattle and sheep. Without these livestock, this grassland (much of which is semi-natural grassland) would revert to the natural vegetation - deciduous woodland in many cases. Our results show that the use of livestock to retain semi-natural grasslands is not dependent on the current high level of livestock product consumption. A 50 % reduction in demand still leaves a market which is large enough to support this activity. However, given how a declining market affects all suppliers, a livestock reduction scenario presents special challenges to the maintenance of semi-natural grasslands. Livestock systems provide a wide range of services that are currently used by society. In a reduction scenario, rural areas lose skills and employment in the livestock sector and there would be ramifications for linked industries such as the meat processing or veterinary sectors. Culturally important features, for example, hedgerows and stone walls, and much of the fauna and flora associated with grassland would be no longer needed. In the UK as a whole, land that is most likely to be taken out of production is associated with difficult production conditions. In England, upland moorland and common land now in a semi-natural state could change to fully natural vegetation cover. In upland areas, where the majority of re-wilding under Consumption Scenario 1 and 2 would be located, evidence suggests that various natural communities including scrub, bracken, bramble, and woodland with their own assemblage of flora and fauna are likely to develop, with potential increases in wild herbivores such as deer, hares, and rabbits. The majority of SSSIs currently under-grazed occur in lowland areas, for example in southern and eastern parts of England, and a lack of livestock results in difficulty in applying the grazing pressure required to maintain the semi-natural faunal and floral diversity. Recreational access to the uplands, which is now facilitated by open grassland landscapes, may be impaired and evidence suggests that visitors view the loss of traditional semi-natural landscapes, with associated meadows, hedges, and stone walls, negatively. Whilst a reduction in the current ecosystem service provision associated with livestock production from cattle and sheep can be expected under Consumption Scenarios 1 and 2, the net change is also dependent on the alternative use to which land is put. In upland SSSIs, overgrazing is often problematic and reducing grazing pressure may allow semi-natural habitats to recover, in particular dwarf shrub heaths, bogs, acid grassland and upland habitats. The release of large areas of land could also be used to diversify upland areas. For example, semi-natural upland woodlands have declined by 30 - 40 % since the 1950 s and the UK Habitat Action Plan has therefore included a target to increase the area of upland oak woodland through planting or natural regeneration of current open ground. In the lowlands, approximately 10 % of the current arable land could be released for other activities, such as bioenergy crops, woodlands, recreational land, wetland creation, nature reserves, flood protection, carbon sequestration, and urban development. Each of these land uses will have its own specific range and flow of ecosystem services associated with it. While in general, the release of agricultural land with high environmental value from food production is not viewed as positive, Defra has concluded that there are likely to be situations where positive outcomes can occur. Economic considerations The reduction in the amount of land needed to supply the UK goes hand-in-hand with a reduction in the value added by agriculture supplying UK consumed food. A 50 % reduction in livestock product consumption (Consumption Scenario 1) reduces the UK farm-gate value of livestock products from £ 7. 6 to 3. 5 billion. The farm-level economic impact of a change along these lines will depend crucially on what replacement output is found for the land released and on market effects that are {{beyond the scope of this}} study. One economic response scenario is that the land resource released remains in agriculture serving export markets. Another strategy is to use the land for non-food purposes. Using biomass energy cropping as a benchmark and assuming a price of £ 40 /tonne dry matter biomass wood, we estimate that replacing the value of the food output of higher quality land released will be challenging, although it is reported that biomass energy is an economically viable alternative to sheep production on uplands.
