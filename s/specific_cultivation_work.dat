Methods and Results: DNA was extracted from a natural, surface petroleum seep and subjected to culture independent analysis (rRNA gene-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and phylogenetic analysis of clone libraries). Molecular analysis suggested dominance by acidophilic bacteria, especially Alphaproteobacteria (mainly bacteria related to Acidiphilium and Acidocella). Archaea were not detected, but fungi were present. pH of the samples was around 3. 5. Conclusions: Acidophilic microbial communities are associated with an acidic petroleum seep.

Close relatives of our study organisms, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Archaeoglobus profundus, Thermococcus fumicolans, and Pyrococcus sp. strain GB-D, are commonly found in hydrothermal vent chimney walls and hot sediments and possibly deeper in the subsurface, where highly dynamic hydrothermal flow patterns and steep chemical and temperature gradients provide an ever-changing mosaic of microhabitats. These organisms (with the possible exception of Pyrococcus strain GB-D) tolerated greater extremes of low pH, high sulfide concentration, and high temperature when actively growing and metabolizing than when starved of carbon sources and electron donors/acceptors. Therefore these organisms must be actively metabolizing in the hydrothermal vent chimneys, sediments, and subsurface in order to withstand at least 24 h of exposure to extremes of pH, sulfide, and temperature that occur in these environments.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} microalgae {{production in}} large scale open ponds under different climatologic conditions, a model-based framework {{is used to}} study the effect of light conditions, water temperature and reactor design on trends in algae productivity. Scenario analyses have been done for two algae species using measured weather data of the Netherlands and Algeria. The effects of temperature control, photo-inhibition and using monthly or yearly fixed biomass concentrations are estimated by a sensitivity analysis. The calculation-based results show that climate conditions such as solar irradiation and temperature dynamics {{play an important role}} in open raceway ponds. In moderate climate zones low and high temperatures over a season suppress growth. At high latitudes this effect is important as light levels vary much during the day and between seasons. Optimal biomass concentrations in ponds depend on location, pond depth and algae species.

The research was conducted from October 2013 to April 2014 in the greenhouse IPB Experimental Station Cikabayan, Bogor. The research was arranged in randomized block design with two factors. The first factor was 5 upland rice varieties (Inpago 5, Batutegi, Jatiluhur, Inpago 8 and Sarinah). The second factor was 4 irrigation intervals which were 3, 6, 9, and 12 days.

One of the most important findings is that countries like Germany, Sweden, or Austria, with strong environmental protection standards, appear to be less energy and environmentally efficient, compared with countries like Denmark, Belgium, Spain, France, or Ireland. In addition, a series of eastern European countries achieve low efficiency scores, which can be characterized as expectable, due to low technology level being implemented in the primary production process.
