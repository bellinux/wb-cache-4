5000|$|Bols {{continued}} {{to expand its}} reach {{over the next few}} decades until it participated in almost every geographic market in the world. Management was quick to realize, however, that societal trends away from alcohol consumption, particularly spirits, threatened the company. Genever was still a large component of Bol's revenues, and this was a particularly difficult market to grow outside of its native Netherlands, as global drinkers tended to prefer the British [...] "dry" [...] style of gin. A strategy of diversification through acquisition was adopted, and in 1977 Italian brands Cynar and Biancosarti, both aperitifs, were added, and in 1983 the company added its first non-alcoholic beverages with the acquisition of Terme di Crodo, makers of still and <b>sparkling</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>waters,</b> non-alcoholic bitters, and sodas, including Crodino, and various other fruit flavored beverages. (In a later divestiture, these brands became part of Campari Group).

40|$|An {{analytical}} system {{composed of a}} purge-and-trap injection system coupled to gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (PTI-GC-MS) specific {{for the analysis of}} volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons (VCHCs) (chloroform; 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane; tetrachloromethane; 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethylene; tetrachloroethylene) and trihalomethanes (THMs) (chloroform; bromodichloromethane; dibromochloromethane; bromoform) in water was optimised. Samples were purged and trapped in a cold trap (- 100 degrees C) fed with liquid nitrogen (cryo-concentration). In order to make this method suitable also for only slightly contaminated waters, some modifications were made to PTI sample introduction, in order to avoid any air intake into the system. PTI, GC and MS conditions were optimised for halogenated compound analysis and limits of detection (LOD) were evaluated. The proposed method allows analysis of samples whose concentrations range from mu g/L to ng/L. It is, therefore, applicable to drinking waters, in analyses required by law, and to slightly contaminated aqueous matrices, such as those found in remote areas, in environmental monitoring. Moreover, by changing cold trap temperature, even <b>sparkling</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> can be analysed, thus avoiding CO 2 interference during the cryo-concentration phase. Our method has been successfully used on real samples: tap <b>Water,</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> and Antarctic snow. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The role of bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> on lipid {{metabolism}} and lipoprotein concentrations in man has scarcely been investigated. The present study aimed {{to investigate whether}} drinking sodium bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> affects postprandial cholesterol and triacylglycerol metabolism in postmenopausal women. In a three-way, randomised, crossover study, eighteen healthy postmenopausal women consumed two sodium bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> (bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> 1 and bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> 2) and a low <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> (500 ml of each) with a standard fat-rich meal (4552 kJ; 75. 3 g fat). The bicarbonated waters were rich in sodium and bicarbonate and bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> 1 contained 5. 7 times more fluoride than bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> 2. Fasting blood samples and postprandial blood samples were taken at 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 420 min {{after the end of}} the meal consumption. Cholesterol and triacylglycerols were determined in serum and chylomicrons. A significant water consumption effect was observed in the total area under the curve (TAUC) of serum and chylomicron triacylglycerols (ANOVA, P= 0. 008 and P= 0. 027, respectively). TAUC of serum triacylglycerols for bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> 2 was significantly lower compared to low <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> (Bonferroni, P= 0. 039). Peak concentration of serum triacylglycerols showed a significant water effect (P= 0. 025). Changes in chylomicron cholesterol were not significantly affected by the type of <b>water.</b> Bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> 1 and 2 did not show any significant differences. Drinking sodium bicarbonate-rich <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> reduces postprandial lipaemia in healthy postmenopausal women compared to drinking a low <b>mineral</b> <b>water.</b> © The Authors 2005.
