5|$|The first fur test allowed Sulley {{to run an}} {{obstacle}} course. Results were not satisfactory, as such objects would catch and <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> the fur due to the extreme amount of motion. Another similar test was also unsuccessful, because, this time, the fur would go through the objects.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk. II system, which allowed radar operators {{to determine whether a}} blip on their screen was a friendly aircraft. IFF was a responder that sent out a pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> in time from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E

25|$|A trabucco is {{a massive}} {{construction}} built from wood, which consists of a platform anchored to the rock by large logs of pine of Aleppo, jutting out into the sea, from where two (or more) long arms called antennae <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> suspended some feet above the water and supporting a huge, narrow-meshed, net (called trabocchetto).|$|E
25|$|Over time, atheromata usually {{progress}} {{in size and}} thickness and induce the surrounding muscular central region (the media) of the artery to <b>stretch</b> <b>out,</b> termed remodeling, typically just enough to compensate for their size such that the caliber of the artery opening (lumen) remains unchanged until typically over 50% of the artery wall cross-sectional area consists of atheromatous tissue.|$|E

They sometimes carry water in their bill to chicks at the nest or even during nest building or egg stages.|$|E

Much of the Jharkhand state is still enclosed by forest. Forests sustain the population of Elephants and tigers.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} initial nursing {{education}} is a two-year Associate Degree in Nursing (Associate of Applied Science in Nursing, Associate of Science in Nursing, Associate Degree in Nursing), a two-year college degree referred to as an ADN. Some four-year colleges and universities also offer the ADN. Associate degree nursing programs have prerequisite and corequisite courses (which may include English, Math and Human Anatomy and Physiology) and ultimately <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> the degree-acquiring process to about three years or greater.|$|E
25|$|Although Yugoslavia {{joined the}} Axis powers, Fascist Italy demanded that their ally Nazi Germany invade Yugoslavia {{in order to}} reach Greece and help their {{disastrous}} campaign there and in the process break up Yugoslavia since Italians were laying claim on certain territories (mostly Dalmatia). The German Luftwaffe then began to mass at the borders of Yugoslavia from allied Axis nations. The VVKJ was forced to <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> to defend Yugoslavia from an apparent invasion and imminent air war.|$|E
25|$|The Burmese {{battle plan}} was greatly shaped by their {{experience}} in the 1759–1760 war. First, they would avoid a single pronged attack route along the narrow Gulf of Siam coastline, which they discovered, could easily be clogged up by more numerous Siamese forces. In 1760, the Burmese were forced to spend nearly three months (January–March) to fight {{their way out of}} the coastline. This time, they planned a multi-pronged attack from all sides to <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> the numerically superior Siamese defences.|$|E

25|$|The Workman layout {{employs a}} {{hypothesis}} about the preferential movement of each finger rather than categorically considering the lowest letter row to be least accessible. Specifically, {{the index finger}} prefers to curl inwards rather than stretch outwards. So for the index finger, the position of second preference goes to the bottom row rather than the top row. Contrarily, the middle and ring fingers are relatively long and prefer to <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> rather than curl in. Based on this, weighting is allotted to each key specifically rather than each row generically.|$|E
25|$|Starspots are {{regions of}} intense {{magnetic}} {{activity on the}} surface of a star. (On the Sun they are termed sunspots.) These form a visible component of magnetic flux tubes that are formed within a star's convection zone. Due to the differential rotation of the star, the tube becomes curled up and stretched, inhibiting convection and producing zones of lower than normal temperature. Coronal loops often form above starspots, forming from magnetic field lines that <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> into the corona. These in turn serve to heat the corona to temperatures over a million kelvins.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics {{was based on a}} system of state {{ownership}} of the means of production, collective farming, industrial manufacturing and centralized administrative planning. The economy was characterized by state control of investment, and public ownership of industrial assets. The Soviet Union invested heavily into infrastructure projects including the electrification of vast areas, and the construction and maintenance of natural gas and oil pipelines that <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> of Russia and into every constituent nation of the USSR. This type of investment set the stage for Russia to become an Energy Superpower in the modern age.|$|E

25|$|The Vili of Gabon {{are mainly}} located in Mayumba. This locality, {{which has about}} 5000 souls, is the last Gabonese city before {{accessing}} the neighbouring Congo border. The region of Mayumba {{is known for its}} still unspoiled wilderness, its immense beaches that <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> of sight, beaten by violent waves and violent currents.This wild side is highlighted by the Mayumba National Park, which covers about 870 square kilometers. It is the protected sanctuary where a wide spectrum of animal and plant species flourishes. They include crocodiles, chimpanzees, gorillas, various monkeys, leopards, elephants, antelopes, buffaloes. It is also a great place to observe different species of birds.|$|E
25|$|Sonication is an {{efficient}} {{tool for the}} synthesis of polymers. The cavitational shear forces, which <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> and break the chain in a non-random process, result in a lowering of the molecular weight and poly-dispersity. Furthermore, multi-phase systems are very efficient dispersed and emulsified, so that very fine mixtures are provided. This means that ultrasound increases the rate of polymerisation over conventional stirring and results in higher molecular weights with lower polydispersities. Ormosils (organically modified silicate) are obtained when silane is added to gel-derived silica during sol-gel process. The product is a molecular-scale composite with improved mechanical properties. Sono-Ormosils are characterized by a higher density than classic gels {{as well as an}} improved thermal stability. An explanation therefore might be the increased degree of polymerization.|$|E
25|$|Incubation {{takes about}} 16 days in Crypturellus, which {{contains}} the smallest species, and 19–20 days in Tinamus and Eudromia. During this period the male is typically silent; {{if he does}} call, he does so away from the nest. As he incubates, he will leave the nest to feed, and he may be gone from 45 minutes to five hours, covering the eggs when he leaves. While incubating, he is mainly motionless and reluctant to move, even from potential danger. It is possible for a human observer to approach and touch the incubating male without eliciting an overt response. Some species will flatten themselves against the ground, <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> their necks, and raise {{their backs to the}} air. This posture causes them to resemble a plant; however, if it is overdone, the eggs become visible from behind.|$|E
