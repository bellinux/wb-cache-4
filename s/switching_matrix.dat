The on-board signal processing includes switching of RF signals between multiple antennas to provide interconnection between the uplink and downlink beams. This paper describes {{the development of}} a dynamic <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> for a TDMA satellite switching system {{to be used in the}} next generation communications satellites. In this paper, a dynamic <b>switch</b> <b>matrix,</b> which includes the microwave <b>switch</b> <b>matrix,</b> the distribution control unit and the timing source, will be described. Several different microwave <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> architectures and <b>switching</b> devices were evaluated and compared. A unique coupler crossbar <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> architecture with dual-gate field effect transistor as switching element was developed. Experimental results of both microwave <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> (MSM) and distribution control unit (DCU) are presented. These test results verify the MSM with coupler crossbar architecture and dual-gate FET as switching element will meet the future SS-TDMA system requirements. Finally, the reliability of the dynamic <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> is addressed.

50|$|With {{structuring}} and grouping, it is {{very well}} seen that in any distributed network there are devices performing one complex function.

5000|$|In the 1960s, however, {{this view}} was coming under {{a great deal}} of strain.

Such features required more flexibility in the controller, leading to the development of computer-controlled switching machines, notably the Bell Labs − Western Electric 1ESS. These early machines still had an analog, usually electromechanical <b>switching</b> <b>matrix</b> because the technology of the time did not permit the cost-effective dedication of a filter-codec to each subscriber.

5000|$|Various {{parameters}} are defined and specified {{to quantify the}} performance of optical switches. The steady state performance of an optical switch (or optical <b>switching</b> <b>matrix)</b> is measured by its ability to effectively transmit optical power from an input port {{to any one of}} N output ports over the “on” state transmission path, and its ability to effectively isolate input power sources from all non-active ports over the “off” state transmission paths. Other key optical performance parameters include transmission efficiency over a range of wavelengths, the ability to minimize input optical power reflected back into the input fiber, transmission balance, and bidirectional transmission. The optical switch (or <b>switching</b> <b>matrix)</b> transient behavior is another important characteristic that is specified by its speed of response to control stimulation via the time interval it takes to either transmit or block the optical signal on any given output port. Two rates can be associated with switches: the switching rate and the signal transmission rate. The switching rate is the rate at which a switch changes states. The signal transmission rate is the modulation rate of information passing through a switch. The signal transmission rate is usually much greater than the switching rate. (If the switching rate approaches or exceeds the transmission rate, then the switch can be called an optical modulator.) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} cyclic {{fault-tolerant}} structure for a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> {{in a tree}} arrangement by connecting the inputs of the <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> into a ring with additional SOAs. Upon com-ponent failures, the affected requests are rerouted through their neighboring inputs toward the desired outputs. By making use of the existing components while rerouting, the proposed structure achieves an excellent trade-off {{between the number of}} additional components, hence size and cost, and fault tolerance. Numerical simulations show that under 210 randomly distributed SOA failures in a 32 × 32 <b>switch</b> <b>matrix,</b> the proposed structure is still able to provide more than 99 % connectivity between all input– output port pairs. We also show through simulations that the proposed structure could potentially scale up to large port counts by limiting the length of the rerouted paths. And its fault-tolerance capability improves as the size of the <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> increases. Experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed structure. Our re-search provides clues to improve the fault tolerance of some kinds of <b>switch</b> <b>matrices,</b> where rerouting within the <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> itself is not possible, such as single-stage matrices.

50|$|In {{a single}} {{receiver}} residential installation {{there is a}} single coaxial cable running from the receiver set-top box in the building to the LNB on the dish. The DC electric power for the LNB is provided through the same coaxial cable conductors that carry the signal to the receiver. In addition, control signals are also transmitted from the receiver to the LNB through the cable. The receiver uses different power supply voltages (13 / 18 V) to select antenna polarization, and pilot tones (22 kHz) to instruct the LNB to select one of the two frequency bands. In larger installations each band and polarization is given its own cable, so there are 4 cables from the LNB to a <b>switching</b> <b>matrix,</b> which allows the connection of multiple receivers in a star topology using the same signalling method as in a single receiver installation.|$|E

Lower frequencies are allocated to cable and terrestrial TV, FM radio, etc. Only one of these frequency bands fits on the coaxial cable, so each of these bands needs a separate cable from the LNBF to a <b>switching</b> <b>matrix</b> or the receiver needs to select one of the 4 possibilities at a time.|$|E
