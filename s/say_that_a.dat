5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E
5|$|It is {{one thing}} to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E
50|$|Let R be a ring, and let a and b be {{elements}} of R. If there exists an element x in R with ax = b, one <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> is a left divisor of b in R and <b>that</b> b is <b>a</b> right multiple of a. Similarly, if there exists an element y in R with ya = b, one <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{is a right}} divisor of b and <b>that</b> b is <b>a</b> left multiple of <b>a.</b> One <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> is a two-sided divisor of b if it is both a left divisor and a right divisor of b.|$|R

25|$|The {{vastness of}} the North American continent, and the variety of its climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landforms, led ancient peoples to {{coalesce}} into many distinct linguistic and cultural groups.

Tara McCormack, a lecturer in international relations at Brunel University, has opined in that trafficking discourse can be detrimental to the interests of migrants as it denies them agency and as it depoliticizes debates on migration.|$|E
