The {{purpose of this}} study was to characterize pulsations {{generated by}} personal <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps</b> relative to a nominal flow rate at the inlet of different respirable cyclones. Experiments were conducted using a factorial combination of 13 widely used <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps</b> (11 medium and 2 high volumetric flow rate pumps having a diaphragm mechanism) and 7 cyclones [10 -mm nylon also known as Dorr-Oliver (DO), Higgins-Dewell (HD), GS- 1, GS- 3, Aluminum, GK 2. 69, and FSP- 10]. A hot-wire anemometer probe cemented to the inlet of each cyclone type was used to obtain pulsation readings. The three medium flow rate pump models showing the highest, a midrange, and the lowest pulsations and two high flow rate pump models for each cyclone type were tested with dust-loaded filters (0. 05, 0. 21, and 1. 25 mg) to determine the effects of filter loading on pulsations. The effects of different tubing materials and lengths on pulsations were also investigated.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 39 - 40) Airborne dust {{evaluation of}} occupational environments is accomplished primarily by {{measurement of the}} mass concentration of dust in the air. Personal air <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps</b> are used for this purpose. The determination of the concentration of airborne dust {{is dependent on the}} volume of air drawn through the filter by the <b>sampling</b> <b>pump</b> and the mass of dust collected on the filter. Therefore, it is crucial that the flowrate and mass of dust be determined with a good degree of accuracy. The relationship between dust-loading on the filter and decrease in flowrate is examined in this study. The effect of smaller particles of dust versus larger particles of dust in relation to flowrate variance is also examined. In addition, the variance of flowrate over time due to the dust loading is investigated. Finally, a new, possibly more accurate gravimetric analytical technique involving the weighing of the entire field monitor unit is compared with standard methods. It is concluded that the variation of flowrate due to dust loading under normal conditions is not significant, and the variation that does occur in the flowrate is primarily due to individual differences in the air <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps.</b> The new gravimetric technique indicated 2 - 5 percent greater mass of dust than the standard technique in comparative determinations for heavy dust loading on the filter...|$|R

40|$|As an {{increasing}} number of processes are being integrated into Lab-on-a-chip devices, there is {{an increasing}} need for flexible and accurate sample manipulation techniques for effective transport and separation. Conductivity differences between running buffer and analyte samples can arise as a product of on-chip processing, or by design. The two situations studied here are <b>sample</b> <b>pumping</b> (where bulk transport is increased and separation of charged analytes is delayed using a relatively high conductivity sample), and sample stacking (where bulk transport is decreased and separation of charged analytes is expedited using a relatively low conductivity sample). A recently developed dynamic loading method for on-chip sample injection in a straight-cross channel configuration is applied here to both pumping and stacking cases. A key characteristic of the dynamic loading method is the ability to inject samples of high concentration density and uniformity of any length. By employing the conductivity differences alone, the effectiveness of either sample transport or sample separation are shown to improve over the uniform conductivity case. Then it is demonstrated that increasing the sample length, through dynamic loading, greatly increases the effectiveness of <b>sample</b> <b>pumping,</b> evidenced in an eight-fold increase in peak height as well as a decrease in total sample length at a downstream detector. Dynamic loading in the sample stacking case was shown to also increase peak intensity height (three-fold) in rapid separations.
