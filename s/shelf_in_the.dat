In 2002, both Malaysia and Indonesia submitted to arbitration by the ICJ on a territorial {{dispute over the}} Ligitan and Sipadan islands which were later won by Malaysia. There are also several other disputes yet to be settled with Indonesia over the overlapping claims on the Ambalat continental <b>shelf</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Celebes Sea and land border dispute between Sabah and North Kalimantan. Malaysia's claim over {{a portion of the}} Spratly Islands is also based on sharing a continental shelf with Sabah.|$|E
5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in {{great northern tilefish}} population is occurring throughout the continental <b>shelf.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity were observed in 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E

25|$|For most coastal countries, the EEZ roughly {{coincides with}} the {{continental}} shelf, the fishing rich area of relatively shallow water, less than 200 metres deep, that extends from most continental coastlines.

The coral atoll equivalent of a continental shelf is the shallow coral floors surrounding the islands and within the coral basins and lagoons.

The ADRO- 2 funding (topic of this report) supported further inquiry into the evolution of ice shelves under warming conditions, and the post-breakup effects on their feeder glaciers. Also, this grant considered fast ice and sea ice characteristics, {{to the extent that they}} provide information regarding shelf stability.

500|$|On {{reaching}} Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, {{and requested}} that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was {{informed by the}} Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. [...] Then, {{with the help of}} the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. [...] In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas, in Chile, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner Emma. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again. Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the Brunt Ice <b>Shelf</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Weddell Sea.

40|$|We {{estimate}} the sea-ice extent and basal melt of Antarctic ice shelves at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using a coupled ice-shelf–sea-ice–ocean model. The shape of Antarctic ice shelves, ocean conditions and atmospheric surface {{conditions at the}} LGM {{are different from those}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present day; these are derived from an ice-shelf–ice-sheet model, a sea-ice–ocean model and a climate model for glacial simulations, respectively. The winter sea ice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LGM is shown to extend up to ～ 7 ° of latitude further equatorward than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present day. For the LGM summer, the model shows extensive sea-ice cover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic sector and little sea ice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other sectors. These modelled sea-ice features are consistent with those reconstructed from sea-floor sedimentary records. Total basal melt of Antarctic ice <b>shelves</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LGM was ～ 2147 Gt a– 1, which is much larger than the present-day value. More warm waters originating from Circumpolar Deep Water could be easily transported into ice-shelf cavities during the LGM because the full glacial grounding line extended to shelf break regions and ice shelves overhung continental slopes. This increased transport of warm water masses underneath an ice shelf and into their basal cavities led to the high basal melt of ice <b>shelves</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LGM...|$|R
