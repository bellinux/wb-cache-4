25|$|High-velocity, high-altitude {{aspects of}} the booster {{atmospheric}} return technology began testing in late 2013 and have continued through 2016. SpaceX has been improving the autonomous landing and recovery of {{the first stage of}} the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, with steadily increasing success. As a result of Elon Musk's goal of crafting more cost-effective launch vehicles, SpaceX conceived a method to reuse the first stage of their primary rocket, the Falcon 9, by attempting propulsive vertical landings on solid surfaces. Once the company determined that soft landings were feasible by touching down over the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, they began landing attempts on a solid platform. SpaceX leased and modified several barges to sit out at sea as a target for the returning first stage, converting them to autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS). SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015, and in April 2016, the first stage booster first successfully landed on the ASDS Of Course I <b>Still</b> <b>Love</b> You.|$|E

500|$|As {{with its}} parent album, [...] "I'll <b>Still</b> <b>Love</b> You" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from music critics. In {{one of the}} more favourable reviews, Ray Coleman of Melody Maker admired Rotogravure as [...] "a pleasing album of uncomplicated pop music" [...] and added that the song was [...] "simplicity itself", likening it to [...] "Something". Less impressed, Bob Woffinden of the NME said: [...] "'I'll <b>Still</b> <b>Love</b> You' is a song Harrison wrote some years back. Lyrics are dreadful, but the melody's quite pretty." [...] In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner described the contributions from Starr's former bandmates as [...] "sound more like throwaways", in contrast with their [...] "inspired work" [...] on Ringo. Schaffner lamented that the treatment of [...] "I'll <b>Still</b> <b>Love</b> You" [...] was almost a [...] "Harrison parody", complete with Van Eaton's [...] "fluid imitation" [...] of the guitarist's playing style.|$|E

The US release coincided with {{heightened}} speculation regarding {{the possibility of a}} Beatles reunion, following promoter Sid Bernstein's offer of $230 million for a single concert by the group. While Starr was often asked about his former bandmates' contributions to the album, he was frustrated by the media's preference for discussing the Beatles. Starr also dismissed the idea that Harrison's non-appearance on [...] "I'll <b>Still</b> <b>Love</b> You" [...] was to avoid Rotogravure being seen as a work by [...] "The New Beatles'", as one interviewer had suggested. Although it was not selected for release as a single, Starr made a promotional film for the song, along with two other tracks from the album.
