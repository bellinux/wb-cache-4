40|$|The z 7 -day {{recurrence}} {{tendency in}} the cosmic ray intensity {{has been studied}} by the Chree method of analysis for the period 1937 -SS, using the ionisation chamber records at Huancayo. The amplitude of the z 7 -day variation changes from year to year. The variation in the amplitude is in general agreement with the changes in solar activity as revealed by the <b>sun-spot</b> <b>number</b> only for the years 1937 - 46 and 19 SZ-SS. This is {{in agreement with the}} results of Meyer and Simpson for the same periods, obtained from a slightly different method of analysis. The correla-tion breaks down for the period 1946 - 5. 1 and this is discussed in terms of possible changes in the electromagnetic conditions in the interplanetary space during the solar cycle.

Sahai from INPE to provide data set of stratospheric ozone from Cachoeira Paulista-SP. ABSTRACT – It was analyzed {{in this paper}} three available sets of stratospheric ozone measurements at different latitudes obtained by ground UVB sun spectrophotometer Dobson type and low energy stratospheric cosmic rays in the period from 1957 until 1997. By the analysis of these sets of ozone data and satellite observations we could detect a decreasing on ozone intensity at all different latitudes (Belsk/Poland, 51 ºN- 21 ºE, Tbilisi/Georgia, 42 ºN- 43 ºE and Cachoeira Paulista/Brazil, 23 ºS- 45 ºW), {{in relation to a}} global mean rate around 10 % during the last three solar cycles (about 3. 3 % by decade). We also search by correlation between cosmic rays measurements in the stratosphere, ozone variations, and sunspot number to verify the possibility of periodic influence on ozone during three solar cycle period. It was confirmed the dependence of ozone concentration variability relating to the sunspot number and the anticorrelation between <b>sun-spot</b> <b>number</b> and low energy cosmic ray intensity in the stratosphere...|$|E
40|$|We use a Monte-Carlo {{approach}} {{to investigate the}} performance of five different time-series estimators of the exponent ff in 1 =f ff noise. We find that a maximumlikelihood estimator is markedly superior to Fourier regression methods and Hurst exponent methods. The results indicate that useful estimates of ff {{can be made from}} time series that are much shorter than generally presumed. PACS codes: 72 : 70 :+m, 73 : 50 :Td, 74 : 40 :+k Keywords: noise, noise parameter estimation, noise generation 1 Introduction Long-term correlations have been observed in many types of time series from physical, biological, physiological, economic, technological and sociological systems. Examples include geophysical data [1, 2, 3] such as rainfall, temperature measurements, <b>sun-spot</b> <b>numbers,</b> earthquake frequencies, and river flows, frequency fluctuations in electrical oscillators [4], rate of traffic flow [1], voltage or current fluctuations in metal films and semiconductor devices [4], loudness fluctuations i [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{to a problem}} on {{the course of the}} natural process on the planet earth in the solar system. It is hard to consider any processes found on the earth except considering the planet earth {{under the influence of the}} solar effects. The classical dynamics is essential to consider the processes on the earth are controlled by the sun. First, a brief note is introduced on the solar activity and <b>sun-spots</b> <b>number.</b> This is important to see this work in relation to what are the important factors, though it is necessary to write here that the key of "relativity " and "quantum mechanics " was obtained by the pioneers on the bases ofthe knowledge on "classic dynamics. Recently, the scientific publications in the United States have introduced some notes on the man-made aurora appeared after a nuclear test above the atmosphere of Hawaii. Some note is related to an identified spherical thermal dome in the atmospheric layer on the earth surface. The author here introduces some basic factors to the aurora as the natural process on the planet earth under the effect of the solar winds. In this work, the author aims to introduce a key to promote researches related to the problems for in the next step to the future...|$|R
