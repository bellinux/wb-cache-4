As a freshman player in 2007, Allen led the <b>secondary</b> <b>unit</b> with seven knockdowns {{along with two}} interceptions. He was named a first-team Ontario University Athletics (OUA) All-Star and a second-team All-Canadian. Allen was again named to the OUA All-Star first team in 2008 and 2009.

Allen intercepted a pass from Terry Bradshaw intended for Lynn Swann in the Chargers' first round playoff win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but the Chargers lost {{in the second round}} to the Miami Dolphins. Prior to the 1983 season, the Chargers traded Allen to the San Francisco 49ers for a draft pick, but Allen was cut during the preseason and never played for the 49ers.|$|E

Henderson, the brother of Butkus and Bednarik Award winner E.J., had recorded an ACC-high four fumble recoveries in 2007 and was the Terrapins' leader in total tackles (133) and tackles for loss (11).

2500|$|Because Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony until 1898, {{its system}} of local {{government}} bears more resemblance {{to that of the}} Hispanophone nations of the Americas than to local government in the United States and some other Anglophone countries. Thus, there are no first-order administrative divisions akin to counties, as defined by the United States Government; instead, Puerto Rico has 78 municipalities or [...] "municipios" [...] as the <b>secondary</b> <b>unit</b> of administration. For U.S. Census purposes, the municipalities are considered [...] "county-equivalents." [...] The municipalities are grouped into eight electoral districts, but these do not possess administrative functions. In 1991, the Autonomous Municipalities Act was passed, which slightly modified the rights and responsibilities of Puerto Rican municipalities with the aim of decentralizing control and improving government services.|$|E
2500|$|The {{imperial}} high commandment led by Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz {{even after}} this battle, was unsure if the main Hungarian army stayed before Pest of it already moved towards north, wanting to relieve Komárom. They still {{believed in the}} possibility that only a <b>secondary</b> <b>unit</b> attacked Vác, and moves towards the besieged Hungarian fortress. When Windisch-Grätz finally seemed to grasp {{what is happening in}} reality, wanting to make a powerful attack at 14 April against the Hungarians at Pest, than to cross the Danube at Esztergom, and cut the way of the army which was marching towards Komárom, but his corps commanders, General Franz Schlik and [...] Lieutenant Field Marshal Josip Jelačić refused to obey to his commands, so his plan, which could cause serious problems to the Hungarian armies, was not realized.|$|E
2500|$|After the Battle of Vác the Hungarian army {{continued}} its advancement, {{according to the}} plan of {{the second phase of}} the Spring Campaign developed on 7 April. [...] According to this plan the Hungarian army had to split, General Lajos Aulich with the II. Hungarian Army Corps, and the division of Colonel Lajos Asbóth remained in front of Pest, doing such military maneuvers which have to make the imperials to believe that the whole Hungarian army is there, diverting their attention from north, where the real Hungarian attack had to start with the I., III. and the VII., corps which had to go westwards, on the northern bank of the Danube via Komárom, to relieve it from the imperial siege. The Kmety division of the VII. corps had to cover the three corps march, and after the I. and the III. corps occupied Vác, the division had to secure the town, while the rest of the troops together with the two remaining divisions of the VII. corps, had to advance to Garam river, than heading for the south to relieve the northern section of Austrian siege of the fortress of Komárom. After this, they had to cross the Danube and relieve the southern section of the siege. In the eventuality of finishing all of these with success, the imperials had only two chances: Or to retreat from Middle Hungary towards Viena, or face the encirclement from the Hungarian troops in Pest and Buda. This plan was very risky (as was the first plan of the Spring Campaign too) because if Windisch-Grätz had discovered that in front of Pest remained only a Hungarian corps, with an attack could destroy Aulich's troops, and with this he could easily cut the support lines of the main Hungarian army, and even occupy Debrecen, the seat of the Hungarian Revolutionary Parliament and the National Defense Committee (interim government of Hungary), or he could encircle the three corps advancing to relieve Komárom. [...] Although the president of the National Defense Committee (interim government of Hungary), Lajos Kossuth, who after the battle of Isaszeg, went to Gödöllő (the Hungarian headquarters), wanted a direct attack on Pest, finally was convinced by Görgei that his and the other generals plan is better. To secure the succes of the Hungarian army, the National Defense Committee sent from Debrecen 100 wagons with munitions. At 10 April the III. Hungarian army corps, led by General János Damjanich defeated in the Battle of Vác the Ramberg division led by Major General Christian Götz, who was fatally wounded. The imperial high commandment led by Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz even after this battle, was unsure if the main Hungarian army stayed before Pest of it already moved towards north, wanting to relieve Komárom.

40|$|California’s {{implementation}} of SB 375, the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008, is putting new pressure on communities to support infill and affordable housing development. As the San Francisco Bay Area adds two million new residents by 2035, infilling the core (in targeted Priority Development Areas, or PDAs) could accommodate {{over half of}} the new population, according to the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG).
