40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{connotation}} of agricultural listed {{company and the}} related researches on capital structure theory of enterprises in China. Based on this, research hypothesis is put forward. Capital structure has positive correlation with the scale, growth and debt paying ability of agricultural listed company, and has negative correlation with the profitability, operating capability and cash capacity. Taking 37 agricultural listed companies as the research samples, a total of 15 financial indices reflecting the growth, profitability, enterprise scale, operating capacity, cash capability and debt paying ability are selected to conduct factor analysis. Based {{on the principle of}} eigenvalue greater than 1, five factors are ascertained, which can explain 84. 04 % variance of original independent variables. Factor loading matrix indicates that these five factors can be named as debt paying factor, profitability factor, scale and growth factor, operating capacity factor and cash capability factor. Multiple linear regression is carried out by taking factor <b>score</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> as the independent variable, and asset-liability ratio of agricultural listed company as the dependent variable. Remove method is applied under 5 % significant level. And only profitability factor can pass the test. Result shows that there is significant negative correlation between profitability and asset-liability ratio, which is inconsistent with the assumption and has supported the Pecking Order Theory. The other four factors have not passed the significant test, and have certain negative correlation with the capital structure of enterprises. Among them, correlation between the capital structure and the debt paying factor and scale and growth factor is inconsistent with the assumption. Combining with the analysis result, corresponding countermeasures for optimizing the capital structure of agricultural listed company are put forward.

40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes twenty-four {{performance}} indices {{contained in}} the questionnaire that {{was used for the}} evaluation of the contributions of some factors to the current performance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Nigerian universities. The researchers surveyed forty five out of sixty three public universities that cut across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria by administering copies of the questionnaire at meetings with staff and students. The indices, through the responses, were subjected to factor analysis by principal components using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS). From this analysis, four factors; namely communication and feedback, study aid, processing and administration and management and relationship were extracted and the percentage contribution of each factor to the current performance of ICT in the university system in Nigeria was estimated. It was discovered that the total sum of the percentage contributions was less than 100. This showed that the performance indices of some extraneous factors which contribute in no small measure to the current performance of ICT in Nigerian universities were not given consideration in the research instrument. Such extraneous factors include but not limited to staff training, security of lives and properties, discipline among staff and student, curriculum and government policy on ICT. Moreover, a factor <b>scores</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> was generated and used to estimate and rank the contribution of each respondent to the performance figure...|$|R

DNAs were extracted from the young fresh leaves. Among 16 primer pairs tested for their ability to generate expected SSR banding patterns in Qatari date-palm genotypes, 10 primers successfully produced clear single bands in most of the studied genotypes. So, far, six SSR primers did not amplify clear bands in our genetic materials even using different PCR conditions. The amplified SSR band sizes ranged from 100 - 300 bp.

If the <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrices</b> do not commute, a necessary and sufficient condition for a common factor to exist is that a submatrix of the ratio (transfer) <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrices</b> is of less than full row rank. Whether <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrices</b> commute or not, a nonsingular (generalized) Sylvester matrix is always a sufficient condition for no common factors to exist. These conditions hold whether common factors are unimodular or not unimodular. These results follow from requiring that in the potential alternative pair of polynomial matrices with the same matrix ratio, i. e. with the same transfer function, all <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrices</b> beyond the given integers p and q are null matrices. Algebraically these requirements take the form of linear equations in the <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrices</b> of the inverse of the potential common factor. Lower block triangular Toeplitz matrices appear in these equations and the sequential inverse of these matrices generates sequentially the <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrices</b> of the inverse of the common factor.
