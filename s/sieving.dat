It is a filter feeder, <b>sieving</b> microscopic algae from water that passes through its gills. It is preyed on by starfish, octopuses and sea otters. It can detect predators by smell and by sight and can swim away from them by opening and closing its valves. Other organisms often grow on the exterior of its shell and it often forms a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on the upper valve and helps protect it from predators.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly larvae can {{be found}} in all feeding guilds in {{freshwater}} habitats. Most early stage larvae and some late stage ones are collector-gatherers, picking up fragments of organic matter from the benthos. Other species are collector-filterers, <b>sieving</b> organic particles from the water using silken nets, or hairs on their legs. Some species are scrapers, feeding on the film of algae and other periphyton that grows on underwater objects in sunlight. Others are shredder-herbivores, chewing fragments off living plant material while others are shredder-detritivores, gnawing at rotting wood or chewing dead leaves that have been pre-processed by bacteria and fungi; most of the nutrients of the latter group come from consumption of the bacteria and fungi. The predatory species either actively hunt their prey, typically other insects, tiny crustaceans and worms, or lie in wait for unwary invertebrates to come too close. A few species feed opportunistically on dead animals or fish, and some Leptoceridae larvae feed on freshwater sponges.|$|E

50|$|A prime <b>sieve</b> or {{prime number}} <b>sieve</b> is a fast type of {{algorithm}} for finding primes. There are many prime <b>sieves.</b> The simple <b>sieve</b> of Eratosthenes (250s BCE), the <b>sieve</b> of Sundaram (1934), the still faster but more complicated <b>sieve</b> of Atkin (2004), and various wheel <b>sieves</b> are most common.|$|R

25|$|Modern {{sieve shakers}} {{work with an}} {{electro-magnetic}} drive which moves a spring-mass system and transfers the resulting oscillation to the sieve stack. Amplitude and <b>sieving</b> time are set digitally and are continuously observed by an integrated control-unit. Therefore, <b>sieving</b> results are reproducible and precise (an important precondition for a significant analysis). Adjustment of parameters like amplitude and <b>sieving</b> time serves to optimize the <b>sieving</b> for different types of material. This method {{is the most common}} in the laboratory sector.|$|E
25|$|Most sieve {{analyses}} {{are carried out}} dry. But there are some applications {{which can only be}} carried out by wet <b>sieving.</b> This is the case when the sample which has to be analysed is e.g. a suspension which must not be dried; or when the sample is a very fine powder which tends to agglomerate (mostly < 45nbsp&µm) – in a dry <b>sieving</b> process this tendency would lead to a clogging of the sieve meshes and this would make a further <b>sieving</b> process impossible. A wet <b>sieving</b> process is set up like a dry process: the sieve stack is clamped onto the sieve shaker and the sample is placed on the top sieve. Above the top sieve a water-spray nozzle is placed which supports the <b>sieving</b> process additionally to the <b>sieving</b> motion. The rinsing is carried out until the liquid which is discharged through the receiver is clear. Sample residues on the sieves have to be dried and weighed. When it comes to wet <b>sieving</b> it is very important not to change the sample in its volume (no swelling, dissolving or reaction with the liquid).|$|E
25|$|A {{horizontal}} {{circular motion}} overlies a vertical motion which {{is created by}} a tapping impulse. These motional processes are characteristic of hand <b>sieving</b> and produce {{a higher degree of}} <b>sieving</b> for denser particles (e.g. abrasives) than throw-action sieve shakers.|$|E
50|$|The Legendre <b>sieve</b> has {{a problem}} with {{fractional}} parts of terms accumulating into a large error, which means the <b>sieve</b> only gives very weak bounds in most cases. For this reason it is almost never used in practice, having been superseded by other techniques such as the Brun <b>sieve</b> and Selberg <b>sieve.</b> However, since these more powerful <b>sieves</b> are extensions of the basic ideas of the Legendre <b>sieve,</b> it is useful to first understand how this <b>sieve</b> works.|$|R
50|$|In number theory, {{the larger}} <b>sieve</b> is a sifting device invented by P. X. Gallagher. The name denotes a {{heightening}} {{of the large}} <b>sieve.</b> In fact, combinatorial <b>sieves</b> like the Selberg <b>sieve</b> are strongest, when only a few residue classes are removed, while the term large <b>sieve</b> means that this <b>sieve</b> {{can take advantage of}} the removal of a large number of up to half of all residue classes. The larger <b>sieve</b> can exploit the deletion of an arbitrary number of classes.|$|R

25|$|A {{rotating}} slotted nozzle {{inside the}} <b>sieving</b> chamber {{and a powerful}} industrial vacuum cleaner which {{is connected to the}} chamber. The vacuum cleaner generates a vacuum inside the <b>sieving</b> chamber and sucks in fresh air through the slotted nozzle. When passing the narrow slit of the nozzle the air stream is accelerated and blown against the sieve mesh, dispersing the particles. Above the mesh, the air jet is distributed over the complete sieve surface and is sucked in with low speed through the sieve mesh. Thus the finer particles are transported through the mesh openings into the vacuum cleaner.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{an approach to}} automatic parallelisation of programs written in <b>Sieve</b> C++ (Codeplay’s C++ extension), using the <b>Sieve</b> compiler and runtime system. In <b>Sieve</b> C++, the programmer encloses a performance-critical region of code in a <b>sieve</b> block, thereby instructing the compiler to delay sideeffects {{until the end of}} the block. The <b>Sieve</b> system partitions code inside a <b>sieve</b> block into independent fragments and speculatively distributes them among multiple cores. We present implementation details and experimental results for the <b>Sieve</b> system on the Cell BE processor. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Sieve</b> {{cells are}} long, slender, {{conducting}} {{cells of the}} phloem that do not form a constituent element of a <b>sieve</b> tube, but which are provided with relatively unspecialized <b>sieve</b> areas, especially in the tapering ends of the cells that overlap those of other <b>sieve</b> cells. <b>Sieve</b> cells are typically associated with gymnosperms, because angiosperms have the more derived <b>sieve</b> tube members and companion cells in their phloem. They have a narrower diameter and are more elongated compared to <b>sieve</b> tube members. <b>Sieve</b> cells are associated with albuminous cells (also called Strasburger cells), which lack starch, thus {{making it possible to}} differentiate them from phloem parenchyma.|$|R

25|$|Gel {{electrophoresis}} uses a gel as an anticonvective medium and/or <b>sieving</b> medium during electrophoresis, {{the movement}} of a charged particle in an electrical field. Gels suppress the thermal convection caused by application of the electric field, and can also act as a <b>sieving</b> medium, retarding the passage of molecules; gels can also simply serve to maintain the finished separation, so that a post electrophoresis stain can be applied. DNA Gel electrophoresis is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after amplification of DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but {{may be used as}} a preparative technique prior to use of other methods such as mass spectrometry, RFLP, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, or Southern blotting for further characterization.|$|E
25|$|Rock garnet {{is perhaps}} the garnet type used for the longest period of time. This type of garnet is {{produced}} in America, China and western India. These crystals are crushed in mills and then purified by wind blowing, magnetic separation, <b>sieving</b> and, if required, washing. Being freshly crushed, this garnet has the sharpest edges and therefore performs far better than other kinds of garnet. Both {{the river and the}} beach garnet suffer from the tumbling effect {{of hundreds of thousands of}} years which rounds off the edges.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>sieve</b> analysis, a {{coarse-grained}} soil sample is shaken {{through a series}} of woven-wire square-mesh <b>sieves.</b> Each <b>sieve</b> has successively smaller openings so particles larger than the size of each <b>sieve</b> are retained on the <b>sieve.</b> The percentage of each soil size is measured by weighing the amount retained on each <b>sieve</b> and comparing the weight to the total weight of the sample. The results of a <b>sieve</b> analysis are plotted as a grain size distribution curve, which is then analyzed to determine the soil gradation of the particular soil.|$|R

25|$|Sediment or rock {{samples are}} {{collected}} from either cores or outcrops, and the microfossils they contain are extracted {{by a variety}} of physical and chemical laboratory techniques, including <b>sieving,</b> density separation by centrifuge or in heavy liquids, and chemical digestion of the unwanted fraction. The resulting concentrated sample of microfossils is then mounted on a slide for analysis, usually by light microscope. Taxa are then identified and counted. The enormous numbers of microfossils that a small sediment sample can often yield allows the collection of statistically robust datasets which can be subjected to multivariate analysis. A typical microfossil study will involve identification of a few hundred specimens from each sample.|$|E
25|$|Here a {{throwing}} motion acts on the sample. The vertical throwing {{motion is}} overlaid {{with a slight}} circular motion which results in distribution of the sample amount over the whole <b>sieving</b> surface. The particles are accelerated in the vertical direction (are thrown upwards). In the air they carry out free rotations and interact with the openings in the mesh of the sieve when they fall back. If the particles are smaller than the openings, they pass through the sieve. If they are larger, they are thrown upwards again. The rotating motion while suspended increases {{the probability that the}} particles present a different orientation to the mesh when they fall back again, and thus might eventually pass through the mesh.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{application}} of CE in forensic science {{is the development of}} methods for amplification and detection of DNA fragments using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which has to lead to rapid and dramatic advances in DNA typing in forensic. DNA separations are carried out using thin CE, 50-mm, fused silica capillaries filled with a <b>sieving</b> buffer. These capillaries have excellent capabilities to dissipate heat, permitting much higher electric field strengths to be used than slab gel electrophoresis. Therefore separations in capillaries are rapid and efficient. Additionally, the capillaries can be easily refilled and changed for efficient and automated injections. Detection occurs via fluorescence through a window etched in the capillary. Both single-capillary and capillary-array instruments are available with array systems capable of running 16 or more samples simultaneously for increased throughput.|$|E

500|$|Digging in swamps {{was more}} complicated; a longer spear (up to 8m) was often used, often {{fitted with a}} hooked end to scoop out the lumps. Scrub was often cleared first with fire; some got {{out of control and}} swamp fires could burn for weeks. Holes were often dug by teams in both hills and swamps—often up to 12m deep—and some {{wetlands}} were drained to aid in the excavation of gum. As field gum became scarce, [...] "bush gum" [...] was obtained by purposely cutting the bark of kauri trees and returning months later to retrieve the hardened resin. Due to the damage caused to the trees by the cutting the practice was banned in state forests in 1905. Gum chips, small lumps useful for the manufacture of linoleum, were difficult to find, and by 1910, the process of washing and <b>sieving</b> to retrieve the chips became common. The process was later mechanised.|$|E
