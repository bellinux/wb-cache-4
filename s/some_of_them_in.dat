A total of 30 competition venues across 14 municipalities were used for competition. Ten of these venues were newly built, while fifteen were renovated to stage the games.|$|E
5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an eccentric orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E
5|$|More than 300individuals {{were injured}} during the raid, {{including}} women and children; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> critical condition. Injured protesters {{were taken to}} the Salmaniya Medical Complex, many of them with broken limbs and open wounds. Four individuals were killed by police using shotguns, from close range. While two of them who were shot in the back, another protester was shot in the thigh and subsequently died at the SMC; the fourth {{was shot in the head}} later and died instantly. At least 25,000mourners took part at the funeral procession, which was held in Sitra on 18February for the three protesters originating from the island.|$|E

5|$|Sorabji's pianistic {{abilities}} {{have been}} the subject of much contention. After his early lessons, he appears to have been self-taught. In the 1920s and 1930s, when his works were being published for the first time and he was performing <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> public, there were controversies involving their alleged unplayability and his pianistic proficiency. At the same time, some people—particularly his closest friends—hailed him as a first-class virtuoso. From this disagreement it has been inferred that he was neither sloppy nor a player of the highest calibre. Sorabji repeatedly denied being a professional pianist and always focused primarily on composition; from 1939, he no longer practised the piano very often. He was a reluctant performer and had difficulty handling the pressure of performing in public. The private recordings that he made of some of his works in the 1960s contain substantial deviations from his scores (although largely due to his impatience and disinterest in playing clearly and accurately). This has been used to argue that the early criticisms of his playing were at least partly justified and that the negative reviews of his music by some of its first listeners were the result of flaws in his performances.|$|E

25|$|Spanish {{police have}} {{developed}} a global reputation for brutality after images of clashes between demonstrators and police were spread on social networks and international news 2011 and 2012.

25|$|In image processing, {{processed}} {{images of}} faces {{can be seen}} as vectors whose components are the brightnesses of each pixel. The dimension of this vector space is the number of pixels.

They are very useful for expressing any face image as a linear combination of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> the facial recognition branch of biometrics, eigenfaces provide a means of applying data compression to faces for identification purposes. Research related to eigen vision systems determining hand gestures has also been made.|$|E
