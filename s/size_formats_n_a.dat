Unlike the new one, the 1950 format is geographical. Until 2009, car plates had to be changed whenever the owner moved to another département or bought a car from a person living in a different département. The 1950 <b>format</b> uses <b>a</b> <b>N</b> X NN <b>format,</b> composed {{of a series of}} one to four numbers, one to three letters and a two-digit code corresponding to the département where the car is registered.|$|R
