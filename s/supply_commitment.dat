30|$|The {{case studies}} were {{selected}} to provide perspectives about different companies exporting different products {{to a range of}} different markets (Eisenhardt 1989). The criteria for a company's selection was that the company had suppliers who committed to supply on contract with specific product specifications in terms of timing of delivery, food safety, traceability, environmental sustainability, animal welfare and product quality. These suppliers need to keep farm management records and on farm management practices are audited to ensure they meet required animal health and welfare as well as environmental sustainability standards. The suppliers also need to meet specific specifications for things such as the age and weight of the animal and fat cover. The suppliers belonged to “producer groups” where they were had an ongoing <b>supply</b> <b>commitment</b> to the New Zealand exporter. In some cases they produced to requirements of particular retail customer or to specific quality specifications that met the requirements of a number of retail customers. These retail customers often visited the suppliers in New Zealand to communicate with the farmers and understand the farming and production practices in New Zealand.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new approach}} for selling rough diamonds through competitive auctions. The classical approach of De Beers—giving each customer a bag of stones and a take-it-or-leave-it price—worked well in near monopoly circumstances, but is ill-suited for competitive producers. Competitive producers, like BHP Billiton, benefit from getting the diamonds to those who value them the most. Beginning in 2008, BHP Billiton introduced a simple auction process to assign its Ekati diamonds to the highest bidders at competitive market prices. A Spot auction, ten times per year, is used to establish prices for each of nineteen deals of diamonds grouped by size, color, and quality. A Term auction allows customers to lock in a long-term <b>supply</b> <b>commitment</b> at prices indexed to future Spot auctions. A Specials auction, {{two or three times}} per year, prices large stones. The auctions use an ascending-clock format in which prices increase for each product until there is no excess demand. This approach allows customers to discover market prices, while managing portfolio and budget constraints. The approach has proven remarkably successful in pricing and allocating the mine’s output {{even in the face of}} the global financial crisis. diamond auctions, market design...|$|E

To reduce loss of sales caused by demand uncertainty, retailers {{can offer a}} fast-ship option to customers who experience stockout. The fast-ship option is a common practice {{that serves as a}} secondary source of supply. When this option is offered, the supply chain partners arrange to have out-of-stock items shipped directly from the supplier to willing customers at no additional cost to the customers. The fast-ship option serves as a mechanism by which inventory risk can be shared between the retailer and the supplier. We investigate the retailer's and the supplier's interactions when the fast-ship option is offered under different scenarios. More specifically, we characterize the supplier's and the retailer's ordering policies and investigate how the supplier and the retailer react to different levels of participation for fast-ship orders. We also study how the supplier can manage its risk by using either price markup or <b>supply</b> <b>commitment</b> under different supply contract structures.

40|$|The {{commercial}} energy {{relationship between the}} EU and Central Asia will be structured around gas above other hydrocarbons and minerals. More specifically, it would entail the provision of medium- to long-term volumes of around 15 bcm annually to supplement the core supply base from Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz II project. The crucial Central Asian state in this equation is Turkmenistan, which alone has the requisite volume availability for export. As such, the initial finding {{of this paper is}} that Turkmenistan should be the EU’s strategic priority for engagement on energy issues. The secondary findings of this working paper are that there is both a role for the EU in Turkmenistan and a willingness {{on the part of the}} Turkmen, if only on a tactical level, to engage. The EU, with European energy companies, can up their game by: i) actively seeking to resolve the long-standing maritime boundary dispute between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan; ii) seeking to secure a <b>supply</b> <b>commitment</b> on gas volumes from specified sources flowing through the proposed East-West pipeline; and iii) working to promote EU companies as the best technical and most environmentally responsible commercial partners to develop new onshore fields under a legal formula that protects all parties’ interests.

40|$|Key words: {{supply chain}} management, {{capacity}} planning, spot market, long-term contract, contract theoryThe long-term <b>supply</b> <b>commitment</b> is made deal through strategic {{interactions between the}} players of the supply chain. Game theoretical analysis is conducted to study the bargaining behaviors of the players. Optimal contract design can be obtained in various bargaining power scenarios: Contract Manufacturer Stackelberg, OEM Stackelberg, and Vertical Nash game. We also extend the analysis for single Contract Manufacturer and single contractual customer to multiple customers. The multi-units auction mechanism is also discussed briefly. This thesis studies the problem of strategic capacity planning for make-to-stock manufacturing systems {{in the presence of}} a spot market and a long-term contractual channel in a continuous-time infinite horizon setting. The spot market is run by a B 2 B online exchange where the sales and prices are random over time while the long-term contractual channel is established by a structured contract in which the price and volume to be delivered are pre-negotiated. Typically, we consider a supply chain which consists of an upstream manufacturer (e. g. Contract Manufacturer) and a downstream manufacturer (e. g. OEM). The two parties of the supply chain are linked by a long-term contract and both of the parties can trade in the spot market. To study the strategic behaviors of the contract manufacturer and the OEM, we first characterize the optimal operating strategies of the players under a specific contract and then analyze the influence of the contract terms on the optimal policies and the expected profit functions. We find that the optimal contracting strategy of the contract manufacturer can be characterized by a supply curve, which is a price-volume pair and strictly upward slopping, and the optimal contracting strategy of the OEM can be characterized by a demand curve, which is strictly downward slopping.

40|$|The {{possibility}} withmicro grids, {{smart energy}} buildings, customers with photovoltaic, storage or demand flexibility enables {{new opportunities for}} the energy system. This thesis is done in collaboration with an on-going-EU-funded project - Fossil- Free Energy District (FED), where Chalmers {{is one of the}} partners. The project aims to design and model a local energy market to establish what financial and energy gain there might be. This thesis sets out to design a local energy market, implement it in a computational model and simulate how this behaves during different scenarios. A model for a local energymarket has therefore been developed. The designed model is based on theory from energy markets as well as previous attempts to design a local energy market. The designed market has the possibility to trade both energy and reserve energy. The reason for this is to have the possibility to handle the inevitable demand and <b>supply</b> <b>commitment</b> errors made on the market ahead of delivery. The reserve market then balances the local energy market to deal with this issue. The model has then been implemented in GAMS with the purpose to simulate how the market would behave in different scenarios. The result from the computational model showed how the market players is able to trade both energy and reserve energy. The increase in energy equipment did not give a noticeable difference in energy traded but a major increase in reserve energy. The amount of energy traded was about 10 % of the total demand in the local energy market throughout all scenarios. The market was therefor highly dependent on the grid to provide the rest. The amount of reserve energy provided was increased with about 45 % if comparing the scenario with the least amount of energy equipment installation compared with the one with the most. The results illustrated how forecast errors, both regarding production and consumption, could use the reserves to balance their needs. The model results also showcase the problems, mainly with the price relations, occurring when it is integrated with other energy market such as Nordpool. The price of energy on the local energy market are very dependent of the intelligence obtained by the market players. If the market should be efficient, every market player needs to actively participating and every market player also needs to make wise decisions. Since these decisions are based on forecast, the intelligence required by the market players to make these is very high...|$|E

The supply contract linking the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) with its suppliers currently represents an important decision tool influencing the production and delivery of final products. The aim {{of this article is}} to investigate by simulation the sensitivity of the supply chain's performance to the variations of two main <b>supply</b> <b>commitments</b> negotiated by contract: flexibility rate and frozen horizon. Each partner belonging to the SC of the OEM performs its own production planning process. A generic analytical model is proposed and applied to simulate the decisional behaviour of each partner in planning its production activities. Contractual constraints (resulting from supply contracts) are formalised and incorporated into the model to allow the study of their impact. Experiments are carried out through a mobile phone SC case study confronted with market fluctuation. The performance of a partner and a SC is assessed via different indicators, mainly the cost and the reliability. The computational results address some managerial findings that are helpful in defining an interesting supply contract along the SC to achieve global performance...|$|R
40|$|The Italian gas {{market is}} the third largest in Europe with strong demand growth {{especially}} in the power generation sector up to the mid 2000 s. But projections of demand growth from that era have not been realised. Clearly {{the impact of the}} financial crisis and subsequent recession has had a significant impact, exacerbated by the growth in wind and solar generation capacity. Market liberalisation in the 2000 s failed to achieve levels of competition in the mid and downstream sectors to the extent seen in North West European markets. This resulted not only in some of the highest European end-user gas prices, but also delayed development of a liquid trading hub. Only in late 2012 did prices at the Italian gas hub PSV align with the prices at the Dutch gas hub TTF and other North West European hubs after capacity availability issues in linking infrastructure were resolved.

40|$|In an imperfectly {{competitive}} industry for a homogeneous good like electricity - with forward wholesale and retail markets - should upstream firms (generators) be vertically integrated with or separated from downstream firms (retailers) ? Left {{to their own}} devices will firms integrate or separate and how does this contribute to welfare? Vertical integration is often viewed by competition authorities regulators and policy-makers with suspicion but are these suspicions misplaced? We address these questions by developing a static and deterministic multi-stage game with oligopolies in both generation and retailing and endogenous choice by generators over the degree of vertical integration. Firms simultaneously compete in quantities in successive forward wholesale and retail markets with retailers able to purchase forward energy from generators. We find that total surplus consumer surplus and other welfare measures are unambiguously better under higher levels of vertical integration. According to many measures we find that "four is enough" i. e. that once a sector has four generators there are diminishing returns in terms of welfare from adding more generators. Moreover full integration is akin to "synthetic" generation - equivalent in welfare terms to adding an additional generator in an otherwise separated sector. Our analysis supports earlier research that shows integrated firms pursue a "raising rivals' costs" strategy - buying wholesale energy to increase the input cost of separated downstream rivals. However by adding forward contracting we also find that separated retailers pursue a counterveiling "over-buy and recycle" strategy - buying more energy forward than they need to meet their retail <b>supply</b> <b>commitments</b> and selling their surplus energy on the wholesale market. This not only protects them against the integrated firms' strategy {{but in the case of}} duopoly generation at least ensures that full integration is the generators' only equilibrium choice...|$|R

The research is designed to explore and improve WRAP/WAM capabilities as a decision-support tool for drought management. The WRAP/WAM model for the Colorado River Basin is applied in this research in both long-term planning and short-term conditional reliability modeling (CRM) modes. A strategy using iterative long-term simulations is developed for modeling water management plans that combine interruptible and firm water <b>supply</b> <b>commitments.</b> The methodology is tested and demonstrated by application to the LCRA System. Improvements in water supply reliabilities provided by off-channel storage are also investigated in the simulation study. The research is designed to explore and improve modeling capabilities in general, not to support specific decisions regarding water management in this particular river basin. CRM features in WRAP provide short-term storage frequency and supply reliability analyses conditioned on preceding reservoir storage and can be employed as a decision-support tool for water management during drought or operational planning studies for preparing for future drought. The research explores alternative methods and combinations of options for performing various CRM tasks and develops several additional new options.
