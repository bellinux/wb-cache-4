Starting the 2010-2011 school year, Fairfax HS has added another orchestra group. The Beginning Orchestra focuses on basic elements of music education and teaches the student fundamentals to prepare them and educate them on music. Intermediate are 2 different orchestras designed to test and challenge the musicians {{at a higher level}} (VBODA pieces grade 4 and 5). And the Advanced Orchestra (playing grade 6 pieces) is the highest level in the Orchestra Department. There are approximately 100 students in the Orchestra program for the enrollment of the 2009-2010 school year. The Orchestra annually participates in District Festival in which the orchestra plays a series of pieces and is graded on them. Often it is believed that the experience is a competition between schools, but it is highly encouraged that the competition be amongst and within the students. The Orchestra also attends a <b>Spring</b> <b>trip</b> annually to various places in America. Some examples include Atlanta, Orlando, New York, and Gatlinburg. The past school year of 2009-2010, the Fairfax High School Orchestra went to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for the annual <b>Spring</b> <b>Trip.</b> The Orchestra is also known for their pit appearances in school plays such as Beauty & the Beast and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.|$|R

50|$|Few {{individuals}} deserve {{more credit}} for {{the revival of the}} sport and industry of cross country skiing than Joe Pete Wilson. I have known Joe Pete for more than four decades. He always loomed larger than life in my eyes. I first encountered Joe Pete in the early 1970s when I was a fledgling cross country ski instructor. I saw a movie in which Joe Pete was the skier and I was amazed at his technique. I was an instructor at one of his franchised North America Nordic centers- Blackberry River Inn, CT. One of my early experiences with Joe Pete included a <b>spring</b> <b>trip</b> to Jackson, NH to attend a meeting of EPSTI instructors. All the instructors decided to take on the Wildcat Valley Trail, a challenging hunk of terrain especially under snow conditions that day. I was having a tough time of it and Joe Pete kept with me and offered continuous encouragement.|$|R
