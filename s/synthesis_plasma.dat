The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the mechanism of improved insulin sensitivity in the Ames dwarfs and the effects of CR on adipose signaling and metabolism in normal and dwarf mice. Enhanced insulin sensitivity in dwarf mice may be partly due to increased release of adiponectin and the reduced release of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). Altered levels of adipocytokines might be consequent to the decreased lipid <b>synthesis,</b> <b>plasma</b> triglycerides, and free fatty acid levels.
