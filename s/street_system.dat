5|$|A Caversham bypass was {{constructed}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was officially opened in 1987. It now carries State Highway 1 away from the retail heart of the suburb, connecting at its northern end with the city's one-way <b>street</b> <b>system.</b> With {{the construction of the}} bypass, Caversham Valley Road was truncated close to its junction with South Road, and the upper stretch of the road continued as part of State Highway 1, connecting the bypass with Dunedin Southern Motorway.|$|E
5|$|Third and Fourth streets, {{as part of}} the Coronado <b>street</b> <b>system,</b> {{have existed}} since the 19th century, and were paved in the early 20th century.

25|$|Windsor's French-Canadian {{heritage}} {{is reflected in}} French street names such as Ouellette, Pelissier, François, Pierre, Langlois, Marentette, and Lauzon. The current <b>street</b> <b>system</b> (a grid with elongated blocks) reflects the Canadien method of agricultural land division, where the farms were long and narrow, fronting along the river. Today, the north–south street name often indicates {{the name of the}} family that once farmed the land where the street is now located. The <b>street</b> <b>system</b> of outlying areas is consistent with the British system for granting land concessions. There is a significant French-speaking minority in Windsor and the surrounding area, particularly in the Lakeshore, Tecumseh and LaSalle areas.|$|E
25|$|The city of Strathcona {{had adopted}} a grid and {{quadrant}} system before its amalgamation with Edmonton, {{with the city}} being centred on Main Street (now 104 Street) and Whyte Avenue (also named 82 Avenue). This <b>street</b> <b>system</b> {{was similar to that}} of present-day Calgary's system, having NW, NE, SW and SE quadrants. Strathcona's grid/quadrant system was abandoned in 1914.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} end of the valley is usually referred to as The Gardens or The Gardens Corner (The Dunedin Botanical Gardens are located nearby). The Gardens Corner contains one of Dunedin's main retail areas, and also one of its busiest road intersections - here the Northern Motorway (State Highway 1 joins Dunedin's one-way <b>street</b> <b>system.</b> This area includes Dunedin North Intermediate School and several University halls, notably Knox College and Salmond College.|$|E

25|$|Notably, {{the county}} road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses {{perennial}} (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) {{in alphabetical order}} for North-South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e., Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for East-West roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton county just continues the numbered <b>street</b> <b>system</b> from Downtown Indianapolis from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.|$|E
25|$|The city is {{laid out}} on a grid-based <b>street</b> <b>system.</b> Streets run north-south and avenues run east-west. Streets are {{numbered}} by their block distance east or west of Main Street. Similarly, Avenues are numbered {{north and south of}} Central Avenue. There are four city quadrants (NW, SW, SE, NE) to describe the exact location of any given address. Main Street addresses are simply designated North and South. Central Avenue addresses are simply designated East and West. The grid addressing system carries over into the rural areas of Ward County, making the county one of only three that do not follow the statewide grid system in North Dakota (the others being Burleigh County and Grand Forks County).|$|E
25|$|Salt Lake City's surface <b>street</b> <b>system</b> is {{laid out}} on a simple grid pattern. Road names are {{numbered}} with a north, south, east, or west designation, with the grid originating at {{the southeast corner of}} Temple Square downtown. One of the visions of Brigham Young and the early settlers was to create wide, spacious streets, which characterizes downtown. The grid pattern remains fairly intact in the city, except on the East Bench, where geography makes it impossible. The entire Salt Lake Valley {{is laid out}} on the same numbered grid system, although it becomes increasingly irregular further into the suburbs. Many streets carry both a name and a grid coordinate. Usually both can be used as an address. US-89 enters the city from the northwest and travels the length of the valley as State Street (with the exception of northern Salt Lake City).|$|E

25|$|Villa Regina lies 250 meters (820ft) {{above sea}} level and is located along the Upper Río Negro (Black River) valley. It is {{within the limits of}} the General Roca {{department}} in the eastern Rio Negro province of northern Patagonia. Situated nearly 100 kilometers (62mi) west of Neuquén and 500 kilometers (310mi) northwest of Viedma, it is connected to the other cities in the orchard-rich Río Negro Valley via Highway 22. The region's landscape is characterized by a plateau to the north, the Río Negro Valley, and a plateau to the south. The plateaus have an average height of 100 meters (328ft). The town encompasses the territory between the northern plateau and the productive areas near the Río Negro's border, which runs along the southern plateau. It has an irregular <b>street</b> <b>system,</b> with a mixture of old and modern buildings in its center. The flora is typical of the Patagonian steppe and includes small bushes with scarce spiny foliage like larrea, alpataco and atriplex lampa.|$|E
25|$|The <b>street</b> <b>system</b> of Peoria {{is based}} on the city of Phoenix {{traditional}} grid system, with most roads oriented either north-south or east-west. The zero point is in downtown Phoenix at Central Avenue and Washington Street. Since Peoria is always west of zero, its north-south numbered Streets are Avenues. Major arterial streets are spaced one mile (1.6km) apart (until you are north of roughly Pinnacle Peak Road). The one-mile (1.6km) blocks are divided into approximately 800 house numbers although this varies. 83rd Avenue, being 8300 West. The numbers in Phoenix start at Central Avenue at a half-mile increment, going west to 7th Avenue ½ mile from Central but considered the arterial. Then the numbers go to 19th (1 mile from 7th), 27th, 35th, 43rd, 51st, 59th, 67th (in many places Peoria's eastern border), 75th, 83rd, 91st, 99th, and so on. In northern Peoria streets are more curvilinear and begin to not follow the north-south route due to rivers, mountains, and terrain challenges. The northern end of the city does still follow the alignment theory and still has blocking according to Phoenix.|$|E
500|$|Caversham [...] {{is one of}} {{the older}} suburbs of the city of Dunedin, in New Zealand's South Island. It is sited at {{the western edge of the}} city's central plain at the mouth of the steep Caversham Valley, which rises to the saddle of Lookout Point. Major road and rail routes south lie nearby; the South Island Main Trunk railway runs through the suburb, and a bypass skirts its main retail area, {{connecting}} Dunedin's one-way <b>street</b> <b>system</b> with the Dunedin Southern Motorway. The suburb is linked by several bus routes to its neighbouring suburbs and central Dunedin.|$|E

500|$|The {{intersection}} of Third Street and Orange Avenue {{dates back to}} at least 1890. Coronado began to commission the paving of much of its <b>street</b> <b>system</b> in the early 1910s. In November 1911, {{the board of trustees}} in Coronado approved the paving of Third Street from Orange Avenue to what was K Avenue. It soon became the goal of the city to have all streets paved before the 1915 San Diego World Exposition. The streets west of Orange Avenue were to be handled in one contract, using [...] "decomposed granite and oil." [...] Third Street had already been paved with this material by 1913.|$|E
500|$|In December 1943, Speer put Wolters {{in charge}} of {{planning}} for the reconstruction of bombed German cities. [...] Wolters organized a working group of about twenty architects and city planners, mostly from northern Germany. [...] The work of this group, known as the Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbauplanung (Task Force for Reconstruction Planning), would {{form the basis for}} the actual postwar reconstruction of Germany. [...] Speer, who authorized the group, saw an opportunity to make German cities more habitable {{in the age of the}} automobile. [...] The group sought solutions which would use the existing <b>street</b> <b>system,</b> rather than the grand ceremonial boulevards common in Nazi city planning. [...] In addition, the Arbeitsstab issued extensive guidelines, ranging from the width of avenues that carried streetcar lines to the ratio of theatre seats to inhabitants.|$|E
500|$|The 1970s saw {{numerous}} {{proposals for}} rehabilitating the neighbourhood, {{and it was}} defined as a zone of high-priority for reconstruction efforts. The administration responsible for preservation and construction in the Old City took Mamilla under its jurisdiction as well, both because of its proximity and its possession of many of the same considerations that the British weighed when regulating its development. A 1972 master-plan for revitalising the city centre transferred 100 of the 120 dunams (...) to Karta, the municipal firm led by architects Gilbert Weil and Moshe Safdie charged with the project, and called for the destruction of almost every building save the French Hospice St. Vincent de Paul.
