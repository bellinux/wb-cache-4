40|$|Lasalocid is an {{antibiotic}} {{from the group}} of carboxylic ionophores, produced by <b>Streptomyces</b> <b>lasaliensis.</b> But there was limited information of lasalocid on human prostate cancer cells. In the present studies, to better understand its effect in human prostate cancer cells, apoptosis and autophagy associated with possible signal pathways in vitro was examined. Our study showed that lasalocid mediated cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 phase by reducing G 1 phase dependent proteins, indicating entering into apoptotic cell death pathway. Lasalocid-induced apoptosis was involved with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial hyperpolarization. In addition, lasalocid induced autophagy through microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC- 3) -II conversion, acidic vesicular organelles formation and GFP-LC- 3 punctuate, which was inhibited by 3 -methyladenine (3 -MA), a widely used pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy. Furthermore, the autophagic phenomena were mediated by production of ROS, confirming that inhibition of ROS with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a ROS inhibitor, attenuated lasalocid-triggered autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy with 3 -MA enhanced the lasalocid-induced apoptosis through enhanced ROS generation. Taken together, lasalocid should be useful {{in the search for}} new potential chemotherapeutic agents for understanding the molecular mechanisms of anticancer in prostate cancer cells. clos...|$|E
40|$|Polycyclic {{polyether}} {{natural products}} have fascinated chemists and biologists alike owing to their useful biological activity, highly complex structure and intriguing biosynthetic mechanisms. Following the original {{proposal for the}} polyepoxide origin of lasalocid and isolasalocid and the experimental determination {{of the origins of}} the oxygen and carbon atoms of both lasalocid and monensin, a unified stereochemical model for the biosynthesis of polyether ionophore antibiotics was proposed. The model was based on a cascade of nucleophilic ring closures of postulated polyepoxide substrates generated by stereospecific oxidation of all-trans polyene polyketide intermediates. Shortly thereafter, a related model was proposed for the biogenesis of marine ladder toxins, involving a series of nominally disfavoured anti-Baldwin, endo-tet epoxide-ring-opening reactions. Recently, we identified Lsd 19 from the <b>Streptomyces</b> <b>lasaliensis</b> gene cluster as the epoxide hydrolase responsible for the epoxide-opening cyclization of bisepoxyprelasalocid A to form lasalocid A. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of Lsd 19 in complex with its substrate and product analogue to provide the first atomic structure-to our knowledge-of a natural enzyme capable of catalysing the disfavoured epoxide-opening cyclic ether formation. On the basis of our structural and computational studies, we propose a general mechanism for the enzymatic catalysis of polyether natural product biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutrition}} {{without any}} doubt is the parameter that most alters {{the age of}} slaughtering to bovine, therefore, our climatic conditions of drought and the seasonal production of forage limits the availability of nutrients, demanding dietary supplementation. A strategy of appropriate feeding would be destined to improve the forage use, maximizing the consumption and digestibility of the available forage. Among the alimentary supplements ionophores were initially used as coccidiostatic for birds, and during the seventies, it began {{to be used in}} the ruminant diet. The most used ionophores for ruminant are the sodium monensine produced by one strain of bacteria Streptomyces cinnamonensis and the sodic lasalocide produced by <b>Streptomyces</b> <b>lasaliensis</b> strain. The aim of this work was to evaluate the use of the ionophores (lasalocide and monensine) and urea, in Nelore calves as protein supplementation, in both males and females, during the reproduction cycle in the dry period. The study took place at Sol Nascente Farm, located at Caarapó, MS county. An entirely random design was adopted, with the treatments arranged as 2 sex by 4 additives as protein supplementation (without addictives or with urea, lasalocide or monensine), totaling 8 treatments with 12 repetitions. Analyzing the daily average weight increments in the total period the weight obtained did not show significant difference neither in the witness and among the animals fed with the addition of the additives, nor by sex...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} the genes for biosynthesis of the off-flavor terpenoid alcohol, 2 -methylisoborneol (2 -MIB), the key genes encoding monoterpene cyclase {{were located in}} bacterial genome databases by {{using a combination of}} hidden Markov models, protein–family search, and the sequence alignment of their gene products. Predicted terpene cyclases were classified into three groups: sesquiterpene, diterpene, and other terpene cyclases. Genes of the terpene cyclase group that form an operon with a gene encoding S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) -dependent methyltransferase were found in genome data of seven microorganisms belonging to actinomycetes, Streptomyces ambofaciens ISP 5053, Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2), Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350, <b>Streptomyces</b> <b>lasaliensis</b> NRRL 3382 R, Streptomyces scabies 87. 22, Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL 2338, and Micromonospora olivasterospora KY 11048. Among six microorganisms tested, S. ambofaciens, S. coelicolor A 3 (2), S. griseus, and S. lasaliensis produced 2 -MIB but M. olivasterospora produced 2 -methylenebornane (2 -MB) instead. The regions containing monoterpene cyclase and methyltransferase genes were amplified by PCR from S. ambofaciens, S. lasaliensis, and Saccharopolyspora erythraea, respectively, and their genes were heterologously expressed in Streptomyces avermitilis, which was naturally deficient of 2 -MIB biosynthesis by insertion and deletion. All exoconjugants of S. avermitilis produced 2 -MIB. Full-length recombinant proteins, monoterpene cyclase and methyltransferase of S. lasaliensis were expressed at high level in Escherichia coli. The recombinant methyltransferase catalyzed methylation at the C 2 position of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) in the presence of SAM. 2 -MIB was generated by incubation with GPP, SAM, recombinant methyltransferase, and terpene cyclase. We concluded that the biosynthetic pathway involves the methylation of GPP by GPP methyltransferase and its subsequent cyclization by monoterpene cyclase to 2 -MIB...|$|E
