500|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September 15, Hendrix was asked by his friend Eric Burdon, formerly of the Animals, {{if he wanted to}} participate in a jam session at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club with Burdon's newly formed band, War. Hendrix accepted, but {{when he arrived at the}} club that evening, he was not allowed to play due to his apparently drug-related disorientation. Burdon commented: [...] "Jimi came down and was well out of it. He... was wobbling too much to play, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to come back the following night." [...] Hendrix returned the next night and presented a healthier appearance. The crowd was enthusiastic and impressed by his performance despite his uncharacteristically subdued guitar playing when he sat in with War on [...] "Tobacco Road" [...] and [...] "Mother Earth". This was the last time Hendrix played guitar in public.|$|E
2500|$|Necrobutcher {{recalls how}} Euronymous {{told him of}} the suicide:Øystein called me {{up the next day}} ... and says, [...] "Dead has done {{something}} really cool! He killed himself". I thought, have you lost it? What do you mean cool? He says, [...] "Relax, I have photos of everything". I was in shock and grief. He was just thinking how to exploit it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "OK. Don't even fucking call me before you destroy those pictures".|$|E
2500|$|Bloomberg is {{in favor}} of {{providing}} tax breaks to big corporations {{for the good of the}} whole community. As mayor, Bloomberg lobbied the CEO of Goldman Sachs to establish its headquarters across from Ground Zero by promising $1.65 billion in tax breaks. Regarding this deal, Bloomberg stated, [...] "This [...] is where the best want to live and work. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> , 'We can help with minimizing taxes. Minimizing your rent. Improving security. But in the end, this is about people.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does he? Why {{should he}} think <b>so,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> know nothing? I {{tell you that}} I know {{absolutely}} nothing. I am ignorant whether he is dead or alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I took Peregrine Orme {{with me that}} I {{might have}} a witness, and I then asked him whether he had spread these reports. He {{acknowledged}} {{that he had done}} <b>so,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that he was a villain." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help {{laughing}} again, at his balancing all callings and professions <b>so</b> equally; and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R
2500|$|It was {{the success}} of his elder brother's fledgling {{television}} commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), that subsequently diverted his attention to film. His brother Ridley said, [...] "Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first. I told him, 'Don't go to the BBC, come to me first.' I knew that he had a fondness for cars, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> 'Come work with me and within a year you'll have a Ferrari.' And he did!" [...] Scott said, [...] "I was finishing eight years at art school, and Ridley had opened Ridley Scott Associates and said, 'Come and make commercials and make some money' because I owed money left and right and centre." [...] He directed many television commercials for RSA while also overseeing the company's operation while his brother was developing his feature film career. [...] "My goal was to make films but I got sidetracked into commercials and then I took off. I had 15 years , and it was a blast. We were very prolific, and that was our training ground. You'd shoot 100 days in a year, then we gravitated from that to film," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{composition}} of [...] "Oh Yeah", the album's best known track, Blank said, [...] "First I did the music and then I invited Dieter to sing along, and {{he came up with}} some lines which I thought, 'no Dieter, it's too complicated, we don't need that many lyrics'. I had the idea of just this guy, a fat little monster sits there very relaxed and says, [...] "Oh yeah, oh yeah". <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> 'Why don't you try just to sing on and on 'oh yeah'?... Dieter was very angry when I told him this and he said, 'are you crazy, all the time [...] "Oh yeah"? Are you crazy?! I can't do this, no no, come on, come on.' And then he said, 'some lyrics, like [...] "the moon... beautiful", is this too much?!' and I said, 'no, it's OK', and then he did this 'oh yeah' and at the end he thought, 'yeah it's nice', he loved it himself also. And also I wanted to install lots of human noises, all kind of phonetic rhythms with my mouth; you hear lots of noises in the background which are done with my mouth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about her}} {{relationship}} with Prince {{in an interview with}} Norwegian station NRK in November 2014 she said, [...] "I did meet him a couple of times. [...] We didn’t get on at all. [...] In fact we had a punch-up." [...] She continued: [...] "He summoned me to his house after 'Nothing Compares 2U'. I made it without him. [...] I’d never met him. [...] He summoned me to his house – and it’s foolish to do this to an Irish woman – he said he didn’t like me saying bad words in interviews. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to fuck off....He got quite violent. I had to escape out of his house at 5 in the morning. He packed a bigger punch than mine." [...] She told a similar story to an interviewer from Hot Press in December 1990. Prince said the events she described never took place, replying to the allegations in his song [...] "Days of Wild", which deals with misogyny. In a 2004 interview with Graham Norton, O'Connor claimed that the story was [...] "much exaggerated by the press" [...] and referred to him as [...] "a sweet guy".|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> it to <b>him,</b> he and I being alone, for he {{commanded}} his councillors and servants to retire out of hearing.|$|R
6000|$|... "What! Then my wretched {{attempt to}} have Marmaduke warned was useless. Oh, Nelly, {{this is too}} bad. Do you really think <b>so?</b> When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> before dinner what Mrs. Leith Fairfax wrote, he only said he feared it was true, and refused {{to give me the}} address." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{just gone}} on up home, {{and he sent}} me round with his apologies. He sees {{now that he had}} no {{business}} to speak to you as he did, and he withdraws everything. He'd 'a' come round himself if I'd said <b>so,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> could make it all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fer once I don't {{agree with}} you. I knew {{how it was}} with him <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> I knew how it was with you <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> and I {{know how it is}} with me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that too." ...|$|E
60|$|BENNET. I don't think <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{you would}} be here about eleven.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think it}} 'ud matter," [...] he mumbled. [...] "A fellow with tortoiseshell-rimmed specs asked me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> How was I to know--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But mine to him {{is equally}} sacred. I shall still be engaged to <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how it would be. I said that, {{as long as you}} or Mamma lived, I would never marry without your leave. Nor would I see him, or write to him without your knowledge. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>so.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> also that <b>I</b> would always be true to him. I mean to keep my word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right. And {{what you}} are to {{understand}} is this; Mr. Graham will now be privileged by your mother and me to address you. He has already asked my permission to do <b>so,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> must consider the matter before I either gave it or withheld it. I shall now give him that permission." [...] Whereupon Madeline made her answer by a slight pressure upon his arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so, Janet. He {{will not}} deny that <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>so.</b> When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> was sure {{that he would have}} {{declined}} such an engagement. But he did not, and I had no way of escape. Janet, if you could know what I have been suffering, you would not be cruel to me. Think what it would have been to you to have to marry a man you did not love, and to break the heart of one you did love. Of course Mr. Gilmore is your friend." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how--the {{commission}} on which I had been sent, the storm which had detained me, the abruptness of the lady, {{the kindness of}} the priest.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything, {{of course}} leaving out all details. Even then the tale was long, {{though it did}} not seem to be one that wearied my hearers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{not thought}} about that at all, {{when he came to}} me. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that I would {{consider}} it all, and that he must come again." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{hearing him}} declare himself <b>so</b> open, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that my curse instead of my blessing would pursue my {{daughter}} {{for being the}} author of all the mischiefs that had happened between us. [...] "No, madam," [...] said he, [...] "if you had looked upon her as a daughter heretofore, I should have had no occasion to have had any breach with you. The whole fault lies at your own door; for whatever your griefs may inwardly be, I would have you recollect they were of your own choosing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have told}} Tom, love, as we agreed, {{that we are}} not going to permit him to run away, and that we cannot {{possibly}} allow it. The loss of one person, and such a person as Tom, too, out of our small household of three, is not to be endured; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> Whether he is considerate, or whether he is only selfish, I don't know. But he needn't be considerate, for he is not the least restraint upon us. Is he, dearest Ruth?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your husband {{more than}} anybody! I love him, I revere him. He is so noble; he is <b>so</b> good! If <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>I</b> {{am going to}} tell you, he would despise me. Own it plainly, Lucy, if I am asking too much in asking you to keep a secret from your husband." ...|$|R
60|$|Now I {{reflected}} {{that there could}} be little harm in repeating to this strange doctor what so many already knew. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything, and the tale was long.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Papa and mamma {{were both}} as kind as {{possible}} to Philip,' continued Amabel; 'but they {{could not bear to}} enter on that. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> you had told all, and he was very glad.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{last words}} brought him round, {{and he took}} his hands of. [...] "I have seen two of them within this minute," [...] said I. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what I had told Harry Charker.|$|E
6000|$|... "But thee wilt see him smile, to-morrow," [...] said Adam. [...] "He {{asked after}} thee {{the first thing}} {{when he began to}} come round, and we could talk to one another. 'I hope she isn't altered,' he said, 'I {{remember}} her face <b>so</b> well.' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> 'no,'" [...] Adam continued, looking fondly at the eyes that were turned towards his, [...] "only a bit plumper, as thee'dst a right to be after seven year. 'I may come and see her to-morrow, mayn't I?' he said; 'I long to tell her how I've thought of her all these years.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Next day, {{after a long}} lying-in-wait, I intercepted Adam Waggett and beckoned {{him into}} the shrubbery. First I {{questioned}} him. A bill of the circus, he told me, had already been left at the lodge. Its tents and booths and Aunt Sallies were even now being pitched in a meadow three or four miles distant and this side the neighbouring town. So far, <b>so</b> good. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> my plan. He could do nothing but {{look at me like}} a fish, with his little black eyes, as I sat on a tree stump and marshalled my instructions.|$|R
6000|$|When he {{got along}} I was {{hard at it}} taking up a [...] "trot" [...] line. He abused me a little for being <b>so</b> slow; but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> fell in the river, {{and that was what}} made me <b>so</b> long. <b>I</b> knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines and went home.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the {{outlines}} of our tale; {{for an hour or}} more I told it while he sat opposite to us swaying his head like a tortoise and saying nothing. At length it was done.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought his}} fielding wanted working up a bit, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{to turn out}} at six {{tomorrow}} morning. He said he wouldn't, so we argued it out. He's going to all right. So is Robinson." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{it was of}} no use {{getting angry}} with Waterford, {{especially}} as I saw he intended walking {{all the way down}} to the ferry with me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I didn't live in any house at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Toby, slowly, as if {{he feared}} he might provoke one of those terrible {{laughing}} spells again, [...] "I saw him tonight, an' he looked {{as if he}} knew what <b>I</b> was doin'; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> up an' <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> an' <b>I</b> didn't know but he'd told you, though he didn't look to me like a feller that would be mean." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was quite}} funny, really. I knew the prince played water polo {{and that he}} was {{selected}} to represent at the 2002 Commonwealth Championships in Manchester. <b>So</b> when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>I</b> did, he smiled and bowed. I gave him a book Warriorsand some Australian water polo cossies. He said: 'Oh, bathers' and then someone <b>told</b> <b>him</b> they were also known as budgie smugglers. The prince laughed and from then on he wanted to know all about me, the national team, the Olympics. He didn't want to talk about himself at all. Alicia McCormack McCormack was born on 7 June 1983 in Helensburgh, New South Wales. [...] She is 168 cm tall, weighs 73 kg, is right handed and has a tattoo featuring the Olympic rings.|$|R
6000|$|... 'John,' she cried, '--drat that man, {{where is}} 'e? John, dear, you just putt your 'at on, and purtend to run {{round the corner}} a bit to Aston's the pawnbroker's. The Lord have mercy upon me for the stories I've been a-tellin' of 'em, but I couldn't bear to see them two pore things a-pawnin' their little bits of jewelry and sich, and Mr. Le Breting, too, 'im as ain't fit to go knockin' {{together}} with underbred folks like pawnbrokers. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> as you'd take 'em round and pawn 'em for 'im yourself; not as I don't suppose you've never pawned nothink in your 'ole life, John, leastways not since ever you an' me kep' company, for afore that I suppose you was purty much like other young men is, John, for all you shakes your 'ead at it now so innocent like. But you just run round, there's a dear, and make as if you was goin' to the pawnbroker's, and then you come straight 'ome again unbeknown to 'em. I ain't a goin' to let them two pore dears go pawnin' their things for a dinner nohow. You take them two suvverins out of your box, John, and putt away these 'ere little things for the present time till the pore souls is able to pay us, and if they never don't, small matter neither. Now you go fast, John, there's a dear, and come back, and mind you give them two suvverins to Mr. Le Breting as natural like as ever you're able.' ...|$|R
