50|$|In April 1963 Mike Burns first {{flew the}} <b>Skiplane,</b> a {{flexible}} wing glider on pontoons. In September 1963, Australian inventor John Dickenson {{set out to}} build a water ski wing that could be released at altitude and glide to a safe landing. After seeing a gliding parachute in a magazine, Dickenson designed the ski kite he called the Ski Wing. Dickenson fashioned an airframe that incorporated a triangle control frame and utilized wire bracing to distribute the load to the Rogallo airfoil; the pilot sat on a swinging seat. Dickenson's Ski Wing was stable and controllable, unlike the flat manned kites used at water ski shows at the time.|$|E
50|$|Publicity {{from the}} Fleep and the Paresev tests sparked {{interest}} in the design among several tinkerers, including Barry Palmer, and Sport Aviation of 1962 shown Jim Hobson of Experimental Aircraft Association (wing shown on US national TV in Lawrence Welk Show in 1962). An Australian engineer Mike Burns developed and used the boat-towed Rogallo-airfoiled <b>SkiPlane</b> starting in 1962 through the 1960s. A fellow countryman of Mike Burns, John W. Dickenson, made ski-kites and eventually partnered with Mike Burns to improve the ski-kite; he formatted a ski-kite that used what {{could be found in}} the 1929 George A. Spratt simple triangle control bar or A-frame with single-point pendulum weight-shift control.|$|E
5000|$|While {{based on}} the design of the earlier Cubs, the {{addition}} of an electrical system, flaps (3 notches), and a considerably more powerful engine (150 hp), make it a very different flying experience. Although the [...] "standard" [...] Super Cub was fitted with a 150-horsepower (112 kW) Lycoming engine, {{it is not uncommon to}} see them equipped with a 160-horsepower O-320-B2B, or even 180 horsepower (134 kW) Lycoming O-360 powerplant. The high-lift wing and powerful engine made the Super Cub a prime candidate for conversion to either floatplane or <b>skiplane.</b> In addition, the PA-18A (an agricultural version) was produced for applying either dry chemical or liquid spray.|$|E
5000|$|On 23 January 2013, C-GKBC (c/n:650), a Kenn Borek Air DHC-6 Twin Otter <b>skiplane,</b> {{with three}} Canadians on board, crashed onto Mount Elizabeth. The Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) was {{detected}} {{on the same}} day. The plane had been en route from the South Pole's Amundsen-Scott US station to Terra Nova Bay's Zucchelli Italian station, operating {{under the auspices of}} the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA). The aircraft was found on 25 January 2013. It had impacted at the 13,000 foot level. The New Zealand helicopter rescue team which spotted the wreckage reported that the accident was not survivable. Canada has jurisdiction in investigating the crash. Recovery efforts were ended on 27 January, after having recovered the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), due to unsafe conditions.|$|E

5000|$|Aqua-glider:These various-formed manned kites were kited behind tow boats over water. Air Force Lt. Col. Bill Skliar in 1959 {{designed}} a biplane kite glider nicknamed Bayou Bird. In 1961, Tom H. Purcell {{designed a}}nd flew an aluminum-framed Fleep-like Rogallo hang glider kite over land; in 1962, he kited the same wing (but pontooned) while over water. His effort was imaged and noted in Skysurfer Magazine in its May/June issue of 1973, published by EAA inductee Michael Markowski, author of Hang Glider's Bible. The 1962 Mike Burns <b>SkiPlane</b> and 1963 Dickenson wings closely matched the Purcell, Barry Hill Palmer, and the Charles Richard NASA Paresev 1B wing; minor control sticks {{derived from the}} triangle control frame were used {{in each of these}} kites (which sometimes glided). These kites, towed high, could stop their kiting and release into a glide. See section [...] "B" [...] for boats that have a major operating sector as a kite (for example, a 1930 Peel Glider Boat).|$|E
5000|$|On November 23, 1948, Francis Rogallo and Gertrude Rogallo {{applied for}} a kite patent for a fully {{flexible}} kited wing with approved claims for its stiffenings and gliding uses; the flexible wing or Rogallo wing, which in 1957 the American space agency NASA began testing in various flexible and semi-rigid configurations {{in order to use}} it as a recovery system for the Gemini space capsules. The various stiffening formats and the wing's simplicity of design and ease of construction, along with its capability of slow flight and its gentle landing characteristics, did not go unnoticed by hang glider enthusiasts. In 1960-1962 Barry Hill Palmer adapted the flexible wing concept to make foot-launched hang gliders with four different control arrangements. In 1963 Mike Burns adapted the flexible wing to build a towable kite-hang glider he called <b>Skiplane.</b> In 1963, John W. Dickenson adapted the flexible wing airfoil concept to make another water-ski kite glider; for this, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale vested Dickenson with the Hang Gliding Diploma (2006) for the invention of the [...] "modern" [...] hang glider. [...] Since then, the Rogallo wing has been the most used airfoil of hang gliders.|$|E
5000|$|On October 4, 1957, the Russian Sputnik began beeping {{its message}} from orbit, and {{everything}} changed. The space race caught {{the imagination of}} the newly formed NASA and Rogallo was in position to seize the opportunity. The Rogallos released their patent to the government, and with Rogallo's help at the wind tunnels, NASA began a series of experiments testing the Parawing (NASA renamed the Rogallo wing the Parawing, and modern hang glider pilots often refer to it as the flexible Rogallo wing) at altitudes up to 200,000 feet and as fast as Mach 3 [...] in order to evaluate them as alternative recovery system for the Gemini space capsules and used rocket stages. By 1960, NASA had made test flights of a framed Parawing powered aircraft, called the [...] "flying Jeep" [...] or Fleep, and of a weight shift Parawing glider, called Paresev, in a series of several shapes and sizes, manned and unmanned. A key wing configuration applying Francis Rogallo's leadership that gave base to kited gliders with hung pilots using weight-shift control was designed by Charles Richards and constructed by the Richards team in 1961-2; such wing became a template for recreational use or Rogallo's inventions, ending up mechanically and ornamentally in <b>Skiplane,</b> ski-kites, and hang gliders of the 1960-1975.|$|E
