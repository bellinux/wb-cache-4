40|$|We {{previously}} described a somatic cell expressing a variant H- 2 Dd molecule {{that did not}} serve as a target for alloreactive anti-Dd CTL. The mutant cell line had been isolated by its failure to express a serological epitope present on the H- 2 Dd alpha 3 domain. In the present study the alpha 3 domain of the Dd molecule of this <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>variant</b> was sequenced and a single nucleotide change resulting in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at residue 227 was identified. This change was reproduced in the cloned H- 2 Dd gene by oligonucleotide- directed mutagenesis. Cells transfected with this mutant gene were not killed by anti-H- 2 Dd CTL. Because previous studies using hybrid H- 2 class I molecules had established that the alpha 3 domain does not express allele-specific determinants recognized by CTL, our results raise the possibility that residues in the alpha 3 domain of H- 2 class I molecules are critical for CTL recognition and constitute a conserved (or monomorphic) determinant recognized by CTL...|$|E

40|$|Human <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>variants</b> {{resistant}} to the arginine analog, canavanine, express 200 -fold increased levels of argininosuccinate synthetase (AS) mRNA as compared to parental cells. In this study we examined whether AS cDNA sequences contain cis- acting regulatory elements {{that are involved in}} the induction of AS mRNA in canavanine-resistant cells. Minigene constructs containing AS cDNA sequences under the transcriptional control of a viral promoter were stably transfected into the human squamous cell carcinoma line, RPMI 2650. Upon conversion of cells to canavanine-resistance, expression of the endogenous AS gene increased by two orders of magnitude as expected. Surprisingly, however, expression of AS cDNA minigenes decreased 10 - to 15 - fold in canavanine-resistant <b>cell</b> <b>variants.</b> The observed down-modulation of AS cDNA minigene expression was dependent upon a concomitant induction of the endogenous AS gene and not simply expression of the canavanine-resistant phenotype. This paradoxical regulation was specific for AS gene sequences since a minigene containing the neomycin-resistance gene in place of AS cDNA sequences failed to regulate. Furthermore, minigenes lacking {{a substantial portion of the}} AS cDNA also failed to exhibit the down-modulation. These findings suggest that expression of the human AS gene is regulated by a specific and limiting, positively-acting, trans- acting mechanism in canavanine-resistant cells and that exogenous AS cDNA (mRNA) sequences can compete for this mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Interferons, in {{addition}} to their antiviral activity, induce a multiplicity of effects on different cell types. Interferon (IFN) - 3, exerts a unique regulatory effect on cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. To investigate whether the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of IFN- ~ in macrophages can be geneticaUy dissociated, and whether IFN-ot and IFN- 3, use the same cellular signals and/or effector mechanisms to achieve their biologic effects, we have derived a series of <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> genetic <b>variants</b> resistant to the antiproliferative and/or antiviral activities of IFN- 3,.

DAP-resistant (DAPr) fibroblast variants were recovered at a median frequency of 12 × 10 − 5 from individual ears from progeny of crosses between mouse strains 129 /Sv and C 3 H/HeJ. The frequency of DAPr variants varied greatly among individual ears, suggesting that they preexisted in vivo and arose at various times during development. Polymorphic molecular markers and a cytological marker on the centromere of chromosome 8 {{made it possible to}} discriminate between each of six possible mechanistic pathways of LOH. The majority (about 80 %) of the DAPr variants were a consequence of mitotic recombination. The prevalence of mitotic recombination in regions proximal to Aprt did not correlate with meiotic map distances. In particular, there was a higher than expected frequency of crossovers within the interval 59 cM to 67 cM. The high spontaneous frequency of Aprt LOH, mediated primarily by mitotic recombination, is fully consistent with our previous results with human peripheral T cells from individuals known to be heterozygous at APRT. Thus, this Aprt heterozygote mouse is a valid model for studying somatic mutagenesis and mitotic recombination in vivo...|$|R
40|$|A {{hierarchy}} of liver-enriched transcription factors {{plays an important}} role in activating expression of many hepatic genes. In particular, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF- 4) is a major activator of the gene encoding HNF- 1, and HNF- 1 itself activates expression of more than 20 liver genes. To dissect this activation pathway genetically, we prepared <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>variants</b> that were deficient in expression of the liver-specific alpha 1 -antitrypsin (alpha 1 AT) gene, which requires both HNF- 1 and HNF- 4 for high-level gene activity. This was accomplished in two steps. First, hepatoma transfectants that stably expressed two selectable markers under alpha 1 AT promoter control were prepared; second, variant sublines that could no longer express either transgene were isolated by direct selection. In this report, we demonstrate that the variants contain defects in the HNF- 4 /HNF- 1 activation pathway. These defects functioned in trans, as expression of many liver genes was affected, but the variant phenotypes were recessive to wild type in <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> hybrids. Three different variant classes could be discriminated by their phenotypic responses to ectopic expression of either HNF- 4 or HNF- 1. Two variant clones appeared specifically deficient in HNF- 4 expression, as transfection with an HNF- 4 expression cassette fully restored their hepatic phenotypes. Another line activated HNF- 1 in response to forced HNF- 4 expression, but activation of downstream genes failed to occur. One clone was unresponsive to either HNF- 1 or HNF- 4. Using the variants, we demonstrate further that the chromosomal genes encoding alpha 1 AT, aldolase B, and alpha-fibrinogen display strict requirements for HNF- 1 activation in vivo, while other liver genes were unaffected by the presence or absence of HNF- 1 or HNF- 4. We also provide evidence for the existence of an autoregulatory loop in which HNF- 1 regulates its own expression through activation of HNF- 4...|$|R
40|$|Developmentally {{regulated}} {{expression of}} {{the products of the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is thought to {{play a key role in}} maternal tolerance of the fetal allograft. Here we analyze a cell line (EE 2 H 3), derived from early post-implantation-stage mouse embryos, that is defective for MHC class I assembly. To follow expression of a single well-defined class I product, we introduced the H- 2 Dd gene under control of the human beta-actin promoter. We found that the transfected EE 2 H 3 cells expressed abundant levels of H- 2 Dd heavy chains and beta 2 -microglobulin protein, but only small amounts of H- 2 Dd surface protein. Surface expression was rescued by the addition of an appropriate antigenic peptide, or by culturing the cells at low temperature. The phenotype exhibited by EE 2 H 3 is thus remarkably similar to that described for class I-negative <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>variants</b> selected using antibodies and complement. However, a striking difference was that surface expression in H- 2 Dd-transfected EE 2 H 3 cells was markedly enhanced in response to treatment with interferon. Thus, we have identified a novel class I assembly-defective cell line. Considering that EE 2 H 3 was established from primary cultures of mouse embryo cells without immunoselection, and is therefore likely to represent a cell population normally present in post-implantation-stage embryos, these findings raise the possibility that expression of class I surface antigens during early development may in part be controlled post-translationally at the level of MHC class I assembly...|$|R
40|$|The p 53 tumor {{suppressor}} protein {{participates in}} multiple cellular processes including cell cycle checkpoints and programmed cell death. In cell lines, loss of p 53 function {{is associated with}} increased genetic instability including aneuploidy, gene amplification, and point mutation. Although similar genetic instability often accompanies the progression of malignancy in tumors, its role in tumor initiation in normal cells is not clear. To study whether or not loss of p 53 leads to genetic instability in normal cells in vivo, we have examined mechanisms of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the Aprt (adenine phosphoribsyltransferase) and flanking loci in normal fibroblasts and T lymphocytes of p 53 -deficient mice. <b>Somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>variants</b> that arose in vivo {{as a consequence of}} genetic or epigenetic alterations abolishing Aprt function were selected and expanded in vitro by virtue of their resistance to 2, 6 -diaminopurine (DAP). We observed that p 53 null mice produced about three times as many DAP-resistant fibroblast colonies than wild-type mice, but the frequency of DAP-resistant T lymphocyte colonies was not significantly changed. Mitotic recombination, but not point mutation, partly accounted for the increase in the frequency of DAP-resistant fibroblasts. Most significantly, chromosome loss/duplication and interstitial deletion, which were extremely rare events in the wild-type mice, represented a significant proportion of LOH events in both fibroblasts and T lymphocytes of p 53 null mice. Also, increased interstitial deletion was observed in fibroblasts of p 53 heterozygous mice. These data suggest that increased genetic variation, including chromosome instability, starts at the initiation stage of tumorigenesis when functional p 53 is absent or reduced...|$|R
40|$|We have {{generated}} several cell lines that express an altered H- 2 Dd molecule. These cell lines, which {{were selected for}} by the failure to express the serological specificity reacting with the monoclonal antibody 34 - 2 - 12, have also undergone alterations in epitopes recognized by CTL. One of the mutants, 2. 12 (- 4) was not killed by an allogeneic anti-Dd CTL line, CTLL-A 2, even though this line was cytotoxic for the parental cell line and two other 34 - 2 - 12 - mutant lines. Two of the 34 - 2 - 12 - mutant lines had an identical serological profile using other monoclonal Dd antibodies, however these two mutants differed markedly in their susceptibility to cytotoxicity by CTLL-A 2. In addition to the determinants recognized by allogeneic CTL we also examined {{the effect of the}} mutation on the determinants involved in restricting the anti-FITC modified-self-cytotoxic response. An anti- FITC-Dd CTL line did not react with two of the mutants and reacted only weakly with the other mutant, demonstrating not only that the Dd epitopes recognized by this cell line and the allogeneic CTL were different, but also that it is possible for a H- 2 class I molecule to express epitopes recognized by allogeneic CTL but not epitopes that function as restricting elements to certain antigens. The observation that both T cell- and B cell-defined determinants were altered in these mutant cell lines is in contrast to the findings, with the mutant mouse strains which were selected for by changes in T cell-defined determinants, which show few, if any, alterations to serological specificities. Characterization of T cell-recognized epitopes expressed on serologically selected <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>variants</b> may therefore prove to be most useful for the study of structure-function relationships of H- 2 class I molecules...|$|R
40|$|From the {{progenies}} of a telotrisomic of chromosome 9 {{short arm}} of an indica rice variety, Zhongxian 3037, a phenotypical variant was selected.

40|$|The NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) {{project and}} the NIH Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) {{together}} define a set of ∼ 30, 000 nonredundant human mRNA sequences with identified coding regions representing 17, 000 distinct loci. These high-quality mRNA sequences allow for the identification of transcribed regions in the human genome sequence, and many researchers accept them as the correct representation of each defined gene sequence. Computational comparison of these mRNA sequences and the recently published essentially finished human genome sequence reveals several thousand undocumented nonsynonymous substitution and frame shift discrepancies between the two resources. Additional analysis is undertaken to verify that the euchromatic human genome is sufficiently complete—containing nearly the whole mRNA collection, thus allowing for a comprehensive analysis to be undertaken. Many of the discrepancies {{will prove to be}} genuine polymorphisms in the human population, <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> genomic <b>variants,</b> or examples of RNA editing. It is observed that the genome sequence variant has significant additional support from other mRNAs and ESTs, almost four times more often than does the mRNA variant, suggesting that the genome sequence is more accurate. In ∼ 15 % of these cases, there is substantial support for both variants, suggestive of an undocumented polymorphism. An initial screening against a 24 -individual genomic DNA diversity panel verified 60 % of a small set of potential single nucleotide polymorphisms from which successful results could be obtained. We also find statistical evidence that a few of these discrepancies are due to RNA editing. Overall, these results suggest that the mRNA collections may contain a substantial number of errors. For current and future mRNA collections, it may be prudent to fully reconcile each genome sequence discrepancy, classifying each as a polymorphism, site of RNA editing or <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> variation, or genome sequence error...|$|R

The role of <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> in dairy processes and products is ill-defined in most studies because the role of these cells combines also the concomitance of physicochemical modifications of milk, bacterial count, and the udder inflammation in the presence of high <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count. The aim of this review is to focus on the role of <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> themselves and of endogenous enzymes from <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> in milk, in dairy transformation processes, and in characteristics of final products overcoming biases due to other factors. The immune function of <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> in the udder defense and their protective role in milk will be primarily considered. Different characteristics of milk induced by various <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> counts, types, and their endogenous enzymes influencing directly the technological properties of milk and the final quality of dairy products will be discussed as well. By comparing methods used in other studies and eliminating biases due to other factors not considered in these studies, a new approach has been suggested to evaluate the effective role of <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> on dairy processes and products. In addition, this new approach allows the characterization of <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> and their endogenous enzymes and, in future research, will allow the clarification of mechanisms involved in the release of these components from <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> during dairy processes, particularly in cheese technologies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Somatic</b> <b>cell</b> {{count is}} a key method used to {{evaluate}} the quality of milk in today’s growing dairy sheep industry. <b>Somatic</b> <b>cells</b> are body cells, primarily the white blood cells, found in a milk sample. If an infection such as mastitis is present, the number of <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> in the milk increases (Gonzalo, et al. 1992). Producers routinely perform <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> counts on cow and goat milk. For dairy cattle in the United States, the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count can not exceed 750, 000 cells per milliliter, for commercial milk. For dairy goats the accepted limit is 1, 000, 000 cells per mL of milk. <b>Somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count procedures on sheep milk however, have not been widely tested and limits are highly debatable, ranging from 250, 000 cells per mL to 1, 000, 000 per mL (Pengov 2001). This project will focus on obtaining valuable information about <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> counts in lactating ewes. There are several methods for determining <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count. Currently sheep milk is evaluated by cow milk standards using the methylene blue stain. However, cows and sheep have different secretory systems. Sheep shed more cellular debris in their milk than cows do, and the blue stain can sometimes falsely mark these <b>cell</b> particles as <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> (Gonzalo et al 2003). Goats have the same secretory system as sheep, and the stain {{used to evaluate the}}ir milk’s <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count is better at differentiating between cells and cellular debris. The green stain is the only officially acceptable method to directly measure <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count in goat milk (Haenlein 1997). This points to the conclusion that comparisons using dyes with higher tint specificity, such as pyronin Y-methyl green, would be of great use in sheep milk (Gonzalo et al. 2003). For this project milk samples were collected from lactating ewes at the University of Rhode Island’s Peckham farm. Several samples were taken from each ewe and collected in a plastic tube. The milk was then refrigerated and later pipetted in small aliquots onto slides. The slides were then dried and stained with either methylene blue or pyronin Y-methyl green stain. Once the slides were stained, they were examined under the oil immersion objective lens of the microscope and a direct microscopic <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count was taken. Our preliminary results have shown that milk stained with pyronin Y-methyl green has a lower <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count than the same sample stained with methylene blue. This indicates that the blue stain does not only stain <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> but extracellular components as well, making it less suitable for use in sheep milk. For this reason, we recommend that the green stain be used for <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count in sheep rather than the blue stain...|$|R

The <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count (SCC) {{is commonly used}} {{as a measure of}} milk quality. <b>Somatic</b> <b>cells</b> are simply animal body cells present at low levels in normal milk. High levels of these cells in milk indicate abnormal, reduced-quality milk that is caused by an intramammary bacterial infection (mastitis) ...|$|R

The cows divided over 5 different Dutch dairy farms were split in two groups and given either a high vitamin E supplementation (3. 000 IU/day orally) or a low supplementation (135 IU/day orally) during the dry period. These data were used to investigate 5 risk factors ante partum for their predictive value towards an elevated <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count post partum. Risk factors taken into account were <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count ante partum, parity, milk yield ante partum, 305 days of production and duration of dry period. Only <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count ante partum and milk yield ante partum showed significant relationships between them and an elevated <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count post partum. For <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count ante partum this was vitamin group B on farms A and C, and for the milk yield ante partum it was group A on farm B. Due to multiple factors, no significant prediction could be made for an elevated <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count post partum using these risk factors. The hypothesis that all risk factors together could predict an elevated <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count post partum was not confirmed...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} {{and distribution}} of gonial and <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> in the ovary of Dermatobia hominis was studied during the 3 rd larval instar. In larvae weighing between 400 and 500 mg, the ovary is partially divided into basal and apical regions by oblong <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> that penetrate from the periphery; these cells show ovoid nucleus and cytoplasm full of microtubules. In both regions, gonial cells with regular outlines, large nucleus and low electron-density cytoplasm are scattered among the interstitial <b>somatic</b> <b>cells.</b> These later cells have small nucleus and electrodense cytoplasm. Clear <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> with small nucleus and cytoplasm of very low electron-density are restrict to the apical region of the gonad. Degenerating interstitial <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> are seen in the basal portion close to the ovary peduncle. During all this larval period the morphological features of the ovary remain almost the same. At {{the end of the}} period there is a gradual deposition of glycogen in the cytoplasm of the <b>somatic</b> <b>cells,</b> increase in the number and density of their mitochondria plus nuclear modification as membrane wrinkling and chromatin condensation in masses...|$|R
