The management of information is becoming an important issue in the domain of <b>security</b> <b>information</b> systems. The information access and association, analysis and assessment, and finally exploitation have become the focus for all <b>security</b> <b>information</b> <b>services</b> and governments. Current surveillance approaches are not very efficient leading innocent citizen to the confrontation of law enforcement services.

40|$|Social {{security}} {{data management}} {{is an important}} topic both in application of information management and in social security management. In the Web 2. 0 era, more and more human information and healthcare information is released to the Internet through various approaches.

How to organize the conventional records together with the related information gathered from the Web is an interesting problem to solve to provide more convenient and powerful social <b>security</b> <b>information</b> <b>service.</b> In this paper, we introduce our initial work on building a Web-oriented social security information system named i-SSIS. I-SSIS is a database system which adopts a new object-role data model named INM model and deploys INM database system as its core. With the assistance of auxiliary tools to carry out social security information extraction, analyzing and query, i-SSIS can properly provide social security-related information gathered from the Web. We introduce the basic ideas of designing i-SSIS and describe the architecture and major components of the system...|$|E

In {{order to protect the}} unauthorized access and eliminate the vulnerability, it is necessary to improve the <b>security</b> <b>information</b> sharing environments about the Japanese domestic software and the equipments.
