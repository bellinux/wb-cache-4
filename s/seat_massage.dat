2500|$|The Care Through Touch Institute, {{located between}} Hyde and Leavenworth Streets, offers free <b>seated</b> <b>massage</b> therapy to {{clients in the}} Tenderloin community. The founder and {{director}} of CTI, Mary Ann Finch, began offering services here in 1997, after being inspired by her volunteer work with Mother Teresa in India. Today, CTI serves primarily low-income and homeless clients at sites such as the Gubbio Project at St. Boniface Church, Tenderloin Self-Help, Tom Waddell health clinic, MCSC, and Martin de Porres House of Hospitality. CTI also offers a 180-hour training in [...] "Seated Massage Therapy, Social Consciousness, and Spiritual Practice" [...] for people who are interested in volunteering with CTI. Sausa, Keatley & Operaria (2007) found in their study on the perceived risks and benefits of sex work among transgender women of color in San Francisco’s Tenderloin that transgender community life {{has been shown to be}} shaped by non-local structural conditions of poverty and sexual inequality - therefore, when it comes to health promotion and social service programs for transgender sex workers, it is imperative that these are informed and instructed by the fabric of such community.|$|R

A Life magazine photo of President Johnson, post gall bladder surgery, has the President lifting his shirt and showing his scar while sitting in one of these chairs. The Presidential Seal was embossed on these chairs with one currently in the Smithsonian Institution and another at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.

40|$|The neuropeptide {{oxytocin}} {{plays an}} important role in social behavior, parenting, and affectionate touch and there is some evidence that oxytocin release can be stimulated by massage or affectionate touch. We examined the effects of massage applied by a <b>massage</b> <b>seat</b> cover on salivary oxytocin levels in two exploratory studies using within-subject designs. In Study 1 massage effects on oxytocin levels were examined in a sample of N = 20 healthy female participants. Effects of a 15 -min massage session were compared to a control condition during which participants sat on a comfortable chair without a <b>massage</b> <b>seat</b> cover. Salivary oxytocin levels were measured at baseline and up to three hours after the session. We found that massage attenuated oxytocin decreases over time, indicating that massage stimulates oxytocin release. In Study 2, we examined whether effects of massage in N = 46 healthy male participants depend on experiences of emotional maltreatment. In addition, we examined whether enhanced oxytocin levels after massage affect the use of excessive handgrip force in response to infant crying and laughter as measured with a handgrip dynamometer. Our findings show that massage results in elevated oxytocin levels compared to a control condition, but that the effects of massage are dependent on experiences of emotional maltreatment. Men with experiences of emotional maltreatment showed lower oxytocin levels, which did not increase after massage. Furthermore, we found that high oxytocin levels after massage were related to reduced handgrip force during exposure to infant crying and laughter, indicating that massage stimulates a sensitive response to infant signals by stimulating oxytocin release. Although massage did not affect oxytocin levels in individuals with experiences of maltreatment, it reduced the use of handgrip force in response to infant crying and laughter in these individuals. Our findings indicate that emotional maltreatment is associated with atypical responding to stimulation of endogenous oxytocin release.

50|$|Although {{there is}} some {{overlapping}} in price and performance, the lighter SLS AMG is considered more of a sporty track-oriented car, compared to the Mercedes-Benz SL which is a more autobahn-focused grand tourer especially with its optional V12 engine.

50|$|They are the {{smallest}} of the large cars. Over the decades, they have grown a considerable amount in dimensions, this has done favors for certain models as their manufacturers have abandoned making expensive, higher-prestige levels of luxury cars. An example would be Ford discontinuing the executive Ford Scorpio, and rather the highest trim of the Ford Mondeo known as the Vignale is equipped with modern and basic luxurious benefits such as leather <b>massaging</b> <b>seats,</b> park-assist, and rear-parking cameras. Another example of this would be Peugeot replacing the 607 with the 508.|$|R

The seventh-gen 5 Series has 7-Series like gesture control, iDrive 6.0 infotainment unit, voice control, and head-up display, and new multi-contour <b>massage</b> <b>seats.</b> BMW claims that the cabin is quieter than ever thanks to extensive use of sound-deadening materials.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Coccydynia is a {{term that}} refers to pain {{in the region of}} the coccyx. Most cases are {{associated}} with abnormal mobility of the coccyx which may trigger a chronic inflam-matory process leading to degeneration of this structure. In some patients this instability may be detected on dynamic radiographs. Nonsurgical management remains the gold stan-dard treatment for coccydynia, consisting of decreased sitting, <b>seat</b> cushioning, coccygeal <b>massage,</b> stretching, manipulation, local injection of steroids or anesthetics, and postural adjust-ments. Those patients who fail these conservative modalities may potentially benefit from coccygectomy. However, surgi-cal intervention is typically reserved for patients with evidence of advanced coccygeal instability (e. g., subluxation or hyper-mobility) or spicule formation, as this population appears to exhibit the greatest improvement postoperatively...|$|R
50|$|Subsequent {{generations of}} the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class have been {{continually}} produced, not always in the same sporting spirit of the original 300 SL, such as the Mercedes-Benz W113 (1963-71) and the Mercedes-Benz R129 (1989-2001). In the 2000s Mercedes oriented its SL series back towards performance, and included styling nods to the 300 SL. The R230 (2002-2011) and the R231 (2012-present) have air inlets in the front fenders which are inspired by the 300 SL Gullwing. However, the SL has since evolved to become a more autobahn-focused grand tourer due to increasing weight, especially with its optional V12 engine in later iterations. The last two {{generations of the}} SL are hardtop convertibles with technological and comfort amenities, and it also has available heated and cooled <b>seats</b> with a <b>massage</b> function.|$|R
