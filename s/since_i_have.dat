5|$|Sources {{describing}} Fuller's movements {{after her}} time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but {{found it difficult to}} realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.|$|E
25|$|The confession-book, I suppose, has disappeared. It is {{twenty years}} <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen one. As a boy I told some {{inquisitive}} owner what was my favourite food (porridge, I fancy), my favourite hero {{in real life}} and in fiction, my favourite virtue in woman, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Post this intimation, I was {{informed}} {{for the first}} time yesterday by the BCCI that the Captain had reservations with my 'style' and about my continuing as the Head Coach. I was surprised <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always respected the role boundaries between Captain and Coach. Though the BCCI attempted to resolve the misunderstandings between the Captain and me, it was apparent that the partnership was untenable, and I therefore believe it is best for me to move on.|$|E
60|$|I gave {{myself over}} to the first real merriment <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard of Mr. Carvel's death.|$|R
60|$|I {{perceived}} but one {{change in}} the Lodger's miserable room, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen it last.|$|R
60|$|And {{my heart}} smote me heavily <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{of my own}} {{courtesy}} not remembered Adèle.|$|R
25|$|I recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, {{to one of}} his long-necked women, {{with their}} piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the {{succulent}} color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. In that moment, I used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.|$|E
25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years <b>since,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
500|$|After its {{publication}} {{he wrote to}} his aunt Maria Clemm saying, [...] "I have no desire to live <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done Eureka. I could accomplish nothing more." [...] He confided in a friend that he believed his contemporary generation was unable to understand it but that it would be appreciated, if ever, two thousand years later.|$|E
60|$|Quite sure. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had a moment's time to think, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{urged that}} duty on myself, and I was quite sure.|$|R
6000|$|... "But why? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen {{so little}} of you. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no idea that you knew even {{what had become of}} me <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left my father." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{liked the}} doctor's {{daughter}} ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> begun to know her, although at first <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{found it a}} little hard to become acquainted with her.|$|R
500|$|Boulton {{was tried}} by a {{tribunal}} headed by Ambroise-Dydime Lépine {{and sentenced to}} death for his interference with the provisional government. He was pardoned, but Scott interpreted this as weakness by the Métis, whom he regarded with open contempt. After Scott repeatedly quarreled with his guards, they insisted that he be tried for insubordination. At his court martial he was found guilty and was sentenced to death. Riel was repeatedly entreated to commute the sentence, but Riel responded, [...] "I have done three good things <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> commenced: I have spared Boulton's life at your instance, I pardoned Gaddy, and now I shall shoot Scott." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniel D. Glasser and Norton I. Kretske were Assistant United States Attorneys in the Northern District of Illinois, {{specializing in}} liquor and revenue offenses. Glasser and Kretske {{solicited}} bribes from defendants under indictment, or {{soon to be}} indicted. Glasser and six other assistants resigned on April 7, 1939, during the tenure of [...] U.S. Attorney William Joseph Campbell. According to Campbell: [...] "Mr. Glasser has the best record of convictions of any one in this office and his conviction record in alcohol cases {{is the best in}} the entire country. <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in office, Mr. Glasser has prosecuted ninety-nine cases and lost only one. He hasn't lost a jury case in three and a half years." ...|$|E
500|$|Leonard Boyarsky, art {{director}} of the original Fallout, when asked about Interplay Entertainment's sale of the rights to Bethesda Softworks, said [...] "To be perfectly honest, I was extremely disappointed {{that we did not}} get the chance to make the next Fallout game. This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's you, Mr. Paret," [...] she said, {{as though}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been a {{frequent}} caller. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never once darkened her threshold <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left her house.|$|R
60|$|It seemed useless for me {{to conceal}} my identity, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a letter in my pocket which would reveal it.|$|R
60|$|He {{spoke with}} his {{customary}} spirit; {{he moved with}} his customary briskness--he had become quite himself again, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen him last.|$|R
500|$|After {{withdrawing}} from political life, Kogălniceanu served as Romanian Academy President from 1887 to 1889 (or 1890). Having fallen severely ill in 1886, {{he spent his}} final years editing historical documents of the Eudoxiu Hurmuzaki fund, publicizing Ancient Greek and Roman archeological finds in Northern Dobruja, and collecting foreign documents related to Romanian history. One of his last speeches, held {{in front of the}} Academy and witnessed by both Carol, who had since become King of Romania, and his wife Elisabeth of Wied, was a summary of his entire career as a politician, intellectual, and civil servant. In August 1890, while traveling through the Austrian region of Vorarlberg, he was troubled by news that Alecsandri had died at his home in Mircești. Writing to Alecsandri's wife Paulina, he asked: [...] "I could not be present at his funeral, [...] you'll allow me, my lady, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> unable to kiss him either alive or dead, to at least kiss his grave!" ...|$|E
500|$|... and {{referred}} to the role the Russian culture played in her life when she stated in 2005: [...] "I have a Russian mother, she was a famous actress in the USSR (Galina Loginova). And the first books, which I read, were in Russian. I {{was raised in the}} atmosphere of the Russian classical theatre school. The art, built on the system of Stanislavsky – that's the most realistic art. And the modern cinema stands on the same principle. A Russian person wants to find the truth. This is the base of the Russian culture. I never forget it, especially <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> Russian roots". When asked if she still feels Russian, after having left Russia at a young age, Milla replied, [...] "Definitely. I still speak Russian. I speak it with my daughter. I read her Russian stories and poems. My roots are very important — they make me who I am".|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> my own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after day, and I think that {{had a lot to do}} with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E
60|$|And {{then for}} the first time I remembered that she had never said a word about the matter <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> met her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Sir!' {{said the}} Major. 'How have you passed the time <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the {{happiness}} of meeting you? Have you walked at all?' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{ordered a}} whisky and soda {{and lit a}} cigarette. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> tasted nothing like them <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left England. Mr. de Valentin leaned across the table towards me.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{have done}} three good things <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> commenced; I have spared Boulton's life at your instance, I pardoned Gaddy, and now I shall shoot Scott." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maxim Anmeghicean, the {{representative}} from ILGA-Europe, stated that, [...] "Even <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> participated at this march I {{have never seen}} such a strong presence by the forces of law and order". He remarked that the gendarmes had acted very professionally.|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards, Brunel {{wrote to}} his brother-in-law, the {{politician}} Benjamin Hawes: [...] "Of all the wonderful feats I have performed, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{in this part of}} the world, I think yesterday I performed the most wonderful. I produced unanimity among 15 men who were all quarrelling about that most ticklish subject— taste".|$|E

60|$|WANDA. [Sighing] I did {{not think}} they did, sir. It is so long I was not out in the town; not <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> Larry.|$|R
60|$|We made camp {{there beside}} the {{peaceful}} river. There Perry {{told me all}} that <b>had</b> befallen him <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> departed for the outer crust.|$|R
2500|$|... "It {{has been}} a long time <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> read {{anything}} from the pen of any man which has given me such encouragement as your article has. [...] In a speech on Lincoln's Birthday which I am to deliver in New York, I am going to take the liberty to quote liberally from what you have said." ...|$|E
2500|$|Minh {{frequently}} {{railed against}} Diệm in his September meeting with Lodge, decrying the police state {{that was being}} created by the Cần Lao Party of the Ngô family. Harkins reported that Minh [...] "has done nothing but complain {{to me about the}} government and the way it is handled <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been here". Harkins was skeptical about Minh's claims of widespread public disenchantment.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-century, the actor-manager {{tradition}} had declined, to {{be replaced}} by a structure where the major theatre companies employed professional directors as auteurs. The last of the great actor-managers, Donald Wolfit, played Lear in 1944 on a Stonehenge-like set and was praised by James Agate as [...] "the greatest piece of Shakespearean acting <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been privileged to write for the Sunday Times". Wolfit supposedly drank eight bottles of Guinness in the course of each performance.|$|E
60|$|I started, in ungovernable agitation, to my feet. The lawyer's {{question}} reminded me, for {{the first}} time <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left England, that something HAD happened.|$|R
60|$|He had no {{conception}} {{of the time that}} <b>had</b> elapsed <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> departed, but guessed that many years had dragged their slow way into the past.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went and}} found myself face to face, not with 'missis,' but the woman <b>I</b> <b>had</b> loved hopelessly but {{faithfully}} all that hard year, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone away to fight my battle alone.|$|R
