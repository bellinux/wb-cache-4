This phenomenon has been largely studied for different languages with the common result that a relatively short number of morphemes allows the detection of a high number of <b>specialised</b> <b>terms</b> to be produced. We believe that the use of such morphological knowledge may help a term detector in discovering very <b>specialised</b> <b>terms.</b> In this paper we propose a module to be included in a term extractor devoted specifically to detect terms that include neo-classical compounds.

40|$|International {{relations}} {{as well as}} multilingual organisations and institutions rely upon translation. In this particular field, translators are mostly concerned with different types of specialised documents, such as legal acts, technical reports and press statements. Due to the high precision and clarity requirements {{that are associated with}} these texts, terminology appears {{to be one of the}} most difficult aspects when it comes to translating specialised documents. This difficulty is the main focus of this study. More specifically, the aim is to describe and analyse how equivalents of <b>specialised</b> <b>terms</b> in the source language can be found in the target language and to study translation strategies that can be applied when translating international relations terminology. In order to obtain the primary data used in the study, NATO’s new strategic concept from 2010 was translated from French to Swedish. The concept is supposed to guide the organisation during a ten-year period. Throughout the translation process both lexical and textual sources were used. The analysis was made in the light of different translation theories and models, which include Vinay and Darbelnet’s (1977) “direct” and “indirect” translation techniques, as well as Cabré’s (1992) theories and methods on terminology. The results show the complexity of the subject, and most importantly, that parallel texts, that is to say specialised documentation, can play an important role when it comes to translating <b>specialised</b> <b>terms,</b> since many of them are not to be found in ordinary dictionaries...|$|R

Translation does not only happen between a foreign language and a/nmother tongue or between very distant languages, it often occurs between close languages such as Catalan and Spanish, which is precisely what this paper is about, a translation from Catalan into Spanish of the book Formentera, passa a passa per les/nvies públiques along with a glossary.

The Italian word is derived as a feminine diminutive of the adjective sordo ("deaf", [...] "dull in sound"), from Latin surdus. The alternative forms given above would have as plurals sordini, sordoni, sorduni. The French version of the word is feminine, and is sometimes used in music notation also: sourdine, plural sourdines.

This book presents the basic principles of modern colour semantics, including the recognition of basic vocabulary, subsets, <b>specialised</b> <b>terms</b> and the significance of non-colour features. Each point is illustrated by case studies drawn from modern and historical languages from around the world. These include discussions of Icelandic horses, Peruvian guinea-pigs, medieval roses, the colour yellow in Stuart England, and Polynesian children's colour terms. Major techniques used in colour research are presented and discussed, such as the evolutionary sequence, Natural Semantic Metalanguage and Vantage Theory. The book also addresses whether we can understand the colour systems of the past, including prehistory, by combining various semantic techniques currently used in both modern and historical colour research with archaeological and environmental information...|$|R

The theoretical part deals with a term in general and describes how the terms are taken over from ordinary vocabulary and back. Furthermore, it describes other ways of vocabulary origin. The practical part is focused on analysis of vocabulary from the dictionary. It studies ways of terms origin. The vocabulary is divided into three parts: loan words in French or words that are part of French lexical substrate, morphologically and semantically developped terms.

Moderately elevated tablelands are thus the characteristic feature of the continent, though the surface of these is broken by higher peaks and ridges.

The author’s study aims at determining to what extent these patterns and their variations contribute to the {{creation of}} a persuasive scientific discourse. The types of combinations between general scientific and <b>specialised</b> <b>terms</b> are studied so as to understand their role in the rhetorical progression of the text. The corpus includes PhD abstracts from two fields that were written in English by native and non-native speakers. The analysis provides evidence that each corpus highlights specific disciplinary strategies based on the use of textual collocational variations, or ‘collocational chains’. While building textual cohesion, these chains contribute to the perception of the text as both coherent and persuasive.

The outcome of the thesis is an evaluation of visuals and content composed on the interpretive trail panels {{for the purpose of}} attractive communication. The most significant deficiencies of the panels of interpretive trails in the protected landscape area of Český kras are quality of graphical design, whether the text communicates with the reader and if the text does not require linear reading. On the other hand, the most important strengths of interpretive trail panels are that the visual elements are always well connected to the content of the text on the panel and the text is easily read without <b>specialised</b> <b>terms.</b> The interpretive trail that has reached the best evaluation in the qualitative analysis is Vodácká NS Berounka.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{in the area of}} {{terminology}} activities in Zimbabwe and it analyses the term creation used in the following selected <b>specialised</b> <b>terms</b> dictionaries: Duramazwi Reurapi Neutano (Dictionary of Biomedical Terms), Duramazwi Remimhanzi (Dictionary of Shona Musical Terms), and Duramazwi Redudziramutauro NeUvaranomwe (Dictionary of Shona Linguistic and Literature Terms). The study specifically analyses and explores how terminographers together with health, music, language and literature specialists made use of their term creation skills and strategies in the creation of new <b>specialised</b> <b>terms</b> for the field of music, health and linguistics. In addition, this research takes into account the impact of factors such as culture, socio- economic, etymological purity, attitudes of the target users, language policy, as well as availability of resources on term creation. Hence, term creation is an exercise that involves many aspects and interlinked factors. This research advances the argument that while some term creation strategies (compounding, coining and derivation) can be adequate and appropriate, however, at times; they are some which result in created terms that are rather cumbersome, vague, artificial, and difficult to master and remember. In addition, this study found out that some term creation strategies (semantic expansion and loan translations) are unproductive; that means they do not add any value on the Shona language vocabulary. Moreover, the borrowing term creation strategy was analysed on the basis of whether it is promoting and elevating the Shona language or is it undermining its value and vitality. This study emphasises the need for a collaborative approach to term creation, with terminologists, linguists, subject area specialists and target language users during the different phases of word formation processes for the collective ownership of the created term and their acceptability to the target users. This study highlights that, through good term creation strategies the Shona Language can significantly contribute to the promotion and development of Shona language in Zimbabwe. Overally, the research yields a substantial amount of information in the terminological formation processes as well as the identification of factors {{that can be used to}} improve term creation strategies in order to develop indigenous languages for use in all spheres of life. The major contribution of this study is the identification and highlighting of the major strength and weaknesses of term creation strategies as a way of developing indigenous languages. The useful findings in this study will benefit the indigenous language development and language policy planners and terminologists in Zimbabwe and other African languages in similar situations. The significant amount of information about term creation that was used in the analysis of term creation in the three dictionaries was solicited from questionnaires and interviews that were carried out with linguists, the specialised dictionary compilers, music students, medical students and high school students doing Shona language and literature subject in Zimbabwe. More information on the term creation was done through content analysis of the three specialised dictionaries and the present researcherâ€™s own experiences as a former Shona high school teacher, linguist and above all as a Shona language speaker...|$|R

40|$|Mathematics {{education}} {{studies have}} shown that part of learning mathematics is learning its language. The language of mathematics is said to include <b>specialised</b> <b>terms</b> and ordinary language terms that have contextual meanings in mathematics. Considering the fact that learners in South Africa are performing poorly in mathematics in the international comparative studies, e. g. TIMSS, there was a need to investigate how teachers facilitate second language learners’ access to the meaning of mathematical terms in multilingual classrooms in South Africa. This study investigated a teacher’s practices in the facilitation of learner access to mathematical terminology in a Grade 11 multilingual class in a township school in Vosloorus, South Africa. The study employed a qualitative approach in investigating Discourse practices that the teacher used to define mathematical terms to second language learners in a multilingual classroom. Direct classroom observations and a teacher interview were the main data gathering methods. The main findings were that the teacher used a combination of interactive practices that involved group work, telling, individual student interactions and initiation, response and evaluation methods. Among definition teaching strategies used were the textbook procedural definition and the textbook descriptive definitions. The chalkboard and the textbook were the main artefacts of the Definition Discourse. The study concludes that the Definition Discourse of the multilingual classroom is a process that involves not only the definition of terms but also an integration of teaching methods and interactive practices where definitions of mathematical terms can be taught even through the eliciting of procedural methods of working out mathematical problems...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, {{the number}} of new {{concepts}} and terms has risen rapidly due to scientific and technological development. Additionally, expert knowledge, which used to be exclusive for experts, also interests middlebrow language users. Compilers of e-dictionaries, aware of this change, are gathering in new editions <b>specialised</b> <b>terms</b> that have become part of our daily lives. In the current globalised world, the need to transfer scientific knowledge to other languages arises, so one of the main tools that translators and, specially, translation trainees employ to look up an unknown term are bilingual dictionaries. Hence, we consider that the study of the treatment given to computing terms in bilingual dictionaries is a field that needs to be reviewed. From an ad hoc corpus composed of texts from the main journals published in the UK and the USA, the most frequent terms belonging to computing are extracted using TermoStat Web 3. 0 (Drouin, 2003). Then, we verify how terms are gathered in the dictionary wordlist, if they are labelled or not, which translation equivalents are given and if they are followed by contextual data. In addition, we check the use of the given equivalents in two Spanish reference corpora: Corpus del Español and Corpus de Referencia del Español Actual. The results from the analysis might suggest a need to take into account new proposals in order to implement the data gathered in these reference works as well as inform new procedures in the design and use of these tools {{from the point of view}} of translators as main users...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the methodology adopted {{for the creation}} of a multilingual?English-Italian-French?philological dictionary, designed to meet as far as possible the requirements of users in the field of philology, who need to use specific terms in a language other than their own. The project is addressed to graduate and post-graduate students, tutors and scholars, translators and interpreters for whom a glossary of <b>specialised</b> <b>terms</b> relative to a given universe of discourse is essential. The dictionary defines a variety of terms associated with philology and extends to other closely connected disciplines such as textual criticism, codicology, palaeography, epigraphy, papyrology, genetic criticism, etc. The three-language glossary is arranged in conventional form?each lexical entry listed alphabetically?and the English terms are followed by their equivalents in Italian and French. The Greek or Latin words from which many philological words have derived and frequently used to refer to a particular concept or phenomenon are also included. The project involves recording not just the term but also a brief contextualized definition in each language, accurately quoting the source, certified and scientifically reliable, from which the information was drawn. Alongside these definitions, a number of other contextualizations appear, also derived from authoritative sources, and different types of illustrations?e. g. manuscripts, stems, images of people and places?relative to the terminology are provided. The textual data and images will be included into an application (Alpha version) of the PINAKES project, released in March 2007, which is able to deal with different types of information?text, scientific objects, tables or graphics. This ongoing dictionary project, at present covering a total of around 1000 words, is constantly enriched with new entries, definitions and contextualizations in the different languages...|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{institutions}} {{represent a}} complex setting and a specific case of institutional translation. The European Central Bank (ECB) {{is a particular}} context as the documents translated belong {{to the field of}} economics and, thus, contain many <b>specialised</b> <b>terms</b> and neologisms that pose challenges to translators. This study aims to investigate the translation practices at the ECB, and to analyse their effects on the translated texts. In order to illustrate the way texts are translated at the ECB, the thesis will focus on metaphorical expressions and the conceptual metaphors by which they are sanctioned. Metaphor is often associated with literature and less with specialised texts. However, according to Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) conceptual metaphor theory, our conceptual system is fundamentally metaphorical in nature and metaphors are pervasive elements of thought and speech. The corpus compiled comprises economic documents translated at the ECB, mainly from English into Romanian. Using corpus analysis, the most salient metaphorical expressions were identified in the source and target texts and explained with reference to the main conceptual metaphors. Translation strategies are discussed {{on the basis of a}} comparison of the source and target texts. The text-based analysis is complemented by questionnaires distributed to translators, which give insights into the institution’s translation practices. As translation is an institutional process, translators have to follow certain guidelines and practices; these are discussed with reference to translators’ agency. A gap was identified in the field of institutional translation. The translation process in the EU institutions has been insufficiently explored, especially regarding the new languages of the European Union. By combining the analysis of the institutional practices, the texts produced in the institution and the translators’ work (by the questionnaires distributed to translators), this thesis intends to bring a contribution to institutional translation and metaphor translation, particularly regarding a new EU language, Romanian...|$|R
