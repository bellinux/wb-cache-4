A study was performed which investigated the effect of hardware configuration on air conditioning cooling system performance at high outdoor temperatures. The initial phase of the investigation involved the testing of ten residential air conditioning units in psychrometric rooms at Texas A&M University. All units were tested using ARI Standard 210 / 240 (1989) test procedures. Tests were conducted at indoor conditions of 80 'F (26. 7 'C) db and 67 'F (19. 4 'C) wb, and outdoor db temperatures of 82 'F (27. 8 'C), 95 -F (35 -C), 100 -F (37. 8 -C), 105 -F (40. 6 -C), 1 10 -F (43. 3 -C), and 120 -F (48. 90 C). The second phase of the research involved the analysis of manufacturers' published cooling performance data for various hardware configurations. For the experimental work, measurements were taken to determine total capacity, system power, EER, and power factor. These results were then compared to manufacturers' predicted values. For the capacity, the experimental results were an average of 2. 6 % below the manufacturers' published values for outdoor temperatures from 85 'F (29. 4 'C) to 115 'F (46. l'C). Experimental power measurements were on average 0. 4 % above manufacturers' listed results. For the EER, experimental results were an average of 2. 9 % less than the manufacturers' predicted values. The power factors of all units were above 0. 95 for the tested outdoor temperatures. In the analysis of manufacturers' published data, relationships between steady-state performance, cyclic performance, and hardware configuration were investigated for a variety of air conditioning units. A statistical relationship was found between the SEER of a unit and its corresponding EER. The <b>split-system</b> units possessed greater increases in EER for a given increase in SEER than the package or two-speed units. Averages values of EER/SEER for EER's at 95 F (350 C) were highest for the <b>split-system</b> units, followed by the package and two-speed units, respectively. Normalized capacity, power, and EER curves were investigated at outdoor temperatures from 85 F (29. 40 C) to 115 OF (46. 1 "C). On average, the two-speed units showed the smallest decrease in capacity with an increase in outdoor temperature, followed by the <b>split-system</b> and package-system units.

Two different, commercially available, <b>split-system,</b> residential-type air-conditioners were tested.

Specifically, with 60 % of the fin area flattened on one condenser, system capacity decreased 4 %; system SEER (effi-ciency), 9 %. With 100 % of the fin area flattened, system ca-pacity decreased 27 %; system SEER, 34 %. Combing dents from the fins after the extreme case where all fins were flat-tened restored capacity to within 1 % of the undented condition and SEER to within 6 % of the undented efficiency.

This report presents the accomplishments of the project, including the design, construction, and qualification of an anechoic chamber, the acquisition of acoustic, flow, and pressure data within a fan-coil unit over a typical operating range, and the development of an understanding of the flow-structure interactions responsible for noise generation in the fan-coil unit. This report focuses on the investigation of a method for measuring the dynamic axial force generated by a fan operating in a steady but spatially non-uniform flow field. Several variations of a measurement system that uses a cantilever beam were tested. Experimental results indicated, in all designs, that the measurement system introduced additional sources of axial motion, occurring at the frequencies of interest and at amplitudes much larger than the one to be measured.

40|$|Electric {{utilities}} {{have had}} a number of air conditioner rebate and maintenance programs for many years. The purpose of these programs was to improve the efficiency of the stock of air conditioning equipment and provide better demand-side management. This paper examines the effect of refrigerant charging (proper servicing of the equipment), system sizing, and efficiency on the steady-state, coincident peak utility demand of a residential central air conditioning system. The study is {{based on the results of}} laboratory tests of a three-ton, capillary tube expansion, <b>split-system</b> air conditioner, system capacity and efficiency data available from manufacturer's literature, and assumptions about relative sizing of the equipment to cooling load on a residence. A qualitative discussion is provided concerning the possible impacts of transient operation and total energy use on utility program decisions. The analysis indicates that proper sizing of the unit is the largest factor affecting energy demand of the three factors (sizing, charging, and efficiency) studied in this paper. For typical oversizing of units to cooling loads in houses, both overcharging and undercharging showed significant negative impact on peak demand. The impacts of SEER changes in utility peak demand were found to be virtually independent of oversizing. For properly sized units, there was a small peak benefit to higher efficiency air conditioners...|$|E
40|$|A {{steady-state}} microchannel <b>split-system</b> {{simulation model}} has been developed based on previous research at the ACRC. This model was utilized as a design tool to optimize a microchannel split system {{with the goal of}} minimizing TEWI, or total equivalent warming impact. The system components were then selected and the optimized microchannel heat exchangers were fabricated. Next, the entire system was assembled and extensive tests were run at steady state conditions over a wide range of outdoor ambient conditions in a calorimeter test facility. The experimental results have been compared to the simulations for the purpose of model refinement and its eventual validation. The full system model overpredicts the total capacity of the system with a minimum error of 0. 2 %, a mean error of 5 %, and a maximum error of 11 %. The evaporator submodel overpredicts the total capacity as well, with a minimum error of 0. 7 %, a mean error of 7 %, and a maximum error of 11 %. The condenser submodel also overpredicts with a minimum error of 0. 5 %, a mean error of 2 %, and a maximum error of 6 %. A major reason for the lower accuracy with the evaporator is because of the refrigerant maldisribution observed in the experiments. The model assumes perfect distribution, hence one reason for the overprediction of the system's capacity. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Project 6...|$|E
40|$|Indoor {{air quality}} is a {{critical}} factor in the classroom due to high people concentration in a unique space. Indoor air pollutant might increase the chance of both long and short-term health problems among students and staff, reduce the productivity of teachers and degrade the student‚Äôs learning environment and comfort. Adequate air distribution strategies may reduce risk of infection in classroom. So, the purpose of air distribution systems in a classroom is not only to maximize conditions for thermal comfort, but also to remove indoor contaminants. Natural ventilation has the potential to {{play a significant role in}} achieving improvements in IAQ. The present study compares the risk of airborne infection between Natural Ventilation (opening windows and doors) and a <b>Split-System</b> Air Conditioner in a university classroom. The Wells-Riley model was used to predict the risk of indoor airborne transmission of infectious diseases such as influenza, measles and tuberculosis. For each case, the air exchange rate was measured using a CO 2 tracer gas technique. It was found that opening windows and doors provided an air exchange rate of 2. 3 air changes/hour (ACH), while with the Split System it was 0. 6 ACH. The risk of airborne infection ranged between 4. 24 to 30. 86 % when using the Natural Ventilation and between 8. 99 to 43. 19 % when using the Split System. The difference of airborne infection risk between the Split System and the Natural Ventilation ranged from 47 to 56 %.

40|$|Due to {{the rising}} demand of using energy {{resources}} more efficiently, the HVAC 2 ÃÜ 6 R industry is constantly facing the challenge of meeting strict energy consumption requirements. This paper presents a study that focuses on improving the efficiency of a residential <b>split-system</b> vapor compression heat pump using R 410 A as the refrigerant. R 410 A, when used as any sub-critical refrigerant in a vapor compression cycle, has a meaningful difference in potential energy savings when using a practically achievable partially isentropic expansion instead of an adiabatic expansion. As a result, {{there is a significant}} potential for efficiency improvements by replacing the expansion valve with a work-generating device - an energy recovery expander. The expander functions by using a nozzle to convert enthalpy and pressure of the refrigerant to a high speed flow. The nozzle is designed to ensure refrigerant phase change and accelerate the flow into the impeller of a micro-turbine. The rotating turbine impeller is connected to an internal generator which generates electrical energy. This electrical energy is used in the system to augment the power into the air conditioner√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s indoor fan motor. The expander enables the realization of decreased power consumption and increased evaporator cooling capacity. The expander has been implemented into a 5 -ton split system heat pump and tested in both heating and cooling modes. The respective heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) and seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) values have been calculated for the baseline unit and then compared to those with the energy recovery expansion device. The rated values have been experimentally determined based on the standard test procedure regulated by ASHRAE 210 / 240. The test results will be reported in this paper...|$|E
40|$|This {{program was}} aimed at {{understanding}} refrigerant/lubricant circulation issues, developing test data and approximate models that can predict operating regimes where good oil management can be assured. A dynamic test facility was constructed and used to examine oil return under varying system operating conditions. The development of industry guidelines for system reliability in using the new refrigerant blends was a goal of this program. To validate the guidelines, techniques and predictions, this dynamic test facility was used to obtain data to compare to the analytical predictions. The overall program approach undertaken to meet this objective was: (1) to identify poor oil return scenarios and, therefore, the worst case oil return parameters for conventional residential HVAC systems using HCFC- 22 and mineral oils, in terms of compressor, suction and exhaust line vapor velocity, and refrigerant viscosity requirements; (2) design and instrument a test apparatus that simulates such conditions, {{as well as those}} that might be achieved with HFC and POE mixtures and HFCs and mineral oils; (3) conduct tests with the range of baseline refrigerants and lubricant mixtures to provide experimental data; and (4) prepare, present and interpret the test data to provide an expanded understanding of the phenomena required for good oil circulation in <b>split-system</b> heat pump systems. To convert this general approach into the program specifics, three major tasks were defined and pursued. These are described briefly here and in greater detail in the report body as Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3.

40|$|Lubricants are {{utilized}} in air-conditioning {{systems for the}} purpose of decreasing friction and wear within the compressor. While ideally the lubricant remains in the compressor, some lubricant is entrained and transported by the refrigerant to the other system components. During operational transients, the lubricant is redistributed throughout the various system components. The equilibrium distribution of lubricant depends among other things on fluid properties, phase change processes, flow rates, geometries, and operating conditions. Experiments were conducted in a commercially available, <b>split-system,</b> residential, air-conditioning system with a nominal 3 -ton capacity that could be operated both as an air-conditioner and a heat-pump. While the system was designed to operate with R 410 A, most of the testing was conducted with pure R 32, which is a leading candidate for R 410 A replacement pending regulatory discontinuation of its other constituent: R 125. The lubricants used in this study were traditional and advanced polyol ester lubricants. Advanced polyol ester lubricants promise to improve lubricity and wear protection compared to current lubricants. The lubricants had nominal viscosities ranging from 32 to 80 cSt. To inventory the distribution of refrigerant and lubricant, the system was modified by the installation of ball valves which could be utilized to separate the system into its constituents: compressor, condenser, liquid line, evaporator, suction line, and accumulator. The system was brought to equilibrium at conditions A, B, C, H 1, and H 2 which are defined in AHRI Standard 210 / 240. After maintaining equilibrium, simultaneously the compressor being shut off and the ball valves were closed which isolated refrigerant and lubricant within each component. The components were subsequently removed and weighed in a manner which allowed the mass of refrigerant and lubricant in each component to be determined. Analysis of the results focuses on the change in mass distribution due to refrigerant-lubricant mixture properties and due to changes in operating conditions. The implications of the net migration of lubricant from the compressor to the remainder of the system will also be discussed...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A <b>split-system</b> direct-expansion air conditioner was used to empirically determine temperature and return-air humidity indicators that could detect performance degradation resulting from degraded conditions. The air conditioner test bench was equipped with the ability to use either a short-tube orifice (STO) or a thermal expansion valve (TXV). The degraded conditions studied include low evaporator airflow, high and low-charge, and a blocked condenser coil. The work presented in this thesis is experimentally based which could identify degraded effects that fall outside of a simulation-based approach. It sought to utilize only low-cost temperature sensing means, although return-air humidity was an important factor for obtaining early detection over a wide range of operating conditions. It was empirically based rather than model based to reduce computation time with a real-time processor. Further, the current work differentiated between a system that uses a shorttube orifice (STO), or fixed-orifice expansion, and a system that uses a thermal expansion valve (TXV), or variable-orifice expansion. This thesis shows that low-cost temperature sensors could be used to detect the degraded conditions studied. However, it is also shown that indicators of low evaporator airflow depend on three loading factors; outdoor-air temperature, return-air temperature, and return-air humidity. In the literature, the humidity sensing point has been neglected by automated detection systems for failures and degraded conditions of low-tonnage air conditioners. The effects of the loading factors on the indicators relative to improper charge and a blocked condenser coil were not studied. STO system and a TXV system relative to the degradations studied, a common set of indicators was identified that could detect degraded conditions without regard to the expansion device...|$|E
40|$|Recognizing {{the need}} for new space {{conditioning}} and water heating systems for manufactured housing, DeLima Associates assembled a team to develop a space conditioning system that would enhance comfort conditions while also reducing energy usage at the systems level.

An integrated system would be developed that would combine a packaged airconditioning system with a small-duct, high-velocity air distribution system. In its basic configuration, the source for space heating would be a gas water heater. The complete system would be installed at the manufactured home factory and would require no site installation work at the homesite as is now required with conventional <b>split-system</b> air conditioners. Several prototypes were fabricated and tested before a field test unit was completed in October 2005. The Comboflair√Ç¬Æ system, complete with ductwork, was installed in a 1, 984 square feet, double-wide manufactured home built by Palm Harbor Homes in Austin, TX. After the home was transported and installed at a Palm Harbor dealer lot in Austin, TX, a data acquisition system was installed for remote data collection. Over 60 parameters were continuously monitored and measurements were transmitted to a remote site every 15 minutes for performance analysis. The Comboflair√Ç¬Æ system was field tested from February 2006 until April 2007. The cooling system performed in accordance with the design specifications. The heating system initially could not provide the needed capacity at peak heating conditions until the water heater was replaced with a higher capacity standard water heater.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project was to {{investigate}} and compare the performance of an R 410 A air conditioner to that of an R 22 air conditioner, with specific interest in performance at high ambient temperatures at which the condenser of the R 410 A system may be operating above the refrigerant's critical point. Part 1 of this project consisted of conducting comprehensive measurements of thermophysical for refrigerant R 125 and refrigerant blends R 410 A and R 507 A and developing new equation of state formulations and mixture models for predicting thermophysical properties of HFC refrigerant blends. Part 2 of this project conducted performance measurements of <b>split-system,</b> 3 -ton R 22 and R 410 A residential air conditioners in the 80 to 135 F (27. 8 to 57. 2 C) outdoor temperature range and development of a system performance model. The performance data was used in preparing a beta version of EVAP-COND, a windows-based simulation package for predicting performance of finned-tube evaporators and condensers. The modeling portion of this project also included the formulation of a model for an air-conditioner equipped with a thermal expansion valve (TXV). Capacity and energy efficiency ratio (EER) were measured and compared. The R 22 system's performance was measured over the outdoor ambient temperature range of 80 to 135 F (27. 8 to 57. 2 C). The same test range was planned for the R 410 A system. However, the compressor's safety system cut off the compressor at the 135. 0 F (57. 2 C) test temperature. The highest measurement on this system was at 130. 0 F (54. 4 C). Subsequently, a custom-manufactured R 410 A compressor with a disabled safety system and a more powerful motor was installed and performance was measured at outdoor temperatures up to 155. 0 F (68. 3 C). Both systems had similar capacity and EER performance at 82. 0 F (27. 8 C). The capacity and EER degradation of both systems were nearly linearly dependent with rising ambient outdoor ambient test temperatures. The performance degradation of R 410 A at higher temperatures was greater than R 22. However, the R 22 and R 410 A systems both operated normally during all tests. Visual observations of the R 410 A system provided no indication of vibrations or TXV hunting at high ambient outdoor test conditions with the compressor operating in the transcritical regime...|$|E
