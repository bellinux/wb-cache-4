25|$|The tide {{components}} with {{a period}} near twelve hours have a lunar amplitude (earth bulge/depression distances) {{that are a}} little more than twice the height of the solar amplitudes, as tabulated below. At new and full moon, the Sun and the Moon are aligned, and the lunar and the solar tidal maxima and minima (bulges and depressions) add together for the greatest tidal range at particular latitudes. At first- and third-quarter phases of the moon, lunar and solar tides are perpendicular, and the tidal range is at a minimum. The <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> go through one full cycle (a high and low tide) about once every 12 hours and one full cycle of maximum height (a spring and neap tide) about once every 14 days.|$|E
25|$|Careful Fourier data {{analysis}} over a nineteen-year period (the National Tidal Datum Epoch in the U.S.) uses frequencies called the tidal harmonic constituents. Nineteen years is preferred because the Earth, moon and sun's relative positions repeat almost {{exactly in the}} Metonic cycle of 19years, which is long enough to include the 18.613 year lunar nodal tidal constituent. This analysis can be done using only {{the knowledge of the}} forcing period, but without detailed understanding of the mathematical derivation, which means that useful tidal tables have been constructed for centuries. The resulting amplitudes and phases can then be used to predict the expected tides. These are usually dominated by the constituents near 12hours (the semi-diurnal constituents), but there are major constituents near 24hours (diurnal) as well. Longer term constituents are 14day or fortnightly, monthly, and semiannual. <b>Semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> dominated coastline, but some areas such as the South China Sea and the Gulf of Mexico are primarily diurnal. In the semi-diurnal areas, the primary constituents M2(lunar) and S2(solar) periods differ slightly, so that the relative phases, and thus the amplitude of the combined tide, change fortnightly (14day period).|$|E

While the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska provides some protection from the Pacific Ocean weather, much of the area experiences strong <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> which can create extreme 30 ft differences between high and low tide, so careful piloting is necessary in many places in order to not collide with underwater obstructions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{four years}} of radar wind data from Halley and Scott Base {{in an attempt to}} resolve the zonal structure of the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> over Antarctica and to determine the dominant component as a function of time. If only one odd and one even wavenumber component are present then it is possible to calculate the amplitudes and phases of those using data from two stations that are similar in latitude but separated in longitude, ideally by 180. Assuming that the main components of the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> at Scott Base and Halley latitudes are wavenumber 1 and 2, as has been suggested by other studies, we are able to determine the seasonal variation of both components. The wavenumber 1 component is often dominant in summer, in winter a mixture of wavenumber 1 and 2 is observed. In addition the longitude at which the maxima of the components coincide was determined and found to vary relatively little. Amplitude variations and the longitudes of maxima coincidence were used to investigate the generation mechanisms of the wavenumber 1 wave. Interaction between planetary waves with wavenumber 1 and the wavenumber 2 <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> was found to be a potential mechanism for the generation of the wavenumber 1 component of the tide, confirming theories and observations discussed in the literature. For periods where this explanation for the generation of the wavenumber 1 tide fails we suggest asymmetric heating through solar particle flux as an additional source...|$|R
40|$|Tidal {{studies have}} shown that there exists a {{resonance}} of the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> in the Hudson Bay-Hudson Strait system. The resonant response is particularly strong within Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay. It is shown here that the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> in Hudson Strait has characteristics that {{are similar to those of}} a half-wavelength open channel resonance. A simple analytical model is developed to account for the salient aspects of the semi-diurnal response in the strait. Non-dimensional parameters that govern the response are identified and evaluated based on the physical dimensions of the region and results from a numerical tidal model. Taking account of the mechanical impedance presented to the channel by Hudson Bay, the results suggest that a channel mode is resonant near semi-diurnal periodicities, in general agreement with observations and more complex tidal models of the region. The possibility that Ungava Bay may have a separate quarter-wavelength resonance driven at the entrance to the continental shelf is also briefly explored...|$|R
40|$|This short paper explores some of {{the reasons}} for the asymmetries {{observed}} in tidal probability distribution functions in areas of predominantly <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide.</b> It shows that contributions to asymmetry can arise from shallow water, diurnal and long period tidal constituents, with the diurnal terms likely to be the most important source of asymmetry at many locations. We consider this observation worthy of note due to the relatively little discussion of the topic in the literature hitherto. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The Port of Saint John is a {{port complex}} that {{occupies}} 45 ha of land along 3900 m of waterfront of the Saint John Harbour {{at the mouth}} of the Saint John River in the city of Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. The Port of Saint John, with facilities on both sides of the river, is noted for its extreme tidal range and river currents. Because of the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> and the river influence, slack water occurs at approximately half tide and not at high or low water as at most other ports.|$|E
50|$|The Moskstraumen or Moskenstraumen is {{a system}} of tidal eddies and whirlpools, {{one of the strongest}} in the world, that forms at the Lofoten archipelago, Norway, in the Norwegian Sea. It is located between the Lofoten Point (Lofotodden) of Moskenesøya (Moskenes municipality) and Værøy, at the small island of Mosken. Moskstraumen is unusual in that it occurs in the open sea whereas most other whirlpools are {{observed}} in confined straits or rivers. It originates from a combination of several factors, the dominant being the strong <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> and peculiar shape of the seabed, with a shallow ridge between the Moskenesøya and Værøy islands which amplifies and whirls the tidal currents.|$|E
50|$|A third {{influence}} {{occurs because}} the moon orbits {{at an angle}} to the equator. This means that if one of the bulges travelling around the earth is above the equator, then the other bulge is below the equator. It also follows that some places will have one daily diurnal tide, while other places will have <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> twice a day. For example, there is a diurnal tide in the Ross Sea near Antarctica every 24.84 hours. The height of this tide dwindles to almost zero in a cycle which takes 13.66 days. New Zealand's tides are semi-diurnal. The primary cause, the lunar tide, is labelled the M2. The M stands for the moon and the 2 stands for twice a day.|$|E

50|$|Like other {{estuaries}} {{along the}} Oregon Coast, Netarts Bay experiences <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> (two high tides and two low tides per day). At mean low low water (the lower low tide), the bay contains approximately 113 million cubic ft of water. Contrasting that with that a mean higher high tide volume of approximately 450 million cubic feet, the bay's tidal prism is about 33 million cubic feet. The tidal range varies between 1.5 and 3 meters(5 - 9 feet), which can vary {{the amount of}} water (40-90%) flushed out of the estuary during each tidal cycle. With a mean tidal period of 745 minutes, bay waters turn over, on average, twice a day. Mixing within the estuary is dependent on local winds and tides. Horizontal mixing is limited, although vertical mixing is strong. Little to no vertical variations in temperature and salinity prevent density-driven current velocities, indicating that Netarts Bay is a well-mixed estuary. This has been further corroborated by water quality and dye studies.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{physical}} {{limitation is}} the energy {{available in the}} tidal fluctuations of the oceans, which is about 0.6 EJ (exajoule).

Without forcing, this energy would be dissipated (at a dissipation rate of 3.7 TW) in about four <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> periods. So, dissipation plays a significant role in the tidal dynamics of the oceans. Therefore, this limits the available tidal energy to around 0.8 TW (20% of the dissipation rate) in order not to disturb the tidal dynamics too much.|$|R

5000|$|Long-Period tides are {{gravitational}} tides, typically with amplitudes {{of a few}} centimeters or {{less and}} periods longer than one day, generated by changes in the Earth's orientation relative to the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter. The distance between a reference point {{on the surface of}} the Earth relative to these objects can be expressed as an infinite combination of periods and, as the distance changes, so does the tidal forcing. An analysis of the changing distance by Pierre-Simon de Laplace in the 18th century shows that these periods at which gravity varies cluster into three species, the semi-diurnal and diurnal tide constituents which have periods of a day or less, and the long period tidal constituents (see also tide). Long period tidal constituents with relatively strong forcing include the lunar fortnightly (Mf) and monthly (Ms) as well as the solar semiannual (Ssa) and annual (Sa) constituents. In addition to having periods longer than a day-long period tidal forcing is distinguished from that of the first and second species by being zonally symmetric. The long period tides are also distinguished by the way in which the oceans respond. In contrast to the first and second species, the long period tidal forcings occur sufficiently slowly that they do not excite surface gravity waves. This property of exciting surface gravity waves is responsible for the high amplitude <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> in the Bay of Fundy, for example. In contrast, the ocean responds to long period tidal forcing with a combination of an equilibrium tidal response along with a possible excitation of barotropic Rossby wave normal modes ...|$|E

The mechanism of clockwise phase propagation of <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> at the Gulf of Thailand in the northern hemisphere is examined using a simple numerical model. The natural oscillation period of the whole Gulf of Thailand is near the semi-diurnal period and the direction of its phase propagation is clockwise, mainly due to the propagation direction of the large amplitude part of the incoming semi-diurnal tidal wave from the South China Sea.
