5|$|Detachments from 5ACS formed part of Australia's {{contribution}} to the Vietnam War. Following the deployment of No.79 Squadron to Ubon Air Force Base in Thailand in June 1962, a party of 5ACS personnel was also sent to Ubon to plan and oversee the construction of facilities for the squadron. Work on these facilities was undertaken by 100 Thai civilians who had built over 50 huts and other <b>support</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for No.79 Squadron {{by the time the}} project concluded at the end of 1962. RAAF units began to be deployed to South Vietnam in 1964, and in May 1966 DetachmentA of 5ACS was formed at Vũng Tàu to improve the airfield there so it could support the UH-1 Iroquois-equipped No. 9 Squadron. The 19 members of this detachment returned to Australia on 8October 1966. DetachmentB of 5ACS was subsequently deployed to South Vietnam in January 1967 to build facilities for eight No.2 Squadron Canberra bombers at Phan Rang Air Base. This task was completed in April, and in June DetachmentB moved to Vũng Tàu to complete the construction of facilities there. Work on Vũng Tàu Airport was finished on 20January 1968 and the detachment was disbanded on 17February 1968.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to budget}} {{constraints}} and the scheduled closure of Boeing's Globemaster production line in 2015, {{it was considered}} unlikely in 2012 that the RAAF would acquire more Globemasters. However, in August 2014 Minister for Defence David Johnston stated that the Government was likely to purchase a further one or two C-17s. The Government {{announced that it would}} purchase two Globemasters in October 2014, and requested information on the pricing and availability for a further pair of aircraft. In November 2014 Australia lodged a formal request with the United States Defense Security Cooperation Agency for four C-17s and associated equipment, for a total cost of $A1.85 billion. An order for the RAAF's seventh and eighth Globemasters was formally announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott on 10April 2015. The first of the new C-17s arrived in Australia on 29 July 2015, and the second on 4 November that year. These two aircraft were among the last C-17s to have been built before the production line was closed, and it is not expected that the RAAF will acquire more Globemasters. It was reported in December 2014 that the New Zealand Government was considering purchasing between two and four Globemasters, and Australian Aviation journalist Andrew McLaughlin suggested that any such acquisition would build on Australia's C-17 <b>support</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The New Zealand Government ultimately decided to not purchase any Globemasters.|$|E

25|$|Equal {{economic}} opportunity, a base {{social safety}} net provided by the welfare state, and strong labor unions have historically been {{at the heart of}} Democratic economic policy. The welfare state supports a progressive tax system, higher minimum wages, social security, universal health care, public education, and public housing. They also <b>support</b> <b>infrastructure</b> development and government sponsored employment programs in an effort to achieve economic development and job creation, while stimulating private sector job creation. Additionally however, since the 1990s the party has at times supported centrist economic reforms, which cut the size of government and reduced market regulations. The party has continuously rejected laissez-faire economics as well as market socialism, instead favoring Keynesian economics within a capitalist market-based system.|$|E
25|$|In general, Negev Bedouins {{have one}} of the highest school dropout rates in Israel. Between grades one and twelve, 85% of girls and 71% of boys drop out. As with many other areas, poor {{infrastructure}} (especially pronounced in the unrecognized villages, but also in the official towns) is a significant obstacle. The physical conditions of school buildings are often substandard, with many lacking in basic facilities, such as libraries, gyms, cafeterias, and heating and cooling systems. Under Israeli law, education is compulsory for all students between the ages of six and thirteen. However, indifference at the government level has meant that this law has not always been enforced with regards to the Negev Bedouin. Moreover, the government will not <b>support</b> <b>infrastructure</b> developments to schools in the unrecognized villages, as the official policy is to incentivize the relocation of the Bedouin into towns. As the building and maintenance of schools is a municipal matter, there are relatively fewer Bedouin schools (compared to the rest of Israeli society), and schools are often further away from most households.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between just-in-time technique and manufacturing performance of some selected Nigerian companies. Just-in time {{was considered to be}} an overall organisational phenomenon. Data were obtained through a structured questionnaire from a sample size of 300 knowledgeable employees to test the developed model and formulated hypotheses that cover both just-intime and the <b>supporting</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Bivariate correlation analysis was used to test the three hypotheses. The results showed that: (1) there was a significant relationship between total quality management (<b>supporting</b> <b>infrastructure)</b> and just-in-time practices; (2) Human resources management (<b>supporting</b> <b>infrastructure)</b> was positively related to just-in-time practices; (3) there was a positive significant relationship between Just-in-time practices and manufacturing performance. These results demonstrate that justin- time practices can be successfully implemented if certain <b>supporting</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are provided, and also support the notion that just-in-time should be practiced at all levels and departments of the organisation, rather than viewing it strictly for shop floor workers...|$|R

2500|$|After the war, {{interviews}} were conducted with Vietnamese communist leaders and military commanders familiar with the Viet Cong organization, its war-making capacity, and <b>support</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> They said the Phoenix operations were very effective against them, reports Stanley Karnow. Thomas Ricks, in evaluating the effectiveness of the counterinsurgency tactics of the Marine Corps and of the Phoenix program, confirmed their value by reference to [...] "Hanoi's official history of the war". If one discounts the corrupt criminality and its political fallout, the Phoenix partisans were perhaps better able tactically to confront the elusive Viet Cong support networks, i.e., the sea in which the fish swam, than the regular units of the ARVN and the U. S. Army. Yet the military lessons of the war in full complexity were being understood by the Army, later insisted Colonel Summers.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{aerospace}} publication Flying Magazine, {{while the}} TBM 700 had rapidly proved popular {{on the market}} and a good aircraft on its own merits, the services and support facilities SOCATA provided for the aircraft were an initial point of weakness. Early on, customers were often faced with lengthy delays in acquiring spare parts and other services; negative feedback on the after sales support for the TBM 700 has been attributed as the cause of a downturn in sales during the 1990s. SOCATA, recognising the critical importance of an effective <b>support</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> decided to invest heavily in improving worldwide support for the type; instead of being solely reliant upon third parties and partnership arrangements with other companies, the firm developed their own facilities. SOCATA opened its own service center in Florida, as well as establishing a network of distributors capable of both sales and services for the TBM 700. Consequently, during the late 1990s, sales of the type within the North American market rose dramatically.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the entire}} PC industry, declines in prices along with {{commensurate}} increases in computer performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities {{to engage in}} upselling. As a result, the company was selling {{a greater proportion of}} inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. Dell's customer service worsened as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical <b>support</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Although, Dell originally was known for high levels of customer service, the decline in computer prices led to the company cutting costs. Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting [...] "got in the way," [...] aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve customer service, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional [...] "bloatware" [...] on PCs.
