40|$|The {{temporal}} synchronization {{of presentation}} slides and lecture videos {{enables us to}} enhance the user experience of online lecture viewing systems. In this work, we present a novel approach to robustly and reliably detect and recognize <b>slide</b> <b>changes,</b> {{which is based on}} bit rate sequences. By exploiting readily available information, the computational complexity of the approach is very low. In contrast to prior work, no requirements on the amount or type of texture, motion of foreground objects, or text size on the slide are imposed. Experimental results show the ability to detect even minor <b>slide</b> <b>changes</b> and demonstrate the robustness against occlusions, foreground motion, and camera motion.

40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{framework}} to automatically match electronic slides to the videos of the corresponding presentations. The synchronized slides support indexing and browsing of educational and corporate digital video libraries. Our approach extends previous work that matches slides based on visual features alone, and integrates multiple cues to further improve performance in more difficult cases. We model <b>slide</b> <b>change</b> in a presentation with a dynamic Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that captures the temporal notion of <b>slide</b> <b>change</b> and whose transition probabilities are adapted locally {{by using the}} camera events in the inference process. Our results show that combining multiple cues in a state model can greatly improve the performance in ambiguous cases. Index Terms — Algorithm, Cameras, Image matching 1...|$|R

30|$|Bandwidth {{utilization}} {{depends on}} the data size transmitted {{over a period of}} time between the client and the server. Based on the data in Table  1, WebELS VPB data for cursor-based presentation mode does not pose high bandwidth utilization since the data size is very small and slide control events are not that frequent. For VPB data in pen-based presentation mode, the more annotation is done, the larger the data sent every mouse release. As for the Flash-based online presentation, slide image is transferred from the server to the client every <b>slide</b> <b>change.</b> Though high quality images are typically around 1 Mbytes, <b>slide</b> <b>change</b> is not that frequent that would cause high bandwidth utilization. But in screen sharing technology, there is a requirement for broadband network to achieve better quality. Among the different online presentation technologies, VPB concept works well even in narrowband Internet environment, say a 56  kbps line. On the other hand, slide synchronization delay between the presenter and listener using VPB is minimal because of its optimized data size, and delay would depend mainly on the network distance, i.e., round-trip propagation and transmission delay. Slide synchronization delay of 1 or 2  seconds is negligible in online distance presentation.|$|R
