25|$|The river has {{provided}} the power {{for a number of}} water mills along its course. At Twyford, there have been mills since at least 1365, and a silk mill was built in 1810. Silk worms thrive on mulberry trees, and Queen Elizabeth I had encouraged planting of them during her reign. The Wokingham area was known for its production of silk stockings, and Thomas and George Billing, who were from Macclesfield and were brothers, hoped to create a profitable business processing the silk. The <b>spun</b> <b>silk</b> was woven on looms set up in cottages, and for a while the Billings were reasonably successful, although labour costs were kept down by employing children who should have been at Polehampton School. The law changed to allow silk to be imported more freely from France, and only mills equipped with up-to-date equipment could compete. Thomas died in 1824, and the mill was sold to become a flour mill soon afterwards. The wooden building was burnt down in a fire in 1891. A new mill was built, and in 1927 was bought by Berks, Bucks and Oxon Farmers Ltd, a group of farmers who operated as a co-operative to mill animal feed. The mill was powered by water wheels and diesel engines until the early 1960s, when it was converted to use electric motors. A distribution warehouse was added in 1969, but another fire destroyed the building in 1976, and construction of a new mill was completed in 1979. The owners became bankrupt in the 1990s, and in 2001 the site was redeveloped for housing. Although none of it is original, much of the building has four storeys, as did the pre-1976 building, and incorporates cosmetic features to suggest the previous use of the site.|$|E

[...] The younger male family members are typically responsible for herding the family's cattle and men of all ages work in the fields.

As for the children--women in miniature, the single difference in dress being the gay pinafore--you can only say of them that they look like Dutch dolls. But such plump, contented, cheerful little dolls!

And in a few days there were no more eggs and I could hear the hungry little nestlings making the minutest of fairy hullabaloos, the very finest <b>spun</b> <b>silk</b> of sound; a tremendous traffic in victual began and I was the trusted friend of the family.|$|E

60|$|Louise needed {{less than}} the others, for her {{wardrobe}} was more extensive and she already possessed all that a young girl could possibly make use of. This niece, the eldest of Uncle John's trio, was vastly more experienced {{in the ways of}} the world than the others, although as a traveller she had no advantage of them. Urged thereto by her worldly mother, she led a sort of trivial, butterfly existence, and her character was decidedly superficial to any close observer. Indeed, her very suavity and sweetness of manner was assumed, because it was so much more comfortable and effective to be agreeable than otherwise. She was now past seventeen years of age, tall and well formed, with a delicate and attractive face which, without being beautiful, was considered pleasant and winning. Her eyes were good, though a bit too shrewd, and her light brown hair was fluffy as <b>spun</b> <b>silk.</b> Graceful of carriage, gracious of manner, yet affecting a languor unsuited to her years, Louise Merrick was a girl calculated to draw from the passing throng glances of admiration and approval, and to convey the impression of good breeding and feminine cleverness.|$|E

You know, when he was only a few days old, he would start suddenly at any strange sound. He was alive like an Æolian harp from the very beginning.... And his hair when he was born--he had a lot of hair--was like the down on the breast of a bird. I remember that now very vividly--and how I used to like to pass my hand over it.

So pleasant did it feel that after a little while he began to move his hand up her beautiful, soft, white arm until it touched her hair. For her hair was unbound and loose; it was dark, and finer than the finest <b>spun</b> <b>silk,</b> and fell all over her shoulders and down {{her back to the}} stone she sat on. He let his fingers stray in and out among it; and it felt like the soft, warm down that lines a little bird's nest to his skin. Finally, he touched her neck and allowed his hand to rest there, it was such a soft, warm neck. At length, but reluctantly, for his little rebellious heart was not yet wholly subdued, he raised his eyes to her face. Oh, how beautiful she was! Her love and eager desire to win him had flushed her clear olive skin with rich red colour; out of her sweet red lips, half parted, came her warm breath on his cheek, more fragrant than wild flowers; and her large dark eyes were gazing down into his with such a tenderness in them that Martin, seeing it, felt a strange little shudder pass through him, and scarcely knew whether to think it pleasant or painful. [...] "Dear child, I love you so much," [...] she spoke, [...] "will you not call me mother?" ...|$|E

The second squadron of the Lancers shot by, and there was the troop-horse, with his tail like <b>spun</b> <b>silk,</b> his head pulled into his breast, one ear forward and one back, setting the time for all his squadron, his legs going as smoothly as waltz music. Then the big guns came by, and I saw Two Tails and two other elephants harnessed in line to a forty-pounder siege gun, while twenty yoke of oxen walked behind. The seventh pair had a new yoke, and they looked rather stiff and tired. Last came the screw guns, and Billy the mule carried himself as though he commanded all the troops, and his harness was oiled and polished till it winked. I gave a cheer all by myself for Billy the mule, but he never looked right or left.|$|E

40|$|Spiders and {{silkworms}} <b>spin</b> <b>silks</b> that outcompete the toughness of {{all natural}} and manmade fibers. Herein, we {{compare and contrast}} the <b>spinning</b> of <b>silk</b> in silkworms and spiders, {{with the aim of}} identifying features that are important for fiber formation. Although spiders and silkworms are very distantly related, some features of <b>spinning</b> <b>silk</b> seem to be universal. Both spiders and silkworms produce large silk proteins that are highly repetitive and extremely soluble at high pH, likely due to the globular terminal domains that flank an intermediate repetitive region. The silk proteins are produced and stored at a very high concentration in glands, and then transported along a narrowing tube in which they change conformation in response primarily to a pH gradient generated by carbonic anhydrase and proton pumps, as well as to ions and shear forces. The silk proteins thereby convert from random coil and alpha helical soluble conformations to beta sheet fibers. We suggest that factors that need to be optimized for successful production of artificial silk proteins capable of forming tough fibers include protein solubility, pH sensitivity, and preservation of natively folded proteins throughout the purification and initial spinning processes...|$|R
