25|$|Until {{the early}} 1970s, Sudan's {{agricultural}} output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972, the Sudanese government became more pro-Western, and {{made plans to}} export food and cash crops. However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan. At the same time, debt <b>servicing</b> <b>costs,</b> from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose. In 1978, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) negotiated a Structural Adjustment Program with the government. This further promoted the mechanized export agriculture sector. This caused great economic problems for the pastoralists of Sudan (See Nuba Peoples).|$|E
25|$|However, as Australia's CAD {{is almost}} entirely {{generated}} by the private sector, as outlined in Professor John Pitchford's 'Consenting Adults Thesis' in the early 1990s, there is an argument that the CAD is not a significant issue. Historically, Australia has relied on overseas capital {{to fill the gap}} between domestic savings and investment, and many of these investment opportunities could not have been pursued if Australia did not have access to foreign savings. This suggests that Australia's apparently low savings level and CAD are not necessarily a significant problem. As long as the investment that is being funded by overseas capital inflow generates sufficient returns to pay for the <b>servicing</b> <b>costs</b> in the future, the increase in foreign liabilities can be viewed as sustainable in the longer term.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposition}} {{includes the}} result where the equilibrium peak-time retail electricity price becomes {{lower than the}} default price. Why should such a result occur? Larger α implies the wholesale electricity supply function is relatively flat. Remember that the retail electricity price depends on two factors, wholesale electricity price as a cost component and marginal retail <b>service</b> <b>cost.</b> While the wholesale electricity price becomes almost constant because of its flat supply function, marginal retail <b>service</b> <b>cost</b> diminished significantly after the system reform. The default retail electricity price could become higher for the remaining retail <b>service</b> <b>cost.</b> This is why the peak-time price becomes lower than the default price.|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{tradeoff}} between average <b>service</b> <b>cost</b> {{rate and}} average delay, is addressed for a M/M/ 1 queueing model with queue-length dependent service rates, chosen from a finite set. We provide an asymptotic {{characterization of the}} minimum average delay, when the average <b>service</b> <b>cost</b> rate is a small positive quantity V more than the minimum average <b>service</b> <b>cost</b> rate required for stability. We show that depending {{on the value of}} the arrival rate, the assumed <b>service</b> <b>cost</b> rate function, and the possible values of the service rates, the minimum average delay either a) increases only to a finite value, b) increases without bound as log(1 /V), or c) increases without bound as 1 /V, when V down arrow 0. We apply the analysis to a flow-level resource allocation model for a wireless downlink. We also investigate the asymptotic tradeoff for a sequence of policies which are obtained from an approximate fluid model for the M/M/ 1 queue...|$|R

Just as this article describes a bond as a 30-year bond with 6% coupon rate, this article describes a pass-through MBS as a $3 billion pass-through with 6% pass-through rate, a 6.5% WAC, and 340-month WAM. The pass-through rate is different from the WAC; it is the rate that the investor would receive if he/she held this pass-through MBS, and the pass-through rate is almost always less than the WAC.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of cost estimates for construction projects {{is not an}} easy job, because construction projects are subject to risks and uncertainties, particularly at the inception stage, when very limited information about the project is available. However, the cost estimates prepared at this stage are usually the most important to the client. Nowadays, the <b>costs</b> for building <b>services</b> installations contribute a significant share of the total construction cost of building projects. Thus the accuracy of the building <b>services</b> <b>cost</b> estimates {{plays an important role in}} the total building construction project cost estimates. Traditionally, building <b>services</b> <b>cost</b> estimates are prepared by a deterministic single-figure (most likely) approach. This approach is often cost-ineffective and reactionary in nature. The risk management process (RMP) provides a logical consistent framework in identifying the risk factors affecting costs and in making allowances for risks in cost estimation. A survey was conducted to find out the current building <b>services</b> <b>cost</b> estimation practices and to obtain an insight into the understanding, use and application of RMP in preparing building <b>services</b> <b>cost</b> estimates within the building services industry. The results of the survey have suggested that the traditional deterministic cost estimation method is still being adopted by the majority of building services engineers in preparing cost estimates. Also, RMP has not been widely adopted by the building services industry in Hong Kong. From the analysis of building services firms and engineers with regard to the critical success factors for implementation of risk management, the survey reflects that the potential of implementing RMP for building <b>services</b> <b>cost</b> estimation is high.

40|$|The grid {{integration}} of intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (RES) causes costs for grid operators due to forecast uncertainty {{and the resulting}} production schedule mismatches. These so-called profile <b>service</b> <b>costs</b> are marginal cost components and {{can be understood as}} an insurance fee against RES production schedule uncertainty that the system operator incurs due to the obligation to always provide sufficient control reserve capacity for power imbalance mitigation. This paper studies the situation for the German power system and the existing German RES support schemes. The profile <b>service</b> <b>costs</b> incurred by German Transmission System Operators (TSOs) are quantified and means for cost reduction are discussed. In general, profile <b>service</b> <b>costs</b> are dependent on the RES prediction error and the specific workings of the power markets via which the prediction error is balanced. This paper shows both how the prediction error can be reduced in daily operation as well as how profile <b>service</b> <b>costs</b> can be reduced via optimization against power markets and/or active curtailment of RES generation.

40|$|AbstractA company's {{economic}} survivability {{depends on}} the trust customers have into {{the company and its}} offered solutions. Consequently a company tries to act as a trustworthiness business partner. A difficult task, when customers cannot check the outcome and quality of an offered solution. Especially for Product Service Systems (PSS), the service part represents such an intangible performance, which cannot be used and verified by customers before consumption. Consequently, customers must trust a company's promised performance quality before they can experience the service. Service production always involves the customer into the service provision process, as the value is co-created. That is why, the service provider's performance and thus its <b>service</b> production <b>costs</b> rely trusting a customer's input. As trust plays such an important role we integrate it into <b>service</b> <b>costing.</b> In our work we present and evaluate a risk-based costing approach for PSS. The benefit of our cost model is to include risk factors associated with the trustworthiness of customer input. Our contribution to service science is the computation of <b>service</b> <b>costs</b> by the extension of standard Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC) including the expected loss due to customer input. In our work we demonstrate the successful inclusion of trust-based risk factors into <b>service</b> <b>costing</b> to improve <b>service</b> <b>cost</b> management in the context of PSS...|$|R
