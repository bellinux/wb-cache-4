You've got to let him sing it." [...] Muddy Waters' previous albums replicated {{the sound of his}} live performances. Working with a studio band rather than his own was problematic for Muddy Waters, who could not perform material from the album live. He stated [...] "What the hell do you have a record for if you can't play the first time it's out? I'm <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> that... If you've got to have big amplifiers and wah-wahs and equipment to make you guitar say different things, well, hell, you can't play no blues." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{earlier work}} was deemed [...] "vaguely funky white-soul" [...] and [...] "rock", recent ones have been judged {{to have a}} more reggae, anthemic pop sound, evoking {{comparisons}} to Coldplay. Levine refuses to fit his music into a genre, saying: [...] "There's so much variety in music, it's silly to belong to a specific club and try to sound a certain way". He considers himself an orthodox lyricist sticking to conventional themes, acknowledging: [...] "Romance, love, the lack thereof are still very big themes. I haven't {{figured out a way to}} use everything yet. As a songwriter, I'm still limited to that one thing." [...] He also claims he does not like mincing words, stating in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I was <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach".|$|E
500|$|In November 1994, Yankovic entered Santa Monica Sound Recorders in Santa Monica, California {{to begin}} {{the first of the}} Bad Hair Day sessions, which he {{produced}} himself. Recording with Yankovic were Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. The album was recorded in five sessions. The first session started on November 30 and yielded two originals: [...] "Callin' In Sick" [...] and [...] "Everything You Know Is Wrong". The second session started the next day and produced the original songs: [...] "I Remember Larry", [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy", and [...] "Since You've Been Gone". The third session took place on November 5, 1995, and resulted in the original [...] "I'm <b>So</b> <b>Sick</b> <b>of</b> You" [...] and the parody [...] "Cavity Search". The fourth session yielded [...] "The Alternative Polka" [...] medley, and the two parodies [...] "Gump" [...] and [...] "Phony Calls". The fifth and final recording session produced [...] "Amish Paradise" [...] and [...] "Syndicated Inc.", both of which were parodies.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, {{when asked about the}} lyrics [...] "Keep her coming every night" [...] and [...] "Sinking my fingertips into every inch of you", Levine said: [...] "Yep, that's sexual, all right. I was <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach. The little girls would enjoy them, and it would go right over my grandparents' heads. But it would hit my ex-girlfriend like a ton of bricks. It was perfect." [...] He also comments on how MTV played an edited version of the song for the music video, with the word [...] "coming" [...] edited out of the line [...] "keep her coming every night". Levine noted, [...] "MTV has now edited the language. They won't let me say, 'Keep her coming every night', and they took the sinking out of 'sinking my fingertips'. It's like communist China. It's totally bizarre." ...|$|E

Ne'theless, I am <b>so</b> sorely <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> this wound that I would rather die than live as I am living; wherefore I will go to Ireland for the sake of being healed, if such a thing is possible." ...|$|R
60|$|Ginger Dick and Peter Russet--two men I've {{spoke of}} to you afore--tried {{to save their}} money once.

500|$|The {{title of}} the album, The Hunting Party, is a contextual metaphor. The album, {{a return to the}} band's {{original}} harder rock-centric sounds, represents the band's desire to not only create something different from other rock bands, but to also bring back the [...] "energy and soul" [...] of rock itself, and that Linkin Park are the party that will hunt for that energy and soul. Shinoda elaborated on the {{title of the}} album in an interview with Kerrang! explaining: [...] "We got <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> other bands trying to be other bands and playing it safe the whole time, so the album name comes from a theory about culture becoming too passive, everyone just standing around waiting for opportunities to come to them instead of going out and getting theirs. I'm aware there {{are always going to be}} heavier bands than us, but The Hunting Party is Linkin Park going out and getting it for ourselves." [...] The inspiration for the title came from a news article Shinoda read online about a Japanese writer's concerns about today's growing society. The writer described the young men of today as [...] "herbivores", and explained how they are essentially grazing, waiting for an opportunity to come to them, rather than hunting for it.|$|E
500|$|After {{the break}} up of Kara's Flowers, Levine, along with Carmichael, left Los Angeles to pursue further studies at Five Towns College in New York. On MTV News, in 2002, he said: [...] "That's when I started {{waking up to}} the whole hip-hop, R thing. We had friends named Chaos and Shit. It was not Brentwood High". After {{dropping}} out of Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York, where he and Jesse Carmichael spent a semester, they reunited with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form a band once more. They experimented with several styles, including country and folk, before deciding groove-based music would become their genre. Levine explained the need for a makeover for the band: [...] "We were just <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> being a typical rock 'n'roll band ... I felt like I needed to look elsewhere for vocal inspiration." [...] The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman, and David Boxenbaum. [...] Following Berkman's advice, the band added a fifth member, James Valentine, and was renamed Maroon 5. In an interview with HitQuarters, Berkman explained that Levine [...] "seemed to be a very shy, shoe-gazing type ... a fifth member could play the guitar to free up the singer , so he could be the star I perceived him to be".|$|E
500|$|... "I Remember Larry" [...] is a style {{parody of}} Hilly Michaels, and {{it tells the}} tale of a {{neighborhood}} bully who, after myriad pranks, is brutally murdered by the narrator. At the 3:10 mark, the song contains a backmasked message, which when reversed reads, [...] "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands". [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy" [...] tells the story of Santa snapping, embarking on a killing spree, and eventually being arrested. Originally, the song had a different third verse, differing in the fact that, {{at the end of the}} song, Santa is killed by the SWAT team. The [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version was eventually released on the single for [...] "Amish Paradise". Another version was written for the Touring with Scissors tour in 1999, combining elements of the album version and the [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version. [...] "Since You've Been Gone" [...] is a generic doo-wop a cappella track that details a lover's torment after the object of his affections breaks up with him. Yankovic performed most of the vocals himself, and to make sure that he stayed on key, a scratch guitar track was recorded; when the song was mixed, the guitar track was removed. Bassist Steve Jay provides the low voices in the song. Finally, [...] "I'm <b>So</b> <b>Sick</b> <b>of</b> You," [...] a style parody of Elvis Costello in which the singer tells his girlfriend all the things he hates about her.|$|E
60|$|Now that grievous hurt which Sir Tristram had {{received}} {{at the hands}} of Sir Marhaus did not heal, but instead grew even more rankled and sore, so that there were many who thought that there had been treachery practised and that the spearhead had been poisoned to cause such a malignant disease as that with which the wounded man suffered. So by and by Sir Tristram grew <b>so</b> grievously <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> his hurt that all those who were near him thought that he must certainly die.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, {{this short}} {{contains}} the famous recurring dispatcher line [...] "Calling Doctor Howard, Doctor Fine, Doctor Howard." [...] In this short, the three doctors get <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> and tired <b>of</b> the repeated calls that {{they decided to}} tear down the dispatcher's call board and, when a small transmitter appears on the floor, quivering and still repeating [...] "Doctor Howard! Doctor Fine! Doctor Howard!", they all take out handguns and shoot it, causing the dispatcher to say [...] "OH!!!! THEY GOT ME.". The Stooges then lift a toast and repeat the film's catch-phrase: [...] "For duty and humanity!" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1901, Renié {{completed}} the Concerto in C minor {{that she had}} begun composing while at the Conservatoire. On the advice of Dubois, she showed it to Camille Chevillard, who scheduled it for several concerts. Unfortunately, Renié, had suffered a severe stomach disorder at 21 that left her weak, and though she often forced herself to perform despite her illness, she became <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> that one <b>of</b> the Lamoureux concerts with Chevillard had to be delayed. Nonetheless, these concerts established Renié, {{not only as a}} virtuoso, but as a composer, and helped establish the harp as a solo instrument, inspiring other composers to write for harp.|$|R
500|$|The team {{failed to}} throw a {{touchdown}} pass in any of their first five games, three of which were shutout losses. Offensive coordinator John Rauch walked out on the team during the week 5 game against Cincinnati, and gave 'personal differences' {{as the reason for}} his resignation. His duties were taken over by McKay, who pointed to the increased effectiveness of the team’s “simpler” offense, saying that they were no longer “trying to do all the things people said you have to do in this league”. On a strange NFL weekend in which O.J. Simpson was ejected from a game for fighting, the Chicago Bears lost a game due to a referee’s inadvertent whistle, and Minnesota Vikings receiver Sammy White fumbled away a touchdown due to starting his celebration before entering the end zone, McKay launched an obscenity-filled tirade against Denver Broncos coach John Ralston after a blowout loss. McKay admitted that his feelings dated back to their college rivalry, when McKay coached at USC and Ralston coached at Stanford University, but pointed to specific plays such as a reverse and a last-minute punt return as evidence that Ralston was trying to run up the score. Third-string running back Manfred Moore caught a lucky break when, waived after the week 13 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was picked up by the Oakland Raiders as an injury replacement for ex-Buccaneer Rick Jennings. He wound up going from an 0–13 team to the eventual Super Bowl champion. Players began to meet for postgame parties at Steve Spurrier’s house, in order to avoid having to show their faces in public. According to defensive end Pat Toomay, “By the time we got to the last game of the season, we had so many injuries that we didn’t feel we had much of a chance. Everybody was <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> the season that they showed up packed and ready to get out of town. It looked like a bunch of Okies fleeing the dust bowl." [...] McKay said that the week 4 game against the Baltimore Colts summed up the season: “On one play I looked up and one of our guys was getting kicked out of the game, and two more were getting carried off”.|$|E

I'm <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> and tired <b>of,</b> of people wanting to come here because they know it's a good country and then they want to change things before they even really officially become a Canadian, so , I have no sympathy for her..."

2500|$|In Section Two, [...] "The Material", Cleckley {{presents}} a typical [...] "full" [...] psychopath's {{behavior in a}} series of 15 vignettes (originally nine in the first edition, and all male). For example, the psychopath can typically tell vivid, lifelike, plausible stories that are completely fraudulent, without evincing any element of delusion. When confronted with a lie, the psychopath is unflappable and can often effortlessly pass it off as a joke. In another typical case history, the psychopath is hospitalized for psychiatric treatment but because of his constant trouble-making, leaving wards in an uproar, the hospital is finally forced to turn him over to the police. Eventually, the police become <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> his repeated antics that they try to hospitalize him again.|$|E
2500|$|Media {{reported}} that the gunman in the 2006 Dawson College shooting in Montreal, Quebec, Kimveer Singh Gill, was interested in goth subculture. Gill's self-professed love of Goth culture was the topic of media interest, and it was widely {{reported that}} the word [...] "Goth", in Gill's writings, was {{a reference to the}} alternative industrial and goth subculture rather than a reference to gothic rock music. Gill, who committed suicide after the attack, wrote in his online journal: [...] "I'm <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> hearing about jocks and preps making life hard for the goths and others who look different, or are different". Gill described himself in his profile on Vampirefreaks.com as [...] "... Trench ... the Angel of Death" [...] and he stated that [...] "Metal and Goth kick ass". An image gallery on Gill's Vampirefreaks.com blog had photos of him pointing a gun at the camera or wearing a long black trench coat.|$|E
2500|$|Wuornos was incarcerated at the Florida Department of Corrections Broward Correctional Institution (BCI) {{death row}} for women, then {{transferred}} to the Florida State Prison for execution. Her appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied in 1996. In a 2001 petition to the Florida Supreme Court, she stated her intention to dismiss her legal counsel and terminate all pending appeals. [...] "I killed those men," [...] she wrote, [...] "robbed them as cold as ice. And I'd do it again, too. There's no chance in keeping me alive or anything, because I'd kill again. I have hate crawling through my system...I am <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> hearing this 'she's crazy' stuff. I've been evaluated so many times. I'm competent, sane, and I'm trying to tell the truth. I'm one who seriously hates human life and would kill again." [...] While her attorneys argued {{that she was not}} mentally competent to make such a request, Wuornos insisted that she knew what she was doing, and a court-appointed panel of psychiatrists agreed.|$|E
60|$|In fact, it is {{said that}} the first doctors in New Jersey were women, and that the people placed such faith in their abilities, that unless a case were very serious indeed, so that a {{physician}} had to be sent for from the city, they were perfectly satisfied with the services of the women doctors. It is also stated, that in those days the people of New Jersey were very healthy. These two statements can be put together in different ways: some may say, that, where people were <b>so</b> seldom <b>sick,</b> doctors <b>of</b> great ability were not needed; while, on the other hand, those who have a higher opinion of womankind might well believe, that, because women made such good doctors, the people were seldom sick.|$|R
50|$|The ECJ {{started by}} {{deciding}} that sick pay {{was within the}} term ‘pay’ under TFEU art 157. <b>So</b> denial <b>of</b> <b>sick</b> pay was prima facie indirect discrimination against women. It rejected the Government’s justification, because {{though it was a}} decision for a national court, ‘generalizations about certain categories of workers… do not enable criteria which are both objective and unrelated to any discrimination on grounds of sex to be identified.’ The ECJ did accept, however, that broader considerations apply when it is a law. If the law would ‘meet a necessary aim of social policy and that they are suitable and requisite for attaining that aim’ it would be justified.|$|R
5000|$|... "Get {{ready for}} blood, tears and sperm. This album {{talks about the}} present tense and the mankind, the {{boundaries}} of ones desires, dreams and mistakes. This is our statement to this rusted world, to these wasted dreams and plastic reality with real life and unreal people. We're <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> mediocrity in their bodies who walk empty streets without any real purpose. This album talks about them, about their sorrow, mistakes and inner demons. Without them we do not exist and without us they are nothing. This is about something real. It's about this fallen mankind. This world has become occupied, surrounded and unhealthy. We {{do not agree with}} this worlds systems of values. This is world without values, without inner boundaries that confront served mediocrity.

2500|$|Jasikevičius's father Linas {{always was}} a sports lover {{and along with}} him, he {{followed}} practically everything, together they cheered for USSR national teams or any athlete who had USSR written across his or her chest. Not surprisingly, his dad {{took him to the}} first basketball workout when he was 6 years old. His first coach was Feliksas Mitkevičius in Kaunas basketball school, who was strict and not once was chasing Šarūnas when he was trying to run away from the workouts. According to Mitkevičius, when Šarūnas was 12 years old, he was <b>so</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> basketball that he wished to drop it. He visited his parents, outlined the situation and stated {{that it would be a}} huge loss to Lithuania. Following it, his dad had a strong conversation with Šarūnas and forbade to drop basketball, which he wished to replace with tennis. In Kaunas basketball school he met with the future NBA star Žydrūnas Ilgauskas with which he was meeting practically every day, at school, in the gym or elsewhere for the next eleven years. Tomas Masiulis was another notable player in his team. Jasikevičius remembers that at first he was seen as the guy who was [...] "talented but lazy" [...] as he was no devotee of the gym; all he did was joke around and try to work as little as possible. Consequently, once his dad stopped him from going on a trip to Minsk with the team, a trip of kind which happens only once a year, as his marks were disastrous and it was a punishment: [...] "No school? So no basketball". Though, his parents were happy to see him venting his hyperactivity in basketball, and this made them urge him on towards the sport, as it also helped him avoid bad company in the area. They played in the gym, and also in the street using scrap metal instead of real baskets, and their favorite pastime was called minus, a kind of forerunner of little game that can be seen today during the NBA All-Star Game called [...] "horse". It was far from ideal, but his parents preferred to see him play with the scrap metal hoops in front of their home rather than down at the pitch, where it would have taken him less than five minutes to pick a fight with the wrong person. His childhood dream was to become a Žalgiris Kaunas player about which he was so crazy that he knew everything about every player, even the players’ shoe sizes. Following the Žalgiris' victory in 1986 Intercontinental Cup, he begged his father to take him to the airport to welcome home the players, where hundreds of people were waiting in the freezing cold. His father knew some of the players, and managed to get signed posters and photos that he used to decorate all the walls of his room.|$|E
