Spring designers of metallic coil springs have design formulae readily available, and software packages specific to coil spring design exist. However, the <b>sulcated</b> spring is at the prototype stage of development, so literature on these springs is very sparse. The thesis contains information {{on the market for}} <b>sulcated</b> springs, and their advantages and disadvantages. Literature on other types of fibre reinforced plastic springs has also been reviewed. Design software has been developed for the <b>sulcated</b> spring along similar lines to coil spring design software. In order to develop the software, a theoretical model had to be developed which formed the mathematical basis for the software. The theoretical model is based on a choice of four methods for calculating the flexural rigidity; beam theory, plate theory, and lamination theory assuming isotropic and orthoropic material properties. Experimental results for strain and spring stiffness have been compared with the theoretical model, and were in good agreement. Included in the design software are the results of experimental work on fatigue, and design limiting factors to prevent or warn against impractical designs. Finite element analysis has been used to verify the theoretical model developed, and to find the better approximation to the experimental results. Applications and types of assemblies for the <b>sulcated</b> spring were discussed. <b>Sulcated</b> spring designs for the automotive applications of a suspension, clutch and engine valve spring were found using the design computer software. These <b>sulcated</b> spring designs were within or close to the space of the existing coil spring and yield the same performance. Finally the commercial feasibility of manufacturing the <b>sulcated</b> spring was assessed and compared with the coil spring, to evaluate the plausibility of the <b>sulcated</b> spring replacing the coil spring eventually...|$|R

60|$|Dimorphism of {{this kind}} in the animal kingdom {{does not seem to}} have any direct {{relations}} to the reproductive powers, as Mr. Darwin has shown to be the case in plants, nor does it appear to be very general. One other case only is known to me in another family of my eastern Lepidoptera, the Pieridæ; and but few occur in the Lepidoptera of other countries. The spring and autumn broods of some European species differ very remarkably; and this must be considered as a phenomenon of an analogous though not of an identical nature, while the Araschnia prorsa, of Central Europe, is a striking example of this alternate or seasonal dimorphism. Among our nocturnal Lepidoptera, I am informed, many analogous cases occur; and as the whole history of many of these has been investigated by breeding successive generations from the egg, it is to be hoped that some of our British Lepidopterists will give us a connected account of all the abnormal phenomena which they present. Among the Coleoptera Mr. Pascoe has pointed out the existence of two forms of the male sex in seven species of the two genera Xenocerus and Mecocerus belonging to the family Anthribidæ, (Proc. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1862); and no less than six European Water-beetles, of the genus Dytiscus, have females of two forms, the most common having the elytra deeply <b>sulcate,</b> the rarer smooth as in the males. The three, and sometimes four or more, forms under which many Hymenopterous insects (especially Ants) occur, must be considered as a related phenomenon, though here each form is specialized to a distinct function in the economy of the species. Among the higher animals, albinoism and melanism may, as I have already stated, be considered as analogous facts; and I met with one case of a bird, a species of Lory (Eos fuscata), clearly existing under two differently coloured forms, since I obtained both sexes of each from a single flock, while no intermediate specimens have yet been found.|$|E

Particularly in xenarthrans, studies have been carried out mainly in the Suborder Pilosa, which includes anteaters, tree sloths and ground sloths. Within Suborder Cingulata, i. e., armadillos, glyptodonts and relatives, an analysis of a digital endocast in a specimen belonging to the genus Glyptodon Owen has recently been performed. We present here the construction and analysis of a digital endocast of another cingulate, namely Pampatherium Ameghino. The cast was made after CT scans, by using the reconstruction software BioVis 3 D. This software was also used to display and calculate the volume of the digital cast and the appropriate portions under scrutiny. The external brain morphology of the specimen of Pampatherium shows that the telencephalic hemispheres were poorly <b>sulcated,</b> and does not extend over either the cerebellum or the olfactory bulbs. Compared with digital endocast of three extant armadillos and of Glyptodon, the broad morphology shows a closely resemblance with the latter. These results are consistent with the most recent phylogenetic reconstructions in Cingulata. On the other hand, the body mass estimate from cranial and dental measurements for that specimen of Pampatherium yielded a value of 380 kg. From this, a quantitative analysis was performed and the appropriate encephalisation quotient was obtained, {{which turned out to be}} 0. 25, which is greater than that calculated for the Glyptodon specimen (0. 16), whose body mass had been estimated as 1300 kg.
