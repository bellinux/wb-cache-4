40|$|Uniformity of {{granular}} flow {{behavior is}} critical in many industries. The behavior in a conveyor apparatus aims {{to fill a gap}} in knowledge of achieving uniformity in mass flow rate by correlating velocity profile data with mass flow rate measurements and observing the difference, resulting in unwanted energy dissipation. Image data were collected for uniformly-shaped particles in a bottom-driven flow conveyor belt system from which a graph of the velocity profiles {{as a function of the}} particle’s position were created. The information on velocity was then used to determine how the flow velocity decayed as particle distance from the belt increased. These velocity relationships, differing upon the size of the particles, <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> and outlet size, will be compared to flow decay relationships found in past experiments that focused on gravity-driven systems. In these past experiments, it was observed that the velocity profiles were linear near the shearing location. Though, as the view shifted towards the center of the bed, the relationship became exponential. The velocity profiles from past experiments will be compared against the relationships found in this conveyor research. If the two relationships differ, this could point towards unexplained velocity phenomena. The application of this research can serve to validate simulations in fluid mechanics and physically demonstrate a process that can be further developed and customized for industry applications, such as feeding a reactor. The image processing can be further developed to process images of non-spherical particles that have a random distribution of size and orientation. B. A. (Bachelor of Arts...|$|E
40|$|The file {{associated}} with this record is under a permanent embargo while its copyright status is ascertained. Pedestrian lateral excitation of bridges has received considerable attention since the large vibrations of the Solférino Footbridge and the London Millennium Footbridge. Many loading models have been proposed, generally assuming frequency synchronisation of pedestrians to the bridge motion. However, some measurements from bridges and tests of pedestrians on oscillating surfaces seem to be inconsistent with this assumption. Rather they indicate self - excited forces at the bridge frequency, which is generally different from the walking frequency. A simple model of human gait has been proposed, drawing on findings in the biomechanics field, {{which is consistent with}} the above observations. It predicts that pedestrians walking more slowly, such as in a denser crow d, generate larger self - excited forces. There is, however, a need to verify this predicted feature and validate or refine other details of the model. To this end, this paper presents a new experimental campaign of the human - structure interaction. A custom - built instrumented treadmill with a generous walking area, equipped with a mechanism allowing for automatic adjustment of <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> to that of the pedestrian, is placed on a hydraulic shaking table.

40|$|On a treadmill, {{intensity}} is determined when a runner sets the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b> The runner must then find {{a combination of}} stride rate and length that will equal the belt speed. When using a cycle ergometer nothing forces a rider to find a combination of pedaling rate and force on the pedal to match a set intensity. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the ability of trained individuals to match the intensity of cycling on a stationary cycle ergometer with the intensity of running on a treadmill. METHODS: Seven participants (3 female, 4 male) who regularly run for fitness ran on a treadmill for 2 miles at a self-selected pace (mean = 3. 18 ± 0. 17 m/s). Then each participant rode the same course on the stationary ergometer with the goal to match the intensity of the run. For the two activities, expired gases, heart rate (HR) and EMG (right leg: gluteus maximus, GMAX, lateral vastus, VAST, hamstrings, HAMS, and gastrocnemius, GAST) were collected. Integrated EMG (mV*s) was calculated to determine muscle activation. Two tailed t-tests were used to quantify the difference between variables of the two trials and correlations were calculated to determine relationships of muscle activity to performance and metabolic data. RESULTS: The average pedaling rate and step frequency, HR, and ventilatory rate (VE) were not statistically different between running and cycling, although HR and VE were lower in cycling (HR mean= 7 bpm, VE mean= 6 L/min). Average oxygen consumption, energy expenditure, METS and breaths per minute were significantly greater during running (mean = 2. 89 L/min, 41. 37 ml/kg/min, 13. 57 kcal/min, 11. 82 METS, 40. 70 bpm) than cycling (mean = 2. 51 L/min, 35. 89 ml/kg/min, 11. 62 kcal/min, 10. 25 METS, 33. 79 bpm) (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Total muscle activity during running was two times greater than cycling (p = 0. 00) and each of the muscles were activated more in running (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). In running, GAST (r= 0. 83, p = 0. 02) and HAMS (r= 0. 90, p= 0. 01) contributed most to total muscle activity, QUAD (r= 0. 97, p= 0. 00) and GAST (r= 0. 82, p= 0. 03) were highly correlated to speed, and QUAD (r= 0. 78, p= 0. 04) was highly correlated with caloric expenditure and oxygen consumption. In cycling, all muscles related similarly to the total muscle activity, speed, caloric expenditure and oxygen consumption, thus muscle activity was shared by the four muscles. CONCLUSION: Based on metabolic data, this group was unable to match the intensity of pedaling with that of their self-selected running pace. Interestingly, they had very similar stride (mean = 79. 1 /min) and pedaling (mean = 78. 3 /min) rates. When asked to match intensities, these participants naturally selected a resistance on the bike that would permit them to pedal at the same frequency as running, but the resistance was not sufficient to produce enough power to match the intensity. Two participants are regular cyclists and they were better able to match intensities. For those two, for example, caloric expenditure was only 0. 42 kcal/min less on the bike, while the other five averaged 2. 03 kcal/min less. The majority of the participants lacked experience on the bike which may be why they were unable to freely match the two intensities. The mismatch of intensity has implications on fitness and injury recovery. The two muscle patterns and task demands are so different, that it is necessary for people to be familiar with the effect of resistance on the bike and not just match leg movement rates if the same {{intensity is}} desired for acquiring or maintaining fitness...|$|E

The first one is the ''calibration'' part and deals with the automatic recognition and learning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottle {{as well as with}} <b>the</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contained solution. Real-time operation is not a requirement in this part which is run off: line once for every product and before the filling process begins. The second part is the ''quality control'' part and is responsible for <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottle, <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> its position within <b>the</b> frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image, <b>the</b> quality check <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottle and the check for <b>the</b> adequate filling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottle. For this part, real-time operation is required so that each bottle is inspected during production. A simulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system was attempted in the Remote Sensing Laboratory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NTUA. The trials were done with glass serum bottles of a diameter <b>of</b> 7 cm. <b>The</b> artificial vision system operated with complete success when <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conveyor <b>belt</b> was 6 m/min. The artificial vision system developed is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality control system. <b>The</b> mechanical parts <b>of</b> an integrated quality control system will be created...|$|R

40|$|Our {{ability to}} {{automatically}} adapt our walking pattern to <b>the</b> demands <b>of</b> our environment {{is central to}} maintaining a steady gait. Accordingly, a large effort is being made to extend and integrate this adaptability to lower-limb prostheses. To date, <b>the</b> main focus <b>of</b> this research has been on short term adaptation, such as {{in response to a}} terrain transition or a sudden change in the environment. However, long term adaptation and underlying sensorimotor learning processes are critical to optimizing walking patterns and predictively changing our gait when faced with continued perturbations. Furthermore, investigating these processes in lower-limb amputees may provide a unique window into the interplay between sensory driven adaptation and top-down cerebellar modulation of locomotor reflexes and may potentially help alleviate gait asymmetries. In the current exploratory study, we therefore investigated adaptation, sensorimotor learning, and gait symmetry in a group of transtibial amputees walking with a hybrid-EMG controlled powered prosthesis and matched controls (both groups N= 3). Participants were asked to perform a split-belt walking trial during which <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> on <b>the</b> affected side ran at twice <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contralateral <b>belt</b> (1. 0 m/s and 0. 5 m/s respectively). Adaptation, sensorimotor learning, and symmetry are compared to two baseline conditions. Initial results illustrate that the amputees were readily able to use the hybrid controller, modulated their EMG depending on treadmill speed, and successfully adapted their gait during split-belt walking. However, the temporal gait parameters suggest that amputees used a different adaptation technique and showed reduced sensorimotor learning, while gait symmetry was improved, in the short term, post-adaptation...|$|R
500|$|The script posed several {{technical}} {{challenges to}} both the puppet and special effects departments of Century 21 Productions. The [...] "blurring" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structures making up the Mysteron city was accomplished by mounting a sheet <b>of</b> glass between <b>the</b> camera and the effects set, with Vaseline placed on the glass at the necessary points to create lens flare. Complex scale model shots of Captain Blue's SPV navigating <b>the</b> spiral structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Car-Vu were simplified by turning the road surface instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle, thus eliminating the requirement to manipulate the wires (or move the camera). Since the spinning blades reduced <b>the</b> practicality <b>of</b> overhead wire control, <b>the</b> scenes <b>of</b> Spectrum Helicopter A42's dogfight with the jetpack-wearing Blue were filmed upside-down (with wires supporting <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helicopter model) and flipped during post-production. A sequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World President and Captain Brown standing on a moving walkway while undergoing security checks at the Maximum Security Building was particularly difficult to film, since it was essential that the puppet operators, working from a gantry overhead, keep pace with <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conveyor <b>belt</b> powering <b>the</b> set below. The Captain Scarlet [...] "grimacing" [...] head, used for the reaction shot immediately after the reconstruction is hit by Blue's bullet, was sculpted especially by the puppet workshop for its one-off appearance in this episode. In his DVD audio commentary for the episode, Gerry Anderson remembered how, on a technical level, [...] "everything had to be perfect" [...] for <b>the</b> filming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first episode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new series.|$|R
