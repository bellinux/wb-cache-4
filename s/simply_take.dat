The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E

25|$|So {{far this}} looks like simple {{parasitism}} by the ants, as if they <b>simply</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the plant for food and shelter. However, the plant also benefits greatly from this relationship. With the help of their traps and predation, the ants defend the plant from other insects and parasitic plants. Any insect that may kill or eat the plant is quickly captured and killed by the ants, which is also to their own benefit.|$|E
25|$|As {{knowledge-based}} technology scaled up {{the need}} for larger knowledge bases and for modular knowledge bases that could communicate and integrate with each other became apparent. This {{gave rise to the}} discipline of ontology engineering, designing and building large knowledge bases that could be used by multiple projects. One of the leading research projects in this area was the Cyc project. Cyc was an attempt to build a huge encyclopedic knowledge base that would contain not just expert knowledge but common sense knowledge. In designing an artificial intelligence agent it was soon realized that representing common sense knowledge, knowledge that humans <b>simply</b> <b>take</b> for granted, was essential to make an AI that could interact with humans using natural language. Cyc was meant to address this problem. The language they defined was known as CycL.|$|E

25|$|In 2006 the Environment Agency {{announced}} it favours compulsory metering in water-scarce southern England. The measure is controversial. Consumer groups fear it will penalise poorer families {{with lots of}} children, and the disabled, who use more water. The announcement also represents a U-turn for Labour, which fiercely opposed compulsory water meters when in opposition, describing them as a 'tax on family life'. In March 2006 the company Folkestone & Dover Water Services was granted the power to install compulsory water meters in a landmark ministerial ruling under which it was given 'water scarcity status' by Environment Minister Elliot Morley. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Morley said: 'In {{many parts of the}} country, water is a precious resource which we can no longer <b>simply</b> <b>take</b> for granted.' The company says that Folkestone and Dover are in one of the driest areas in the UK. Many parts of the Middle East had more rain than this area, and it is getting even drier and warmer due to climate change.|$|E

Jim Trageser of The Press-Enterprise, in a review of one of the San Diego performances, praised Taylor, saying he [...] "has the lung power to <b>simply</b> <b>take</b> over any show, especially his own" [...] and [...] "shows surprising grace and athleticism as well as the kind of leonine masculinity that certain big men (Orson Welles, Babe Ruth) possess".

500|$|Gage {{received}} a letter from Lord Dartmouth on April 14, 1775, advising him [...] "to arrest the principal actors and abettors in the Provincial Congress whose proceedings appear in every light to be acts of treason and rebellion". On the night of April 18, Gage sent out a detachment of soldiers on the fateful mission that would spark the American Revolutionary War. The purpose of the British expedition was to seize and destroy military supplies that the colonists had stored in Concord. According to many historical accounts, Gage also instructed his men to arrest Hancock and Adams; if so, the written orders issued by Gage made no mention of arresting the Patriot leaders. Gage apparently decided that he had nothing to gain by arresting Hancock and Adams, since other leaders would <b>simply</b> <b>take</b> their place, and the British would be portrayed as the aggressors.|$|E
500|$|There were {{problems}} to the nomination; Ernest had no children, and thus {{would have had}} to adopt one of the princes of his house to succeed him as King of Greece. To solve this problem, Ernest suggested to Palmerston that he <b>simply</b> <b>take</b> the title regent of Greece and hold the kingdom in trust for his chosen heir. He also stipulated that if he accepted the throne, it should be subject to certain guarantees by the other powers. The apparent deal-breaker however was the fact that Ernest wanted to acquire the Greek throne and still maintain control of his [...] "safer" [...] duchies. In the end, the British cabinet thought the proposed conditions unacceptable. His proposals turned down, Ernest in turn refused. In 1863, the Greek throne was accepted by another member of a royal family: the Princess of Wales' younger brother Prince William of Denmark. Ernest would later comment, [...] "That this cup was spared me, I always regarded as a piece of good fortune".|$|E

500|$|The Americans became {{increasingly}} {{worried about the}} growing chasm in the outlook towards the war, and on advice from his advisers, Johnson described neutralism as [...] "another name for a Communist takeover" [...] in a New Year's message to Minh. As Minh remained adamant about these policies, Roger Hilsman and Lodge, the main proponents of removing Diệm, began to lose confidence in the junta, joining the military establishment, who had opposed the coup against Diệm in the first place. In a January 21 meeting between Harkins, Lodge, Minh, Kim and Tho, the Americans mooted a plan to bomb North Vietnam and were explicitly rebuffed by Minh, who thought that such actions would result in escalation and be counterproductive, possibly inducing a Chinese land incursion akin to what had happened during the Korean War. The Australian historian Anne E. Blair identified this meeting as sealing Minh's political [...] "death warrant" [...] because when Lodge reported the meeting to Washington, the leading generals in the US military lobbied McNamara claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the US should <b>simply</b> <b>take</b> control of anti-communist military policy.|$|E
500|$|At first, the collectivists {{worked with}} the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their {{respective}} figureheads. Mikhail Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as centralist and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would <b>simply</b> <b>take</b> {{the place of the}} ruling class they had fought against. Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that [...] "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers." [...] In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress, where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the St. Imier Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme.|$|E
