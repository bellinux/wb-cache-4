25|$|Coretta {{went to a}} Women Strike for Peace {{rally in}} New York, {{in the early days}} of November 1963. After {{speaking}} at the meeting held in the National Baptist Church, King joined the march from Central Park to the United Nations Headquarters. The march was timed to celebrate the group's second anniversary and celebrated the successful completion of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Coretta and Martin learned of John F. Kennedy's assassination when reports initially indicated he had only been seriously wounded. King joined her husband upstairs and watched Walter Cronkite announce the president's death. King <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> visibly shaken husband following the confirmation.|$|E
25|$|After an {{indifferent}} reception to his {{solo show}} in London, featuring mostly his nocturnes, Whistler abruptly decided {{he had had}} enough of London. He and Trixie moved to Paris in 1892 and resided at n° 110 Rue du Bac, Paris, with his studio at the top of 86 Rue Notre Dame des Champs in Montparnasse. He felt welcomed by Monet, Auguste Rodin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and by Stéphane Mallarmé, and he set himself up a large studio. He {{was at the top of}} his career when it was discovered that Trixie had cancer. They returned to London in February 1896, taking rooms at the Savoy Hotel while they sought medical treatment. He made drawings on lithographic transfer paper of the view of the River Thames, from the hotel window or balcony, as he <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> She died a few months later.|$|E
500|$|Feynman {{was working}} in the {{computing}} room when he was informed that Arline was dying. He borrowed Fuchs' car and drove to Albuquerque where he <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> for hours until she died on June 16, 1945. He immersed himself in work on the project and was present at the Trinity nuclear test. Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmful ultraviolet radiation. On witnessing the blast, Feynman ducked towards the floor of his truck because of the immense brightness of the explosion, where he saw a temporary [...] "purple splotch" [...] afterimage of the event.|$|E
60|$|Augustine spoke first, for Mrs. Carrol <b>sat</b> {{speechless}} <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{trouble as}} Christie paused.|$|R
60|$|The door closed, and Sally <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> <b>her</b> chin in {{her hands}} to think.|$|R
60|$|She didn't say any more, but <b>sat</b> there <b>with</b> <b>her</b> eyes glued on the stage.|$|R
500|$|On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg {{conducted}} a private church {{service for the}} family and reported that Tatiana and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead. The final entry in Tatiana's final notebook at Yekaterinburg was a saying she had copied from {{the words of a}} well-known Russian Orthodox holy man, Father Ioann of Kronstadt: [...] "Your grief is indescribable, the Savior's grief in the Gardens of Gethsemane for the world's sins is immeasurable, join your grief to his, in it you will find consolation." [...] The following day, on 15 July, Tatiana and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked with one another and moved the beds in their room so visiting cleaning women could scrub the floor. They got down on their hands and knees to help the women and whispered to them when the guards weren't looking. All four young women wore long black skirts and white silk blouses, the same clothing they had worn the previous day. Their short hair was [...] "tumbled and disorderly." [...] They told the women how much they enjoyed physical exertion and wished there was more of it for them to do in the Ipatiev House. On the afternoon of 16 July 1918, the last full day of her life, Tatiana <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> mother and read from the Biblical Books of Amos and Obadiah, Alexandra noted in her diary. Later, mother and daughter sat and just talked. As the family was having dinner that night, Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, came in and announced that the family's kitchen boy and Alexei's playmate, 14-year-old Leonid Sednev, must gather his things and go to a family member. The boy had actually been sent to a hotel across the street because the guards did not want to kill him {{along with the rest of}} the Romanov party. The family, unaware of the plan to kill them, was upset and unsettled by Sednev's absence. Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky's office, for what was to be the last time, to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity. Yurovsky placated her by telling her the boy would return soon, but the family was unconvinced.|$|E
2500|$|Early that February, {{the coldest}} for many years, Adams had <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{in her room}} for forty minutes. A nurse entered, unnoticed, and saw Clara's [...] "bed clothes all off... and over the foot rail of the bed, her night gown up around her chest and {{the window in the}} room open top and bottom", while Adams read to her from the Bible. When later confronted by Hannam {{regarding}} this, Adams said [...] "The person who told you that doesn't know why I did it".|$|E
60|$|Tommy <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> face {{between her}} hands. Czerny's Exercises lay neglected.|$|E
60|$|She <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{back towards}} Mr. Carter {{and looked out}} at the window.|$|R
60|$|One afternoon, as I <b>sat</b> alone <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> {{she made}} the remark that my reading lessons had ceased.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> chatting <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{for some}} time. Presently Bertha was brought back by her partner to her mother's side.|$|R
60|$|Peggotty <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> chin on {{the foot}} of the stocking, looking silently at the fire.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman did}} not answer; she <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> black eyes intently {{fixed on the}} floor.|$|E
60|$|There was silence. The mother <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{hands folded}} in her apron, her face set, thinking.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she went}} in to breakfast and <b>sat</b> toying <b>with</b> <b>her</b> food, keeping her head bent down, her face hidden.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} Squire attentively, while Ida {{folded her hands}} in her lap and <b>sat</b> still <b>with</b> <b>her</b> eyes fixed upon the fire.|$|R
60|$|Alice said nothing; she had <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{face in her}} hands, {{wondering}} if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.|$|R
60|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> face averted, {{and did not}} answer. His heart struck heavily, {{but he did not}} relax.|$|E
60|$|So {{he let her}} cry, {{and said}} no more, but <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> cold hand in his warm, easy clasp.|$|E
60|$|Elsie <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{elbows on}} the table, gazing in silence towards the empty fireplace. She looked weary and sad.|$|E
60|$|She <b>sat</b> motionless, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hand {{tightening}} {{over the edge}} of the table, and he, too, said no more. She began to tremble violently.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Lapham <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{hands in}} her lap, {{and stared at the}} smile on her husband's face, where he sat facing her.|$|R
60|$|June {{made her}} lover take {{her on the}} top of a 'bus, saying she wanted air, and there <b>sat</b> silent, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> face to the breeze.|$|R
60|$|Phoebe trembled, {{and said}} nothing. She <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> head down, and her hands, fast clasped together, {{resting on her}} lap.|$|E
60|$|He {{struck a}} match {{and held it}} for her. Joan <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{elbows on the table}} and smoked in silence. She was thinking.|$|E
60|$|Mercifully {{unconscious}} of {{what she}} had done, Jo <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> nose in the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.|$|E
60|$|Hilda <b>sat</b> silent, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> lips pressed tightly {{together}} and {{an expression of}} determination upon her face. The other solicitors speedily left, after more expressions of regret.|$|R
60|$|The simple {{kindness}} {{of her words}} fell clearly. Wing went out from her presence as one entrusted with a grave commission. She <b>sat</b> on <b>with</b> <b>her</b> thoughts.|$|R
60|$|Rob {{thought she}} was yery {{handsome}} as she <b>sat</b> there <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes fixed on the}} horizon, while these rebellious thoughts found utterance in her quivering, passionate voice.|$|R
60|$|Sophy <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> head resting {{upon her}} hands and her face very close to her companion's, keeping time with her feet to the music.|$|E
60|$|She reached home by {{nine o'clock}} and <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> mother for an hour, reading out loud some book {{on which they}} were then engaged.|$|E
60|$|For {{some little}} time Pearson and William Welch turned their {{attention}} to the Indians, while the mother <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> eyes fixed upon the canoe.|$|E
60|$|Shelton withdrew {{and went}} down-stairs. Ferrand {{was still at}} breakfast. Antonia stood at the {{sideboard}} carving beef for him, and in the window <b>sat</b> Thea <b>with</b> <b>her</b> Persian kitten.|$|R
60|$|While {{this was}} going on in the garden, Mrs. Woodward <b>sat</b> dutifully <b>with</b> <b>her</b> uncle while he sipped his obnoxious toddy, and {{answered}} his questions about their two friends.|$|R
60|$|Blanche <b>sat</b> there <b>with</b> <b>her</b> little excited, yet innocent--too innocent--stare; {{her eyes}} {{followed}} Mrs. Vivian's. They met Bernard's for an instant, {{and for some}} reason, at this moment, Bernard flushed.|$|R
