Bonding a <b>strengthening</b> <b>plate</b> to {{the tension}} face is an {{effective}} technique to repair reinforced concrete beams; however, much large shear stress along the adhesive line at the plate end will occur. The stress may cause the plate bonded at its end and the strengthened beams fail prematurely. In this paper, the finite element analysis software ANSYS was applied to study the interfacial stress distribution among the adhesive layer. The main factors affecting the peak values of the interfacial stress was also investigated entirely. The effect depends on two {{factors such as the}} distance of plate end from the support and plate thickness...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{investigation}} into the characteristics of catenary action and their effects on structures are reported here. There are five aspects presented in this thesis: a literature review on progressive collapse and beam-to-column connections; an exact analysis of catenary action of truss; nonlinear finite element analyses of different post-column removal performance {{as a function of the}} original and retrofitted beam-to-column connection geometries; comparison of different behaviours of different beam-to-column connection geometries; and the minimisation of the <b>strengthening</b> <b>plate</b> weight for the retrofitted structures. This thesis demonstrates that when a column is removed, the bending moment will decrease significantly as the catenary tensile force and the plastic deformation increase in the beams connected to the damaged column. This thesis also shows that when a column is destroyed by a blast, the failure strain will be reached at the simple beam-to-column joint. To enhance the survival capability of the steel framed structures subjected to terrorist blast, retrofitting schemes were proposed for strengthening the joints of tall steel framed structures, ensuring the full development of catenary action. This thesis simulates the post-column removal behaviour of the original and the strengthened structures by means of the ABAQUS finite element package. For this purpose, sophisticated two- and three-dimensional models of catenary action are developed. Through comparing different results of the original and the strengthened structures from a column removal, the advantages of the proposed retrofitting schemes have been demonstrated. This thesis investigates the relative advantages and shortcomings between two different retrofitting schemes and compares the proposed retrofitting schemes with other moment beam-to-column connections used for new construction. For the same resisting capacity of the retrofitted structure, the Vertical Plate Scheme will require much more material than the Flange Plate Scheme. But the Vertical Plate Scheme still has its advantages. The Vertical Plate Scheme does not require the removal of the floor slab and easier to conduct than the Flange Plate Scheme. Finally, it is demonstrated that the sizes of strengthening plates can greatly change the overall behaviour of the retrofitted structures; with the reduction of the <b>strengthening</b> <b>plate</b> sizes, the stress and strain will increase and the structure will experience elastic stage and elasto-plastic sequentially. This thesis minimises the thickness and the length of the strengthening plates by the exact analytic method for simple structures and the finite element method for complicated structures...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a new strengthening system for reinforced concrete beams that employs an externally bonded plate composed of composite fibre cement reinforced with fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) rebars. The proposed approach involves preloading of a FRP rod and a precasting process. The paper also presents experimental and analytical analysis carried out on large-scale beams strengthened with an externally bonded carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plate or by using the near surface mounted (NSM) technique. These well-known techniques are compared with the proposed approach through four-point bending tests. The results are analysed with regard to the load-displacement curve, bending stiffness, cracking load, yield strength and failure load. During testing, a specific type of camera was used to measure the displacement field without making any direct contact with the test specimen. This method allows evaluation of the continuous and discontinuous field of displacement and is used to measure crack opening. The main conclusions are that the mechanical performances of the reinforced concrete structural elements are improved both in service and at failure. The flexural stiffness of the strengthened specimen is improved due to an increase in inertia resulting from the <b>strengthening</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{prediction}} of edge debonding for a beam retrofitted with a Fiber-Reinforced Polymer plate. This failure mechanism, also known as plate-end debonding, stems from the concentration of interfacial stresses arising at the termination of the <b>strengthening</b> <b>plate.</b> Early models of edge debonding adopted failure criteria based on interfacial stresses. However, due to the typically catastrophic nature of this failure mechanism, approaches based on Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) became increasingly established. In this paper, the problem is addressed {{by means of the}} Cohesive Crack Model (CCM) and of the Finite Fracture Mechanics (FFM). These models are able {{to bridge the gap between}} the stress- and the energy-based approaches and nevertheless have been used in a limited number of analytical studies to date. Based on a cohesive interface law with linear softening, closed-form solutions are derived for the interfacial stresses and the load-displacement curves, as well as for the ultimate load. It is found that LEFM usually overestimates the debonding load, thus justifying the need for the proposed approach; on the other hand, debonding load estimates based on FFM are in excellent agreement with the CCM predictions. Finally, a parametric analysis highlights the effect of the geometry/material properties on the structural response, as well as the ductile-to-brittle transition and the possible occurrence of structural instabilities depending on the test controlling parameter...|$|E

The second approach takes both the slip and the separation between the two elements into account.

High modulus carbon fibre composites (CFRP) make this fatigue strengthening more promising by decreasing stress intensity factor range at the fatigue crack tip to a large extend. In this study, an ultra high modulus (UHM) CFRP plate, with a modulus of 460 GPa, was adopted to strengthen initially center cracked steel <b>plates.</b> CFRP <b>strengthened</b> steel <b>plates</b> were tested under fatigue loading to investigate {{the effectiveness of the}} composites on preventing fatigue crack propagation and extending the fatigue life. Five strengthening configurations were adopted by changing both the patch length and patch width. Both single-sided and double-sided strengthened specimens were tested. A crack detection method of ‘‘beach marking” was adopted during the fatigue tests, to monitor and record the crack propagation against fatigue cycles. Experimental results show that the application of UHM CFRP substantially reduces crack growth rate and prolongs fatigue life up to 8 times more than that of un-strengthened steel plates. It was also found that double-sided strengthening is more efficient than single-sided one.

Advanced carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) has been demonstrated promising for fatigue strengthening of steel structures.

The experimental results showed that UHM CFRP plates could generally increase the fatigue life of the welded steel joints.

Some researchers {{claim that the}} column strengthened under load has the same ultimate capacity as the column welded without preloading. Others disagree and recommend safe design not allowing the steel to yield. The paper presents the parametric study of wide flange columns HEA 100 strengthened under load via two plates parallel to flanges conducted on numerical models validated by experiment. The varying parameters are thickness of strengthening flange, column length, initial bow imperfection, preload magnitude {{and direction of the}} axis which is pinned while the other axis is fixed. The experimental research consisted of two columns welded without preload and two columns strengthened under preload ratios (preload magnitude divided by base column ultimate strength) equal to 0. 5 (200 kN) and 0. 75 (300 kN). All columns were 3 m long and the boundary conditions were determined by knife-edge bearings which ensured pinned supports in the direction perpendicular to the strong axis and fixed perpendicular to the weak axis.
