5|$|The name Crewkerne {{is thought}} to be derived from Cruc-aera; from the British cruc - a spur of a hill, and the Old English aera - a house, {{especially}} a storehouse. The town was known as Crocern, or Cruaern in the 899 will of Alfred the Great when he left it to his younger son Æthelweard, and by 1066 the manor was held by Edith <b>Swanneck</b> mistress of King Harold. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and the church estate was given to the Abbaye-aux-Hommes in Caen, Normandy. In the Domesday Survey of 1086 it was described as a royal manor.|$|E

50|$|The site, on {{an ancient}} road between Cambridge and Ely, was settled by farmers {{as early as}} the Roman period. The Domesday Book {{recorded}} that it was owned by Edith the Fair (also known as <b>Swanneck),</b> the consort of King Harold, in 1066. It was owned subsequently by the Breton lord, Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond.|$|E
5000|$|Edith the Fair (Ealdgȳð Swann hnesce, [...] "Edyth the Gentle Swan"; c. 1025 - c. 1086), {{also known}} as Edith <b>Swanneck,</b> was the first wife of King Harold Godwinson. [...] "Swanneck" [...] (or Swan-Neck) comes from the folk {{etymology}} which made her in Old English as swann hnecca, [...] "swan neck", which was actually most likely a corrupted form of swann hnesce, [...] "Gentle Swan" [...] She is sometimes confused with Ealdgyth, daughter of Earl Ælfgar of Mercia, who was queen during Harold's reign.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>swanneck</b> (or gooseneck) flask is a {{particular}} shape of normally plastic or glass tube leading into a test tube or other vessel. The [...] "swan neck" [...] significantly slows down the motion of air through the tube, and particles in the air, such as bacteria, become trapped on moisture on its inner surfaces. As a result, sterile liquid in the vessel itself remains sterile {{as long as the}} liquid does not contact the contaminated liquid in the tube. Louis Pasteur developed and used this apparatus in the early 1860s to prove that particles in the air (germ theory), rather than the air itself (spontaneous generation), led to fermentation.|$|E

5000|$|Harold {{stopped to}} pray at Waltham {{on his way}} from the Battle of Stamford Bridge to fight William of Normandy; the battle-cry of the English troops at Hastings was [...] "Holy Cross". According to Gesta Guillelmi, {{an account of the}} battle written by William of Poitiers in the 1070s, Harold's body was handed over to William Malet, a {{companion}} of William the Conqueror for burial; Duke William refused an offer by Harold's mother, Gytha, to exchange Harold's corpse for its weight in gold. The account also relates that some Normans remarked [...] "in jest" [...] that [...] "he who guarded the coast with such insensate zeal should be buried by the sea shore", but does not say that this was actually done. Another account, the Carmen de Hastingae Proelio, thought to have been written only months after the battle, says that he was buried under a cliff top cairn, but this version does not appear in any other account.William of Malmesbury wrote in the Gesta regum Anglorum in 1125, that the refusal to accept Gytha's gold simply meant that Harold's body was handed over without payment, and that it was taken from the battlefield to Waltham for burial. This version is supported by the Roman de Rou, written by Wace in the 1160s. The final and most detailed medieval account comes from the Waltham Chronicle. The author describes how two canons from Waltham, Osgod Cnoppe and Aethelric Childemaister, accompanied Harold from Waltham to Hastings. After the battle, they asked permission to recover Harold's body, which could only be identified by his concubine, Edith <b>Swanneck,</b> who recognised [...] "secret marks". From Hastings the body was brought to Waltham and buried under the floor of the church. This story was related to the author of the Chronicle when he was a boy, by the elderly Sacristan Turketil, who claimed to have himself been a boy at Waltham when Haroldarrived en route from Stamford Bridge, and later witnessed the interment of the king. The author himself claims to have seen Harold's body being disinterred and moved twice during the rebuilding work which started in 1090.|$|E
40|$|The human finger {{contains}} tendon/ligament mechanisms {{essential for}} proper control. One mechanism couples {{the movements of}} the interphalangeal joints when the (unloaded) finger is flexed with active deep flexor. This study's aim was to accurately determine in a large finger sample the kinematics and variability of the coupled interphalangeal joint motions, for potential clinical and finger model validation applications. The data could also be applied to humanoid robotic hands. Sixty-eight fingers were measured in seventeen hands in nine subjects. Fingers exhibited great joint mobility variability, with passive proximal interphalangeal hyperextension ranging from zero to almost fifty degrees. Increased measurement accuracy was obtained by using marker frames to amplify finger segment motions. Gravitational forces on the marker frames were not found to invalidate measurements. The recorded interphalangeal joint trajectories were highly consistent, demonstrating the underlying coupling mechanism. The increased accuracy and large sample size allowed for evaluation of detailed trajectory variability, systematic differences between flexion and extension trajectories, and three trigger types, distinct from flexor tendon triggers, involving initial flexion deficits in either proximal or distal interphalangeal joint. The experimental methods, data and analysis should advance insight into normal and pathological finger biomechanics (e. g. <b>swanneck</b> deformities), and could help improve clinical differential diagnostics of trigger finger causes. The marker frame measuring method may be useful to quantify interphalangeal joints trajectories in surgical/rehabilitative outcome studies. The data as a whole provide the most comprehensive collection of interphalangeal joint trajectories for clinical reference and model validation known to us to date.
