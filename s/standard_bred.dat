50|$|Polled strains {{have been}} {{developed}} of many cattle breeds which were originally horned. This has usually been done by crossing with naturally polled breeds, most commonly Angus and Galloway cattle. For example, polled Jersey cattle originated in Ohio sometime prior to 1895. Two strains were developed, the first to appear being founded by crosses of registered Jersey bulls (the standard) on common muley (hornless) cows. These were graded up by the continued use of purebred Jersey sires, selection being made of the polled offspring of each generation, the horned progeny being discarded. Thus originated what was later known as the single-standard strain. As {{in the case of}} the Polled Shorthorns and Polled Herefords, the development of the single-standard strain was soon followed by the appearance of a double-standard strain, founded by a few naturally hornless sports that were discovered in registered herds of horned Jersey cattle. These <b>standards</b> were <b>bred</b> among themselves or crossed with registered horned Jerseys, followed by selection for the polled head, and the strain was developed in this way.|$|R

In 2005, the American Kerry Bog Pony Society was founded, with 11 initial registrants. Also in 2005, the Irish Department of Agriculture and Food and the European Commission recognised the Kerry Bog Pony as an official breed; the following year, the Irish Horse Board issued the first equine passports for members of the breed. Until 2009, there was an exception in place that allowed unrelated ponies that met the physical breed <b>standards</b> to be <b>bred</b> as Kerry Bog Ponies, with the offspring being registered and given passports certifying them as purebred Kerry Bog Ponies. This was in part due to a concern of inbreeding among the small number of ponies initially registered. Kerry Bog Ponies were also part of the Irish Rural Environment Protection Scheme (closed to new applicants in 2009), which financially rewarded farmers for using environmentally-friendly methods. The Kerry Bog Village, an open-air museum on the Ring of Kerry is one location that breeds and houses part of the existing Kerry Bog Pony population.|$|R

Our aim is {{the interplay between}} aggression, brain monoamines and depigmentation. The Hedlund white mutation in the American mink is an extreme case of depigmentation observed in domesticated animals. The aggressive (- 2. 06 +/- 0. 03) and tame (+ 3. 5 +/- 0. 1) populations of wild-type dark brown color (<b>standard)</b> minks were <b>bred</b> during 17 successive generations for aggressive or tame reaction towards humans, respectively. The Hedlund mutation {{was transferred to the}} aggressive and tame backgrounds to generate aggressive (- 1. 2 +/- 0. 1) and tame (+ 3. 0 +/- 0. 2) Hedlund minks. Four groups of 10 males with equal expression of aggressive (- 2) or tame (+ 5) behavior, standard or with the Hedlund mutation, were selected to study biogenic amines in the brain. Decreased levels of noradrenaline in the hypothalamus, but increased concentrations of the serotonin metabolite, 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid and dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid, in the striatum were measured in the tame compared with the aggressive standard minks. The Hedlund mutation increased noradrenaline level in the hypothalamus and substantia nigra, serotonin level in the substantia nigra and striatum and decreased dopamine concentration in the hypothalamus and striatum. Significant interaction effects were found between the Hedlund mutation and aggressive behavior on serotonin metabolism in the substantia nigra (P < 0. 001), dopamine level in the midbrain (P < 0. 01) and its metabolism in the striatum (P < 0. 05).

The results were compared between the groups in order to see if there were statistically significant differences. The study did not reveal any significant differences in local and general skin temperatures between the two study groups.

40|$|For {{several years}} {{a colony of}} <b>standard</b> <b>bred</b> rabbits has been {{maintained}} by this laboratory {{as the basis for}} the study of problems in constitution. The foundation stock for the colony was built up from pedigreed and registered animals purchased in this country and abroad. The breeds represented were chosen mainly on the basis of physical conformation, and the stock includes a full range of contrasting types from the small Polish to the Giant Flemish, and the cobby Dutch to the racy Belgian. Representative color varieties and coat characters are also included? One of the purposes for which this colony was organized was to provide material of known quality for the study of relations between constitution and susceptibility to disease (1). As an approach to these problems, experiments were carried out with pure bred rabbits of various lines to determine, on the one hand, whether such differences as are represented by breed characters may be associated with distinctive differences in the reaction to disease-producing agents, and on the other, for the purpose of selecting the most suitable material for a more detailed study of any relations which might be found. The present report is concerned with observations on the response of different breeds of rabbits to one of the agents employed, namely, Tr. pallidum.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} (1, 2) that marked alterations {{take place in the}} blood cytology of syphilitic rabbits in the postinoculation period of 3 to 5 months, during which the disease is clinically characterized by the development, regression, and healing of primary and generalized lesions. Among the outstanding changes observed were an increase in the total white cell count, the platelet count, and the absolute numbers of neutrophils and monocytes, and a {{decrease in the number of}} lymphocytes. In connection with our studies on the biology of syphilitic infections, observations were made to determine the blood cell levels of infected animals after the complete spontaneous healing of lesions; that is, in the period of latency when there is no clinically demonstrable evidence of infection. It was found that the red blood cell count and the hemoglobin in per cent of rabbits with latent syphilis were both significantly lower than normal values; other significant differences were not noted. These observations, together with a brief comparison of the blood cytology in experimental and human syphilis, are presented in this report. Material and Methods Careful clinical examinations of a large group of syphilitic animals were made, and those rabbits selected for blood cytology studies which had been inoculated at least 5 months previously and which presented no clinical evidence of infection.

40|$|The {{breeding}} method is a conceptually simple and computationally cheap ensemble generation technique. Bred vectors (BV) are dynamically {{obtained from the}} nonlinear model and correspond to the spatial structures with fast-growing fluctuations at each time. These vectors have a characteristic localized spatial structure, with {{only a small number}} of significant values corresponding to the leading fluctuation areas. The temporal and spatial growth of the BV interacts making the spatial structure a key factor of the dynamics. In this paper we introduce a new breeding technique, Logarithmic Bred Vectors (LBV), which allows growing vectors with tuneable spatial structure, more (or less) localized. This yields ensembles with different spatiotemporal dynamics (different spread, etc.). This is done by introducing a new parameter (the geometrical mean) which controls the spatial correlation of the bred vectors, from uncorrelated vectors similar to random perturbations, to fully correlated and localized vectors similar to <b>standard</b> <b>bred</b> vectors. The new method increases the diversity of the ensemble and allows the spread to grow faster preserving the model performance in terms of the root mean square error. Consequently, the ensembles can be calibrated for a desired lead time (for instance a shorter forecast range). The concepts are illustrated using a chain of diffusively coupled Lorenz systems. Preliminary evidence of the possible application in operative weather prediction models is also presented. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Perioperative {{analgesic}} {{management is}} mandatory in anaesthesia; {{the possibility to}} provide analgesia {{at the site of}} pain, with minimal impairment of other functions, is the rationale behind loco-regional anaesthetic (LRa) techniques. Loco-regional anaesthesia success is connected to optimal local anaesthetic distribution around the nerves; the real time sonographic visualization of the technique enhances the possibilities to make a more efficacious and safer block. Furthermore post-operative pain assessment in a patient where we are unable to communicate verbally is particularly difficult and an effective post-operative analgesia is essential. OBJECTIVES To design and test with a clinical trial, efficacy, safety and duration of three new different ultrasound-guided loco-regional techniques in dogs and one ultrasound-assisted neuraxial technique in the equine specie. LIST OF THE STUDIES STUDY n° 1 : Comparison between three different ultrasound-guided for radial, ulnar, medial, musculocutaneous (RUMM) nerves block approaches in dogs undergoing thoracic limb surgery. STUDY n° 2 : Ultrasound-guided femoral-obturator nerve in dogs undergoing TPLO surgery. STUDY n° 3 : A new approach to transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in dogs undergoing mastectomy. STUDY n° 4 : Ultrasound-assisted extradural technique in horse. STUDY DESIGN All the studies started from a prospective anatomical research. Randomized and prospective single blinded clinical trials (study 1 and 2). Prospective clinical trials (study 3 - 4). ANIMALS 1. Study n° 1 : 5 dog cadavers and 30 owner’s client dogs. 2. Study n° 2 : 6 dog cadavers and 20 owner’s client dogs. 3. Study n° 3 : 10 dog cadavers and 10 owner’s client dogs. 4. Study n° 4 : two horse’s tails obtained from the slaughterhouse, 15 experimental <b>Standard</b> <b>bred</b> horses, 20 owner’s client Warmblood horses. METHODOLOGY All the studies were divided in one or more anatomical studies and one clinical study. Anatomical study: dissections and ultrasound (US) scanning to gain three-dimensional and bi-dimensional anatomical knowledge of the interested region in order to find a target ultrasound window and to design an US-guided LRa needling technique. For the studies 1, 2, 3 a comparison between the sonoanatomy and the real anatomy was performed by evaluation of the spread after injection of new methylene blue solution around the nerves visualized by US. Clinical study: US-guided techniques developed during the anatomical studies were applied in order to evaluate the intra operative and post-operative analgesia provided from the LR anaesthesia. Intra-operative monitoring and post-operative pain were evaluated by a blind operator (study 1 - 2 - 3). RESULTS Study n° 1 Anatomical phase: opening the arm in the medial face, at gleno-humeral joint level, the four nerves appeared at the same deepness and held in the same intermuscular fascia; descending toward the elbow the radial nerve enters the intermuscular fascia and goes towards the lateral portion of the arm. The ultrasound images confirm the presence of the nerves around the axillary artery in the proximal approach called axillary approach (AGR). In the medial and lateral midhumeral approaches the radial nerve appeared at a different depth, in comparison to the other three nerves and near to the humerus. Clinical phase: intra operative fentanyl infusion resulted necessary in 5 / 10 dogs LGR, 0 / 9 MGR dogs and 0 / 10 dogs AGR belonging the respectively groups. Post-operative first rescue analgesia performed 2. 07 ± 1. 98 LGR, 4. 25 ± 1. 25 in MGR and 8. 6 ± 1. 15 hours after extubation for AGR. The execution of the block resulted easier in the AGR respect to the other groups. Study n° 2 Anatomical phase: femoral nerve (FN) and obturator nerve (ON) are present together at the level of L 6 th vertebral body and L 7 th transvers process. From the ultrasound study the two nerves appeared as two holes inside the iliopsoas muscle that diverge, moving the probe caudally. Both nerves were stained for more than 4 cm with a 0. 1 mL kg- 1 of new methylene blue solution injection. Clinical phase: intraoperative fentanyl infusion resulted necessary in 1 / 10 dogs belonging R 3 (ropivacaine 0. 3 %) and 3 / 10 dogs belonging R 5 (ropivacaine 0. 5 %). Post-operative first rescue analgesia performed 550. 9 ± 58. 52 minutes R 3, 664. 2 ± 151. 4 minutes R 5 {{from the end of the}} surgery (p= 0. 06). Study n° 3 Anatomical phase: the abdominal nerves (T 12 -T 13 -L 1 -L 2 -L 3 - l 4) appear to be very close dorsally, where they pass the aponeurosis of the transversus muscle in order to run over it and enter the fascia between the internal oblique and transversus muscle. The separation between the 2 muscle was identifiable in a US-window nominated as ‘target US pocket’. T 13, L 1, L 2, L 3, L 4 nerves resulted stained with 0. 2 mL kg- 1 of new methylene blue solution. Clinical phase: in 3 / 10 dogs where TAP block was performed at the ‘target US pocket’ with 0. 2 mL kg- 1 ropivacaine 0. 25 % 2 μ kg- 1 of fentanyl at T 1 was administered. Post operative pain score < 3 for the first 4 hours after the surgery in 10 / 10 dogs. Study n° 4 Anatomical phase: two peculiar US images were detected for last sacral bone and first intercoccygeal spaces. First intercoccygeal gave a peculiar image named ‘cat face’ and it was used as US target window to design a US-assisted epidural technique. The mean ± SD depths detected at the level of first and second intercoccygeal spaces were respectively 2. 79 ± 0. 27 cm and 2. 85 ± 0. 18. Clinical study n° 5 : In 100 % of the horses the ‘cat face’ was detected and in 20 / 20 horses epidural performed wit US-assisted technique result efficacy during laparoscopic surgery. The mean ± SD between the trained operator and untrained operator Δ (TO-UO) was 1. 08 ± 1. 06 cm. The mean ± SD between Δ (UO-US) was 2. 55 ± 1. 73 and the Δ(TO-US) was 1. 86 ± 1. 24. DISCUSSIONS The axillary approach resulted in an easier and more effective block compared to the other two and it was superior in terms of duration for the post-operative analgesia. The femoral-obturator approach provided an effective analgesia in dog undergoing TPLO surgery with both the ropivacaine concentration used. The block resulted capable to post pone a first rescue analgesia at least 5 hours after the end of the surgery. The new approach to transversus abdominis plane block in dogs undergoing mastectomy resulted efficacious and it might be a routinely analgesia technique in a dog with a history of mammary tumour. Ultrasound-assisted extradural technique in horse resulted feasible and it might increase the rate of success of neuroaxial anaesthesia in this species...|$|E
