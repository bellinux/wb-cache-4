5|$|The {{game was}} {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 89–73.

After advancing, they <b>swept</b> <b>the</b> Arizona Diamondbacks in the NL Championship Series, winning their first pennant in franchise history. However, the Rockies were, in turn, swept in the 2007 World Series by the Boston Red Sox, ending their season.

However, this did not transfer into the regular international matches. In six home Tests against the West Indies and South Africa in 2005–06, Gilchrist managed only 190 runs at 23.75, but Australia was unhindered, winning 3–0 and 2–0 respectively.|$|E

The Heat's playoff run was stopped by the Detroit Pistons, the previous season's champions, in 7 games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Wade scored 42 and 36 points in Games 2 and 3 respectively despite playing with sinusitis, the flu, and a knee strain. He also suffered a strained rib muscle in Game 5 of the Conference Finals that prevented him from playing in the series' sixth game and limited him in the seventh.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel and {{efficient}} technique {{to generate a}} high quality mesh that approximates the outer boundary of a swept volume (SV). Our approach comes with two guarantees. First, the approximation is conservative, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>swept</b> volume is enclosed by the output mesh. Second, the one-sided Hausdorff distance of the generated mesh to <b>the</b> <b>swept</b> volume is upper bounded by a user defined tolerance. Exploiting this tolerance our method produces an anisotropic mesh which nicely adapts to the local complexity of <b>the</b> approximated <b>swept</b> volume boundary. <b>The</b> algorithm is two phased: a initialization phase that generates a conservative voxelization of <b>the</b> <b>swept</b> volume, and <b>the</b> actual mesh generation {{which is based on}} CGAL’s Delaunay refinement implementation. ...|$|R
