5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He said <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E

Flipping through the channels on the hotel television in search of shows like CSI, he was {{just in time to}} see a segment on A where a detective commented on a woman's death in a house fire. He said <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of, [...] "The amount of carbon monoxide in the victim's lungs proves that she had died prior to the fire," [...] and Heppner liked the way the last words sounded.|$|E

500|$|On the Allied side, the officers, both French and Austrian, were {{frustrated}} by their superiors' timidity. [...] Clearly, Frederick's position was precarious, and the Prussians were outnumbered. One officer, Pierre-Joseph Bourcet, convinced Soubise {{that they should}} attack Frederick in the morning, by swinging to Frederick's left flank and cutting his line of retreat. This would, Bourcet thought, finish the campaign. After some persuasion Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen were convinced and everyone went to sleep. In the morning of 5 November, some of the Allied troops went out to forage, and Soubise received a notice from Saxe-Hildburghausen, <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of not a moment to be lost, we should advance, gain the heights and attack from the side. Until that point, Soubise had done nothing to rouse the French troops to action.|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often say <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> {{that the book}} is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and {{turning it into a}} book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
2500|$|Keith Hoerig: We got {{the name}} Five Iron Frenzy from a roommate {{of most of}} ours. He was kind of paranoid, and afraid that if he went outside on this {{particular}} night {{he was going to}} get jumped by some people. He had a golf club to defend himself and he said <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of it being like [...] "putter mayhem". Scott looked at the golf club he was holding, and noting that it was a five iron said, [...] "No, more like a Five Iron Frenzy." [...] The name stuck.|$|E

6000|$|The story {{made its}} impression, and Lapham saw it. [...] "Now I say," [...] he resumed, {{as if he}} felt {{that he was going to}} do himself justice, and say <b>something</b> <b>to</b> heighten <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> his story had produced. At the same time he was aware of a certain want of clearness. He had the idea, but it floated vague, elusive, in his brain. He looked about as if for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{precipitate}} it in tangible shape.|$|R
2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down. He was an odd character, for sure. I can {{remember}} standing in line at a Misfits show {{and all of a}} sudden he just sat down on the ground and started holding his head like his ears were ringing or something, and said <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of [...] "What am I doing here? Where am I?" [...] So that was Frank.|$|E
2500|$|The restaurant's {{name was}} devised on a {{cancelled}} 1936 road trip to California, in which Beverly spilled a picnic basket of chicken after Rubye hit a {{bump in the}} road while driving on the Oklahoma prairie. Rubye remarked <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of [...] "This is really chicken in the rough". After this occurred, they turned around and headed back to Oklahoma City. Another notion is that the name was devised on a family picnic [...] "where silverware had been forgotten", and that the consumption of the chicken without silverware constituted eating it [...] "in the rough", using one's hands. However, the official website of the chain states that the former occurred.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a motion}} to censure is passed, the chair (or the vice-president, if the {{presiding}} officer is being censured) addresses the censured member by name.

( [...] This phrase should not be included as the cause for censure may have occurred outside of meetings.) [...] "A censure is a warning. It is the warning voice of suspension or expulsion. Please take due notice thereof and govern yourself accordingly." [...] Or, if the chair is being censured, the vice-president may say, [...] "Mr. X, you have been censured by the assembly for the reasons contained in the resolution.

5000|$|Jim Steinmeyer {{has argued}} that Selbit's {{introduction}} of the sawing illusion {{was a turning point}} in the history of magic after which gentler styles represented by the likes of John Nevil Maskelyne were in irreversible decline to be replaced by more sensational presentations that owed <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shock <b>effect</b> of Grand Guignol theatre. In particular, Steinmeyer identifies the sawing illusion as the beginning of a fashion for magic featuring female assistants in the role of victim. He says the cliche of [...] "pretty ladies teased and tortured by magicians" [...] was not a cliche prior to Selbit's illusion.|$|R
2500|$|Jewel {{has also}} had ventures into writing; she {{published}} a book of poetry titled A Night Without Armor in 1998. Although it sold over 1 million copies and was a New York Times best seller, it received mixed reviews. During an MTV interview in 1998, Kurt Loder pointed out the incorrect usage in her book of poetry of the word [...] "" [...] (intended as <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of [...] "of a casual nature") to which Jewel responded, [...] "You're a smartass for pointing that out. [...] Next topic." [...] In the fall of '98, the poet Beau Sia composed a book-length response to [...] "A Night Without Armor" [...] entitled [...] "A Night Without Armor II: [...] the Revenge." [...] The reviewer Edna Gundersen, writing in USA Today, noted, [...] "Hers is flowery and sensitive. [...] His is wry and absurd." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the mid-1950s}} {{it was clear}} that the simple {{theoretical}} tools being used to calculate the performance of all fusion machines were simply not predicting their actual behavior. Machines invariably leaked their plasma from their confinement area at rates far higher than predicted. In 1954, Edward Teller held a gathering of fusion researchers at the Princeton Gun Club, near the Project Matterhorn (now known as Project Sherwood) grounds. Teller started by pointing out the problems that everyone was having, and suggested that any system where the plasma was confined within concave fields was doomed to fail. Attendees remember him saying <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> that the fields were like rubber bands, and they would attempt to snap back to a straight configuration whenever the power was increased, ejecting the plasma. He went on to say that it appeared the only way to confine the plasma in a stable configuration would be to use convex fields, a [...] "cusp" [...] configuration.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley came up {{with the}} name while he, Simmons and Criss were driving around New York City.

[...] Frehley created the now-iconic logo, making the [...] "SS" [...] look like lightning bolts, when he went to write the new band name over [...] "Wicked Lester" [...] on a poster outside the club where they were going to play. (Some of Wicked Lester's artwork included one lightning bolt for the [...] "S" [...] in Lester.) Later, Stanley designed the logo with a Sharpie and a ruler and accidentally drew the two S's nonparallel because he did it [...] "by eye."

40|$|The {{explosion}} of intra-state conflicts is challenging those international agencies which, directly or indirectly, offer assistance to people affected by disasters. International interventions in intra-state conflicts {{have become more}} complex, and the humanitarian mandate of such agencies has expanded beyond emergency relief interventions. Some agencies now insist, not only that they must do <b>something</b> <b>to</b> relieve <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of armed conflicts, but that they must also respond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conflict itself. This is a challenge, {{not only for the}} relief and development community and its grant-making partners in governments and inter-governmental agencies, but also for a growing number of specialist agencies which offer assistance in the field generically referred to as conflict resolution. Britain is home for a growing number of diverse international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) specialising in conflict resolution and prevention. In this article I highlight a few of the key issues for INGOs supporting local peacemaking capacities. Conflict resolution: old field, new actor...|$|R

40|$|Two-phase heat {{transfer}} devices are becoming fairly ubiquitous; <b>the</b> capability <b>to</b> transport heat at high rates over appreciable distances, without any external pumping device, the low cost, durability and relatively simpler modeling/design process, make this technology very attractive for many thermal management applications. Indeed, such devices {{have been investigated}} in plenty of fields such as: nuclear plants, energy systems, solar heat recovery, air conditioning, electronic cooling in avionics and in railway traction. As a consequence, they can operate under different environmental conditions that can affect their behavior. Nevertheless, {{it is difficult to}} find in literature <b>something</b> related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of <b>the</b> ambient temperature on the thermal performance of such devices. The actual temperature, varying the thermo-fluid properties of the fluid inside the device, the condensation and the evaporation phenomena, could be an important parameter that can affect the performance. In this work a Multi-Evaporator loop thermosyphon is tested at different ambient temperatures, ranging from - 20 °C up <b>to</b> 30 °C. <b>The</b> start-up behavior, as well as the thermal performance, are analyzed by means of temperature and pressure measurements and fluid flow visualization...|$|R
2500|$|Bunin {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in international myths and folklore, {{as well as}} the Russian folkloric tradition. But, (according to Georgy Adamovich) [...] "he was absolutely intolerant towards those of his colleagues who employed stylizations, the [...] "style Russe" [...] manufacturers. His cruel– and rightly so– review of Sergey Gorodetsky's poetry was one example. Even Blok's Kulikovo Field (for me, an outstanding piece) irritated him as too lavishly adorned... "That's Vasnetsov," [...] he commented, meaning 'masquerade and opera'. But he treated things that he felt were not masqueradery differently. Of the Slovo o Polku Igoreve... he said <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> that all the poets of the whole world lumped together couldn't have created such wonder, in fact something close to Pushkin's words. Yet translations of the legend... outraged him, particularly that of Balmont. He despised Shmelyov for his pseudo-Russian pretenses, though admitting his literary gift. Bunin had an extraordinarily sharp ear for falseness: he instantly recognized this jarring note and was infuriated. That was why he loved Tolstoy so much. Once, I remember, he spoke of Tolstoy as the one 'who's never said a single word that would be an exaggeration'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Needing a new {{car because}} of the high profile of Ward's Packard, they found {{traveling}} salesman Merle Collison sleeping in his Buick along the highway outside Douglas, Wyoming. After Collison was awakened, he was shot. Starkweather later accused Fugate of performing a coup-de-grace after his shotgun jammed. Starkweather claimed Fugate was the [...] "most trigger happy person" [...] he had ever met. The salesman's car had a push-pedal emergency brake, which was something new to Starkweather. While attempting to drive away, the car stalled. He tried to restart the engine and a passing motorist stopped to help. Starkweather threatened him with the rifle, and an altercation ensued. At that moment, a deputy sheriff arrived on the scene. Fugate ran to him, yelling <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of: [...] "It's Starkweather! He's going to kill me!" [...] Starkweather tried to evade the police, exceeding speeds of [...] A bullet shattered the windshield and flying glass cut Starkweather deep enough to cause bleeding.

2500|$|With Aukerman away at college, the Descendents added Ray Cooper as both {{singer and}} second guitarist. They {{performed}} with this lineup, and occasionally as a quintet when Aukerman would make return visits to Los Angeles. Stevenson {{pushed for the}} band to tour, which Navetta and Lombardo were against: [...] "Bill kind of sat down with me and Frank and said <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of {{we were at a}} point where we needed to grow by going on the road", Lombardo later said. [...] "Frank said no, and I had to say no also, so he said he had to leave the band and we were both kind of bummed out. I don’t think Frank even believed him at first. That was a bad scenario." [...] Navetta, Lombardo, and Cooper tried to start a new band, the Ascendants. [...] "We played one show", said Lombardo. [...] "Frank played in his underwear, and I don’t mean boxers. It was all a disaster, it was sad, for me anyway." [...] Navetta ultimately quit the band by setting all of his musical equipment on fire and moving to Oregon, where he became a full-time fisherman.|$|E
5000|$|The Nyayasutras {{dedicate}} many {{sections on}} causality and casual relations (Karana, Sanskrit: कारण), particularly Book 4.

A specific effect {{is produced by}} a specific cause (plurality in causes accepted), and in Nyayasutras view a specific cause produces a specific effect and no other (plurality in effect, or contradictory effect is not accepted). The sutras assert that there cannot be reciprocity to a cause, either we misunderstand the cause or misapprehend <b>the</b> <b>effect.</b> <b>The</b> text rejects remote or supernatural causes, and rejects that qualities are causes.

5000|$|Bill Ragsdale {{stands up}} in front of the Speakers pulpit, with his back against it, and fastens his quick black eye upon any member who rises, lets him say half a dozen {{sentences}} and then interrupts him, and repeats his speech in a loud, rapid voice, turning every Kanaka speech into English and every English speech into Kanaka, with a readiness and felicity of language that are remarkable - waits for another installment of talk from the members lips and goes on with his translation as before. His tongue is in constant motion from 11 in the forenoon till four in the afternoon, and why it does not wear out is the affair of Providence, not mine. There is a spice of deviltry in the fellows nature and it crops out every now and then when he is translating the speeches of slow old Kanakas who do not understand English. Without departing from the spirit of a members remarks, he will, with apparent unconsciousness, drop in a little voluntary contribution occasionally in the way of a word or two that will make the gravest speech utterly ridiculous. He is careful not to venture upon such experiments, though, with the remarks of persons able to detect him.
