[...] While giving his opinion on burqa ban Mr Bolkestein said that he [...] "disagrees with the recent introduction of a burqa ban, an idea championed by Geert Wilders." [...] The Netherlands, he said, is the third European country to introduce such a ban after France and Belgium. [...] "A ban makes martyrs of the few burqa wearers {{there are in the}} Netherlands", he said.|$|E

But he warned that fans were in for a longer wait than expected, after lead singer Brian Johnson suggested there would be new material the next year. Malcolm stated, [...] "You know what Brian's like. He just <b>says</b> <b>things</b> and then walks away. It'll be a little while– {{a year or two}} anyway. I've been doing some jamming on some song ideas but I do that all the time, as do the rest of the band. We are still working. But we had a long rest between Stiff Upper Lip and Black Ice, so I think we need a couple of years to recuperate and work on it a bit more." ...|$|E

500|$|Carson {{then moved}} to the factual {{evidence}} and questioned Wilde about his acquaintances with younger, lower-class men. Wilde admitted being {{on a first-name basis}} and lavishing gifts upon them, but insisted that nothing untoward had occurred and that the men were merely good friends of his. Carson repeatedly pointed out the unusual nature of these relationships and insinuated that the men were prostitutes. Wilde replied that he did not believe in social barriers, and simply enjoyed the society of young men. Then Carson asked Wilde directly whether he had ever kissed a certain servant boy, Wilde responded, [...] "Oh, dear no. He was a particularly plain boy– unfortunately ugly– I pitied him for it." [...] Carson pressed him on the answer, repeatedly asking why the boy's ugliness was relevant. Wilde hesitated, then for the first time became flustered: [...] "You sting me and insult me and try to unnerve me; and at times one <b>says</b> <b>things</b> flippantly when one ought to speak more seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{announcing the}} character's creation, BBC Publicity {{initially}} stated of her personality: [...] "Maddy's enthusiasm and ability speaks for itself. She's a young SHO who loves {{her job and}} is fun to be around." [...] Expanding, it was added that: [...] "Maddy's young, fun and up for a laugh while, at the same time, dedicated to her job. She's definitely {{not going to be}} single for very long, but there's a family secret she's harbouring which could just get in the way..." [...] The BBC Holby City homepage describes Maddy as: [...] "enthusiastic and eager to learn. Being with her is fun. She doesn't moan, she loves her job and gets on with it. She just wants to be happy". Comparing the character's personality to her own, [...] Lewington commented: [...] "My good pal, Sir Robert Powell (Mark Williams) has said that a character is often only yourself turned 3 degrees. I think this to be true of Maddy and I. There are similarities. Although she's smarter than me, she does the daftest things! She's <b>says</b> <b>things</b> I wouldn't.

500|$|Gosling {{played an}} {{introvert}} who {{falls in love}} with a sex doll in the 2007 film Lars and the Real Girl. He drew inspiration from James Stewart's performance in Harvey. Roger Ebert felt [...] "a film about a life-sized love doll" [...] had been turned into [...] "a life-affirming statement of hope" [...] because of [...] "a performance by Ryan Gosling that <b>says</b> <b>things</b> that cannot be said". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post described his performance as [...] "a small miracle ... because he changes and grows so imperceptibly before our eyes." [...] However, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt [...] "the performance is a rare miscalculation in a mostly brilliant career." [...] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film was a box office failure, failing to recoup its $12 million production budget. Gosling starred opposite Anthony Hopkins in the 2007 courtroom thriller Fracture. He originally turned down the role, but changed his mind when Hopkins signed on. Gosling noted that he was drawn to his character, Willie, because he had flaws and seemed like a real person. He spent time shadowing lawyers and observing courtroom proceedings in preparation for the role. Claudia Puig of USA Today declared that [...] "watching a veteran like Hopkins verbally joust with one of the best young actors in Hollywood is worth the price of admission". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt it was a treat to watch [...] "the spectacle of that crafty scene stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen nibbler Ryan Gosling ... Each actor is playing a pulp type rather than a fully formed individual, but both fill in the blanks with an alchemical mix of professional and personal charisma." [...] The film grossed over $91 million worldwide.|$|E
