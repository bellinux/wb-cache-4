Maxwell guesses that Kath has stopped the train as Jorg stands, {{dropping}} his trousers. Maxwell next guesses that Kath has jumped {{in front of the}} train, and Les repeatedly hits him with a pillow as Jorg defecates into Kath's <b>shoebox,</b> which is held by Hugo. Shona sees that the train has hit a deer, and Kath re-enters.|$|E
5|$|The project {{presented}} {{a variety of}} specific challenges. Because its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on acoustics first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior. He proposed a <b>shoebox</b> auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and Vienna Musikverein. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect Johann Balthasar Neumann, especially the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the Paris Opéra designed by Charles Garnier.|$|E

5|$|Woodenlegs, {{unsure what}} to do with the material, passed them to Weist, who at the time was writing a Cheyenne history for use in {{reservation}} schools. The negatives were contained in a battered <b>shoebox,</b> and some were in poor condition. Weist involved photographer Jerry Mader to work on their restoration. Weist, Mader, and Woodenlegs began a project in the 1960s to make the images available in reservation schools. Without funds for publication, however, the project was abandoned in 1981 on the death of Woodenlegs. Weist died in 1994. The negatives were passed to anthropologist Margot Liberty in 1998 by a remaining project member, Elizabeth Wilson Clark, shortly before her death. Liberty had been a teacher at the Northern Cheyenne reservation in the 1950s, and she agreed to edit the material into a book for the University of Oklahoma Press. Finally, 142 of the images were published in 2006 as A Northern Cheyenne Album. The book includes a commentary from Woodenlegs recorded years before.|$|E

25|$|Besieged by reporters, Ethan checks into a motel. He {{receives}} {{a letter from}} the killer, which leads to a <b>shoebox</b> containing a mobile phone, a handgun, and five origami figures. The killer calls him and explains that each of the figures contains instructions on how to complete a trial, which will allow him to determine how much Ethan loves his son. If he chooses to complete them, then he will receive a piece of the address where Shaun is held. The trials force Ethan to make increasingly difficult moral decisions, including driving against traffic at high speeds on the highway, crawling through a maze composed of broken glass and active electrical pylons, cutting off one of his fingers, breaking into the apartment of a drug dealer and murdering him in front of his family, and drinking a glass of poison on camera. While undergoing the trials, he meets Madison Paige, a journalist who occasionally checks into the motel to deal with her chronic insomnia. She sympathizes with Ethan's plight, and decides to conduct her own investigation into the Origami Killer.|$|E

500|$|Pei's design {{placed the}} rigid <b>shoebox</b> {{at an angle}} to the {{surrounding}} street grid, connected at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones. The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like filigree. The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion. Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together. [...] "I can imagine only 60percent of the space in this building," [...] he said during the early stages. [...] "The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else." [...] As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support. Billionaire tycoon Ross Perot made a donation of US$10million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H. Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the last}} two years several cases of severe contact {{dermatitis}} related to newly acquired sofas and armchairs originating from China have been published. The responsible allergen is dimethylfumarate (DMF), an extremely potent sensitizer and irritant found in sachets inside the furniture. Recently, cases of contact dermatitis related to shoes and riding helmets have also been described. METHODS: We evaluated two patients with allergic contact dermatitis related to shoes manufactured in China that were contaminated by dimethylfumarate found in sachets placed inside the <b>shoeboxes.</b> RESULTS: Patch tests with DMF extracted from the sachets inside the <b>shoeboxes</b> showed positive reactions. Postitive reactions were also obtained using small fragments of the shoes and tissue of the "MouldProof" sachet. The patients were instructed to avoid the suspected shoes and were treated with topical corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Contact dermatitis induced by dimethylfumarate should be suspected in appropriate cases. It {{is important to remember that}} this allergen is not included in most series for patch testing...|$|R

A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something.

In September 2005, he {{released}} an 'in-character' semi-fictionalised autobiography titled Bigger than Hitler, Better than Christ (...)

In 2006, Mayall reprised the role of Alan B'Stard in the play The New Statesman 2006: Blair B'stard Project, written by Marks and Gran. By this time B'Stard had left the floundering Conservatives and become a Labour MP. In 2007, following a successful two-month run in London's West End at the Trafalgar Studios, a heavily re-written version toured theatres nationwide, with Marks and Gran constantly updating the script to keep it topical. However, Mayall succumbed to chronic fatigue and flu in May 2007 and withdrew from the show. Alan B'Stard was played by his understudy, Mike Sherman during his hiatus.|$|E
