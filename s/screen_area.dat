25|$|More {{accurately}} {{known as}} limiting resolution, tube resolution {{is measured in}} line pairs per millimeter or lp/mm. This {{is a measure of}} how many lines of varying intensity (light to dark) can be resolved within a millimeter of <b>screen</b> <b>area.</b> However the limiting resolution itself {{is a measure of the}} Modulation Transfer Function. For most tubes, the limiting resolution is defined as the point at which the modulation transfer function becomes three percent or less. The higher the value, the higher the resolution of the tube.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the 2DS using one physical display divided to emulate two, Kyle Orland of Ars Technica believed that Nintendo had missed an opportunity to produce a full-screen gaming tablet using the 2DS's form factor; which would have enabled future games and apps to use the entire <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> (which he estimated to be around the 5-inch range used by phablets), still allow backwards compatibility with games designed for the folding 3DS and DS, and enhance the ability to port existing smartphone games to the platform. However, Orland also noted that introducing such a product could fragment Nintendo's portable gaming ecosystem for existing 3DS users—and {{that it was too}} early in the 3DS's life for Nintendo to introduce a successor.|$|E
500|$|Afterward, the animators would compile the scenes, {{and develop}} a new {{storyboard}} with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design. Under Tom Porter, the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces. A few surfaces in Toy Story came from real objects: a shader for the curtain fabric in Andy's room used a scan of actual cloth. Under Galyn Susman and Sharon Calahan, the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a [...] "render farm" [...] of 117 Sun Microsystems computers that ran 24 hours a day. Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week. Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total. There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots. A camera team, aided by David DiFrancesco, recorded the frames onto film stock. Toy Story was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels, with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter-inch of <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> on a typical cinema screen. During post-production, the film was sent to Skywalker Sound, where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.|$|E

2500|$|Color {{convergence}} {{and color}} purity are {{two aspects of}} this single problem. Firstly, for correct color rendering {{it is necessary that}} regardless of where the beams are deflected on the screen, all three hit the same spot (and nominally pass through the same hole or slot) on the shadow mask. This is called convergence. More specifically, the convergence {{at the center of the}} screen (with no deflection field applied by the yoke) is called static convergence, and the convergence over the rest of the <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> is called dynamic convergence. The beams may converge at the center of the screen and yet stray from each other as they are deflected toward the edges; such a CRT would be said to have good static convergence but poor dynamic convergence. Secondly, each beam must only strike the phosphors of the ...|$|E

2500|$|MWAA is also {{planning}} a new [...] "Secure National Hall" [...] project. Currently, National Hall is before security, {{with a separate}} security <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> {{for each of the}} three concourses. Since Terminal B and C were designed pre-9/11, the security <b>screening</b> <b>areas</b> are cramped and congested. Further, passengers cannot access the concessions and restaurants of National Hall after they go through security, and going from one concourse to another requires re-screening, or, in certain situations, taking a bus between concourses.|$|R
5000|$|Increasing the <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> of each panel {{transfers}} {{the load}} across more surface area {{and therefore the}} wear tends to be decreased in comparison to other screens.|$|R

50|$|Through {{the use of}} {{multiple}} projectors set up to project onto a <b>screen</b> <b>area,</b> over-projected images could be designed as animations. Typical multi-image animation effects included fading from one photograph or graphic to another, progressively building text to form a completed statement, inserting images or graphics into frames or windows on screen, step by step movement of images across the <b>screen</b> <b>area,</b> and superimposing text or images onto a background. The visual effects were synchronized to music or voice and based on the capabilities and limitations of the slide projectors and dissolve units.|$|E
50|$|Because of the building-block {{nature of}} the system, the {{configuration}} of the overall <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> and shape is flexible, leading to simple traditional rectangular displays, and more complex non-standard shapes.|$|E
50|$|The Game Gear's lower screen {{resolution}} {{results in}} the Game Gear version having a smaller visible <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> than the Master System edition, causing some fans to consider the Game Gear version the more challenging title. For example, when facing the boss of the Underground Zone, the reduced <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> either side of Sonic gives the player less time to react to hazards moving onto the screen. Other bosses were also affected: the Green Hills Zone battle {{takes place in a}} smaller, steeper arena; there is a 3rd chute which cannot be seen while fighting Robotnik in the final Crystal Egg stage.|$|E

40|$|Background We {{assessed}} {{the relationship between}} screening uptake and socioeconomic deprivation for London women aged 50 – 52 invited to their first routine screening appointment between 2006 and 2009. Methods We examined uptake for London overall and within six <b>screening</b> <b>areas,</b> using deprivation quintile, based on post code of residence. Results After adjustment for age, area and ethnicity, overall uptake decreased with increasing deprivation (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0. 95, P, 0. 001). However, in two <b>screening</b> <b>areas</b> with lower uptake, women living in deprived areas had higher uptake than women from affluent areas. Conclusions These potential inequalities in early diagnosis across London require further investigation...|$|R
5000|$|These differing panel shapes {{are used}} {{in an attempt to}} reduce the {{quantity}} of panels on each frame but still provide maximum rigidity and support for the mesh attached to them. The purpose of reducing these panels is to maximize usable <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> as the walls of each panel {{get in the way of}} the mesh and prevent it from being used, this is known as [...] "blanking". The non-blanked <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> of a shaker screen is widely used as a selling feature, the more screen surface you have available to work the more efficient your shaker becomes and therefore can handle a higher quantity of fluid.|$|R

5000|$|The {{method for}} {{measuring}} ANSI lumens {{is defined in}} the IT7.215 document which was created in 1992. First the projector is set up to display an image in a room at a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. The brightness and contrast of the projector are adjusted so that on a full white field, {{it is possible to}} distinguish between a 5% <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> block of 95% peak white, and two identically sized 100% and 90% peak white boxes {{at the center of the}} white field. The light output is then measured on a full white field at nine specific locations around the screen and averaged. This average is then multiplied by the <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> to give the brightness of the projector in [...] "ANSI lumens".|$|E
