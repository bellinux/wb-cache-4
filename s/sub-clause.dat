40|$|This {{document}} briefly describes preSAT 1. 0, a {{new technique}} designed to efficiently solve structured CNF formulae. preSAT {{is based on an}} original preprocessing technique called revival [1]. This technique aims at producing either <b>sub-clauses</b> or relevant additional clauses for the tested CNF. To this end, revival heuristically checks whether each clause is minimally (w. r. t. set-theorical inclusion of literals) irredundant. The efficiency of revival relies on its full integration into a modern SAT solver. Hence, its computation benefits from the classical components of modern DPLLs (watched literals, learning scheme, VSIDS-like heuristics, etc.), boosting (sub-) clauses production. However, on some large industrial problems, revival can be time consuming. To avoid losing time in such cases, our pre-processor has a time limit empirically set to 60 seconds. Therefore, even if new <b>sub-clauses</b> could be produced, the CNF is delivered in its current state. After the application of our revival pre-processor, SatElite [2] is used to even more simplify the formula before running an exhaustive approach. For the complete solver, Rsat [3] has been selected. The addition of revival to this solver is expecte...|$|R

Farsi grammar books mention various meanings and uses for the preposition Rā. However, one of the uses of Rā is in complex sentences where Linguists have paid less attention to it. This usage of Rā is related to combined sentences, for which the subordinate clause is in main clause and after Rā. But the verb of the main clause has no need for Rā. For example, "Ān rā ke kamande sa'ādat ka&scaronan mībarad če konad ke naravad". Some Linguists such as Khanlari and Mashkour argue that this uses is totally wrong and only exists in current books. Nevertheless, in old Literature such as Golestan, this usage could be easily found. In this article, I am going to introduce this characteristic of Rā and also analyzing the argument against this issue. According to the examples that could be found in old literature books, the usage of Rā will be represented in complex sentences, where the <b>sub-clauses</b> could be found in main clauses...|$|R

Thus, there was a discrepancy between the two <b>sub-clauses.</b> Independent Thought, a non-governmental organisation, in a petition in 2013, had challenged Exception 2. In a landmark ruling on 11 October 2017, the supreme court upheld the age of consent as 18 years. The {{court held that the}} distinction made between a married girl child and an unmarried girl child was illogical and ran against the provisions of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Such a distinction also violated a child’s right to liberty and dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. Irrespective of her marital status, sex with a minor girl will now attract a minimum rigorous imprisonment of ten years. Two other significant statues undermined by the IPC section were the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and the Juvenile Justice Act, both of which defines a child as someone below the age of 18.|$|R

The rise in the scientific and biotechnological importance of BM along with an increased awareness of governments on the necessity of preserve the microbiological diversity has resulted in a global understanding of the need to assure stable and well managed operations inside culture collections.
