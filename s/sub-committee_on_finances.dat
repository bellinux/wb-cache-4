40|$|While the {{institutional}} infrastructure to coordinate climate change policy in Thailand already exists, {{previous studies have}} identified an important gap in this infrastructure. An institutional arrangement/coordinating mechanism is needed to oversee coordination of resource allocation and utilization among government agencies {{in order to achieve}} the national goal of a low carbon and resilient society. This paper reviews current policies and institutions related to climate change and recommends a new <b>Sub-committee</b> <b>on</b> Climate <b>Finance</b> be established under the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC). Alternatively, the existing sub-committee could be renamed as a <b>Sub-committee</b> <b>on</b> Climate <b>Finance</b> and Planning. Having a specific coordinating mecha-nism <b>on</b> climate <b>finance</b> would facilitate the government’s oversight of allocation of financial resources, tracking and monitoring of resource use, and also serve as a check point for resource allocation to prevent redundancy in terms of activities and allocated climate change funds. This institutional proposal may also be relevant and applicable to other developing countries facing similar challenges...|$|R
