25|$|Rabbi Mordechai {{served as}} {{a link between the}} Belz {{community}} of old and the new community that his brother was establishing in Israel through his recording of every custom and practice that he had seen done in Belz. He was originally commissioned to write down these notes by his father, the third Belzer Rebbe. In the early years in Israel, Rebbe Aharon urged him to continue. At that time, paper was scarce, so Rabbi Mordechai recorded his memories on <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> envelopes and wedding invitations.|$|E
25|$|A Howler is a blood-red {{letter sent}} to signify extreme anger or {{to convey a}} message very loudly and publicly. When it is opened, the sender's voice, which has been magically {{magnified}} to a deafening volume, bellows a message at the recipient and then self-destructs. If it is not opened or there is a delay in opening it, the letter smolders, explodes violently, and shouts the message out even louder than normal. In the film version, the Howler folds itself into an origami-style set of lips and eyes, and shouts the message out and then shreds itself into <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> before it burns itself.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 1946 {{he started}} work at DUCO, a Du Pont Company paint factory outside Turin. Because of the {{extremely}} limited train service, Levi {{stayed in the}} factory dormitory during the week. This gave {{him the opportunity to}} write undisturbed. He started to write the first draft of If This Is a Man. Every day he scribbled notes on train tickets and <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> as memories came to him. At the end of February, he had ten pages detailing the last ten days between the German evacuation and the arrival of the Red Army. For the next ten months, the book took shape in his dormitory as he typed up his recollections each night.|$|E

25|$|Pascal's most {{influential}} theological work, referred to posthumously as the Pensées ("Thoughts"), was not completed before his death. It {{was to have}} been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title Apologie de la religion Chrétienne ("Defense of the Christian Religion"). The first version of the numerous <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled Pensées de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets ("Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects") and soon thereafter became a classic. One of the Apologies main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of skepticism and stoicism, personalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.|$|E
25|$|Items must be {{collected}} and moved round the screen or {{placed in the}} inventory box to complete cases. Characters will either offer the player objects, or the player must seek out items that can be taken. Collectible items can be kept for later use by dragging the object into the Inventory box. Players must also look for scraps of the Carmen Notes, which describe where each thief will hide. These notes have each been torn into three pieces {{to make them more}} difficult to find. The player must click on the <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> to assemble them into a whole note. Once all the pieces of the Carmen note are found, the ACME handcuffs (known as Time Cuffs) activate and the player can decode Carmen's message to deduce her henchmen's location. Using the Time Cuffs on the relevant object reveals the thief, whom the Good Guide then arrests. After capturing each crook (with Dee Cryption captured once and the others captured twice), the player pursues Carmen herself.|$|E

[...] He also wrote a song about his habit, titled [...] "Dad Blame Anything A Man Can't Quit". Miller died of lung and throat cancer in 1992, at age 56, shortly after the discovery of a malignant tumor under his vocal cords. His remains were cremated.|$|E

500|$|Fully recuperated, he {{returned}} to Shrewsbury in July. Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about career and prospects on two <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> one with columns headed [...] "Marry" [...] and [...] "Not Marry". Advantages included [...] "constant companion and a friend in old age... better than a dog anyhow", against points such as [...] "less money for books" [...] and [...] "terrible loss of time." [...] Having decided in favour, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit Emma on 29 July. He did not get around to proposing, but against his father's advice he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.|$|E
500|$|A {{small amount}} of silver coins from Peru and Mexico freely {{circulated}} as legal tender. Minor financial agreements were completed in lieu of currency with assorted agricultural products, such as [...] "wheat, hides, tallow, beef, pork, butter, lard, peas, lumber and other articles of export of the territory." [...] One pioneer recalled the lack of currency, receiving at most 25¢ in transactions between 1844 and 1848. To overcome the lack of circulating coins, Abernethy gathered scraps of flint left over from arrowhead production by local indigenous. After attaching <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> to them, the amount owed by Abernethy was written on one and given to customers, transferable for other supplies at his store. Coins remained a prized item by settlers for example, during a sale of lots in Oregon City a property manager offered a discount of 50% if paid in specie.|$|E
500|$|Using <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> {{given to}} him by a janitor, notes written on the margins of a newspaper, and later a legal pad {{given to him}} by SCLC attorneys, King wrote his essay [...] "Letter from Birmingham Jail". It responded to eight {{politically}} moderate white clergymen who accused King of agitating local residents and not giving the incoming mayor a chance to make any changes. Bass suggested that [...] "Letter from Birmingham Jail" [...] was pre-planned, as was every move King and his associates made in Birmingham. The essay was a culmination of many of King's ideas, which he had touched on in earlier writings. King's arrest attracted national attention, including that of corporate officers of retail chains with stores in downtown Birmingham. After King's arrest, the chains' profits began to erode. National business owners pressed the Kennedy administration to intervene. King was released on April 20, 1963.|$|E

When Stewie is exploring the house he finds a Hustler magazine under his brother's bed, curious of what a vagina looks like.

Stewie mentions that Aquaman is pretty useless if the crime does not take place on water. Other references included jokes about the television series Lost and actors Robin Williams and Sean Connery.|$|E
500|$|In late July 1944, Soviet forces {{began to}} {{approach}} from the east. The departing Germans who already destroyed most direct evidence of genocidal intent burned surrounding villages to the ground, including 761 buildings in Poniatowo, Prostyń, and Grądy. Many families were killed. The fields of grain that once fed the SS were burned. On 19 August 1944, German forces {{blew up the}} church in Prostyń and its bell tower, the last defensive strongpoint against the Red Army in the area. When the Soviets entered Treblinka on 16 August, the extermination zone had been levelled, ploughed over, and planted with lupins. What remained, wrote visiting Soviet war correspondent Vasily Grossman, were small pieces of bone in the soil, human teeth, <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and fabric, broken dishes, jars, shaving brushes, rusted pots and pans, cups of all sizes, mangled shoes, and lumps of human hair. The road leading to the camp was pitch black. Until mid-1944 human ashes (up to 20 carts every day) had been regularly strewn by the remaining prisoners along the road for [...] {{in the direction of}} TreblinkaI. When the war ended, destitute and starving locals started walking up the Black Road (as they began to call it) in search of man-made nuggets shaped from melted gold in order to buy bread.|$|E
500|$|Of Keats's {{six major}} odes of 1819, [...] "Ode to Psyche", was {{probably}} written first and [...] "To Autumn" [...] written last. Sometime between these two, he wrote [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". It {{is possible that}} [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] was written between 26 April and 18 May 1819, based on weather conditions and similarities between images in the poem and those in a letter sent to Fanny Brawne on May Day. The poem was composed at the Hampstead house Keats shared with Brown, possibly while sitting beneath a plum tree in the garden. According to Keats' friend Brown, Keats finished the ode in just one morning: [...] "In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree, where he sat {{for two or three}} hours. When he came into the house, I perceived he had some <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feelings on the song of the nightingale." [...] Brown's account is personal, as he claimed the poem was directly influenced by his house and preserved by his own doing. However, Keats relied on both his own imagination and other literature as sources for his depiction of the nightingale.|$|E

[...] He would later use whatever <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> or materials his mother would give him, along with number two pencils, to imagine and draw. Inventive for his age, he once took an old bed sheet and fashioned it into a canvas to draw a painting that he still has today.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{children}} were {{admitted to the}} Foundling Hospital on 25 March 1741, into a temporary house located in Hatton Garden. At first, no questions were asked about child or parent, but a distinguishing token was put on each child by the parent. These were often marked coins, trinkets, pieces of cotton or ribbon, verses written on <b>scraps</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> Clothes, if any, were carefully recorded. One entry in the record reads, [...] "Paper on the breast, clout on the head." [...] The applications became too numerous, and a system of balloting with red, white and black balls was adopted. Children were seldom taken after they were twelve months old.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the period}} from 1906 to 1909 he lived a settled life in Monikie but had so little money {{that he could not}} afford to publish his work.

Several of his 1910 recordings for Columbia in London are available on a CD on the Temple label. These include traditional tunes as well as his own works, presenting a unique window into early twentieth century fiddle playing and probably back to the 1850s.|$|E
