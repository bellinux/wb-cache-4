40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) {{identified}} the caustic side solvent extraction (CSSX) process as the preferred technology to remove cesium from radioactive waste solutions at the Savannah River Site (SRS). As a result, Washington Savannah River Company (WSRC) began designing {{and building a}} Modular CSSX Unit (MCU) in the SRS tank farm to process liquid waste for an interim period until the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) begins operations. Both the solvent and the strip effluent streams could contain high concentrations of cesium which must {{be removed from the}} contactors, process tanks, and piping prior to performing contactor maintenance. When these vessels are drained, thin films or drops will remain on the equipment walls. Following draining, the vessels will be flushed with water and drained to remove the flush water. The draining reduces the cesium concentration in the vessels by reducing the volume of cesium-containing material. The flushing, and subsequent draining, reduces the cesium in the vessels by diluting the cesium that remains in the film or drops on the vessel walls. MCU personnel requested that Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) researchers conduct a literature search to identify models to calculate the thickness of the liquid films remaining in the contactors, process tanks, and piping following draining of salt solution, solvent, and strip solution. The conclusions from this work are: (1) The predicted film thickness of the strip effluent is 0. 010 mm on vertical walls, 0. 57 mm on horizontal walls and 0. 081 mm in horizontal pipes. (2) The predicted film thickness of the salt solution is 0. 015 mm on vertical walls, 0. 74 mm on horizontal walls, and 0. 106 mm in horizontal pipes. (3) The predicted film thickness of the solvent is 0. 022 mm on vertical walls, 0. 91 mm on horizontal walls, and 0. 13 mm in horizontal pipes. (4) The calculated film volume following draining is: (a) Salt <b>solution</b> receipt <b>tank</b> [...] 1. 6 gallons; (b) Salt <b>solution</b> feed <b>tank</b> [...] 1. 6 gallons; (c) Decontaminated salt <b>solution</b> hold <b>tank</b> [...] 1. 6 gallons; (d) Contactor drain tank [...] 0. 40 gallons; (e) Strip effluent hold tank [...] 0. 33 gallons; (f) Decontaminated salt solution decanter [...] 0. 37 gallons; (g) Strip effluent decanter [...] 0. 14 gallons; (h) Solvent hold tank [...] 0. 30 gallon; and (i) Corrugated piping between contactors [...] 16 - 21 mL. (5) After the initial vessel draining, flushing the vessels with 100 gallons of water using a spray nozzle that produces complete vessel coverage and draining the flush water reduces the source term by the following amounts: (i) Salt <b>solution</b> receipt <b>tank</b> [...] 63 X; (ii) Salt <b>solution</b> feed <b>tank</b> [...] 63 X; (iii) Decontaminated salt <b>solution</b> hold <b>tank</b> [...] 63 X; (iv) Contactor drain tank [...] 250 X; (v) Strip effluent hold tank [...] 300 X; (vi) Decontaminated salt solution decanter [...] 270 X; (vii) Strip effluent decanter [...] 710 X; (viii) Solvent hold tank [...] 330 X. Understand that these estimates of film thickness are based on laboratory testing and fluid mechanics theory. The calculations assume drainage occurs by film flow. Much of the data used to develop the models came from tests with very ''clean'' fluids. Impurities in the fluids and contaminants on the vessels walls could increase liquid holdup. The application of film thickness models and source term reduction calculations should be considered along with operational conditions and H-Tank Farm/Liquid Waste operating experience.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master's thesis is to describe the existing surge <b>tank</b> <b>solutions</b> and additional improvements, and to simulate the hydraulic behavior of the surge tanks and how it affects the hydropower plant. The high head hydropower plant Torpa and the low head hydropower plant Åna-Sira are used for the case study, thus the surge tanks can be simulated under different hydraulic conditions. Turbine pressures and mass oscillations after a complete turbine shutdown, and turbine regulation parameters from operating the hydropower plant, are simulated in the LVTrans software. The result is a Surge Tank Atlas, where the surge <b>tank</b> <b>solutions</b> are described with conceptual drawings, advantages and disadvantages, and documentation from the simulations. This Surge Tank Atlas provides a useful tool to compare different surge <b>tank</b> <b>solutions</b> for both a high head and low head hydropower plant. Some of the conclusions are valid for both hydropower plants and all the surge <b>tank</b> <b>solutions.</b> Increasing the distance from surge tank to turbine, decreasing the surge tank volume or a strong throttling of the surge tank will increase the water hammer significantly, {{and to some extent}} reduce the mass oscillations. An optimal throttling of the surge tank will stabilize the running of the hydropower plant, reduce the surge tank mass oscillations and hence the necessary height and volume of the surge tank. Other conclusions vary between the open and the closed surge tank, and the high and low head hydropower plant. The closed surge tank shows a better dampening of the water hammer than the open surge tank for both hydropower plant, the closed surge tank can be throttled stronger than the open surge tanks, and the surge tanks at the low head hydropower plant requires more volume than for the high head plant, even though the hydraulic head is a tenth of the high head hydropower plant. Hence there are some significant differences in the hydraulic behavior between the surge <b>tank</b> <b>solutions</b> and the high head and the low head hydropower plant, that will be presented and discussed in the Surge Tank Atlas...|$|R

With this type of disease {{it was felt that}} a resistant rootstock would provide the best control, hence this program has received the primary emphasis in research on this disease. Several publications have described the collections of avocado types and related species in Latin America (2, 3, 4, 5), the testing procedures in the search for resistance (6), and preliminary reports have been presented of the resistance of some of the plant materials (6, 7). All plants are now first screened for resistance in the nutrient <b>solution</b> <b>tank</b> test in the greenhouse, which provides a rapid and severe trial (6). High resistance was reported early in the development of this program in several small-fruited species of the genus Persea, based on tests in the greenhouse and lathhouse and a few preliminary field trials (7). Similar high resistance has been found in additional collections made in Latin America by the senior author within the past few years. Unfortunately to date all of the high resistance occurs in species which are not graft compatible with avocado (1) and hence cannot be used directly as rootstocks, as had been hoped.

40|$|Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina is {{dissolving}} Pu 239 scrap, {{which is}} a legacy from the production of nuclear weapons materials, and will later convert it into oxide form to stabilize it. An eductor {{has been used to}} both dilute and transfer a plutonium containing solution between tanks. Eductors have the advantages of simplicity and no moving parts. Reliable control of dilution is important because the geometry of the receiving tank could potentially allow a nuclear criticality. Dilution factor was to have been controlled by the appropriate choice of flow restrictor in the line between the plutonium <b>solution</b> <b>tank</b> and the eductor. However, dilution factors measured for liquid transfers with different flow restrictors showed unexpected trends, causing concern that the process was not well understood. As a result, the performance of the eductor and associated piping were analyzed using a mathematical model. The one dimensional, two phase model accounted for eductor performance and for air and vapor coming out of solution at low pressures. The unexpected trends were shown {{to be the result of}} variations in viscosities and densities of both the plutonium solution and the nitric acid solution used as both the motive fluid and diluent. The model agreed well with existing data and was then used to make pre-test predictions of flows for four solution transfers with good agreement. This provided confidence that the eductor system was a reliable method for obtaining specified dilution factors. Based on model results, recommendations were made and implemented for the operation of the eductor transfer system.

The proposed plan is to centrifuge the solutions to remove solids which may present downstream criticality concerns or cause operational problems with the 1 st Cycle solvent extraction due {{to the formation of}} stable emulsions. An evaluation of the efficiency of the H-Canyon centrifuge concluded that a sufficient amount (> 90 %) of the solids in the Tank 11. 1 and 12. 2 solutions will be removed to prevent any problems. We based this conclusion on the particle size distribution of the solids isolated from samples of the solutions and the calculation of particle settling times in the centrifuge. The particle size distributions were calculated from images generated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mean particle diameters for the distributions were 1 - 3 {micro}m. A significant fraction (30 - 50 %) of the particles had diameters which were 1 {micro}m account for > 99 % of the solid mass and will be efficiently removed by the centrifuge; therefore, the formation of emulsions during solvent extraction operations is not an issue.

The configuration of this bioreactor {{was similar to}} a shell-and-tube heat exchanger, and consisted of a bundle of parallel tubes made up of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel, containing nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, fixed on to the tube sheets. The tube bundle was contained in a cylindrical shell which was provided with two channels, one at each end. Ammonia nitrogen wastewater was introduced into the shell-side space surrounding the tubes. At the same time, air was pumped through an air-stone into wastewater for nitrification. Ethanol solution was pumped into one channel. It flowed through the tubes into the other channel and was withdrawn into the ethanol <b>solution</b> <b>tank</b> for recycling. An integrated nitrogen removal process was studied using this bioreactor. The nitrogen removal process could be much simplified when it {{was carried out in}} this bioreactor, because only a small amount of ethanol diffused into the wastewater from the recycling ethanol solution, and the BOD 5 value in the effluent was lower than 30 mg l - 1. In addition, no accumulation of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate in the recycling ethanol solution was observed. The total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) concentration was below 3 mg l - 1 after the ethanol solution was recycled in the bioreactor for a week. The ammonia oxidation rate when nitrification and denitrification occurred simultaneously in a bioreactor was about twice as fast as when only nitrification occurred (denitrification was restrained). The operational system remained stable for more then 3 months and the mechanical strength of the tubes was excellent even after 3 months of continuous operation. The existence of a short-cut of nitrogen removal was indicated, in which ammonia nitrogen was first converted into nitrite and subsequent denitrification proceeded directly from nitrite using the co-immobilized mixed culture. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} challenges in the nuclear fuel cycle is to establish a material balance for tanks containing spent fuel <b>solutions.</b> These <b>tanks</b> present an extremely hostile environment to the analyst, making determination of the amount of fissile material in them difficult. Historic methods used to determine the volumes of <b>solutions</b> in these <b>tanks</b> are usually based on use of tank geometry in conjunction with depth and density measurements, both of which vary with temperature and are normally controlled by the operator of the facility. Changes in the interior geometry of tanks due to addition of various types of equipment, minor structural modifications, and accumulation of insoluble materials at the bottom and on the interior surfaces of the tanks affect the available volume and make difficult its accurate measurement. For safeguards purposes, it is thus desirable to have a repeatable method of volume determination independent of the operator and other factors. To determine the quantity of uranium and plutonium in a given tank, aliquots are withdrawn and subjected to analysis; both isotopic abundances and the amount of each element present are determined. Isotope dilution mass spectrometry is the method of choice for quantitative measurements in this application and yields values more precise and accurate than other methods.

To obtain the <b>solution,</b> the <b>Tank</b> and Hopfield linear programming network was repeatedly used. However, since such a network frequently produces constraint-violating solutions, {{the reliability of}} Foo and Takefuji’s approach is doubtful. In this article, it is shown that reliability of the network approach can be greatly improved, by guaranteeing constraint-satisfying solutions, if the original job-shop problem is reformulated as a goal programming problem, before it is mapped onto a goal programming network. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical coupon testing were {{performed}} on 6 Hanford <b>tank</b> <b>solution</b> simulants and corresponding condensate simulants to evaluate the susceptibility of vapor space and liquid/air interface corrosion. Additionally, partial-immersion coupon testing {{were performed}} on the 6 <b>tank</b> <b>solution</b> simulants to compliment the accelerated electrochemical testing. Overall, the testing suggests that the SY- 102 high nitrate solution is the most aggressive of the six solution simulants evaluated. Alternatively, the most passive solution, based on both electrochemical testing and coupon testing, was AY- 102 solution. The presence of ammonium nitrate in the simulants at the lowest concentration tested (0. 001 M) had no significant effect. At higher concentrations (0. 5 M), ammonium nitrate appears to deter localized corrosion, suggesting a beneficial effect {{of the presence of}} the ammonium ion. The results of this research suggest that there is a threshold concentration of ammonium ions leading to inhibition of corrosion, thereby suggesting the need for further experimentation to identify the threshold...|$|R
40|$|Word was {{received}} that the Eimco filter has been shipped from the Salt Lake City plant. It is expected {{within two weeks}} or about May 10, 1948. In place of a float gauge {{referred to in the}} Process Research Progress Report, March 1 [...] 31, 1984, a Uehling Tank-O-Meter will be used on the chemical <b>solution</b> <b>tanks</b> for the W. D. Building. Word was also received that the steam ejector has been shipped. It can be expected within the next few days. This item will complete the equipment to be used for the removal of activity from the flue gases produced in the incinerator. Laboratory experiments using synthetic bismuth chloride solutions are considered as completed for the time being. The experiments have shown that good yields, and adherent deposits can be obtained from solutions containing 0. 18 g. bismuth/ml. with a 7 N hydrochloric acid concentration, providing a diaphragm is inserted between the anode and cathode. Neither calcium chloride nor pyrogallol are necessary under the conditions mentioned above. Bismuth was plated from a production solution in Run EP- 1 in which the activity has been reduced from 4. 2 {times} 10 {sup 7 } c. /min. /ml. to 4. 2 {times} 10 {sup 4 } c. /min. /ml. A yield of 2. 48 g. /amp. -hr. was obtained. The deposit contained several large nodules which were easily rubbed off. A greater portion of the past month was taken up with the preparation of a exhibit for the Miamisburg Atomic Energy Show...|$|R
50|$|In 2013, ABB {{launched}} a 420 kV Disconnecting Circuit Breaker (DCB) with integrated FOCS. Since one FOCS replaces many conventional current transformers, engineering {{and design of}} the substation is simplified. By reducing the material needed, including insulation, a 420 kV DCB with integrated FOCS can reduce a substation’s footprint by over 50% compared to the conventional <b>solution</b> of live <b>tank</b> breakers with disconnectors and current transformers.|$|R
