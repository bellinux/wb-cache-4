5|$|In 1998, Murray Hill Publishing sued 20th Century Fox for $150,000, {{claiming}} that {{the idea for the}} film was stolen from a screenplay they had purchased from high school teacher Brian Webster entitled Could This Be Christmas?. They said the script had 36 similarities with Jingle All the Way, including the plot, dialogue and character names. Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993, and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed the idea was copied by Kornfield, who was Fox's <b>script</b> <b>reader.</b> In 2001, Fox were found guilty of stealing the idea and ordered to pay $19 million ($15 million in damages and $4 million in legal costs) to Murray Hill, with Webster to receive a portion. Laurel died {{a few months after the}} verdict, before receiving any of the money. On appeal, the damages figure was lowered to $1.5 million, before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 after a judge decided the idea was not stolen, as Fox had bought Kornfield's screenplay before he or anybody else at Fox had read Could This Be Christmas?.|$|E

To date, no studies of color CP have been conducted on right-to-left <b>script</b> <b>readers</b> in secondary category boundary to support this theory. Three experiments have been conducted: Experiments 1 and 2 established the Arabic blue–purple secondary category boundary, and Experiment 3 tested the CP {{of color in the}} blue–purple category boundary. Sixty participants (30 men and 30 women) took part in this study. All spoke Arabic as their first language, and all were undergraduate or postgraduate students at King Saud University. Their ages ranged from 18 – 35 years {{with a mean age of}} 21. 9 years (SD = 5. 2). The result indicated that for Experiments 1 and 2, it appeared that the Arabic blue–purple category boundary was approximately 10 PB and it is in the same location as for English. For Experiment 3, reaction times in the between-categories condition were significantly faster than those in the within-category condition; this suggested that CP of color was shown in the Arabic&# 39;s blue–purple secondary category boundary.

5000|$|Since the Metamorphoses {{is derived}} from {{literary}} texts, productions of Zimmerman's may be classified in the genre of Readers Theater. According to Miriam Chirico, Readers Theater presents a narrative text to an audience, for instance a poem rather than action that follows a typical play <b>script.</b> <b>Readers</b> Theater generally follows the [...] "presentational" [...] form of theater, rather than representational, often relying on narrators to bring insight from an outside perspective to a character. The presentational aspect creates a direct link between the audience and the narrator. Readers Theater reduces theatrical devices, such as costumes, sets, and props, {{to concentrate on the}} story and the language. Metamorphoses follows these methods by using multiple narrators, who both tell and comment on the story, and language that is strongly rooted in the David R. Slavitt translation of Ovid.|$|R

40|$|Teaching {{has often}} been {{thought of as a}} {{creative}} performance. Al-though comparisons with performance were originally intended to emphasize teacher creativity, they have become associated instead with contemporary reform efforts toward scripted instruction that deny the creativity of teachers. Scripted instruction is opposed to con-structivist, inquiry-based, and dialogic teaching methods that empha-size classroom collaboration. To provide insight into these methods, the “teaching as performance ” metaphor must be modified: Teaching is improvisational performance. Conceiving of teaching as improvi-sation highlights the collaborative and emergent nature of effective classroom practice, helps us to understand how curriculum materi-als relate to classroom practice, and shows why teaching is a cre-ative art. Although the teacher-proof movement of the post-Sputnik 1960 s has long been considered a failure, new versionsof teacher proofing have gained adherents in the 1990 s, as increasing numbers of schools continue to implement scripted curricula that turn teachers into <b>script</b> <b>readers.</b> These curricula often provide word-for-word scripts that teachers are strongly encouraged to follow, and include Slavin’s Success for All (Slavi...|$|R

40|$|This study {{predominantly}} {{examined the}} regularity and consistency effects during word recognition with second language (L 2) Chinese adult readers using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixteen native alphabetic <b>script</b> <b>readers</b> learning Chinese as a late-acquired L 2 with reading proficiency of Chinese reaching local Primary 4 level completed a lexical decision (LD) task and a delayed naming (DN) task. ERP {{results showed that}} effects of regularity occurred at P 200 in LD and on right hemisphere only where irregular characters elicited greater positivity than regular characters. Null effects of consistency were noted in both LD and DN. This suggests that, in Chinese, regularity and consistency construct distinctly and operate under different mechanisms with different neural correlates. In addition, null phonological effects were observed in DN. The study also suggests that the access to phonological information from print is subject to task demands as well as reading proficiency. Besides, L 2 Chinese readers followed a similar developmental ERP trajectory of native Chinese-speaking Grade 4 children and adopted an accommodation pattern in developing orthography-to-phonology knowledge in Chinese reading. published_or_final_versionSpeech and Hearing SciencesBachelorBachelor of Science in Speech and Hearing Science...|$|R

40|$|Poster presentationSession: Object recognition: ReadingChanges in font {{regularity}} {{within a}} word or between words are shown to affect experts more than novices in visual word recognition (Gauthier et al., 2006). Consistent with this finding, we recently found that expert Chinese readers showed stronger left side bias (i. e., the preference to judge a character made from two left-halves of a mirror-symmetric character more similar to the original character than one from two right-halves; Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009) in perceiving characters in a familiar font than in an unfamiliar font. Nevertheless, this font sensitivity effect was limited to characters with the visual complexity of the <b>script</b> that the <b>readers</b> were most familiar with. Here we used a masked repetition priming paradigm in a semantic decision task with EEG recording to examine font sensitivity effects in simplified and traditional Chinese readers with simplified, traditional, and shared (shared between the two scripts) character stimuli. In each trial, the target character was presented in a familiar font (song), while the prime was in either the same (song) or a different, unfamiliar font (feng). Since simplified <b>script</b> <b>readers</b> {{are not familiar with}} traditional characters, they may demonstrate less font sensitivity to traditional characters. In contrast, because the visual complexity of shared characters are similar to simplified but not traditional characters, font sensitivity effects may only be observed in traditional characters among traditional Chinese readers. Consistent with our hypothesis, the font change across the prime and target affected N 1 amplitude among simplified Chinese readers when perceiving simplified and shared but not traditional characters. In contrast, traditional Chinese readers demonstrated a marginal font sensitivity effect only in traditional characters. These results suggest that font sensitivity depends on experience with the visual complexity of the script. The heterogeneity in visual complexity among Chinese characters provides this unique opportunity to reveal this effect...|$|R
