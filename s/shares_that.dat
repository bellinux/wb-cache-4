5|$|Outside of England and Wales, the {{decision}} {{has not been}} applied. In White v Shortall, the Supreme Court of New South Wales explicitly rejected Dillon's reasoning. Campbell J nonetheless reached the same conclusion (that a settlor could declare a valid trust of an unascertained parcel of <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> {{was part of a}} larger fund), albeit by different reasoning.|$|E
5|$|This action (and {{others like}} it) was {{intensely}} unpopular {{with the other}} investors, however, and he was blackballed from entry in the New York Stock Exchange several times before regaining admittance. Following the event, a rule was made to limit the length of any option contracts to sixty days, to prevent a similar coup on the short side. After some troubles, Little was again worth $2 million by 1846 (equivalent to about $ million today). However, his fortunes were again reversed that year when he attempted but failed to corner the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and was obligated to pay out for thousands of inflated <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> he had himself bid up in price, losing about {{a million dollars in}} the process—a staggering sum at the time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, UBS {{announced}} the planned cut of 8,700 jobs and had implemented a new compensation plan. Under the plan, {{no more than}} one-third of any cash bonus would be paid out in the year it is earned with the rest to be held in reserve and stock-based incentives that would vest after three years; top executives would have to hold 75% of any vested shares. Additionally, the bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, would no longer receive any extra variable compensation, only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> could not be sold for four years. In April 2009, UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business, UBS Pactual, for approximately US$2.5billion to BTG Investments. UBS rejected proposals to break apart the bank and divest its investment banking division.|$|E

5|$|Investigating {{appropriations}} led Randall {{to focus}} on financial impropriety in Congress and the Grant administration. The most famous of these was the Crédit Mobilier scandal. In this scheme, the Union Pacific Railroad bankrupted itself by overpaying its construction company, the Crédit Mobilier of America. Crédit Mobilier was owned by the railroad's principal shareholders and, as the investigation discovered, several congressmen also owned <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> they {{had been allowed to}} purchase at discounted prices. Randall's role in the investigation was limited, but he proposed bills to ban such frauds and sought to impeach Vice President Schuyler Colfax, who had been implicated in the scandal. Randall was involved with the investigation of several other scandals, as well, including tax fraud by private tax collection contractors (known as the Sanborn incident) and fraud in the awarding of postal contracts (the star route scandal).|$|E

25|$|Stock exchanges {{originated}} as mutual organizations, {{owned by}} its member stock brokers. There {{has been a}} recent trend for stock exchanges to demutualize, where the members sell their shares in an initial public offering. In this way the mutual organization becomes a corporation, with <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> are listed on a stock exchange. Examples are Australian Securities Exchange (1998), Euronext (merged with New York Stock Exchange), NASDAQ (2002), Bursa Malaysia (2004), the New York Stock Exchange (2005), Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, and the São Paulo Stock Exchange (2007).|$|E
25|$|Until February 2005, Canopy held SCO shares, and the {{management}} of SCO held shares of Canopy. The two parties became embroiled in a bitter dispute when the Noorda family sought to oust board member Ralph Yarro III on claims of misappropriation. With internal problems not made public (which included the suicides of Canopy's director of information systems, Robert Penrose, and Val Kriedel, the daughter of Ray Noorda), the Canopy Group agreed to buy back all the <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> SCO had in Canopy {{in exchange for their}} SCO shares and cash.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the company}} went public on 12 July 1973, as J Sainsbury plc, the company was wholly owned by the Sainsbury family. It {{was at the time}} the largest ever {{flotation}} on the London Stock Exchange; the company rewarded the smaller bids for shares in order to create as many shareholders as possible. A million shares were set aside for staff, which led to many staff members buying <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> shot up in value. Within one minute the list of applications was closed: £495million had been offered for £14.5million available shares. The Sainsbury family at the time retained 85% of the firm's shares.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch, {{traditionally}} able seafarers and keen mapmakers, obtained {{an increasingly}} dominant position in world trade, a position which before had been {{occupied by the}} Portuguese and Spaniards. In 1602 the Dutch East India Company (Dutch: Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC) was founded. It was the first-ever multinational corporation, financed by <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> established the first modern stock exchange. It became the world's largest commercial enterprise of the 17th century. To finance the growing trade within the region, the Bank of Amsterdam was established in 1609, the precursor to, if not the first true central bank.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, Loft sued Guth for {{breaching}} {{his duty}} {{of loyalty to}} the company by failing to sell the syrup formula to Loft, and instead appropriating it for himself. Loft argued that while its president, Guth used Loft's assets, credit, finances, facilities and employees {{to build up the}} other company. Guth argued that the opportunity came to him personally and that it was out of Loft's business sector. Loft sued for the 237,500 <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> Guth owned (91% of Pepsi-Cola's total shares). He remained president of Pepsi during the process. In 1939, the Delaware supreme court rendered the verdict in favor of Loft.|$|E
25|$|An ETF {{is a type}} of fund. It owns assets (bonds, stocks, gold bars, etc.) and divides {{ownership}} of itself into <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> are held by shareholders. The details of the structure (such as a corporation or trust) will vary by country, and even within one country there may be multiple possible structures. The shareholders indirectly own the assets of the fund, and they will typically get an annual report. Shareholders are entitled to a share of the profits, such as interest or dividends, and they may get a residual value in case the fund is liquidated. Their ownership interest in the fund can easily be bought and sold.|$|E

Nova had previously used the asset management consulting company to arrange short term financing with an 11 million share stock loan on 29 July 2007.

25|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} two-field system, a three-field system allows for {{significantly}} more land to be put under cultivation. Even more important, the system allows for two harvests a year, reducing the risk that a single crop failure will lead to famine. Three-field agriculture creates a surplus of oats {{that can be used}} to feed horses. Because the system required a major rearrangement of real estate and of the social order, it took until the 11th century before it came into general use. The heavy wheeled plough was introduced in the late 10th century. It required greater animal power and promoted the use of teams of oxen. Illuminated manuscripts depict two-wheeled ploughs with both a mouldboard, or curved metal ploughshare, and a coulter, a vertical blade in front of the ploughshare. The Romans had used light, wheel-less ploughs with flat iron <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> often proved unequal to the heavy soils of northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Until 1967, {{all schools}} {{in central and}} {{southern}} Somalia taught Italian. In 1972, the Somali language was officially declared the only national language of Somalia, though it now <b>shares</b> <b>that</b> distinction with Arabic. Due to its simplicity, {{the fact that it}} lent itself well to writing Somali since it could cope with all the sounds in the language, and the already widespread existence of machines and typewriters designed for its use, the government of Somali president Mohamed Siad Barre, following the recommendation of the Somali Language Committee that was instituted shortly after independence with the purpose of finding a common orthography for the Somali language, unilaterally elected to only use the Latin script for writing Somali instead of the long-established Arabic script and the upstart Osmanya script. During this period, Italian remained among the languages used in higher education. In 1983, nine out of the twelve faculties in the Somali National University used Italian as the language of instruction. Until 1991, there was also an Italian school in Mogadishu (with courses of Middle school and Liceum), later destroyed because of the civil war.|$|E
