50|$|The {{system is}} {{designed}} whereas the government not only regulates and oversees system performance, but the ambulance <b>service</b> <b>contractor</b> is held accountable to meet or exceed performance requirements. These requirements include, but not limited to, time constraints. Such limits are set to ensure an ambulance arrives to life-threatening emergencies without delay. The contractors failure in fulfilling the contractual obligations can result in fines being imposed, {{up to and including}} termination of contract. The agreement and contract between government and contractor are done through a competitive bidding process. This insures that the most cost-effective provision of EMS services is guaranteed.|$|E

50|$|During the 1980s, janitors {{working for}} large real estate owners had become victims of {{competition}} and lowered wages. The large real estate companies sent out cleaning services to the building <b>service</b> <b>contractors.</b> These contractors were in high competition {{with each other and}} therefore cut wages for their cleaning services. This placed janitors in a situation that they had no power to change: If they attempted to ask the <b>service</b> <b>contractors</b> for higher wages, the contractors would pass the responsibility to the real estate owners. If the janitors inquired the owners about increasing their wages, the owners would say that it was the responsibility of the contractors.|$|R
50|$|Effective Price Reduction Clause {{compliance}} procedures will protect vendors if their discounting practices are fully and accurately disclosed {{in their original}} proposals to GSA and then are used {{as a basis for}} compliance over the term of the contract. Although not ideal, a compliance system implemented after a contract has been awarded can bring a contract into compliance, although sometimes at the expense of profits. If implementing a system {{in the middle of a}} contract period, inaccuracies that turn up should be corrected immediately, and the GSA contracting officer should be made aware of them. Price Reduction Clause compliance systems and procedures can range from the simple to the complex. A simple, manual system would be appropriate for a <b>service</b> <b>contractor</b> with standard labor rates that are not discounted. A complex system would be required for a reseller with thousands of products and discounting policies that differ among product groups.|$|E
5000|$|Public Health Service {{catering}} case: Recurrent complaints {{by patients}} over the catering <b>service</b> (<b>contractor</b> Mediterranea de Catering) due to poor standards in food, denied by the Government of Navarre. A tribunal imposed a fine on the catering service. The recently outsourced service {{was found to}} be operating at higher expenses than the regular public catering service in force up to that point, as disclosed by the Accountancy Chamber of Navarre (the Comptos). Opposition parties, besides condemning the lack of transparency, labeled [...] "a scandal" [...] the conclusions of the Accountancy Chamber's report, one that pointed to financial losses coupled with a deterioration in food standards following outsourcing of the service. These parties demanded in turn the resignation of regional Health Secretary Marta Vera. Just the opposite, UPN's regional government, while [...] "respecting" [...] the conclusions, protested their not considering [...] "the actual circumstances" [...] of the moment the privatization decision was made.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2011, it was {{reported}} that the University of Central Arkansas board had bought out Meadors's contract, accepted his resignation in return, and replaced him with an interim president, Tom Courtway. The board's actions followed a controversy about renovations and expansion of the university president's house. The university campus food <b>service</b> <b>contractor</b> Aramark had offered to contribute $700,000 to the cost of the renovation. Meadors and board chair Scott Roussel reportedly did not inform the board that the deal involved granting Aramark a new service contract. In January 2013, while working in the United Arab Emirates, Meadors pleaded guilty to violating the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act during his time as the UCA president, after he was [...] "accused of urging a vice president to destroy a letter that said the offer would be in exchange for renewing Aramark's contract". Meadors had originally been charged with tampering with a public document, but reached a negotiated plea bargain for the Arkansas FOIA violation. Roussel also resigned in May 2012, but was not charged with any offense.|$|E
