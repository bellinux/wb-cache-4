5|$|Most of the {{bromides}} of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the lanthanides and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular bromides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. <b>Silver</b> <b>bromide</b> is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for bromine.|$|E
5|$|Other uses of organobromine {{compounds}} include high-density drilling fluids, dyes (such as Tyrian {{purple and}} the indicator bromothymol blue), and pharmaceuticals. Bromine itself, {{as well as}} some of its compounds, are used in water treatment, and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an enormous number of applications (e.g. <b>silver</b> <b>bromide</b> for photography).

25|$|The low {{activation}} energy in <b>silver</b> <b>bromide</b> can be attributed the silver ions’ high quadrupolar polarizability; that is, it can easily deform from a sphere into an ellipsoid. This property, {{a result of the}} d9 electronic configuration of the silver ion, facilitates migration in both the silver ion and in silver-ion vacancies, thus giving the unusually low migration energy (for Agv−: 0.29–0.33 eV, compared to 0.65 eV for NaCl).|$|E

Surgical treatment for hemifacial spasm in the early 20th century included neurolysis (destruction of nerve tissue), stretching the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve), and high-pressure irrigation of the nerve with lactate ringer's solution. The medical regimens of that time involved injection of the nerve with ethanol, electrical stimulation, application of toxic compounds (nitrate of <b>silver,</b> zinc, arsenic, <b>bromides)</b> as well as medications such as Dilantin or other anticonvulsants.|$|R

By using the Kruskal-Wallis test, our results revealed that pH 12. 1 is more effective, although both pHs can be used. Our findings also suggest that silver staining can substitute ethidium bromide, an expensive and highly toxic stain that requires specific equipment for examination...|$|R
40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy at Loughborough University. The basic photographic process {{involves the use of}} <b>silver</b> halide, usually <b>bromide,</b> with a small proportion of iodide in the more sensitive films. The silver halide is present as a dispersion of small crystals of diameter 0. 1 – 1. 5 μm in a colloidal binder of gelatin. This suspension of silver halide grains is termed the photographic emulsion. The gelatin has many important properties, one being that it suspends the crystals in warm aqueous solution during grain growth and sets to a jelly on cooling. The emulsion is prepared by forming and growing the silver halide by double decomposition between a soluble silver salt and mixed alkali halides. [Continues. ...|$|R
25|$|Additional {{investigations}} on electron- and hole-trapping {{demonstrated that}} impurities {{also can be}} a significant trapping system. Consequently, interstitial silver ions may not be reduced. Therefore, these traps are actually loss mechanisms, and are considered trapping inefficiencies. For example, atmospheric oxygen can interact with photoelectrons to form an O2− species, which can interact with a hole to reverse the complex and undergo recombination. Metal ion impurities such as copper(I), iron(II), and cadmium(II) have demonstrated hole-trapping in <b>silver</b> <b>bromide.</b>|$|E
25|$|Impurity {{concentrations}} can {{be controlled}} by crystal growth or direct addition of impurities to the crystal solutions. Although impurities in the <b>silver</b> <b>bromide</b> lattice are necessary to encourage Frenkel defect formation, studies by Hamilton have shown that above a specific concentration of impurities, the numbers of defects of interstitial silver ions and positive kinks reduce sharply by several orders of magnitude. After this point, only silver-ion vacancy defects, which actually increase by several orders of magnitude, are prominent.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, this {{reaction}} {{is used in}} analytical chemistry to confirm the presence of chloride, bromide, or iodide ions can be tested by adding silver nitrate solution. Samples are typically acidified with dilute nitric acid to remove interfering ions, e.g. carbonate ions and sulfide ions. This step avoids confusion of silver sulfide or silver carbonate precipitates with that of silver halides. The color of precipitate varies with the halide: white (silver chloride), pale yellow/cream (<b>silver</b> <b>bromide),</b> yellow (silver iodide). AgBr and especially AgI photo-decompose to the metal, as evidence by a grayish color on exposed samples.|$|E
30|$|The {{deterioration}} of archaeological objects from marine environments {{leads to the}} formation of thick layers of corrosion products and concretions [3]. The mixture of corrosion products frequently separates into two layers. The inner layer extends from the residual metal core to the original surface and does not contain calcareous or seabed materials. The outer layer extends from the original surface out onto the surrounding media. Concretion (a mixture of organic and inorganic calcite and aragonite (CaCO 3)) is often only weakly bonded to the corrosion product layer [3]. In marine silver artefacts, the main corrosion products are silver chloride AgCl, silver sulphide Ag 2 S and mixed <b>silver</b> chloride and <b>bromide</b> AgCl/Br. In aerobic conditions, concretions tend to protect silver artefacts. In anaerobic conditions, the main corrosion product is silver sulphide [3].|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{explore a}} fast and {{sensitive}} method for screening T cell receptor (TCR) biases through comparison of silver staining for {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} and ethidium bromide staining for agarose gel electrophoresis.

40|$|Considering the {{resource}} waste and environmental burden for timber and plastic materials ending up at landfills, this study proposed upcycling wood and plastic waste into value-added wood-plastic composites (WPCs), {{complying with the}} standard requirements of flexural strength, thickness swelling, water absorption and thermal insulation. Biological deterioration {{is a major concern}} of WPCs. Bacterial survival, fungal attack and algal growth of bactericide-treated WPCs were holistically analysed. Melamine resin was adopted for impregnating anti-microbial agents on the surface. All the agents showed excellent bactericidal rate (Escherichia coli), yet poly-diallyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride (PolyDADMAC) and silver had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations. In terms of weight loss and strength reduction due to fungal decay (Coriolus versicolor), PolyDADMAC, <b>silver</b> and cetyltrimethylammonium <b>bromide</b> (CTAB) imparted the highest resistance on the WPCs. Moreover, PolyDADMAC and copper provided the most protection against algal growth (Chlorella vulgaris), and the former presented durable inhibitory effect.

25|$|Ammonia {{can act as}} a ligand in {{transition}} metal complexes. It is a pure σ-donor, {{in the middle of the}} spectrochemical series, and shows intermediate hard-soft behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named ammine in the nomenclature of coordination compounds. Some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper(II) (2+), a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to a solution of copper(II) salts. Tetraamminediaquacopper(II) hydroxide is known as Schweizer's reagent, and has the remarkable ability to dissolve cellulose. Diamminesilver(I) (+) is the active species in Tollens' reagent. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: silver chloride (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, <b>silver</b> <b>bromide</b> (AgBr) is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution, whereas silver iodide (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous ammonia.|$|E
25|$|According {{to the art}} {{historian}} Nicholas Allen, {{the image on the}} shroud was formed by a photographic technique in the 13th century. Allen maintains that techniques already available before the 14th century—e.g., as described in the Book of Optics, which was at just that time translated from Arabic to Latin—were sufficient to produce primitive photographs, and that people familiar with these techniques {{would have been able to}} produce an image as found on the shroud. To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis, in papers published in several science journals, and in a book. <b>Silver</b> <b>bromide</b> is believed by some to have been used for making the Shroud of Turin as it is widely used in photographic films.|$|E

40|$|Short {{nucleotide}} repetitions (STRs) {{are commonly}} used as genetic markers; thus their detection and analysis constitutes a very important tool for the mapping of genetic diseases, {{as well as for}} gathering information about genetic polymorphisms at the population level.

In this work, we analyzed genomic DNA from five individuals affected with type II diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and five controls (unaffected individuals) in order to know the most precise and reproducible technique for the analysis of the existing polymorphism in the STR DG 10 S 478 of the TCF 7 L 2 gene. The combination of PCR with labeling of the products with the CY 5 fluorophore, followed by detection on an ALFexpress sequencer, offered the required resolution to detect the variability in this STR, based solely on size analysis. Our methodology offers similar accuracy and reproducibility at lower costs than existing methods based on the sequencing of PCR products, and is a faster alternative when applied to genotyping studies...|$|R
40|$|Acridine orange is a metachromatic {{intercalator}} {{used extensively}} in histochemistry to differentiate double- from single-stranded (ds, ss) nucleic acid by the emission {{of green and}} red fluorescence, respectively, under ultraviolet light. In the present study we standardised a protocol {{in order to use}} acridine orange to detect rotavirus ds RNA in polyacrylamide gels and compared it to <b>silver</b> and ethidium <b>bromide</b> staining. We demonstrated that the simplest and best condition was attained when gels containing rotavirus ds RNA bands, stained in green, were treated with 4. 3 M acridine orange after electrophoresis and destained with distilled water pH 6 at 37 ◦C. Under this protocol, rotavirus RNA concentration was calculated and the mean minimum amounts of nucleic acid detected by acridine orange, ethidium <b>bromide,</b> and <b>silver</b> staining were 26. 0 ± 4. 29, 15. 6 ± 1. 48 and 1. 06 ± 0. 11 ng, respectively. The comparison of acridine orange sensitivity with ethidium <b>bromide</b> and <b>silver</b> staining, for 25 field strains of rotavirus and one cell-adapted strain (SA 11), demonstrated concurrent results in 80 % of the specimens. Red colour emission resulting from the interaction of acridine orange with ss nucleic acid was also shown by testing denatured 0. 5 kb HindIII digest of lambda phage DNA. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that rotavirus ds RNA could be used for reverse transcription activity, followed by PCR amplification, after acridine orange staining. In conclusion, although acridine orange is less sensitive than ethidium <b>bromide</b> and <b>silver</b> staining, its practicality, low cost, metachromatic properties, and its non-interference on RT-PCR should be considered.

500|$|The {{fourth stage}} {{involved}} remedying {{the problem of}} communicating between the two towers {{during the time of}} Pope Pius X. His plans were to make the Gregorian Tower into a historical tower and to record and carry out observations at the second tower by linking the two towers along the fortified wall with a [...] iron bridge spanning the gap. At the west end of this bridge, a four-inch equatorial was installed on semicircular bastion. The east end of the bridge, above the barracks of the gendarmes, had a heliograph, with a camera attached, used to photograph the Sun (photoheliograph). A new 16-inch visual telescope, called Torre Pio X, was erected in the second tower. As a result of these modifications, the original library was moved to the Pontifical Academy Lincei, and the old meteorological and seismic instruments were shifted to the Valle di Pompei observatory. The new Astronomical Library was housed in two rooms of the building. The two new Repsold machines were used for recording on the astrographic plates. The recorded observations were published along with explanatory notes together with the last two series of the atlas of stars. Charts were printed on <b>silver</b> <b>bromide</b> paper.|$|E
500|$|Dickson and his then lead assistant, Charles Brown, made halting {{progress}} at first. Edison's original idea involved recording pinpoint photographs, 1/32 {{of an inch}} wide, directly on to a cylinder (also {{referred to as a}} [...] "drum"); the cylinder, made of an opaque material for positive images or of glass for negatives, was coated in collodion to provide a photographic base. An audio cylinder would provide synchronized sound, while the rotating images, hardly operatic in scale, were viewed through a microscope-like tube. When tests were made with images expanded to a mere 1/8 of an inch in width, the coarseness of the <b>silver</b> <b>bromide</b> emulsion used on the cylinder became unacceptably apparent. Around June 1889, the lab began working with sensitized celluloid sheets, supplied by John Carbutt, that could be wrapped around the cylinder, providing a far superior base for the recording of photographs. The first film made for the Kinetoscope, and apparently the first motion picture ever produced on photographic film in the United States, may have been shot at this time (there is an unresolved debate over whether it was made in June 1889 or November 1890); known as Monkeyshines, No. 1, it shows an employee of the lab in an apparently tongue-in-cheek display of physical dexterity. Attempts at synchronizing sound were soon left behind, while Dickson would also experiment with disc-based exhibition designs.|$|E
