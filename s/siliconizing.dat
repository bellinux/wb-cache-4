In this work, the experimental design using the Taguchi method is employed to optimize the <b>siliconizing</b> parameters in the pack <b>siliconizing</b> surface hardening process. The <b>siliconizing</b> parameters evaluated are: <b>siliconizing</b> temperature, <b>siliconizing</b> time, silicon potential (ratio of silicon powder to bean pod ash (BPA) nanoparticle) and tempering temperature.

Available knowledge on the <b>siliconizing</b> related parameters, material selection issue, temperature-time dependence and effects on the interface, structure and properties of siliconized substrate were critically reviewed. Critical parameters for the <b>siliconizing</b> process on mild steel substrate by using TSS were established.

30|$|The latest {{development}} in nonwoven barrier fabrics is the <b>siliconized</b> thermally bonded highloft barrier material. The <b>siliconized</b> highloft is {{a blend of}} three different types of <b>siliconized</b> fibers (e.g., Basofil®, Tencel® and Protex®) held together with a low-melt polyester ([Hendermann & Bridges 2006]). Each component of the blend provides a specific and necessary functionality to the barrier material. The <b>siliconized</b> melamine fibers provide a non-shrinking form of carbon, whereas the regenerated cellulosic fiber improves the softness and water repellency of the blend. The regenerated cellulosic fiber is very cost effective and can be used to increase the bulk of the product. <b>Siliconized</b> modacrylic fiber, when used in an appropriate blend ratio, can reduce the local oxygen content within the barrier during a fire, thereby prolonging char oxidation. The low melt polyester provides resiliency to the barrier, and its strong thermoplastic character helps to maintain the structural integrity of the char formed.|$|R

The e-glass fibre woven mat was surface treated by an amine functional coupling agent 3 -Aminopropyletrimethoxysilane (APTMS). The fibres were surface treated by aqueous solution method and thermo assisted to create silinol groups.

40|$|Staphylococcus {{epidermidis}} is {{a frequent}} cause of infection {{associated with the use}} of biomedical devices. Flow cell studies of the interaction between bacteria and surfaces do not generally allow direct comparison of different materials using the same bacterial suspension. The use of a modified Robbins Device (MRD) to compare the adhesion to different surfaces of Staph. epidermidis RP 62 A grown in continuous culture was investigated. Adhesion to glass was compared with <b>siliconized</b> glass, plasma-conditioned glass, titanium, stainless steel and Teflon. Attachment to <b>siliconized</b> glass was also compared with glass under differing ionic strength, and divalent cation concentrations. Both the differences in numbers adhering and changes in adhesion (slope) through the MRD were compared. There was a trend towards higher numbers adhering to the discs at the in-flow end of the MRD than at the outflow end, probably reflecting depletion of adherent bacteria in the interacting stream. Adhesion of Staph. epidermidis RP 62 A to <b>siliconized</b> glass and Teflon was reduced when compared to glass with increasing flow rates. Adhesion to stainless steel was not affected by flow rate and titanium gave a different slope of adhesion through the MRD when compared with glass, suggesting an interaction with different sub-populations within the interacting stream. Differences between <b>siliconized</b> glass and glass at flow rates of 300 ml h− 1 were abolished by the addition of calcium or EDTA and reduced by the addition of magnesium. Increasing ionic strength reduced the statistical significance of the differences between glass and <b>siliconized</b> glass. Pre-conditioning of glass with pooled human plasma reduced adhesion compared with untreated glass and again gave a different slope to glass. The MRD linked to a chemostat can be used to compare directly bacterial adhesion to potential biomaterials. Variable depletion of the interacting stream should be taken into account in the interpretation of results. Divalent cation concentration, substrate properties and flow rate were important determinants of the comparative adhesion of Staph. epidermidis RP 62 A to surfaces...|$|R

The <b>siliconized</b> temperature was 1150 °C and the holding time was 10 h. Both the specimens with <b>siliconized</b> coatings and without coatings were oxidized at 1250 °C for 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 h respectively. The coating possessed a double layer structure with {{the composition of}} (Nb,X) Si 2 (X represents Ti, Cr and Hf), and the outer layer was denser. The major structure in the outer layer was composed of columnar crystals perpendicular to the interface between the coating and the substrate, {{and that in the}} inner layer was mainly composed of equiaxed crystals. A transitional layer about 5 µm thick was found between the coating and the substrate. After oxidation at 1250 °C, the major constituents in the scale were SiO 2 and TiO 2 and the mole ratio of these two phases was about 2 : 1. The thickness of the (Nb,X) Si 2 layer decreased and that of transitional layer increased as the oxidation time prolonged.

40|$|International audienceThe {{transfer}} by wafer-bonding of single-crystalline SiC {{thin films}} to a polycrystalline SiC support {{to obtain a}} “quasi-wafer” is an attractive way for lowering the cost of silicon carbide wafers. Such a process needs high quality polycrystalline substrates, with controlled and high-level bulk properties (thermal conductivity, electrical resistivity) and with very low surface roughness and surface bowing. Currently, polycrystalline SiC wafers which are available are <b>siliconized</b> SiC or CVD processed SiC wafers. <b>Siliconized</b> ceramic wafers are very heterogeneous (mixture of 3 C, 6 H, 15 R and silicon), while CVD ones are of better quality (homogeneous and textured 3 C). However neither the <b>siliconized</b> SiC nor the CVD SiC can be CMP polished with low roughness over large dimension. In this paper, wafers with large and textured grains (> 1 cm) are processed and characterized. The polishing of such structures is studied and optimized to obtain low surface roughness. To meet these requirements high temperature processes used for single crystal growth were selected. Structural investigations performed on the grown ingots showed an important influence of the used seed since no preferential crystallographic orientation was observed during the growth. The final polishing quality was of high level but step heights were observed between grains...|$|R

The infiltration layers’ morphology, compactness degree, microhardness, component and phase structure are analyzed. Moreover, the samples are soaked in the molten zinc bath at 470 ℃ for 26 h, and their corrosion rate is measured. The {{results show that the}} intermetallic compounds (Fe 3 Si, Fe 3 Mo, MoSi 2 and Mo 5 Si 3) with good corrosion resisting property are produced in infiltration layers. The addition of Mo element can promote the penetration of Si element in the infiltration agents, thus increasing the compact density of infiltration layers. The comparative results also prove that the silicon-molybdenumizing layers are more compact, especially for the sample with m(Si) ∶m(Mo) = 2 ∶ 1. Its corrosion rate decreases almost two orders of magnitude compared with that of the substrate, showing better corrosion resisting property. However, the existence of defects (such as holes) in the infiltration layers leads to the decrease of compact density, and the corrosion resisting property in molten zinc is also affected.

Želeli smo ugotoviti količino vpite vode ter s tem vpliv navlaževanja na dimenzijsko stabilnost lesa na različne načine pritrjevanja lesa. Metodi preskušanja sta bili SIST EN 927 - 5 in umetno pospešeno staranje (UPS). Ugotovili smo, da je vijačenje s sprednje strani s silikoniranjem neprimeren način pritrjevanja. Zaradi slabega tesnjenja silikona in povečanega deleža čelnega lesa zaradi izvrtine, je delež vpite vode povečan.

Wetting of {{elements}} of external decks was researched {{with regard to}} their construction. The main goal was to determine the quantity of absorbed water and in this way to assess the influence of wetting on wood dimension stability in regard to fixation. The test methods were the SIST EN 927 - 5 and the artificially accelerated aging. It turned out that the front side screwed together with <b>siliconizing</b> is an inefficient way of fixation. Due to in efficient silicon sealing and an increased portion of the front wood from the borehole, the volume of absorbed water increases.

40|$|The {{aggregation}} method utilizes outbred blastocysts {{which are}} easier to obtain in numbers. The ES cells are intorduced into the developing embryo by the adherance of the cells to a dezonulated 8 cell stage embryo. The embryos are cultured to blastocysts and then transfered into a pseudopregnant hybrid (C 57 X CBA) F 1 recipient. ### Method: **Preparation of the aggregation plate. ** Aggregation {{and culture of the}} embryos with the ES cells is performed in microwells prepared in a plastic tissue culture plate using a darning needle. 1. In a 6 cm petri dish add up to 10 drops of M 16 media (ca. 3 - 4 mm, larger allows too muh turbulence when the palte is moved). - Cover the entire plate with parafin or Dow Corning Fluid 200 (viscosity 50 cs). - Sterilize a darning needle by dipping in ethanol and ignite. Note be very careful not to burn the plastic layer off (ie. don't place in a bunsen burner). Just sterilizing in ethanol is probably sufficient and more"needle friendly". - Press the darning needle through the oil and media into the palstic and make a circular movement with the free end of the needle but DO NOT twist the needle (it scores the sides). The well should be ca. 300 um dia with a smooth wall. *NOTE. In our experience it is critical to make the wells through the oil and media rather than on a dry plate, presumably to make smooth (lubricated) wells. When we made wells on dry plates the embryos always died*. - Make 5 - 6 wells in each drop and then return the plate to the incubator. **Removal of the Zona pellucida from the embryo. ** After recovering 2. 5 day mouse embryos (see Flushing Morula protocol) the zona is removed in acid Tyrode's solution. Acid Tyrode's: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") - Make to 90 ml with Travenol water and dissolve components. Adjust pH to 2. 5 with 5 M HCl and make to 100 ml with Travenol water. Filter sterilize and make aliquots of 1 ml. Store at - 20 °C. - Warm to room temperature before use. - After removing the zona the embryos become extremely sticky and therefore siliconized pipettes are required for handling them. **Siliconizing Capillary Glass** Embryos that have had the zona pellucida (jelly-like outer coating) removed are "sticky" to handle, often getting stuck inside the transfer pipette during handling. This problem is overcome by <b>siliconizing</b> the capillary glass (inside only) before it is used to fashion transfer pipettes. NOTE: This procedure must be carried out wearing gloves in a fume hood! Use a 27 gauge needle and 3 cc syringe (filled) to run a small amount of silicone (Sigmacote) through the inside of a piece of capillary glass, allowing excess Sigmacote to drip into a 10 ml tube. This is repeated with each piece of glass and the glass placed in a measuring cylinder. The excess Sigmacote in the 10 ml tube may be used to refill the syringe when empty. Once 50 - 80 pieces have been siliconized the glass is rinsed no less than eight times with Milli-Q water, shaking the water out of the glass by hand after each rinse. The glass is then rinsed six times with "Travenol" water. The cylinder is then sealed with Parafilm which is punctured several times with a needle to allow evaporation with minimal dust collection. The cylinder is placed in a hot air oven to speed evaporation. Once completely dry, the glass is ready to use. Sigmacote is made by Sigma Chemicals. The catalogue number for Sigmacote is SL- 2 **Dezonulating** 1. Put several drops of M 16 and also acid Tyrodes into a small petri dish (do not mix). - Transfer all of the embryos to one of the drops of M 16. We use Random bred Swiss embryos. - Collect up to 50 embryos (less if unable to handle that no. quickly) with as little media as possible and transfer to a drop of acid Tyrodes, then transfer immediately to a fresh drop of acid Tyrodes. - Agitate the embryos while watching them under the scope. - Transfer the embryos to a drop of M 16 as soon as the zona dissolves. This should take around 90 seconds. - Rinse in a second drop of M 16 immediately and then transfer to the aggregation plate, placing one embryo in each well. Return plate to the incubator. - We include a control of 6 - 8 unmanipulated embryos during the culture period. **Preparation of ES cells for aggregation** We use small clumps of ES cells rather than single ES cells as these are much easier to place in the wells. The cells are harvested essentially as described in "Passaging and Spliting ES cells" except {{that at the end of}} the tyripsinization step they are GENTLY pipetted up and down 6 - 8 times rather than the vigourous motion usually used to create a single cell suspension. This yields clumps of cells of 4 - 12. 1. Aspirate media from the plate, wash with 5 ml PBS and with 5 ml PBS/EGTA. Aspirate and place plate on 37 °C warming tray. - After 2 - 5 min. remove the flask and checl under the dissecting scope. Individual cells should be apparent in the collonies. - Add 1 ml trypsin/EDTA and rock flask back and forward for ca. 1 min. until the cells lift off the plate. Gently pipette the cells up and down with a 1 ml pipette 6 times and then add 1 ml of ES cell media. Wash gently up and down several times. - Add cells to 2 ml of ES cell media to dilute to an appropriate concentration. **Aggregation** 1. Using a pasteur pipette, place a drop of suspended ES cell clumps in a small petri dish. - Under the dissecting scope and using a very narrow siliconized transfer pipette, select clumps of 5 - 10 cells. Transfer one clump to each well and watch to be sure that it comes to rest adjacent to the embryo. Very carefully return the plate to the incubator once all the embryos and wells are filled. - Our embryos take 24 hours to develop to expanded blastocysts at which point they are transfered into psuedopregnant (C 57 X CBA) F 1 mice using a siliconized, flame polished pipette. **Removal of Expanded Blastocysts from Aggregation Wells** Before attempting to remove expanded blastocysts, make sure that the pipette is wide enough. To remove blasts from wells, fill a transfer pipette with M 16 up to the end of the narrow pulled section then position the end over each well and blow the embryos out. Arrange them in groups of 12 for easy collection during transfer...|$|E
40|$|International audienceZinc eluted from <b>siliconized</b> latex (SL) {{increases}} {{resistance of}} to imipenem in vitro. A foreign body peritonitis model {{was used to}} evaluate the activity of imipenem using SL or silicone (S) implants. No differences were observed in mortality, positive blood cultures and tissue bacterial counts between SL and S implants. Implant-associated counts, however, were significantly higher in the SL group. It is concluded that SL decreases the activity of imipenem against...|$|R
40|$|The {{activities}} of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased {{in the presence}} of <b>siliconized</b> latex urinary catheters (SLUCs). This effect was associated with the loss of OprD. The zinc that eluted from SLUCs is responsible for this phenomenon. We have found that zinc exerts a negative effect on the expression of OprD, the porin responsible for carbapenem entry into P. aeruginosa.

This effect dramatically increases volume of drops that are vertically pinned on a flat <b>siliconized</b> substrate. The drop pinning behavior exhibits two regimes: for low protein content in a drop the pinning increases as the contact angle hysteresis increases, and for high protein content the pinning decreases as the surface tension of the protein solution decreases.

40|$|LTHOUGH {{the vitamin}} B 12 and folate {{contents}} of human erythrocytes and leukocytes have been established, {{information regarding the}} content of these vitamins in normal human platelets is lacking. The results of studies to determine these values are presented here. METHODS Preparation of platelets. Venous blood from normal male and female subjects, ages 20 - 40, was mixed (9 : 1) with 1 per cent EDTA in 0. 7 per cent saline in <b>siliconized</b> tubes and centri-fuged at 2500 rpm in a PR- 2 centrifuge for 3 minutes to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Subsequent centrifugations were at 3000 rpm and 4 C. for 30 minutes. A platelet button was obtained by centrifuging the PRP, and the platelets were washed 7 times with one-half the plasma volume of cold. 05 M imidazole-buffered isotonic saline, pH 7. 3, containing 0. 1 per cent EDTA, in <b>siliconized,</b> graduated McNaught tubes. Where necessary, contami-nating red cells were removed during the washings. Vitamin B 12 studies.
