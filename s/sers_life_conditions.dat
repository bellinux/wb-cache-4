40|$|Adverse early <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> have lasting {{effects on}} old-age health and mortality. Exposure to disease, {{nutritional}} deprivation, or adverse socioeconomic <b>conditions</b> early in <b>life,</b> {{as early as}} in the foetal stage, have all been linked to decreased adult health or increased mortality. Evidence suggests that the association between these and other adverse early <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> with later health may be causal. Often, however, the mechanism through which early <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> are linked with later life health is unclear. In particular, it is not well understood whether negative early life insults affect health directly through damage to cells and organs, indirectly through the ability to accumulate human capital, or through yet other pathways. However, {{a thorough understanding of}} the mechanism through which early <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> influence adult health is critical for the development of policy interventions aiming to improve population health by attenuating the impact of adverse early <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> and exposures. The IUSSP Seminar “Pathways to Health: How intermediary <b>life</b> events and <b>conditions</b> mediate or modify the early life effects ” focused on the mechanism through which adverse early <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> influence adult and old-age health and mortality.

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of a cohort’s early <b>life</b> <b>conditions,</b> compared to later period conditions, on adult- and old-age mortality is not known. This paper studies how cohort-level mortality depends on shocks in the cohort’s early and later <b>life</b> (period) <b>conditions.</b> I use cohort’s own mortality {{as a proxy for}} the early <b>life</b> <b>conditions,</b> and define shocks as deviations from trend. Using historical data for five European countries I find that shocks in early <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> are only weakly associated with cohort’s later mortality. This may be because individual-level health is robust to early <b>life</b> <b>conditions,</b> or because at the cohort-level scarring, selection and immunity cancel each other. Shocks in period conditions, measured as deviations from trend in period child mortality, are strongly and positively correlated with mortality at all older ages. The results suggest that at the cohort-level period conditions drive mortality change. Europe, mortality...|$|R

40|$|I {{study how}} shocks in cohort-level early <b>life</b> <b>conditions,</b> as {{represented}} by deviations from trend in mortality before age 5, affect later mortality. I use data for six European countries and find that shocks that increase infant mortality decrease later life expectancy between ages 5 - 30. The effect is strong for England and Wales but small or insignificant for other countries. Shocks that increase mortality at ages 1 - 5 increase life expectancy between ages 5 - 30 and compress the mortality distribution. For both shocks the effects are weak at older ages. These results suggest that early <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> have a transitory effect and potentially only little influence on old-age mortality. cohort effects, early <b>life</b> <b>conditions,</b> mortality...|$|R
40|$|Background Recent {{estimates}} of the number of children and young people with <b>life</b> limiting <b>conditions</b> derived from routine inpatient data are higher than earlier estimates using death record data. Aim To compare routine inpatient data and death records as means of identifying <b>life</b> limiting <b>conditions</b> in children and young people. Design Two national cohorts of children and young people with a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> (primary cohort from England with a comparator cohort from Scotland) were identified using linked routinely collected healthcare and administrative data. Participants 37563 children and young people with a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> in England who died between 1 April 2001 and 30 March 2015 and 2249 children and young people with a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> in Scotland who died between 1 April 2003 and 30 March 2014. Results In England, 16642 (57 %) non-neonatal cohort members had a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> recorded as the underlying cause of death; 3364 (12 %) had a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> -related condition recorded as the underlying cause and 3435 (12 %) had <b>life</b> limiting <b>conditions</b> recorded only among contributing causes. 5651 (19 %) non-neonates and 3443 (41 %) neonates had no indication of a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> recorded in their death records. Similar results were seen in Scotland (overall, 16 % had no indication of <b>life</b> limiting <b>conditions).</b> In both cohorts, the recording of <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> was highest amongst those with haematology or oncology diagnoses and lowest for genitourinary and gastrointestinal diagnoses...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the heights of}} the Brazilian people using anthropometric and economic data from the Pesquisa de Orçamentos Familiares (POF) 2002 - 2003. The literature suggests that height is a good proxy of the physical <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> of the populations. The tabulations of POF microdata indicate that the difference among the heights of 21 and 65 -year-old men is circa 6 centimeters. The same value, by chance, represents the difference on the stature of the poorest and richest quintiles. There are also steady regional differences; in the North and Northeast, the heights are about 2 centimeters lower than the national average, for any cohort. Regression analyses show that proxy variables related to <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> during body growth and regional dummies were statistically significant causes of the variation on the height of individuals. In contrast, color, urban/rural and inequality variables were not significant. The results replicate what the historiography on <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> and stature says: the social environment has {{a significant impact on}} the average height of the populations. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} correlates of maternal acceptance of preschool chil-dren {{in a sample}} of Mexican-American migrant farmworker mothers, including problems in <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> (education, employment, relatives, friends, partnerlspouse, children, health, housing, and finances) and so-cial support (task, emotional, source, satisfaction, accessibility). One hundred Mexican-American mothers of preschoolers who participated in the Texas Migrant Council’s Headstart Program were interviewed with regard to demographic information, social support, and problems in <b>life</b> <b>conditions.</b> The results supported the hypothesis that total social support accounts for more variation in maternal acceptancehejection than prob-lems in <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> alone. Social support accounted for 75 % of the variance in maternal acceptancelrejection of preschool children, and accessibility to support predicted the largest proportion of the variance. The results suggest that it i s important to identify Mexican-American migrant farmworker mothers isolated from social support, since such isolation, in combination with problems in <b>life</b> <b>conditions,</b> places their children at higher risk for maternal rejection. Long-term problematic l i f e conditions have been found to affect parental behavior during the preschool years. These conditions include the qual i ty of the mar i ta l relationship (Belsky 1984; Crouter, Belsky, & Spanier, 1983; Makosky, 1982), unemployment and social isolation (Garbarino & Sher-man, 1983; Zur-Szufiro & Longfellow, 1982), and financial status (Belle, 1982). In particular, ongoing problems in l i f e conditions have been predic-t ive o f maladaptive responses o f mothers t o children.
