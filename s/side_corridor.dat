25|$|<b>Side</b> <b>corridor</b> stock {{such as the}} J6 thirds and F2 {{composites}} had {{doors with}} adjacent quarter lights to all compartments and ventilation was by droplights set into the doors. G1 tea cars had a small dining saloon and kitchen set into {{one end of a}} composite coach. Although there were no external doors to the dining saloon, the windows retained the droplight and quarter light arrangement.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, open stock had a two-window {{arrangement}} whereby each seating bay had two windows side by side. One window was fixed {{and the other}} was a droplight. Restaurant vehicles such as the B2 first class dining car and the B3 third class dining saloon had Stone's pattern ventilators above the fixed windows but this feature was not included in other open stock. The J5 open thirds were unusual in having four doors per side rather than two. The doors had adjacent quarter lights like those on the <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> stock and opened directly into the passenger saloon rather than the end vestibules which only accommodated the lavatories.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "North Atlantic" [...] stock clearly {{belonged to}} Period II but the large picture windows and toplight {{ventilators}} had {{been inspired by}} contemporary Great Western Railway practice. The full set of five coaches {{was made up of}} four types. These were a B4 buffet car, an H3 <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> tricomposite, two J8 <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> thirds and a K3 <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> brake third. The buffet car was [...] long and the others [...] long.|$|E
500|$|Early {{passenger}} services were operated with 4 and 6 wheeled [...] "dogbox" [...] passenger carriage with small compartments and no <b>side</b> <b>corridors.</b> Later years saw {{the provision of}} <b>side</b> <b>corridors</b> to provide access down the train, and onboard toilets. Sleeping carriages was first introduced in 1887, and dining cars from 1908.|$|R
50|$|In March 2013 the new {{activity}} 'A Journey through Space' opened, {{in one of}} the <b>side</b> <b>corridors</b> of the exhibition.|$|R
50|$|For {{stopping}} trains (including the Alton line), 38 two-car units designated 2-BIL were produced; {{these had}} <b>side</b> <b>corridors</b> and lavatories, but no corridor {{connection between the}} coaches. They had one control trailer coach and one motor coach equipped with two 275 hp (205 kW) motors and Metrovick control equipment.|$|R
2500|$|The other variant is the [...] "closed" [...] or [...] "compartment" [...] car, {{in which}} a <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> connects {{individual}} compartments along {{the body of the}} train, each with two rows of seats facing each other.|$|E
2500|$|The Latécoère 440 was {{powered by}} a 650hp (485kW) Hispano-Suiza 12 Nbr upright V-12 engine. [...] Two of its {{radiators}} {{were placed on the}} underside of the lift struts, close to the fuselage, with a third on the port side of the fuselage itself. [...] This allowed a smoothly streamlined nose profile, though the cross-section of the fuselage here and elsewhere was essentially rectangular. [...] The aircraft commander, who was also navigator and bomb aimer was stationed with his bomb sights immediately behind the engine firewall. The pilot's cabin was under the wing, with his windshield at about mid chord; he had a Rhodoid glazed panel in the wing for a better view. [...] The cabin rear was glazed and extended into a deep cut-out in the wing trailing edge to improve upward visibility. [...] It merged into the gunner/radio operator's circular glazed cupola. The three crew positions were linked by a starboard <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> which had an external door at each end. [...] The externally braced tailplane, placed on the top of the fuselage had a swept leading edge and carried split elevators. [...] The fin was nearly triangular but the rudder was deep and rounded. [...] Neither control surface was balanced, but both had trim tabs.|$|E
60|$|Matt Lincoln did {{not stop}} until he reached Temple Court, as that large office-building {{on the corner of}} Nassau and Beekman streets is called. Then he drew a long breath as he took a stand in one corner of a <b>side</b> <b>corridor.</b>|$|E

50|$|From 1892 a new train {{category}} with especially comfortable express coaches appeared: the Durchgangszug or D-Zug (plural: D-Züge). Originally these were trains {{in which one}} could walk right through {{from end to end}} by means of bellows-type corridor connectors between coaches and <b>side</b> <b>corridors</b> or centre aisles within coaches, unlike the hitherto usual compartment coaches with doors {{on each side of the}} compartment, but no access to the next coach.|$|R
60|$|The boy's light burned no {{more after}} that, and Hester was content till a new worry came to trouble her. On {{her way to}} her room late one night, she saw a tall shadow flit {{down one of the}} <b>side</b> <b>corridors</b> that {{branched}} from the main one. For a moment she was startled, but, being a woman of courage, she followed noiselessly, till the shadow seemed to vanish in the gloom of the great hall.|$|R
60|$|Too late {{to worry}} about that. With his {{screwdriver}} he unfastened the plate over the generator and ripped out the wiring in handfuls. The generator came loose and he dragged {{it away from the}} wall. The screen was off, thank God. He managed to carry the generator into a <b>side</b> <b>corridor.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{third floor}} was but dimly lit until the {{professor}} turned on more light. Then {{he turned into}} a little <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> {{at the end of}} which was located a long, narrow room which, during the previous year, had been used by some of the hired help but which was now unoccupied.|$|E
6000|$|Led by the twins, {{the other}} Rovers and their chums {{hurried down the}} <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> to {{where there was a}} red light and a sign, [...] "Fire Escape." [...] Then they threw open a window, and in a moment more stood on the escape mentioned. It was of steel, fairly wide, and ran along past several windows, the second of which belonged to the room {{occupied}} by Stowell.|$|E
50|$|On one <b>side</b> of the <b>corridor</b> {{are fairly}} small {{galleries}} with gold ornaments {{inspired by the}} architecture of the adjoining Fuglsang manor house. These are dedicated to smaller scale works. On the other <b>side</b> of the <b>corridor</b> are larger toplit galleries.|$|R
50|$|The <b>side</b> <b>corridors</b> {{were located}} between the cazuelas and other private chambers, divided into rooms that were rented to families. The stage was located {{opposite}} the entrance gate, behind the dressing rooms. The {{upper part of}} the back wall had three balconies guarded by rails from where the public overlooked the scene. On the right side there was a door for the comedians, which gave access to stage. Under the hardwood floor was the pit, which housed the company and all their belongings.|$|R
50|$|Once {{a fashionable}} {{department}} store-anchored regional shopping mall, in 1997 it was {{converted to a}} power center as the nearby Plaza at West Covina became the dominant area center. It was once anchored by a five story May Company department store, where the Target now stands. Uniquely, the power center is two levels, with parking for the lower level {{on the south side}} of the center and parking for the upper level on the north <b>side.</b> <b>Corridors</b> connect both the upper and lower levels.|$|R
60|$|It {{was like}} a meeting in a <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> of a mansion full of life. The stalwart man was buttoned up in a dark overcoat, and carried an umbrella. His hat, tilted back, {{uncovered}} {{a good deal of}} forehead, which appeared very white in the dusk. In the dark patches of the orbits the eyeballs glimmered piercingly. Long, drooping moustaches, the colour of ripe corn, framed with their points the square block of his shaved chin.|$|E
60|$|Some warning {{instinct}} must at {{that moment}} have struck the woman, for with a stifled cry she disengaged herself from Somers's arm, and dashed rapidly down the hall. Somers, evidently unaware of the cause, stood irresolute for a moment, and then more silently but swiftly disappeared into a <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> as if to intercept her. It was the rapid passage of the Signora that had {{attracted the attention of}} Grace and Rushbrook in the study, and it was the moment after it that Mr. Rushbrook left.|$|E
60|$|He {{slipped from}} the door. The little <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> was as yet empty. For {{a second or}} two he listened intently. There were no {{footsteps}} as yet audible in the main corridor. In half-a-dozen swift strides he reached the door of his own room, turned the handle, and passed inside. Almost immediately there were footsteps in the corridor outside. The bell of the room opposite was answered. Again silence! The seconds grew into minutes, and the minutes passed away. Then his door was suddenly opened from the outside, softly and silently. Winifred Rowan stood there on the threshold of his room, with the handle of the door still in her hand, and to his fancy there was something ominous in the way she looked at him.|$|E
50|$|Briggs {{had been}} murdered in a closed {{compartment}} that had no corridor, so after the train started {{there was no way}} to leave until the next station. Public reaction resulted in the establishment of the communication cord on trains that allowed passengers to contact members of the railway crew, required by the Regulation of Railways Act 1868. It also led to the creation of railway carriages with <b>side</b> <b>corridors,</b> which allowed passengers to move from their compartments while the train was in motion. Old compartment stock was modified by some companies to include circular peep-holes in the partitions.|$|R
5000|$|LTC school {{buildings}} always consist of long central corridors, from which classrooms are constructed on either side. Typically, {{there will be}} a continuous span of classrooms on one side, whilst intervals will be left between clusters of classrooms on the alternate side, to allow for additional exits and natural light to penetrate the corridor. Occasionally, classrooms will only be constructed on a single <b>side.</b> <b>Corridors</b> typically have low ceilings (approximately 3 metres), and capacity for bags (primary schools) or lockers (high schools) to be stored along the walls. A long series of windows provides visual contact with classrooms.|$|R
30|$|The {{pedestrian}} corridor on {{the station}} road side is approximately 16  m long (8  m {{on both sides of}} the middle island) and the opposite station <b>side</b> pedestrian <b>corridor</b> is approximately 14  m long.|$|R
60|$|The eunuch {{wasted no}} time, for this deed, once done, he became--save for some {{insignificant}} monk in Asia Minor, whose fate {{would soon be}} sealed--the only sharer of Theodora's secret, and therefore {{the only person who}} could curb and bend that most imperious nature. Hurrying into the chamber where the visitors were waiting, he gave a sinister signal, only too well known in those iron days. In an instant the black mutes in attendance seized {{the old man and the}} boy, pushing them swiftly down a passage and into a meaner portion of the palace, where the heavy smell of luscious cooking proclaimed the neighbourhood of the kitchens. A <b>side</b> <b>corridor</b> led to a heavily-barred iron door, and this in turn opened upon a steep flight of stone steps, feebly illuminated by the glimmer of wall lamps. At the head and foot stood a mute sentinel like an ebony statue, and below, along the dusky and forbidding passages from which the cells opened, a succession of niches in the wall were each occupied by a similar guardian. The unfortunate visitors were dragged brutally down a number of stone-flagged and dismal corridors until they descended another long stair which led so deeply into the earth that the damp feeling in the heavy air and the drip of water all round showed that they had come down to the level of the sea. Groans and cries, like those of sick animals, from the various grated doors which they passed showed how many there were who spent their whole lives in this humid and poisonous atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|It {{was three}} o'clock in the morning when Deane softly opened the door of his bedroom in the Hotel Universal, and looked up and down the <b>side</b> <b>corridor.</b> There was no one in sight, no sound of any one passing in the main corridor, a few yards away. For several moments he stood and listened intently. Then he moved a few yards to the left, and stopped {{opposite}} another door. He scrutinized the number,--27. It was the number he sought. He felt in his pocket for the keys which he had collected from various sources. One by one he tried them in the lock. In vain! Not one fitted. He tried the handle of the door softly. There was no doubt about it. The door was securely fastened. He recognized at once the failure of his first attempt, and returned to his room. His bed was as yet undisturbed. He had not even changed the tweed travelling suit in which he had journeyed up from Rakney. It was a fool's errand, after all, he thought, on which he had come. Yet somehow or other, after his conversation with Ruby Sinclair, after he had realized how thorough her search would indeed be, how convinced she was that somewhere amongst the effects of the dead man lay the secret of wealth, he had realized more completely than ever before the danger in which he stood. Granted, even, that no suspicion of complicity with Rowan attached to him, his financial ruin would be none the less complete if that paper should ever come into the hands of people who understood its worth. Never had the situation seemed so clear, so dangerous, as that night after he had walked home with the girl and turned his face again toward the sea. Something in the very desolation of the marshes seemed to help thought, perhaps by the absence of any distracting object. There was a sense of breadth about the place. As he walked, with only the murmur of the sea in his ears, he saw things clearly. He saw himself in the prime of life, suddenly flung from the place to which he had climbed, flung down to join all those poor millions of strugglers whose first foot has yet to be planted upon the first rung of the great ladder. He was too old to begin at the beginning. There was no place for him down amongst those on whom failure had already placed her mark. He could not have borne it. To be stripped of his riches, his name, the position of which he was without a doubt proud, to suffer the breaking of his engagement, the downfall of all his ambitions,--the very thought of it was intolerable. And in the deep silence of that night, as he listened to the gurgling of the sea below, and the faint movement of the wind across the level land, he realized, with a sudden pain at his heart, the danger in which he stood. In three days the girl would be there. Scotland Yard would send one of its myrmidons with her. She would have free access to all the dead man's belongings. She would take with her a lawyer. Every scrap of paper the man had possessed, every trifling object, would have its value. The Little Anna Gold-Mine was world famous. There would be no chance of their overlooking a single document bearing such a name.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1980s a {{complete}} rake of 1950s built corridor compartment second class Mk1s (including a BSK) which operated {{exclusively on the}} Glasgow - Stranraer route and connected with the Irish Sea ferries, were painted into a very striking [...] "Sealink" [...] livery of red, blue, and white, and internally the vestibules (but not the main <b>side</b> <b>corridors)</b> were painted bright yellow to match the refurbished EMUs of the period. Being early 50s coaches these had all-timber interiors which lent themselves to painting. Following withdrawal from the Stranraer line {{towards the end of}} the 1980s this rake was used by ScotRail on [...] "Merrymaker" [...] charter services, including long-distance trips on the West Coast Main Line, before eventually being withdrawn completely at the very end of the 1980s.|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanical}} equipment was {{identical to the}} contemporary SNCF BB 36000 Astride: the main frame is constructed of corrosion resistant steel, with 6MJ crash absorbance zones at either end; the locomotive bodywork is of copper plated steel. There are two air conditioned driving cabs, and a central equipment section containing electric and pneumatic equipment, accessed by <b>side</b> <b>corridors.</b> Both primary and secondary suspension are by coil spring with shock absorbers. The transmission system uses a bogie mounted traction motor (one per axle) connected to the wheelset via a hollow shaft drive and flexible coupling, traction forces are tranmissed by low-lying rods connected to the bogie frame. Mechanical braking is by pneumatically operated disc brakes on each axle. The external design {{takes into account the}} minimisation of pressure pulses when passing other trains.|$|R
30|$|Local {{corridor}} contained Dahuang mountain—Tuan mountain—Yunlong mountain corridor, Pan’an lake, Jiuli lake, Woniu Subsidence area corridor.

The development and construction work on both <b>sides</b> of the <b>corridor</b> were restricted. Attention should be paid to purifying water quality and strengthening the ecological restoration on both <b>sides</b> of the <b>corridor.</b>|$|R
