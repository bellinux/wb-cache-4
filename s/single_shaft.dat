5|$|The {{neck of the}} emu is {{pale blue}} and shows through its sparse {{feathers}}. They have grey-brown plumage of shaggy appearance; the shafts and {{the tips of the}} feathers are black. Solar radiation is absorbed by the tips, and the inner plumage insulates the skin. This prevents the birds from overheating, allowing them to be active during the heat of the day. A unique feature of the emu feather is the double rachis emerging from a <b>single</b> <b>shaft.</b> Both of the rachis have the same length, and the texture is variable; the area near the skin is rather furry, but the more distant ends resemble grass. The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male's penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates. The plumage varies in colour due to environmental factors, giving the bird a natural camouflage. Feathers of emus in more arid areas with red soils have a rufous tint while birds residing in damp conditions are generally darker in hue. The juvenile plumage develops at about three months and is blackish finely barred with brown, with the head and neck being especially dark. The facial feathers gradually thin to expose the bluish skin. The adult plumage has developed by about fifteen months.|$|E
25|$|A <b>single</b> <b>shaft</b> {{combined}} cycle plant comprises a gas turbine and a steam turbine driving a common generator. In a multi-shaft {{combined cycle}} plant, each gas turbine and each steam turbine has its own generator. The <b>single</b> <b>shaft</b> design provides slightly less initial cost and slightly better efficiency than if the gas and steam turbines had their own generators. The multi-shaft design enables two or more gas turbines to operate {{in conjunction with a}} single steam turbine, which can be more economical than a number of <b>single</b> <b>shaft</b> units.|$|E
25|$|Her {{design was}} that of a {{standard}} three island merchant freighter, with two coal-fired Hayabara boilers producing 1825 shp, driving a <b>single</b> <b>shaft,</b> with a design speed of 14 knots. In 1932, she was modernized with two Ikegai diesel engines. She was armed with two QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval guns and one 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun.|$|E
50|$|Because these engines {{needed a}} less {{sophisticated}} rocker setup, {{with only a}} <b>single</b> rocker <b>shaft</b> in each head, they were also cheaper and lighter than their Hemi counterparts. In the Chrysler literature, the Poly engines were also called <b>single</b> rocker <b>shaft</b> (SRS), while the Hemi engines were called dual rocker shaft (DRS).|$|R

50|$|Granodiorite is {{most often}} used as crushed stone for road building. It is also used as {{construction}} material, building facade, and paving, and as an ornamental stone. The Rosetta Stone is a stele made from granodiorite. The portico columns of the Pantheon in Rome are formed from <b>single</b> <b>shafts</b> of granodiorite, each 12 metres tall by 1.5 metres in diameter.|$|R
25|$|Located about 7.5km from Welkom, a {{kimberlite}} pipe, {{was discovered}} in 1890 and mined from a <b>single</b> <b>shaft</b> until {{the start of the}} Boer War in 1899. Mining continued after the war until a major aquifer, which was encountered at a depth of 259m, forced the mine to close. It was eventually re-opened by Samada Diamonds Pty Ltd and closed again in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Furness Shipbuilding Co Ltd of Haverton Hill-on-Tees built London Valour in 1956 as an oil tanker. She was {{launched}} on 12 June and completed on 6 December. She was LOF's first steam turbine-driven tanker. She had twin steam turbines producing {{a total of}} 8,200 shaft horsepower between them. They were double reduction-geared onto a <b>single</b> <b>shaft</b> to drive a single screw. The turbines were built by Richardsons Westgarth & Company of Hartlepool, {{which was part of}} the same group as Furness Shipbuilding.|$|E
25|$|Merlin is {{a family}} of rocket engines {{developed}} by SpaceX for use on its Falcon rocket family of launch vehicles. Merlin engines use LOX and RP-1 as propellants in a gas-generator power cycle. The Merlin engine was originally designed for sea recovery and reuse. The injector {{at the heart of}} Merlin is of the pintle type that was first used in the Apollo Program for the lunar module landing engine. Propellants are fed via a <b>single</b> <b>shaft,</b> dual impeller turbo-pump.|$|E

25|$|The {{working gas}} of a Brayton cycle can be helium, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide. The {{high-pressure}} working gas is expanded in a turbine to produce power. The low-pressure warm gas is cooled in an ambient cooler. The low-pressure cold gas is compressed to the high-pressure of the system. Often the turbine and the compressor are mechanically connected through a <b>single</b> <b>shaft.</b> High pressure Brayton cycles {{are expected to}} have a smaller generator footprint compared to lower pressure Rankine cycles. A Brayton cycle heat engine can operate at lower pressure with wider diameter piping. The world's first commercial Brayton cycle solar power module (100kW) was built and demonstrated in Israel's Arava Desert in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and reverse steering shaft and clutch system with a <b>single</b> <b>shaft</b> that spins in one direction, and brakes on the idlers. Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the idler to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both idler sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increasing}} {{tensions in the}} Far East, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, Commander in Chief, US Asiatic Fleet, withdrew Asheville and her sister ship Tulsa to the Philippines. Asheville left Chinese waters {{for the last time}} on 5 July 1941, when she sailed from Amoy for Manila. Unfortunately, the ship's <b>single</b> <b>shaft</b> broke while the ship rode out a typhoon off Swatow. Admiral Hart dispatched Marblehead to bring in the crippled gunboat. The cruiser brought Asheville home on 11 July. Since Admiral Hart had regarded Asheville and Tulsa as having neither the speed with which to run nor the guns with which to fight, he assigned them to the Inshore Patrol based at Manila, where they remained on local patrol duty into December 1941.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the application of multi-criteria optimization to the two-carrier two-speed planetary gear trains. In order to determine mathematical model of multi-criteria optimization, variables, objective functions and conditions should be determined.

25|$|There are {{thirteen}} preserved {{elements of}} the palate of Europasaurus, including the quadrate, pterygoid and ectopterygoid. The quadrates articulate with the palate and braincase bones, {{as well as the}} external skull bones. They are similar in shape to those of Giraffatitan and Camarasaurus, and have well developed articular surfaces. A <b>single</b> <b>shaft</b> is present for a majority of the quadrates length, with a pterygoid wing along the medial side. Pterygoids are the largest of the sauropod palate bones, and it has a triradiate shape, like the postorbitals. An anterior projection contacts the opposite pterygoid, while a lateral wing contacts the ectopterygoid, and a posterior wing supports the quadrate and basipterygoid (a bone that provides connection between the palate and the braincase). The ectopterygoid is a small palate bone, which articulates the central palate bones (pterygoid and palatine) with the maxilla. Ectopterygoids are 'L' shaped, with an anterior process attaching to the maxilla, and a dorsal process that meets the pterygoid.|$|E
