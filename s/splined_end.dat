40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of aeroengines with increasing thrust capabilities requires the {{development of}} shaft technology {{to deal with this}} greater power transmission, whilst still restricting their dimensions and weight. Modern aerospace drive shafts are predominantly of a single-alloy design and significant benefits could be obtained from using a dual alloy shaft, where a high temperature alloy is used at the turbine, i. e. hot, end of the shaft and a high strength alloy is used for the <b>spline</b> <b>end</b> of the shaft, where high strength is required, rather than high temperature performance. Whilst the processes of joining dissimilar materials are widely used the evolution of the joint and its strength characteristics are not fully understood. A program of research has been instigated to lead to an improved understanding of friction welds and their behaviour under monotonic and cyclic loadings with the overall objective to establish confidence in the welding parameters for these material combinations and the associated post-weld heat treatments. This paper presents an overview of the mechanical testing program and the aims of this work, illustrated with some examples from the monotonic and cyclic test work carried out on inertia friction welded dual alloy shaft components...|$|R

Consequences of this important result for the numerical stability of the local interpolation scheme are discussed. A stable algorithm {{for the evaluation of}} polyharmonic spline interpolants is proposed. ...|$|R

For example, a [...] capacity machine can generate gears with a 10 in pitch diameter and usually {{a maximum of}} a 10 in face width. Most hobbing {{machines are}} vertical hobbers, which means the blank is mounted vertically. Horizontal hobbing machines are usually used for cutting longer workpieces; i.e. cutting <b>splines</b> on the <b>end</b> of a shaft.|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} Remez algorithm {{was developed}} for constructing the best polynomial approximations for continuous and discrete functions in an interval. In this paper the classical Remez algorithm is generalised {{to the problem of}} polynomial spline (piece-wise polynomial) approximation with the spline defect equal to the spline degree. Also, the values of the <b>splines</b> in the <b>end</b> points of the approximation interval may be fixed. Polynomial splines combine simplicity of polynomials and flexibility, which allows one to significantly decrease the degree of the corresponding polynomials and oscillations of deviation functions. Therefore polynomial splines are a powerful tool for function and data approximation. The generalisation of the Remez algorithm developed in this research has been tested on several approximation problems. The results of the numerical experiments are presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} complex {{generalization}} of Schoenberg's cardinal <b>splines.</b> To this <b>end,</b> {{we go back}} to the Fourier domain definition of the B-splines and extend it to complex-valued degrees. We show that the resulting complex B-splines are piecewise modulated polynomials, and that they retain most of the important properties of the classical ones: smoothness, recurrence, and two-scale relations, Riesz basis generator, explicit formulae for derivatives, including fractional orders, etc. We also show that they generate multiresolution analyses of L 2 (R) and that they can yield wavelet bases. We characterize the decay of these functions which are no-longer compactly supported when the degree is not an integer. Finally, we prove that the complex B-splines converge to modulated Gaussians as their degree increases, and that they are asymptotically optimally localized in the time–frequency plane in the sense of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} objective {{has been to}} redesign a high speed three stage axial compressor research facility. The new design provides uniform inlet flow to the compressor, a wider operational range at lower speeds, better speed control, and upgrades to the data acquisition system. The compressor used is a research compressor modeling the last three stages of a Rolls-Royce high-pressure compressor. Unlike low speed facilities, the research compressor matches both Reynolds number and Mach number of the engine representative conditions. The compressor {{is powered by a}} 1400 HP AC Motor. The design speed of 5000 rpm is achieved through a 5 : 1 step-up gearbox, and the speed is controlled with a variable frequency drive. ^ The facility redesign included turning the compressor around to provide a clean flow inlet path, not blocked by the driveline components. This required a new rotor shaft designed with a <b>spline</b> at one <b>end.</b> The new inlet design consists of a bellmouth, venturi flow meter, and a long straight duct section to provide an accurate mass flow measurement and a uniform flow. The redesigned throttle and exhaust are located between the gearbox and the compressor, with air exiting the facility through the open doors. ^ The inlet flow measurements show pressure uniformity of ± 0. 15 % deviation from average. The temperature uniformity of ± 4 % deviation from average has been accomplished. Rotational speed control to within 0. 5 rpm is now possible. This has led to the design operating point being established with an uncertainty of 0. 09 % for the total pressure ratio and 0. 73 % for the mass flow measurement. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} been carried out in the {{framework}} of the project GLOWA-Danube (GLObal WAter cycle) where a joint effort is made by several groups to model the interaction of the water cycle and society in the Upper Danube catchment area. In particular regional climate models are used to simulate and eventually predict precipitation in this research area, while other groups convert this information into river runoff estimates and groundwater fluxes. It has been agreed in the project that precipitation data and other meteorological data must be handed over to the hydrological groups with a spatial resolution of 1 km. Long term runs with regional climate models are, however, not feasible at 1 km resolution, because they would exceed available computer resources by far. Therefore, a pragmatic downscaling method for precipitation must be implemented which provides data of 1 km resolution on the basis of model results of fairly coarse resolution. This downscaling uses extensively climatological precipitation observations where such downscaling relations can be derived. These observed rates are then adapted to the model results. The data are provided by the German Weather Service (DWD) and the Austrian Weather Service (ZAMG). The years 1991 - 2000 have been chosen as a reference period for the analysis. The climate simulation is carried out by the mesoscale model MM 5 at a resolution of 45 km. The model MM 5 offers a wide range of parameterizations with respect to convective processes, the boundary layer, cloud microphysics, and the radiation balance, all directly or indirectly responsible for generating precipitation. Sensitivity studies are performed to find the best configuration for the research area and reference period. A variety of methods is tested to generate observed and simulated climatological time series of precipitation. In particular, a linear average, a running average, a Fourier analysis, and spline interpolation are intercompared. In the <b>end,</b> <b>spline</b> interpolation between monthly values showed the best results for both time series and is used as a basis for the downscaling method. The downscaling method has to correct two major discrepancies between the observed precipitation distribution at the 1 km resolution and the simulated distribution at the 45 km resolution. First, these are small scale details related to topography in the rainfall distribution at the 1 km resolution, which lack in the 45 km resolution. Second, there is an unrealistic southward shift of the rainfall maximum at the northern rim of the Alps in the simulations, which needs to be corrected. A specific correction factor is introduced for each problem. The correlation between the spatial distribution of observed and simulated distributions increases after using the correction factors. Due to the climatological relationships, the results time periods of 10 days and longer are superior to those for periods shorter than 10 days. The precipitation distribution depends, of course, on the wind direction in particular so near the Alps. Wind direction and wind speed are simulated by the MM 5 model and combined with the correction factors described above. The correlation between the spatial distribution of observed and simulated precipitation increases more if the wind direction dependent correction factors are introduced. These improved correction factors depend less on climatological relationships and perform therefore better for shorter time periods. Additionally, {{they will be able to}} respond better on changes in the weather regime in future climates. Altogether, this investigation provides a new pragmatic method to downscale model simulations on the basis of observations. This method will be used in the project GLOWA-Danube...|$|R
