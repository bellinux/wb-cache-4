40|$|Seed <b>shattering</b> is {{a common}} problem in early soybean {{production}} system (ESPS) in the Midsouth, which mainly uses maturity group (MG) IV soybeans. Many {{studies have been conducted}} on the genetics of soybean <b>shattering</b> resistance for individual varieties; however, information on the physiology of soybean <b>shattering</b> pattern under specific environmental conditions, which is often critical to soybean growers, is very limited. Field experiments were conducted at Stoneville MS from 2007 to 2009 to investigate the <b>shattering</b> patterns of 80 - 132 MG IV soybean varieties each year. Results from 2007 and 2008 indicated that, when April-planted MG IV soybeans matured in mid- to late August, pods of most soybean varieties did not <b>shatter</b> within the first three weeks after maturity (WAM) and there was no significant <b>shattering</b> effect on final yields. However, differences in pod <b>shattering</b> among the varieties became apparent in the fourth WAM. Late-planted MG IV soybeans, which matured in early September, had a low <b>shattering</b> rate and could hold seeds up to 6 WAM before reaching a critical <b>shattering</b> point. Most soybean varieties planted in April 2009 did not show significant pod <b>shattering</b> {{by the end of the}} fourth WAM. The critical point of <b>shattering</b> was not reached until 6 - 7 WAM. Relatively lower temperatures and abundant rainfall during the late growing season in 2009 may be the main reasons causing delayed <b>shattering</b> in April-planted MG IV soybeans. Results from the May-planting of 2007 and the April-planting of 2009 indicated that soybeans maturing after September have much less problematic <b>shattering.</b> Different weather patterns, especially temperature and rainfall in each year could be essential factors affecting seed <b>shattering</b> patterns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Seed <b>shattering,</b> or shedding, is an {{important}} fitness trait for wild and weedy grasses. U. S. weedy rice (Oryza sativa) is a highly <b>shattering</b> weed, thought to have evolved from non-shattering cultivated ancestors. All U. S. weedy rice individuals examined to date contain a mutation in the sh 4 locus associated with loss of <b>shattering</b> during rice domestication. Weedy individuals also share the <b>shattering</b> trait with wild rice, but not the ancestral <b>shattering</b> mutation at sh 4; thus, how weedy rice reacquired the <b>shattering</b> phenotype is unknown. To establish the morphological basis of the parallel evolution of seed <b>shattering</b> in weedy rice and wild, we examined the abscission layer at the flower-pedicel junction in weedy individuals in comparison with wild and cultivated relatives. Results Consistent with previous work, <b>shattering</b> wild rice individuals possess clear, defined abscission layers at flowering, whereas non-shattering cultivated rice individuals do not. <b>Shattering</b> weedy rice from two separately evolved populations in the U. S. (SH and BHA) show patterns of abscission layer formation and degradation distinct from wild rice. Prior to flowering, the abscission layer has formed in all weedy individuals and by flowering it is already degrading. In contrast, wild O. rufipogon abscission layers have been shown not to degrade until after flowering has occurred. Conclusions Seed <b>shattering</b> in weedy rice involves the formation and degradation of an abscission layer in the flower-pedicel junction, as in wild Oryza, but is a developmentally different process from <b>shattering</b> in wild rice. Weedy rice abscission layers appear to break down earlier than wild abscission layers. The timing of weedy abscission layer degradation suggests that unidentified regulatory genes may {{play a critical role}} in the reacquisition of <b>shattering</b> in weedy rice, and sheds light on the morphological basis of parallel evolution for <b>shattering</b> in weedy and wild rice. </p...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Shatter</b> {{is a type}} of {{cannabis}} concentrate, <b>shatter</b> specifically {{refers to}} a texture of concentrate that breaks and <b>shatters</b> like glass, rather than pulling like taffy. It is created by extracting the cannabinoids, terpenes, and other chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant usually from dried cannabis. <b>Shatter</b> is similar to Live resin, but instead Live resin uses fresh cannabis and is extracted differently than <b>Shatter.</b> A wide variety of solvents can be used for extraction, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, petroleum ether, naphtha, benzene, butane, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and olive oil. <b>Shatter</b> is usually transparent and has an amber glass color. The reason <b>shatter</b> is clear {{has to do with the}} molecules in the cannabis. If this molecules are left undisturbed, they form the glass-like appearance. Heat, moisture, and high terpene content can also affect the texture of the outcome of the extraction, which may turn oils into a runnier substance that resembles sap. Oils with a consistency that falls somewhere between clear <b>shatter</b> and viscous sap is often referred to as [...] "pull-and-snap".|$|R

The player responds to Kaufmann's questions and completes a psychological test, fills in a questionnaire or colors pictures. The player's responses to these tests alters aspects of gameplay in the second setting, including the available areas, the physical appearance and behavior of characters encountered, and the physical appearance of the monsters. <b>Shattered</b> Memories returns to Kaufmann's office periodically throughout the game.|$|E

40|$|A {{yield loss}} caused by pod <b>shattering</b> {{is one of}} the {{obstacles}} to the improvement of soybean productivity in tropical areas. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the resistance of soybean genotypes to pod <b>shattering</b> as affected by agronomical and morphological characters. The field study was conducted in Malang, Indonesia, using 150 soybean genotypes. Data were collected on agronomical traits, the percentage of pod <b>shattering,</b> and pod morphological traits. Identification for <b>shattering</b> resistance was done as per oven dry method. Percentage of pod <b>shattering</b> was ranged from 0 % up to 100 % <b>shattering</b> with a mean of 58. 11 %. Pod <b>shattering</b> was found to be negatively correlated with a number of pod per plant, the thickness of the pod, and Y/Z (seed weight and pod weight ratio). The Identification obtained 66 very highly susceptible genotypes, 19 susceptible genotypes, 19 moderate genotypes, 38 resistant genotypes, and 8 very resistant genotypes. Two of eight very resistant genotypes (G 511 H/Anj//Anj///Anj////Anj- 6 - 11 and G 511 H/Anj//Anj///Anj////Anj- 5 - 4) have high yield, medium maturity day and large seed size.

40|$|Seed <b>shattering</b> in crops {{is a key}} {{domestication}} trait due to {{its relevance}} for seed dispersal, yield, and fundamental questions in evolution (e. g., convergent evolution). Here, we focused on pod <b>shattering</b> in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the most important legume crop for human consuption in the world. With this main aim, we developed a methodological pipeline that comprises a thorough characterization under field conditions, including also the chemical composition and histological analysis of the pod valves. The pipeline was developed {{based on the assumption}} that the <b>shattering</b> trait itself can be treated in principle as a “syndrome” (i. e., a set of correlated different traits) at the pod level. We characterized a population of 267 introgression lines that were developed ad-hoc to study <b>shattering</b> in common bean. Three main objectives were sought: (1) to dissect the <b>shattering</b> trait into its “components,” of level (percentage of <b>shattering</b> pods per plant) and mode (percentage of pods with twisting or non-twisting valves); (2) to test whether <b>shattering</b> is associated to the chemical composition and/or the histological characteristics of the pod valves; and (3) to test the associations between <b>shattering</b> and other plant traits. We can conclude the following: Very high <b>shattering</b> levels can be achieved in different modes; <b>shattering</b> resistance is mainly a qualitative trait; and high <b>shattering</b> levels is correlated with high carbon and lignin contents of the pod valves and with specific histological charaterstics of the ventral sheath and the inner fibrous layer of the pod wall. Our data also suggest that <b>shattering</b> comes with a “cost,” as it is associated with lowpod size, low seed weight per pod, high pod weight, and low seed to pod-valves ratio; indeed, it can be more exaustively described as a syndrome at the pod level. Our work suggests that the valve chemical composition (i. e., carbon and lignin content) can be used for a high troughput phenotyping procedures for <b>shattering</b> phenotyping. Finally, we believe that the application of our pipeline will greatly facilitate comparative studies among legume crops, and gene tagging...|$|R

40|$|Resistance to pod <b>shattering</b> (<b>shatter</b> resistance) is {{a target}} trait for global {{rapeseed}} (canola, Brassica napus L.), improvement programs to minimise grain {{loss in the}} mature standing crop, and during windrowing and mechanical harvest. We describe the genetic basis of natural variation for <b>shatter</b> resistance in B. napus and show that several quantitative trait loci (QTL) control this trait. To identify loci underlying <b>shatter</b> resistance, we used a novel genotyping-by-sequencing approach DArT-Seq. QTL analysis detected a total of 12 significant QTL on chromosomes A 03, A 07, A 09, C 03, C 04, C 06, and C 08; which jointly account for approximately 57 % of the genotypic variation in <b>shatter</b> resistance. Through Genome-Wide Association Studies, we show {{that a large number}} of loci, including those that are involved in <b>shattering</b> in Arabidopsis, account for variation in <b>shatter</b> resistance in diverse B. napus germplasm. Our results indicate that genetic diversity for <b>shatter</b> resistance genes in B. napus is limited; many of the genes that might control this trait were not included during the natural creation of this species, or were not retained during the domestication and selection process. We speculate that valuable diversity for this trait was lost during the natural creation of B. napus. To improve <b>shatter</b> resistance, breeders will need to target the introduction of useful alleles especially from genotypes of other related species of Brassica, such as those that we have identified. 2014 Raman et al...|$|R
