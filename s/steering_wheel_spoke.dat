40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} public debate {{as to whether}} people {{should be allowed to}} use cell phones while driving. In several countries, this debate has led to restrictions on cell phone use while driving. Japanese data suggests that answering a call might be the most dangerous task, followed by dialing. Several questions were therefore selected for further investigation. 1. How does the dialing device and its location affect task time, errors, driving performance, and ratings of workload? 2. How does the location of the display (especially head-up displays) affect those same measures? 3. For various control-display combinations, how are those measures affected by driving workload? The experiment will be comprised of two distinct portions. In the first portion, subjects will drive a simulator on straight roads (implying controlled workload) while dialing a 10 -digit telephone number using 6 device configurations with various displays. During the second test portion, participants will drive a simulator on roads with curves of different radii while entering phone numbers for 3 different device combinations. The following device/location configurations will be examined: (1) 10 -key keypad on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>spoke,</b> (2) 10 -key keypad on the center console, (3) joystick on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>spoke,</b> (4) joystick mounted on the center console, (5) hand held 10 - key keypad, (6) a cross key on the touch screen, and (7) a 10 key keypad on the touch screen. These devices will be used for 3 display conditions: (1) head up display, (2) monitor mounted in the center console, or (3) no display...|$|E

2500|$|MY 1995: Improvements {{made to the}} transaxle, a {{modification}} to the optional remote keyless entry system {{and the addition of}} 'thumb-touch' acceleration and cancel features, placed on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>spokes,</b> to the cruise control. Later 1995 models were produced with sheet metal front fenders, which replaced the composite fenders on earlier models to improve structural integrity. The corporate [...] "Pentastar" [...] logo was replaced by the Chrysler wreath on the grille, horn pad, and various other places (except the keyless entry key fob and keys, which still had the old [...] "Pentastar" [...] logo). Chrysler waited until 1995 for this change on its other models {{with the exception of the}} Cirrus and Sebring, with the Plymouth brand getting a related new logo on all 1996 and later models.

500|$|MY09.5: {{upgrades}} affected models {{ordered from}} 21 October 2008 and produced from November. Instrument cluster illumination was commonised to white. The turn-by-turn navigation and Berlina V8 options were removed. Engine wise, the [...] "premium" [...] {{version of the}} Alloytec V6 was now fitted to the Omega and Berlina, bringing improved fuel consumption and a slight reduction in engine output (see above). A range of safety upgrades were also introduced (see above). Further MY09.5 changes were introduced in March 2009. The space-saver spare wheel were discontinued and replaced by two no-cost options: either a lightweight tyre inflator kit or a full-size spare wheel (previously an extra cost). Sportwagon variants of the Calais V and SS V receive an alloy spare wheel if the full-size spare is chosen, while {{the remainder of the}} line-up receives a steel wheel spare. March also signalled an opportunity for Holden to replace the dark-grey horizontal dashboard strip and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>spokes</b> as used on the SV6, SS and SS V to a matte silver type. The safety improvements made to the Omega sedan from October production onwards were also introduced for the Omega Sportwagon (see above), and the [...] "V-Series" [...] insignia used on SS V and Calais V models was removed, replaced by a single [...] "SS V" [...] or [...] "Calais V" [...] badge.|$|R

5000|$|In 1957, Hindustan Motors, {{to further}} earlier {{collaboration}} with Morris Motors, who by then had become British Motor Corporation after merger with Austin Motors, entered into {{an agreement to}} manufacture 1956 Morris Oxford series III in India. All the tooling was transferred to Uttarpara plant in India. The car was rebadged as Ambassador (later called Mark 1) was launched in mid-1957 and the early model Morris Oxford series II derived Hindustan Landmaster was discontinued. The new model included deep headlamp cowls and small rear wing [...] "tail fins"— all the rage in 1956. The dashboard and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> were completely redesigned. The Landmaster's flat-plane two-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> {{gave way to a}} dished <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with three <b>spokes</b> made-up of four wires per spoke, for the Ambassador. Also a new, dimpled bonnet made its debut. These models had a Austin Motors derived 1476 cc side-valve petrol engine. In 1959 the side-valve engine was replaced by a 1489 cc, 55 bhp overhead-valve BMC B-series petrol engine.|$|R

Other types of vehicles may use the circular design, a butterfly shape, or some other shape. In countries where cars must drive {{on the left side of}} the road, the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is typically on the right side of the car (right-hand drive or RHD); the converse applies in countries where cars drive on the right side of the road (left-hand drive or LHD).|$|R
50|$|The Grand Am {{included}} Strato bucket seats {{upholstered in}} Naugahyde vinyl or corduroy cloth featuring manual recliners and adjustable lumbar supports - both features common on European-style sports/luxury sedans, but unusual for American cars of that time. Also included were an instrument panel from the Pontiac Grand Prix featuring a Rally gauge cluster with fuel, oil, water and volt gauges (a tachometer or fuel economy gauge was optional, and on cars so equipped, the clock {{was moved to}} a space on the lower instrument panel under the radio), three-spoke padded <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with brushed-stainless <b>spokes,</b> and Genuine Crossfire African Mahogany trim on the dash facing, radio and clock surrounds, {{as well as the}} center console between the front seats. Grand Ams also were among the first U.S.-built cars with a turn-signal mounted headlight dimmer switch that had been common on imported cars for decades. Other standard equipment included concealed windshield wipers, a 1.12 in front stabilizer bar, and an in-the-windshield radio antenna. Upscale options included air conditioning, tinted glass, power windows-locks-seat, rear defogger, various sound systems, and tilt-steering-wheel. AM/FM stereo with a tape player was optional.|$|R

50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> A lower <b>steering</b> ratio means that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher {{steering ratio}}, which will make the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is therefore harder to turn.|$|R

50|$|Prior to Nintendo's own Wii <b>Wheel,</b> several {{third-party}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories {{had been}} introduced for the Wii Remote. One released by Ubisoft, the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel,</b> was developed by Thrustmaster. It is bundled with certain games, such as Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT Pro Series. The accessory, which is only for aesthetic/ergonomic enhancement, is meant for driving-style gameplay in which the Wii Remote would be held lengthwise in a two-handed gamepad orientation, steering the subject by tilting the controller. The Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> is also sold separately. Since the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> was revealed, other similarly designed <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories have been produced, including the Wii Racing Wheel by Intec.|$|R
