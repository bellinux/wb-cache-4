40|$|The study {{investigated}} the relationship among three cognitive styles and summarization abilities. Both summarization products and processes were examined. <b>Summarizing</b> products were scored and a canonical correlation analysis was performed to determine their relationship with three cognitive styles. <b>Summarizing</b> processes were examined by videotaping students as they provided think aloud protocols. Their processes were recorded on composing style sheets and analyzed qualitatively. Subjects were sixth-grade students in self-contained classes in a suburban school district. <b>Summarizing</b> products were collected over a two week period in the fall. <b>Summarizing</b> processes were collected over an eight week period {{in the spring of}} the same school year. The results of the <b>summarizing</b> products analysis suggest that cognitive styles are related to summarization abilities. Two canonical correlations among the two variable sets were statistically significant at the. 05 level of significance (. 33 and. 29). The results further suggest that students who are field independent, reflective, and flexible in their attentional style may be more adept at organizing their ideas and using written mechanics while <b>summarizing.</b> Students who are impulsive and constricted in attentional style may exhibit strength in expressing their ideas while <b>summarizing.</b> Results of the <b>summarizing</b> processes analysis suggest that students of one cognitive style combination may exhibit different behaviors while <b>summarizing</b> than those of other cognitive style combinations. Students who are field independent, reflective, and flexible in their attentional style seem to display more mature, interactive behaviors while <b>summarizing</b> than their peers of other cognitive style combinations...|$|R

Reading is useful for language acquisition. Provided that the students more or less understand, what they read, the more they read, the better they get at it One of the techniques used in teaching reading is <b>summarizing.</b> <b>Summarizing</b> is the process of identifying the most salient information. In this technique, the students must make summary using their own language based on the text. The formulation of the research problem were: 1) How is the students’ reading achievement before they are taught using <b>summarizing?</b> 2) How is the students’ reading achievement after they are taught using <b>summarizing?</b> 3) Is there any significant effect before and after they are taught by using <b>summarizing?</b> The purpose of this study were to: 1) find out the students’ reading achievement before they are taught by using <b>summarizing,</b> 2) find out the students’ reading achievement after they are taught by using <b>summarizing,</b> 3) find out the significant effect before and after they are taught by using <b>summarizing</b> on the students’ reading achievement.

5|$|Today, the eliminativist view is {{most closely}} {{associated}} with the philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland, who deny the existence of propositional attitudes (a subclass of intentional states), and with Daniel Dennett, who is generally considered to be an eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness. One way to <b>summarize</b> the difference between the Churchlands's views and Dennett's view is that the Churchlands are eliminativists when it comes to propositional attitudes, but reductionists concerning qualia, while Dennett is an anti-reductionist with respect to propositional attitudes, and an eliminativist concerning qualia.|$|E

50|$|Shape {{analysis}} overcomes {{the problems}} of pointer analysis by using a more flexible naming system for objects. Rather than giving an object the same name throughout a program, objects can change names depending on the program's actions. Sometimes, several distinct objects with different names may be <b>summarized,</b> or merged, so {{that they have the}} same name. Then, when a <b>summarized</b> object is about to be used by the program, it can be materialized—that is, the <b>summarized</b> object is split into two objects with distinct names, one representing a single object and the other representing the remaining <b>summarized</b> objects. The basic heuristic of shape analysis is that objects that are being used by the program are represented using unique materialized objects, while objects not in use are <b>summarized.</b>|$|R
