From a cohort of 336 beginning teachers it was found that temperaments and multiple intelligences are two separate constructs. The differences in patterns of intelligence strengths confirm that each of the four temperaments is distinct from the other. Teachers adopting a Catalyst Temperament have above average <b>strengths</b> <b>in</b> Linguistic, Musical, Interpersonal and Intrapersonal Intelligences. Those with a Stabilizer Temperament display above average <b>strengths</b> <b>in</b> Logical-Mathematical and Interpersonal Intelligences.

5|$|Although {{the economy}} of Moncton was traumatized twice—by the {{collapse}} of the shipbuilding industry in the 1860s and by the closure of the CNR locomotive shops in the 1980s—the city was able to rebound strongly on both occasions. The city adopted the motto Resurgo after its rebirth as a railway town. The city's economy is stable and diversified, primarily based on its traditional transportation, distribution, retailing, and commercial heritage, and supplemented by <b>strength</b> <b>in</b> the educational, health care, financial, information technology, and insurance sectors. The strength of Moncton's economy has received national recognition and the local unemployment rate is consistently less than the national average.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{indicator of}} Chnodomar's numbers is size of forces considered necessary by the Roman government {{to deal with}} the Alamanni threat in Gaul: 40,000 (Julian's 15,000 plus Barbatio's 25,000). Assuming that the Roman military planners would have sought a 2 to 1 superiority to guarantee success, that would imply an Alamannic <b>strength</b> <b>in</b> Alsace of about 20,000. On the basis of these indicators, the midpoint between the recent estimate and Ammianus' figure, 25,000, would seem plausible.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Jeanne was one {{of three}} November hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico; it was the first {{tropical}} cyclone to attain hurricane <b>strength</b> <b>in</b> the Gulf of Mexico during November. The late season storm surprised maritime interests, and two barges broke free from towing vessels. Indirectly, the hurricane produced heavy precipitation that peaked at 23.28inches (591mm) in Key West. Minor beach erosion occurred along the Texas coast, where tides were two to four feet above normal; coastal flooding affected the state, which was heavily impacted by tropical cyclones in August and September. Jeanne caused no deaths.|$|E

5|$|Early World Cups {{were given}} to {{countries}} at meetings of FIFA's congress.

The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.|$|E
