We focus specifically on <b>sand</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in Hole Alaminos Canyon 21 A (AC 21 -A), Hole Green Canyon 955 H (GC 955 -H) and Hole Walker Ridge 313 H (WR 313 -H). Using a new logging-while-drilling directional resistivity tool and a one-dimensional inversion developed by Schlumberger, we resolve the resistivity of the current flowing parallel to the bedding, R‖ and the resistivity of the current flowing perpendicular to the bedding, R⊥. We find the <b>sand</b> <b>reservoir</b> in Hole AC 21 -A to be relatively isotropic, with R‖ and R⊥ values close to 2 Ω m. In contrast, the gas hydrate-bearing <b>sand</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in Holes GC 955 -H and WR 313 -H are highly anisotropic.

There are number of uncertainties associated with porosity permeability transforms such as for example, biasness in the core selection, core to log depth mismatch, permeability up-scaling and geostatical error. Some of them like depth matching and up-scaling can be eliminated but the uncertainty due to biased core selection and statistical uncertainty remains a challenge even in present times. The effects of those uncertainties are even more pronounced in case of low permeabilities in a tight gas <b>sand</b> <b>reservoir</b> environment. An example for a tight gas <b>sand</b> <b>reservoir</b> field from Middle East was {{used for this study}} and it is demonstrated that the general fit to the data significantly underestimates the permeability whereas by using Swanson's mean the predicted permeability is in good agreement with the arithmetic mean of permeability.

40|$|The further {{exploration}} and development of Pabst Gas Field with faulted <b>sand</b> <b>reservoirs</b> require {{an understanding of the}} properties and roles of faults, particularly Low Throw near Vertical Faults (LTNVFs), in gas migration and accumulation at a reservoir scale. This study presents numerical modeling of gas migration and accumulation processes in Pabst Field. Based on studies of the reservoirs, structure, faults, and fluid properties of the field, reservoir scale modeling was performed to determine the gas supply style and the fault properties by means of hundreds of iterations in which the fault properties and gas supply pattern were modified to match the gas distribution obtained from modeling with the gas distribution inferred from seismic data constrained by well data and production data. This study finds that in the main three <b>sand</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of Pabst Field the overlying younger sands cut down into the underlying older sands, so that partial connections between the three sands allow gas communication among the sands. Meanwhile, three fault families break up the three sands into numerous compartments. A primary fault and large synthetic and antithetic faults act as gas migration pathways: the synthetic and antithetic faults are inlets for gas flow and the primary fault is an outlet, and LTNVFs act as barriers to gas flow. Modeling requires fault properties in the field to change while the field is formed. The porosity and permeability of the faults in Pabst Field are 10 % and 0. 1 md, respectively, during gas charging of the <b>sand</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> But when there is no gas charging and large gas columns are maintained, the porosity and permeability of the faults decrease to 6 % and 0. 001 md, respectively. Pabst Field probably has an impulse gas charge history. Fault opening and closing, gas charge and recharge, and replacement of gas by formation water may occur. A combination of stratigraphy, structure, overpressure and gas charge rate control gas migration style, gas charge history, and gas distribution in the field. The significance of the study is that this improved numerical approach for modeling gas migration into and through specifically faulted <b>sand</b> <b>reservoirs</b> fills the gap between basin modeling and production modeling...|$|R

The Dirkala Field {{is located in}} the southern Murta block of Petroleum Exploration Licenses (PELs) 5 and 6 in the southern Cooper and Eromanga Basins of central Australia. Excellent oil production from a single reservoir sandstone in the Jurassic Birkhead Formation in Dirkala 1 had indicated a potentially larger resource than could be mapped volumetrically. The hypothesis that the resource was stratigraphically trapped led to the need to define the fluvial <b>sand</b> <b>reservoir</b> seismically and thereby prepare for future development. A small (16 km 2) 3 -D seismic survey was acquired over the area in December 1992. The project was designed not only to evaluate the limits of the Birkhead sand but also to evaluate the cost efficiency of recording such small 3 -D surveys in the basin. Interpretation of the dataset integrated with seismic modeling and seismic attribute analysis delineated a thin Birkhead fluvial channel <b>sand</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Geological pay mapping matched volumetric estimates from production performance data. Structural mapping showed that Dirkala 1 was optimally placed and that no further development drilling was justifiable.

A critical review of commercial reservoir simulators, used to predict tight <b>sand</b> gas <b>reservoir,</b> revealed that many are poor when used to model fluid flow through tight reservoirs. Conventional simulators ignore altogether or model incorrectly certain phenomena such as, Knudsen diffusion, electro-kinetic effects, ordinary diffusion mechanisms and water vaporization. We studied the effect of Knudsen's number in Klinkenberg's equation and evaluated the effect of different flow regimes on Klinkenberg's parameter b.

We demonstrated the relevance of this, so far ignored effect, in tight <b>sands</b> <b>reservoir</b> modeling. A 2 -D numerical simulator based on equations that capture the above mentioned phenomena was developed.

Also, the capillary pressure difference between gas-source beds and <b>sand</b> <b>reservoirs</b> indicated by the huge difference in vertical permeability (Table  5) also drives gas migrating from mud beds to sandy reservoirs (cf.

Within <b>sand</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> the methane-filled space is initially restricted to the top, but it expands downward when methane is abundant, and the formation water is expelled along the gas–water interface.
