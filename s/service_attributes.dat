5000|$|Although product {{characteristics}} are neither produced nor consumed in isolation, hedonic price models {{assume that the}} price of a product reflects embodied characteristics valued by some implicit or shadow prices. In empirical studies, these implicit characteristic prices are coefficients that relate prices and attributes in a regression model. Hedonic price regression models are estimated using secondary data on prices and attributes of different product or service alternatives. In working with longitudinal data, one adds period-specific dummies and uses their regression coefficients to estimate quality-adjusted price indices. In hedonic regression, independent variables typically include performance-related product and <b>service</b> <b>attributes.</b> Such {{product characteristics}} represent not only value to the user but also resource cost to the producer. It has been demonstrated however that prices in hedonic regression are not determined completely by technical factors and performance-related characteristics. Brand-name and market-segment effects can explain price distortions and premiums that are charged over and above any allowance made for differences in measurable product performance.|$|E
5000|$|Attribute-oriented {{programming}} (@OP) is a program-level marking technique. Programmers can mark program elements (e.g. {{classes and}} methods) {{to indicate that}} they maintain application-specific or domain-specific semantics. For example, some programmers may define a [...] "logging" [...] attribute and associate it with a method to indicate the method should implement a logging function, while other programmers may define a [...] "web service" [...] attribute and associate it with a class to indicate the class should be implemented as a web <b>service.</b> <b>Attributes</b> separate application's core logic (or business logic) from application-specific or domain-specific semantics (e.g. logging and web service functions). By hiding the implementation details of those semantics from program code, attributes increase the level of programming abstraction and reduce programming complexity, resulting in simpler and more readable programs. The program elements associated with attributes are transformed to more detailed programs by a supporting tool (e.g. preprocessor). For example, a preprocessor may insert a logging program into the methods associated with a [...] "logging" [...] attribute.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aims of {{this study}} are twofold: first, it {{attempts}} to investigate <b>service</b> <b>attributes</b> in a hospital front office; and second, to identify strategies to improve those <b>service</b> <b>attributes.</b> Design/methodology/approach: This study used integration of Quality Function Deployment and Kano Model. The research instrument, which takes the SERVQUAL model as its starting point, was developed using a comprehensive set of techniques, including a literature review of relevant topics, interviews and focus group discussions. Using a sample of 140 customers of an international hospital situated in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, 14 <b>service</b> <b>attributes</b> required by customers were identified. The attributes, which were further categorised into 5 attractive, 4 one-dimensional and 5 ‘must-be’ attributes, were analysed using the Kano Model. Findings: Using the integrated QFD and Kano Model, the <b>service</b> <b>attributes</b> needed for improvement were identified. The results are different from those when the company used either SERVQUAL or QFD alone. This study also reveals that benchmarking with competitor might produce misleading results. The results are different when the analysis combined a comprehensive method of QFD and Kano Model.
