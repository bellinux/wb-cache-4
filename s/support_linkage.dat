The disorder is characterised by the incomplete discharge of radioiodide from a primed thyroid following perchlorate challenge. However, the molecular basis of the association between hearing loss and a defect in organification of iodide remains unclear. Pendred {{syndrome is}} inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and has recently been mapped to 7 q 31 coincident with the non-syndromic deafness locus DFNB 4. To define the critical linkage interval for Pendred syndrome we have studied five kindreds, each with members affected by Pendred syndrome. All families <b>support</b> <b>linkage</b> to the chromosome 7 region, defined by the microsatellite markers D 7 S 501 -D 7 S 523. Detailed haplotype analysis refines the Pendred syndrome linkage interval to a region flanked by the marker loci D 7 S 501 and D 7 S 525, separated by a genetic distance estimated to be 2. 5 cM.

40|$|Abstract: The fish early-life stage (FELS) test (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] test {{guideline}} 210) {{is the primary}} test used internationally to estimate chronic fish toxicity in support of ecological risk assessments and chemical management programs. As {{part of an ongoing}} effort to develop efficient and cost-effective alternatives to the FELS test, {{there is a need to}} identify and describe potential adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) relevant to FELS toxicity. To support this endeavor, the authors outline and illustrate an overall strategy for the discovery and annotation of FELS AOPs. Key events represented by major developmental landmarks were organized into a preliminary conceptual model of fish development. Using swim bladder inflation as an example, a weight-of-evidence–based approach was used to <b>support</b> <b>linkage</b> of key molecular initiating events to adverse phenotypic outcomes and reduced young-of-year survival.

The proposed Disease-specific Imaging Probe Profiling (DIPP) database quantitatively archives and presents the gene expression profiles of targets across different diseases, anatomic regions, and subcellular locations, providing an objective reference for selecting imaging probes.

We have previously shown that HLA-DR 4 and DR 11 as well as HLA-DQ* 03 alleles are increased in unrelated AA patients compared with controls. To study whether class II HLA alleles are linked to AA, we investigated 81 extended families that included 192 AA patients, including 89 with AT or AU.

No association to either UC or CD was found in three novel intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DDXL.
