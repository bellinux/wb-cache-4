40|$|A CCD {{technique}} is described which allows long integration periods between readouts together with moderate chopping rates. During each {{phase of a}} differential chopping cycle, one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> images is shifted {{to the center of}} the chip, which is light sensitive. At the same time, the other <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> images is shifted under one of two masked areas which serve as charge-storage sites. Since the vertical shifting between phases can be accomplished in much less time than the typical exposure per phase, there is negligible image smearing. For a given light level and chopping rate the performance of this {{technique is}} limited primarily by the readout noise and the vertical charge transfer inefficiency. If many transfer cycles are required between readouts, the charge transfer inefficiency will diffuse the accumulated charge images along the vertical columns.

The superconducting volume is very small inside the CDW phase and becomes very large instantly when the CDW phase is fully suppressed. The observations can be understood based on the strong q-dependent electron-phonon coupling-induced periodic-lattice-distortion (PLD) mechanism of CDWs. The volume variation of superconductivity implies the emergence of domain walls in the suppressing process of CDWs.

40|$|We {{systematically}} examine all the tight-binding parameters {{pertinent to}} charge transfer along DNA. The π molecular {{structure of the}} four DNA bases (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine) is investigated by using the linear combination of atomic orbitals method with a recently introduced parametrization. The HOMO and LUMO wavefunctions and energies of DNA bases are discussed and then used for calculating the corresponding wavefunctions of the two B-DNA base-pairs (adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine). The obtained HOMO and LUMO energies of the bases are in good agreement with available experimental values. Our results are then used for estimating the complete <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> transfer parameters between neighboring bases and also between successive base-pairs, considering all possible combinations between them, for both electrons and holes. The calculated microscopic quantities {{can be used in}} mesoscopic theoretical models of electron or hole transfer along the DNA double helix, as they provide the necessary parameters for a tight-binding phenomenological description based on the π molecular overlap. We find that usually the hopping parameters for holes are higher in magnitude compared to the ones for electrons, which probably indicates that hole transport along DNA is more favorable than electron transport.

40|$|Abstract-Transport theory {{based on}} the {{relaxation}} time formalism {{has been applied to}} bismuth; the results are used in Part II of this paper to determine the figure of merit of Bi in energy conversion processes. Using the Jones-Shoenberg model for bismuth, analytic expressions have been derived for the electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and for the Hall, Seebeck and Nernst coefficients. The Boltzmann transport equation was solved for the perturbed distribution function using anisotropic relaxation times. The result was then introduced in the transport integrals for the electric current and for energy flux to obtain the phenomenological equations for each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> carriers associated with a given ellipsoid. The contributions of each group of carriers were then added in the common symmetry coordinate system of the crystal to obtain the above-mentioned transport coefficients.

40|$|The {{transition}} metal dichalcogenide (TMD) 1 T-TaS_ 2 exhibits a rich <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> density wave (CDW) orders. Recent investigations suggested that using light or electric field can manipulate the commensurate (C) CDW ground state. Such manipulations {{are considered to}} be determined by the charge carrier doping. Here we simulate by first-principles calculations the carrier doping effect on CCDW in 1 T-TaS_ 2. We investigate the charge doping effects on the electronic structures and phonon instabilities of 1 T structure and analyze the doping induced energy and distortion ratio variations in CCDW structure. We found that both in bulk and monolayer 1 T-TaS_ 2, CCDW is stable upon electron doping, while hole doping can significantly suppress the CCDW, implying different mechanisms of such reported manipulations. Light or positive perpendicular electric field induced hole doping increases the energy of CCDW, so that the system transforms to NCCDW or similar metastable state. On the other hand, even the CCDW distortion is more stable upon in-plain electric field induced electron injection, some accompanied effects can drive the system to cross over the energy barrier from CCDW to nearly commensurate (NC) CDW or similar metastable state. We also estimate that hole doping can introduce potential superconductivity with T_c of 6 ∼ 7 K. Controllable switching of different states such as CCDW/Mott insulating state, metallic state, and even the superconducting state can be realized in 1 T-TaS_ 2, which makes the novel material have very promising applications in the future electronic devices...|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{approach}} for approximating electrostatic charge distributions {{with a small}} number of point charges to optimally represent the original charge distribution. By construction, the proposed optimal point charge approximation (OPCA) retains many of the useful properties of point multipole expansion, including the same far-field asymptotic behavior of the approximate potential. A general framework for numerically computing OPCA, for any given number of approximating charges, is described. We then derive a 2 -charge practical point charge approximation, PPCA, which approximates the 2 -charge OPCA via closed form analytical expressions, and test the PPCA on a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> distributions relevant to biomolecular modeling. We measure the accuracy of the new approximations as the RMS error in the electrostatic potential relative to that produced by the original charge distribution, at a distance 2 x the extent of the charge distribution [...] the mid-field. The error for the 2 -charge PPCA is found to be on average 23 % smaller than that of optimally placed point dipole approximation, and comparable to that of the point quadrupole approximation. The standard deviation in RMS error for the 2 -charge PPCA is 53 % lower than that of the optimal point dipole approximation, and comparable to that of the point quadrupole approximation. We also calculate the 3 -charge OPCA for representing the gas phase quantum mechanical charge distribution of a water molecule. The electrostatic potential calculated by the 3 -charge OPCA for water, in the mid-field (2. 8 Å from the oxygen atom), is on average 33. 3 % more accurate than the potential due to the point multipole expansion up to the octupole order. Compared to a 3 point charge approximation in which the charges are placed on the atom centers, the 3 -charge OPCA is seven times more accurate, by RMS error. The maximum error at the oxygen-Na distance (2. 23 Å) is half that of the point multipole expansion up to the octupole order...|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the master thesis lies on {{developing}} a methodology to analyse the accuracy of toll declarations within a satellite based toll system. This methodology employs two different approaches to determine reasons why Toll Service Providers (TSP) deliver toll declarations that show charge inaccuracies. Both approaches are carried out to analyse {{the results of the}} ARENA project’s field test which was held in April 2010 to test On Board Unit (OBU) solutions for toll collection. In particular, the charge reports of companies that participated in the field test are analysed. An overview of satellite based tolling systems with regards to the design of the associated pricing lists and toll declaration requirements has shown that many differences among the tolling systems in Europe exist. In addition a practical analysis of the available test data is performed. The first approach is to use the delivered raw data from the compliance check reports to create a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> reports. This set of newly created charge reports is then compared to the TSPs’ delivered charge reports and the known true charge report. Significant correlations between the TSP’s charge reports and the newly created ones are identified which lead {{to the conclusion that the}} raw data has been facilitated by the TSP to calculate the fees within the charge reports. The results of the comparison when applying the first approach to the ARENA test data prove that the reason for the inaccuracies does not lie in the wrong calculation of the fees according to the ARENA pricing list but lies within the raw GPS data itself. The second facilitated approach is to visualise the GPS data in ArcGIS in order to analyse the reported trajectories. Therefore the true route, the reported trajectory and data from a reference OBU is used as an input. The results of applying the second approach to the ARENA test results show that inaccuracies were caused by failing to collect GPS data during power outages. Furthermore it is determined that there were data management problems on the TSP side regarding the time stamps of the reported test data...|$|E

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that some integrable spin chains possess a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> quasilocal conserved <b>charges,</b> with the classic example being the spin- 1 / 2 XXZ Heisenberg chain. These charges have been proven to be essential for properly describing stationary states after a quantum quench, and must {{be included in the}} generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We find that similar charges are also necessary for the GGE description of integrable quantum field theories with non-diagonal scattering. A stationary state in a non-diagonal scattering theory is completely specified by fixing the mode-ocuppation density distributions of physical particles, as well auxiliary particles which carry no energy or momentum. We show that the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> conserved <b>charges</b> with integer Lorentz spin, related to the integrability of the model, are unable to fix the distributions of these auxiliary particles, since these charges can only fix kinematical properties of physical particles. The field theory analogs <b>of</b> quasilocal lattice <b>charges</b> are therefore necessary.
