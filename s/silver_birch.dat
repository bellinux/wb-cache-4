5|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>birch</b> {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> are hairless. The leaf base of <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> is usually a right angle to the stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>birch</b> {{is used in}} {{traditional}} medicine as a diuretic and is reputed to be useful {{in the treatment of}} high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, gout, kidney stones, nephritis, cystitis, digestive disturbances and respiratory diseases. For these purposes, a decoction of the bark or leaves is generally used. Externally <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> is used to promote healing, relieve pain and treat inflammations and infections of the skin such as eczema and psoriasis.|$|E

5|$|B. pendula is {{distinguished}} from the related downy birch (B. pubescens, the other common European birch) in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy birch), more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch), and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy birch). It is also distinguished cytologically, <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy birch is tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and downy birch more common on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. <b>Silver</b> <b>birch</b> also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch, which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative vernacular name 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{closely related}} Betula platyphylla in {{northern}} Asia and Betula szechuanica of central Asia are also treated as varieties of <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> by some botanists, as B. pendula var. platyphylla and B. pendula var. szechuanica respectively (see birch classification).|$|E
5|$|The main {{species of}} trees in the woods include English oak, sessile oak, hornbeam, beech, <b>silver</b> <b>birch,</b> wild service tree, aspen, rowan, field maple, crack willow, wild cherry, hazel and holly.|$|E
50|$|The SSSI is ancient {{semi-natural}} woodlands {{with many}} trees which are mature or over-mature, especially pedunculate oaks. There are also many ash {{trees and a}} scattering of <b>silver</b> <b>birches</b> and aspens. The oaks have nationally rare and nationally uncommon beetles, and there are locally rare lichens.|$|R

40|$|Cryptosporella betulae (Gnomoniaceae, Diaporthales) and Pleomassaria siparia (Pleomassariaceae, Pleosporales), {{the first}} both in teleo- and {{anamorphic}} (Disculina betulina), the second {{only in its}} anamorphic stage (Prosthemium betulinum) are recorded {{for the first time}} in Estonia. In summer 2008 first disease symptoms were observed; in summer 2009 C. betulae was identified as a new species and as an obvious pathogen, causing these symptoms on young <b>Silver</b> <b>birches</b> (Betula pendula). At the following winter both anamorphic fungi were found abundantly sporulating on thin branches and twigs, fallen into the snow from mature <b>Silver</b> <b>birches.</b> In May 2010 the teleomorphic C. betulae was first time recorded on the birch leaves, fallen last autumn. Pathogenicity of P. betulinum is still not known. Taxonomic relevance of the fungi together with the possible connection of the findings with the recent meteorological extremities in Estonia is shortly discussed. ...|$|R
5|$|Four {{areas of}} {{woodland}} containing 157 trees has been planted by The Life for a Life Charity {{around the lake}} on the Restaurant side, for the cremated remains of loved ones to be placed beneath them. These forests contain Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), English oak (Quercus robur), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and the <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pendula).|$|E
5|$|The <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> has an open canopy {{which allows}} plenty {{of light to}} reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses and {{flowering}} plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella). Small shrubs that grow {{on the forest floor}} include blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).|$|E
5|$|The <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree that owes its common {{name to the}} white peeling bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often pendulous and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall. The flowers are catkins and the light, winged seed get widely scattered by the wind. The <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> is a hardy tree, a pioneer species, {{and one of the}} first trees to appear on bare or fire-swept land. Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland, the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy. It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber, firewood, tanning, racecourse jumps and brooms. Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes which have been shown to have medicinal properties.|$|E
60|$|Behind {{the house}} was a grove of fir and spruce, a dim, cool place where the winds were fond of purring and where there was always a resinous, woodsy odour. On the further side of it was a thick {{plantation}} of slender <b>silver</b> <b>birches</b> and whispering poplars; and beyond it was Uncle Roger's house.|$|R
60|$|They lurched to the highroad and awoke {{from their}} sun-soaked drowse {{at the sound}} of the clopping hoofs. They paused to look for {{partridges}} in a rim of woods, little woods, very clean and shiny and gay, <b>silver</b> <b>birches</b> and poplars with immaculate green trunks, encircling a lake of sandy bottom, a splashing seclusion demure in the welter of hot prairie.|$|R
30|$|A tending {{treatment}} was simulated {{at the age}} of 7  years. It was first assumed that species other than the planted one are completely removed. Then, other optimizations were conducted in which a mixture of pine, spruce and birch was left to continue growing. Hardwoods other than birch were removed completely. Trees were left in all size classes of the plantation species but smaller classes were thinned more than larger ones. Other species were treated with uniform thinning. As a result, the tending treatment reduced the size variation of seedlings only slightly. The tending of the spruce plantation left 330 pines, 1028 spruces, 330 <b>silver</b> <b>birches</b> and 330 pubescent birches per hectare. In the pine plantation, 1525 pines, 300 spruces, 90 <b>silver</b> <b>birches</b> and 90 pubescent birches were kept. The number of birches was lower because of the adverse effect of a dense birch cover on pine development. This is because birches easily overtop pines, which reduces the productivity of the stand. This was also noted in preliminary simulations.|$|R
5|$|Though park keepers {{featured}} {{that the}} crowd would cause {{damage to the}} park, an official estimate suggested the cost was only around £100 (now £). Park superintendent John Hare reported the most serious damage was to a <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> tree planted the previous year. He praised the concertgoers, many of whom helped clear up after the concert and were awarded with a free Stones LP if they returned a full sack.|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (<b>silver</b> <b>birch),</b> Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (common alder), Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (downy birch)) and Ericaceae.|$|E
5|$|The ruined {{tower of}} St Mary-le-Port church stands {{to the west}} of the park, {{surrounded}} by derelict financial office buildings. Adjoining the ruins of St Peter's church in the middle of the park is a sensory herb garden, and five <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> trees as a memorial to the beaches of the D-Day landings. To the east is a grassy arena, and the partially excavated remains of Bristol Castle with a preserved vaulted chamber. There is also a bandstand and a children's play area.|$|E
25|$|The heath is not {{therefore}} a natural landscape, but a cultural landscape {{created by the}} intervention of man. In order to prevent its semi-open heathland from being repopulated by trees, especially pines and, to a lesser extent, <b>silver</b> <b>birches,</b> which would cause the loss of this millennia-old environment and its many inhabitants, including often very rare animal and plant species, sheep are allowed to graze it regularly; these are almost exclusively the local German moorland sheep, the Heidschnucke.|$|R
50|$|The Bruces also {{oversaw the}} {{planting}} {{of more than}} 1,000 trees across the rural property. Australian natives, especially the Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) found favour with the Bruces, though {{the vast majority of}} the species planted were European ornamentals. The list of species included poplars (Populus canadensis), Monterey Pinepines (Pinus radiata), pencil pines (Athrotaxis cupressoides), pussy willows (Salix discolor), silver spruces (Picea engelmannii), black walnuts (Juglans nigra), golden elms (Sassafras albidum), <b>silver</b> <b>birchs</b> (Betula pendula), quince (Pseudocydonia sinensis) and white oaks (Quercus arizonica).|$|R
50|$|There are two {{public use}} {{islands in the}} area. The Hog's Back is a small rock island which used to exhibit lots of {{religious}} oriented graffiti, but has since been eco-scrubbed and now is a bare rock with a fire pit, near Greer Bay. Anderson's island {{has a population of}} <b>silver</b> <b>birches,</b> along with a cliff-jumping area on the south-east side of the island, and also has religious oriented graffiti carved into the trees and painted onto rocks. Other public access areas exist including a government dock in Wilson's Bay.|$|R
5|$|The {{ruins of}} St Peter's Church are a {{memorial}} to the civilians and auxiliary personnel killed in the aerial bombing of Bristol, and a plaque on its wall lists their names. Adjoining the church is a sensory herb garden and The Normandy Garden of Peace, which was opened on 5 November 1995, with five <b>Silver</b> <b>Birch</b> trees, managed by Bristol's D-Day veterans, {{in memory of the}} five D-Day beaches. There are also memorials for trees for Anne Frank and the victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|This covers {{most of the}} reserve. <b>Silver</b> <b>birch</b> is dominant, with a few crack willow, goat willow, {{some wild}} cherry and {{sycamore}} in the canopy. Shrubs include hawthorn, elder, holly, yew and rowan, with garden escapes like buddleia, Oregon grape, cotoneaster, privet. There are some saplings of pedunculate oak, mostly around the edge, and holm oak. The field layer is mainly thick bramble, with ivy in denser shade. Ferns include male fern, broad buckler fern and the less common lady fern.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{generally}} considered native are the alder (Alnus glutinosa), <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pendula), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), hazel (Corylus avellana), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), beech (Fagus sylvatica), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), aspen (Populus tremula), wild cherry (Prunus avium), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), holm oak (Quercus ilex), oak (Quercus robur), sallow (Salix cinerea), elder (Sambucus nigra), elm (Ulmus spp.) and medlar (Mespilus germanica). Among notable introduced species, the cabbage palm (Cordyline australis) has been planted in coastal areas {{and may be}} seen in many gardens.|$|E
5000|$|This {{oldest of}} Moscow's boulevards {{was laid out}} in 1796 under the {{direction}} of the architect Karin. <b>Silver</b> <b>birches</b> were the first trees to be planted here, but they did not take root, and so for almost 200 years the wind has rustled through the heavy foliage of mighty lime trees. Immediately after it was laid out this picturesque boulevard became a favourite place for high society people to take their walks. It became “a green club” for the Moscow aristocracy because of a great number of lime trees on the boulevard.|$|R

5|$|Betula pendula, {{commonly}} known as <b>silver</b> <b>birch,</b> warty birch or East Asian white birch, is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to Europe and parts of Asia, though in southern Europe it is only found at higher altitudes. Its range extends into Siberia, China and southwest Asia {{in the mountains of}} northern Turkey, the Caucasus and northern Iran. It has been introduced into North America, where it is known as the European white birch, and is considered invasive in some states in the United States and in parts of Canada. The tree can also be found in more temperate regions of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{grows in}} some areas where it is not {{believed}} to be indigenous. It is often found underneath oak and <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> in Hagley Park in central Christchurch, New Zealand, where {{it is likely to}} have been introduced, probably on the roots of container-grown beech, birch, and oak in the mid-19th century—around the time exotic trees began to be planted in the Christchurch area. Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and {{is believed to have been}} introduced with the import of pine trees. It also grows in pine plantations in neighboring Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Ectomycorrhizal, Amanita muscaria forms {{symbiotic}} {{relationships with}} many trees, including pine, spruce, fir, birch, and cedar. Commonly seen under introduced trees, A.muscaria is the fungal {{equivalent of a}} weed in New Zealand, Tasmania and Victoria, forming new associations with southern beech (Nothofagus). The species is also invading a rainforest in Australia, where it may be displacing the native species. It appears to be spreading northwards, with recent reports placing it near Port Macquarie on the New South Wales north coast. It was recorded under <b>silver</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pendula) in Manjimup, Western Australia in 2010. Although it has apparently not spread to eucalypts in Australia, it has been recorded associating with them in Portugal.|$|E
60|$|As for literature, Ben Rusk {{persuaded him}} to try Captain Marryat and Conan Doyle. Carl met Sherlock Holmes in a paper-bound book, during a wait for flocks of mallards on the duck-pass, which was a little temple of <b>silver</b> <b>birches</b> bare with November. He {{crouched}} down in his canvas coat and rubber boots, gun across knees, and read for an hour without moving. As he tramped home, into a vast Minnesota sunset like a furnace of fantastic coals, past the garnet-tinged ice of lakes, he kept his gun cocked and under his elbow, ready for the royal robber who was dogging the personage of Baker Street.|$|R
6000|$|As I strolled {{across the}} moor this {{afternoon}} towards Waverley, I saw Jones was planting out that bare hillside of his with Douglas pines and Scotch firs and new strains of <b>silver</b> <b>birches.</b> They {{will improve the}} landscape. And I thought as I scanned them, [...] "How curious that most people entirely overlook this constant betterment and beautifying of England!

2500|$|The {{square and}} park began to attract upscale residents, and was {{continually}} upgraded, {{with the addition}} of gaslight and curbstones, the laying out of streets around the square [...] which the church laid out, graded and named, but then ceded to the city, the construction of a fence around the park in 1866 to which residents received keys, and extensive landscaping, including gravel paths and flowerbeds, and trees such as [...] catalpas, cottonwoods, horse chestnuts and <b>silver</b> <b>birches.</b> In addition to serving the local residents, the park was used for church events, including annual festivals for children of the parish. During the coldest winters, the park trustees flooded the park to create a large ice skating rink.|$|R
