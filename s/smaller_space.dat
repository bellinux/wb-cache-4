25|$|For a {{transformation}} between finite-dimensional vector spaces, {{this is just}} the difference dim(V) − dim(W), by rank–nullity. This gives an indication of how many solutions or how many constraints one has: if mapping from a larger space to a smaller one, the map may be onto, and thus will have degrees of freedom even without constraints. Conversely, if mapping from a <b>smaller</b> <b>space</b> to a larger one, the map cannot be onto, and thus one will have constraints even without degrees of freedom.|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of plasma display panels and microdischarges, there is great {{interest}} in sustaining plasmas in <b>small</b> <b>spaces.</b> In principle, plasmas in <b>small</b> <b>spaces</b> should scale {{in the same manner}} as plasmas in macroscopic spaces by keeping pd (pressure × dimension) constant. In practice, this is not necessarily the case. In many instances the characteristic size of the plasma is on the order of the Debye length and the surface-to-volume ratio is sufficiently large that surface processes dominate. Following pd scaling also implies that higher pressures are required to facilitate plasmas in <b>small</b> <b>spaces.</b> The high pressure and small dimensions also imply that transients are particularly important. In this paper, the dynamics of plasmas sustained in <b>small</b> <b>spaces</b> will be discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the design processes in contemporary Japanese landscape architecture.

The aim is to investigate if design strategies exist that reveal specific methods in designing for <b>small</b> <b>spaces</b> and to further understand how theses methods are applied in designing for <b>small</b> <b>spaces.</b> Interviews {{as well as a}} specific design task focus on designers’ understanding, perception, and appraisal of design possibilities for <b>small</b> urban <b>spaces</b> through investigation of their design process and work practice. The study reveals that rather than a single approach on designing for <b>small</b> <b>spaces</b> differentiated design strategies are utilized, which consider spatial context, sensory experience and processes and emphasize the understanding of site specific-ness in the design process for these spaces.

25|$|The formal {{definition}} of distributions exhibits {{them as a}} subspace {{of a very large}} space, namely the topological dual of D(U) (or S(Rd) for tempered distributions). It is not immediately clear from the definition how exotic a distribution might be. To answer this question, it is instructive to see distributions built up from a <b>smaller</b> <b>space,</b> namely the space of continuous functions. Roughly, any distribution is locally a (multiple) derivative of a continuous function. A precise version of this result, given below, holds for distributions of compact support, tempered distributions, and general distributions. Generally speaking, no proper subset of the space of distributions contains all continuous functions and is closed under differentiation. This says that distributions are not particularly exotic objects; they are only as complicated as necessary.|$|E
25|$|Transducer {{technologies}} employed much less commonly for headphones include the Heil Air Motion Transformer (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and Plasma-ionisation. The first Heil AMT headphone was marketed by ESS Laboratories and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter {{from one of}} the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only Precide of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models both used a flat sheet of film which limited the maximum volume of air that could be moved. Currently TakeT produce a piezoelectric film headphone which is shaped not unlike an AMT transducer but which like the driver Precide uses for their headphones, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within <b>smaller</b> <b>space</b> constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.|$|E

25|$|Measures {{creating}} uniform wastewater loadings tend {{to reduce}} the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a plug flow reactor model circulating water over surfaces colonized by biofilm, while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a continuous stirred-tank reactor keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. Secondary treatment bioreactors may {{be followed by a}} physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of fixed film secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth activated sludge systems can be operated in a <b>smaller</b> <b>space</b> than fixed-film trickling filter systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, MOSFETs {{are widely}} used in many types of analog {{circuits}} because of their own advantages (zero gate current, high and adjustable output impedance and improved robustness vs. BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter-base). The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes (length and width) of the MOSFETs used. By comparison, in bipolar transistors {{the size of the}} device does not significantly affect its performance. MOSFETs' ideal characteristics regarding gate current (zero) and drain-source offset voltage (zero) also make them nearly ideal switch elements, and also make switched capacitor analog circuits practical. In their linear region, MOSFETs can be used as precision resistors, which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs. In high power circuits, MOSFETs sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from thermal runaway as BJTs do. Also, MOSFETs can be configured to perform as capacitors and gyrator circuits which allow op-amps made from them to appear as inductors, thereby allowing all of the normal analog devices on a chip (except for diodes, which can be made smaller than a MOSFET anyway) to be built entirely out of MOSFETs. This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a silicon chip in a much <b>smaller</b> <b>space</b> and with simpler fabrication techniques. MOSFETS are ideally suited to switch inductive loads because of tolerance to inductive kickback.|$|E

The propellant is intended to be kept at low pressure to minimise stress; a vehicle that is both large and light has an advantage during atmospheric reentry compared to other vehicles due to a low ballistic coefficient.

500|$|For scenes {{showing the}} {{exterior}} of the Nostromo, a [...] landing leg was constructed to give a sense of the ship's size. Ridley Scott was not convinced that it looked large enough, so he had his two young sons and the son of Derek Vanlint (the film's cinematographer) stand in for the regular actors, wearing <b>smaller</b> <b>space</b> suits to make the set-pieces seem larger. The same technique was used for the scene in which the crew members encounter the dead alien creature in the derelict spacecraft. The children nearly collapsed due to the heat of the suits; oxygen systems were eventually added to help the actors breathe. Four identical cats were used to portray Jones, the crew's pet. During filming, Sigourney Weaver discovered that she was allergic to the combination of cat hair and the glycerin placed on the actors' skin to make them appear sweaty. By removing the glycerin she was able to continue working with the cats.|$|E
500|$|The South Park Blocks, {{especially}} near Portland State University, {{have been}} home to protests and marches. A workers' rights protest on May 1, 2000, organized by the May Day Coalition, gathered 300–400 people. Police chief Mark Kroeker said 19 people, some [...] "dressed like anarchists and (carrying) gas masks" [...] were arrested, and Portland Police used bean bag rounds, with fears of repeating the 1999 WTO riots in Seattle unless sufficient force was shown early. The police declared emergency at 3:45pm after a lit newspaper box was thrown at officers, then the police corralled the marchers into a <b>smaller</b> <b>space</b> with mounted officers and ordered them to disperse.

Various characters were included at the suggestion of editor Mark Helfrich, who brought Marvel's X-Men Encyclopedia to director Brett Ratner, searching for mutants who could make appearance. Mark Helfrich portrays an unnamed mutant with ash-gray skin. These include Phat, a mutant that is a very large man who can slim down to fit in a <b>smaller</b> <b>space</b> (played by two actors, Via Saleaumua – [...] "large mode" [...] – and Richard Yee – [...] "small mode"); Spike (played by Lance Gibson), a mutant who battles Wolverine in the forest by extruding bony spikes from his flesh – the character was added because the editing team felt that the original cut of the scene portrayed Logan as a cold-blooded killer, which could be changed if another mutant attacked Wolverine before he struck the Brotherhood and Glob Herman (played by Clayton Dean Watmough), a mutant with transparent skin. Various other mutants make cameos at the X-Mansion; Shauna Kain and Kea Wong reprised their cameo roles as Siryn and Jubilee respectively, and three identical girls in the background in one scene are a reference to the Stepford Cuckoos. Olivia Williams portrays Moira MacTaggert. X-Men co-creator Stan Lee and writer Chris Claremont have cameos in the film's opening scene as the neighbors of young Jean Grey. The sergeant directing defensive preparations before the Brotherhood assaults Alcatraz Island is played by R. Lee Ermey. Lloyd Adams portrays the green-skinned mutant that climbs the guard tower on Alcatraz. Many fans believed this was Toad however, the credits list him as lizard man and Brett Ratner confirmed it was Anole.
