5|$|Along with rapid promotion, the war also noticeably {{lowered the}} age of {{battalion}} commanding officers. In 1914, they were aged over 50, while the average age for a battalion commanding officer in the BEF between 1917 and 1918 was 28. By this stage, it was official policy that men over 35 were no longer eligible to command battalions. This trend was reflected amongst the junior officers. Anthony Eden was the Adjutant of a battalion when aged 18, and served as the Brigade Major in the 198th Brigade while <b>still</b> <b>only</b> aged 20.|$|E

5|$|Rugby turned {{professional}} in late 1995, and in 1996 the Canterbury Crusaders (now called the Crusaders) franchise was established. Hammett became {{a founding member}} of the side, which struggled in the inaugural Super 12, finishing in last place. The 1997 season went better for Hammett; the Crusaders finished sixth, and the Canterbury provincial team won the National Provincial Championship (NPC) after beating Counties in the final. Although Hammett was receiving more and more game time, he <b>still</b> <b>only</b> participated in the NPC final as a replacement.|$|E

Chamberlain also won his first field goal percentage title, and set the all-time record for rebounds in a single game with 55. Chamberlain was so dominant on the team that he scored almost 32% of his team's points and collected 30.4% of their rebounds.|$|E
5|$|A {{more ambitious}} plan by Butlin was thought up {{on a trip}} to the Bahamas in 1946. Seeing {{potential}} for a camp in warmer climes, he formed a company under the chairmanship of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama. Butlin also purchased the Princess hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau. The camp was intended to be complete and open on New Years Day of 1950. After an investment of US$5 million (2011:£) the camp opened, <b>still</b> <b>only</b> partially complete, in the winter of 1949. To celebrate its opening, Butlin ran a mystery flight, where guests, who had paid $129 (2011:£) each, were taken on a flight to the resort without being informed in advance.|$|E
5|$|A son of King Harald Hardrada, Magnus was in 1058 {{appointed}} nominal {{leader of}} an expedition into the Irish Sea while <b>still</b> <b>only</b> a child. He {{appears to have}} assisted Welsh ruler Gruffydd ap Llywelyn and Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia in their struggles against the English, although his primary objective may have been to assert control over Orkney. He later accompanied his father in Harald's campaign against Denmark in 1062, and was appointed regent and made king before Harald's fatal invasion of England in 1066. Magnus briefly ruled Norway alone thereafter, until his younger brother Olaf returned from England in 1067.|$|E

5|$|According {{to damage}} surveys, 13 of the country's islands {{sustained}} damage; 470 homes and 6 schools were destroyed and hundreds more damaged. Damage throughout Tonga amounted to 104.2million paʻanga ($51.3million USD). In addition to infrastructural and public damage, the environment sustained catastrophic losses on Tonga. The Insular Flying Fox (Pteropus tonganus), a native species of bat, suffered great losses from Waka. Compared to pre-cyclone population levels, 79.8% (±9.9%) {{of the species}} was killed across six islands. This was due to widespread destruction of their natural food source, which decreased by 85% (±11.8%) following Waka. Trees across Vava'u were completely defoliated, although only 6.6% were killed, leaving no food for the bats. The greatest decline in bats was on Utula'aina Island at 95.7%; A'a Island sustained a complete loss of food-bearing plants. Six months after the storm, the bat population in Vava'u was <b>still</b> <b>only</b> 20% of the pre-storm level.|$|E
5|$|After the Pearl Harbor attack, Taylor was {{assigned}} to the 44th Fighter Squadron, and went to the South Pacific at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. He was able to record two additional aerial kills: the first on January 27 and the other on December 7, 1943, two years after Pearl Harbor. This brought his total number of career kills to six, making him a flying ace. Officially however, Taylor is <b>still</b> <b>only</b> credited with two aerial victories on December 7, 1941 and one on January 27, 1943. At Guadalcanal, he was injured during an air raid and was sent back to the United States in 1943. In the U.S., he trained pilots in preparation of combat in Europe and was then assigned to the 12th Pursuit Squadron. At the end of World War II, Taylor had reached the rank of major and went to the Philippines to command a squadron that used the first United States Air Force combat jets, the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star.|$|E
5|$|At its widest aperture, the {{sharpness}} {{does not}} meet the 1800 threshold at either 8mm (1572, f/4.5) or 12mm (1356, f/5), but at 16mm (f/5.6) it achieves over 2000 lines per picture height. However, stopping down improves the sharpness at all focal lengths, according to PC Magazine. At 8mm, 1800 is reached at f/8, while at 12mm it is <b>still</b> <b>only</b> at 1509 by f/8. The image quality is asymmetric with better performance on the right side. At 8mm and f/4.5, it has 1 blur unit in the center and 1.5 in the corners. Although the images are slightly sharper at f/5.6, SLR Gear claims sharpness declines significantly at f/11 to almost 2 blur units with further stopping down increasing blur to 3.5 at f/22. At the longer focal lengths for this lens, stopping down to f/29 yields a 5 blur unit result.|$|E

5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, {{though he had}} not yet {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's body had been found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if he could find the killer—years later, he <b>still</b> <b>only</b> has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize it is impossible to sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a dark room.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{has long}} been {{suspected}} to be slightly variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than both Rigel and Vega, which are also slightly variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, but it is <b>still</b> <b>only</b> listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it {{is located in the}} Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.|$|E
5|$|Edwards's fortifications {{were tested}} in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn rebelled against English rule, the first major insurrection since the conquest. The Welsh appear to have risen up over the {{introduction}} of taxation, and Madog had considerable popular support. By {{the end of the}} year, Edward had returned to Wales with a large army and marched west from Chester, reaching his castle at Conwy by Christmas. Here he was trapped and besieged until January 1295, supplied only by sea, before forces arrived to relieve him in February. Harlech was also besieged but was saved from defeat by the arrival of supplies by sea from Ireland. Caernarfon, however, was <b>still</b> <b>only</b> partially completed and was stormed by Welsh forces and the castle and town set alight. In Anglesey, Welsh forces killed the royal sheriff. In the spring Edward pressed home his counterattack with a force of 35,000 soldiers, putting down the uprising and killing Madog.|$|E
