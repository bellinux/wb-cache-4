25|$|CBS Evening News is the {{flagship}} evening television news program of CBS News, the news {{division of the}} CBS television network in the United States.

25|$|On May 30, 2017, reports {{surfaced}} {{confirming that}} <b>Scott</b> <b>Pelley</b> had been relieved of his anchor and editor duties at CBS Evening News.

The move was made official a day later on May 31 and Anthony Mason was named interim anchor of the program. On June 6, CBS Evening News announced on Twitter that Pelley would anchor until June 16, 2017. Anthony Mason became interim anchor effective June 19.|$|E
25|$|On March 10, 2005, Rather was succeeded on {{an interim}} basis by Face the Nation host and CBS News {{correspondent}} Bob Schieffer.

Under Rather in the {{years leading up to}} his retirement, the CBS Evening News trailed its rivals at ABC and NBC by a fairly large margin. White House correspondent John Roberts, and <b>Scott</b> <b>Pelley,</b> his predecessor in that position, were often mentioned as possible successors to Rather when he retired.

25|$|On March 30, 2014, 60 Minutes {{presented}} {{a story on}} the Tesla Model S luxury electric automobile in a segment, with <b>Scott</b> <b>Pelley</b> conducting an interview with CEO Elon Musk concerning the car brand as well as his SpaceX company. Within a day, the automotive blog site Jalopnik reported that the sounds accompanying footage of the car shown during the story were actually sounds from a traditional gasoline engine dubbed over the footage, when in reality the electric car is much quieter. CBS released a statement explaining that the sound was the result of an audio editing error, and subsequently removed the noise from the online version of the piece. However, several news outlets, as well as Jalopnik itself, have expressed doubt over the authenticity of this explanation, noting the similar scandal involving Tesla Motors and The New York Times in 2013.|$|E
