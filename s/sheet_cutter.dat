50|$|By 1942, Morris {{was doing}} well enough to open a {{corrugated}} box plant and to buy another Baltimore enterprise, the King Folding Box Co., where he installed a corrugated <b>sheet</b> <b>cutter.</b> Morris sold corrugated partitions to major glass companies, which needed them to separate the bottles and glasses they shipped. The following year {{the name of his}} enterprise was changed to Newth Morris Box Company. In 1944, another branch was opened in Jacksonville, Florida, where the company produced cardboard anti-radar devices for World War II American troops and popcorn boxes for movie theater owners. Following Morris's purchase of Rock City Box Co. that same year, he changed the name of Newth Morris Box Co. to Rock City Box Sales Company.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} Monday, Marsha {{is having}} a discussion with her friend Sheila Klein about Bill, a man that Marsha slept with the previous night. When the package arrives at the door, the two struggle to open the box while Waldo waits excitedly inside. Unable to open the box by other means and frustrated, Marsha retrieves a <b>sheet</b> metal <b>cutter</b> from her basement and gives it to Sheila, who stabs straight through the box as well as Waldo's head.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, {{the company}} changed the product name {{to its current}} {{designation}} of [...] "Barnum's Animals Crackers". In 1958, production methods changed to improve the cookies' visual details. Until then, animal shapes were stamped out of a dough <b>sheet</b> by a <b>cutter.</b> This produced outlines with little sophistication. By installing rotary dies, bakers can actually engrave details onto each cookie, creating a more intricate design. The rotary dies are still used today.|$|R
5000|$|Cookie cutting sheet: Used {{for larger}} volumes, a {{production}} cookie cutting sheet {{is a piece}} of study plastic the size of a full sheet pan that essentially has dozens of cutout cookie cutters mounted on to it. [...] Rather than rolling out the dough and pressing the cutter into the top of the dough, the cutting sheet is placed of the baking sheet, cutting side up. A sheet of cookie dough, already rolled to the correct thickness, is laid on top of the cutting sheet, and a rolling pin is used to press the dough down on to the sharp edges of the cutting sheet. The cut cookies fall through the holes into the sheet, into their properly spaced positions on the baking sheet. The scrap dough and cutting sheet are removed, and the pan is ready for baking. Cookie <b>cutter</b> <b>sheets</b> allow high volume production without the time or risk of moving cut cookies to baking sheets, resulting in rapid production of a more uniformly shaped and spaced product.|$|R
