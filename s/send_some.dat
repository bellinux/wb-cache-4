5|$|As {{evident in}} his {{imperial}} edicts, the Hongwu Emperor {{was well aware of}} the Buddhist link between Tibet and China and wanted to foster it. Rolpe Dorje, 4th Karmapa Lama (1340–1383) rejected the Hongwu Emperor's invitation, although he did <b>send</b> <b>some</b> disciples as envoys to the court in Nanjing. The Hongwu Emperor also entrusted his guru Zongluo, one of many Buddhist monks at court, to head a religious mission into Tibet in 1378–1382 in order to obtain Buddhist texts.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that foreign}} support would be {{necessary}} for {{the continued existence of}} the United Belgian States, the Statists tried to make contact with foreign powers they believed to be sympathetic. Despite numerous attempts, however, the revolution failed to gain foreign support. The Dutch were not interested and, although the Prussian king, Frederick William II, was sympathetic and did <b>send</b> <b>some</b> troops to aid the revolutionaries in July, Prussia was also forced to withdraw its forces under combined Austrian and British pressure.|$|E

5|$|Lord Herbert {{left the}} castle {{to join the}} {{campaign}} against Parliament, returning at intervals to acquire more funds for the war. Charles I himself visited the castle twice, first in June 1645 after the battle of Naseby and again in 1646, when he enjoyed playing bowls on the castle's green. The Royalist cause was now close to military collapse, and the Marquess started to <b>send</b> <b>some</b> valuables, including the oak panelling from the parlour, some plaster ceiling and many pictures, to his brother at nearby Troy House for safe-keeping. Lord Herbert was captured in Ireland, and an attack on Raglan itself appeared imminent.|$|E

25|$|Although these {{troubles}} were {{continuing to}} trouble John in Rome, {{he was still}} able to participate and influence broader ecclesiastical and political questions across Europe.

25|$|Colonization: The Assyrians, in {{conjunction}} with their deportation (see below) would also <b>send</b> <b>some</b> of their own into foreign lands and settle them as colonists. The primary aim was to establish a loyal power base; taxes, food and troops could be raised here as reliably as at their homeland, {{or at least it}} must have been hoped. Furthermore, their presence would bring innumerable benefits; resistance to other conquerors, a counter to any rebellions by the natives and assist the provincial Assyrian governors in ensuring that the vassal state was loyal to Assyria.|$|E
25|$|That evening, the Wehrmacht {{launched}} a massive aerial and artillery barrage of Paris in revenge, leaving several thousand dead or injured.

25|$|The {{negotiations}} {{have been}} split along a developing-country/developed-country divide.

Developed countries wanted to study S provisions, <b>send</b> <b>some</b> proposals to negotiating groups, and leave deadlines open. Developing countries claimed that the developed countries were not negotiating in good faith, while developed countries argued that the developing countries were unreasonable in their proposals. At the December 2005 Hong Kong ministerial, members agreed to five S provisions for least developed countries (LDCs), including the duty-free and quota-free access.|$|E

25|$|Besides these routes, {{there are}} tractor routes along the {{climbing}} routes. These tractor routes {{are used to}} bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take {{up most of the}} width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks {{from the side of the}} path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may <b>send</b> <b>some</b> rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.|$|E
