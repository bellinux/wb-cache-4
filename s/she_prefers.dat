5|$|Unko is {{the student}} council {{president}} at Shimoshina. She is an intelligent and athletic girl. Although {{her name is}} actually Sadako, this reminds her of the horror character Sadako, so <b>she</b> <b>prefers</b> to use Unko because she is afraid of ghosts.|$|E

In her spare time she enjoys shopping, playing with her children, and {{browsing}} the internet; she has stated that she finds {{it increasingly difficult to}} enjoy shopping due to being constantly recognised.

5|$|Critics {{also note}} the {{entertaining}} {{methods used to}} drive the plot. When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that <b>she</b> <b>prefers</b> to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.|$|E
25|$|Delany, in 2003, tried {{having an}} {{injection}} of botox in her forehead, but the needle hit a nerve {{and created a}} bruise which affected the muscle in her right eye, causing it to droop slightly. In 2010, she vowed {{she would never have}} plastic surgery. She told Prevention in 2010 that <b>she</b> <b>prefers</b> eating healthily, including vegetables, tofu, fish, gluten-free pasta, and bread.|$|E

Her special talent is writing, and she chronicles the main aspects of her life in various personal diaries. <b>She</b> <b>prefers</b> being called Mia, although her best friend, Lilly Moscovitz often calls her BL (Baby Licker), POG (Princess Of Genovia), or PIT (Princess In Training).|$|E
25|$|In 1969 Brel {{appeared}} in his third film, Mon oncle Benjamin (My uncle Benjamin), directed by Édouard Molinaro and co-starring Claude Jade and Bernard Blier. He also produced the soundtrack.

25|$|Mysteriously, {{this work}} was a fresco of her father's Cluj University, which Rădulescu may not have {{attended}} at all, to {{the backdrop of the}} Great Depression and political convulsions. Such details renewed speculation that Marta was signing works penned by Dan Rădulescu. The student-narrator takes part in the strike of 1932, where she meets recruiters for both the Romanian Communist Party and the fascist Iron Guard (including a glimpse of the agitator Bănică Dobre). The autofictional Rădulescu informs the reader that <b>she</b> <b>prefers</b> the Guard, but attends meetings of the far-left, during which communist activists imply that the difference between them and the fascists is a minor one.|$|E

25|$|Hathaway {{studied at}} the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, {{and was the first}} {{teenager}} admitted into The Barrow Group Theater Company's acting program. Between 1998 and 1999, she sang soprano with the All-Eastern U.S. High School Honors Chorus at Carnegie Hall and in plays at Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey. She is a trained stage actress and stated to The Associated Press that <b>she</b> <b>prefers</b> performing on stage to film roles. At the start of her film career, Hathaway's acting style and beauty has been compared to the likes of Judy Garland and Audrey Hepburn. She cites Garland as one of her favorite actresses and Meryl Streep as her idol.|$|E
25|$|Pupils {{must pass}} an 11-plus {{entrance}} exam {{to get into}} the school. The King Edward Schools are academic powerhouses and therefore fiercely competitive to get admission. The entrance examination is tough and only 1 in 10 are successful.The King Edward VI Foundation holds its exams at the same time, and generally a candidate will sit one exam for multiple schools within the foundation. Formerly 155 were selected from each year, from more than 1,500 candidates; with a few more accepted every year on appeal. From September 2014 the school increased its intake to 180 pupils in Year 7. A pupil has the opportunity to list the Foundation schools that he or <b>she</b> <b>prefers,</b> and depending on the results, may get allocated into one of the schools.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{populate}} the film with many characters, {{as in his}} previous films, here the story focuses on the compelling relationship at its center: the actress and her kidnapper literally struggling for power and desperate for love. The film's title line Tie Me Up! is unexpectedly uttered by the actress as a genuine request. She does not know if she will try to escape or not, and when she realizes she has feelings for her captor, <b>she</b> <b>prefers</b> not {{to be given a}} chance. In spite of some dark elements, Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! can be described as a romantic comedy, and the director's most clear love story, with a plot similar to William Wyler's thriller The Collector.|$|E

25|$|Kvitová {{uses the}} {{pinpoint}} service stance {{and is known}} for her fast and well-placed serves. As a left-handed player, she executes the shot well by serving out wide away from her opponent, especially on the advantage-side of the court to her opponent's backhand, and then coming forward to finish off the point with a winner down the line. She is also noted for her exceptional timing. On forehands, <b>she</b> <b>prefers</b> to take the ball early, thus allowing her to produce down-the-line winners effectively. On backhands, she utilises all the important muscle groups to produce shots with exceptional amount of power. When returning, she uses a short compact motion which allows her to return aggressively regardless of the serve speed. She is also known to attack weak second serves by producing powerful winners.|$|E
25|$|Chibiusa's {{affections}} {{come into}} conflict. Despite being self-aware {{of the fact}} that Usagi Tsukino and Mamoru Chiba are her biological parents, she does not immediately identify them as such, instead suspiciously viewing them as strangers who look like them. There is evidence that Chibiusa has a hard time identifying Usagi and Mamoru as being her parents since she sees such a sharp contrast in personality between their present and future selves. She also reacts differently toward Usagi and Mamoru than she does towards King Endymion and Neo-Queen Serenity, being more respectful to the latter but more spontaneous to the former; it is not clear if <b>she</b> <b>prefers</b> one set over the other. However, she always calls her teenage father Mamoru as Mamo-chan (in the 20th century), an affectionate nickname by Usagi, and has an innocent crush on him, much to Usagi's fury.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, 2011, the {{original}} Ruth Martin, actress Mary Fickett, {{died at age}} 83. The episode on Wednesday September 21, 2011, was dedicated to her. On September 23, 2011, the series finale aired on ABC with open-ended stories. The final week featured Dr. Joe and Ruth Martin relocating to Pine Valley to cover recently arrested David Hayward's hospital duties. The return of Adam Chandler and Brooke English coincided with the revelation that David had somehow resurrected Stuart Chandler. Jackson Montgomery dissolved his relationship with Erica after she admitted that <b>she</b> <b>prefers</b> not to remarry. Unresolved is JR Chandler's plunge into insanity as he drunkenly aims a gun at a crowd of All My Children regulars during a welcome-home party for Stuart. The screen darkened before revealing the victim, leaving the story open for an eventual continuation with Prospect Park. On April 29, 2013, the revived series moved five {{years into the future}} after {{the original}} series finale on ABC. On November 11, 2013, it was confirmed by some of its actors that the series had once again become cancelled, this time by its online revival team.|$|E

She thinks Edward is still alive, immortal because he is artificial, and because of the [...] "snow" [...] which Edward creates when carving ice sculptures.|$|E
500|$|Although Milian is {{best known}} for her singing career, she {{originally}} wanted to be an actress. When asked whether <b>she</b> <b>prefers</b> singing or acting, Milian said that [...] "they're both my passion. But, honestly, if I had to choose, it would probably be my music. I love writing. I love listening. I love the challenge of it." [...] Milian has also stated that she loves [...] "performing live on the stage ... above all else. It's my favorite." ...|$|E
