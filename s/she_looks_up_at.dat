I'm in my own universe and my mind is a million miles somewhere else," [...] she stated, further explaining, [...] "Why I feel like I come from the moon is because {{my mother told me}} I was found somewhere." [...] She believes that when <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the moon, she can often spot her grandmother there, still living in her childhood home.|$|E

60|$|RAINA (placing {{her hands}} on his {{shoulder}} as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with admiration and worship). My hero! My king.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him; it was {{the very}} spot on which a couple of hours before <b>she</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her mother. [...] "You're free--you're free." ...|$|R
60|$|Her eyebrows were faintly contracted. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him pathetically.|$|R
60|$|Wingate laughed softly. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... [Throughout {{all this}} MRS. MEGAN has sat stolidly before the [...] fire, but as FERRAND {{suddenly}} steps forward <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> [...] him.] ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{places a}} cushion for her, and prepares tea; <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> [...] him softly, {{but as he}} {{finishes}} and turns to her, she drops that [...] glance.|$|E
60|$|EILEEN. Yes--for good. (<b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his averted face. He remains silent. She {{continues}} apprehensively.) You don't say anything. I thought--you'd be glad. You've {{always told}} me it was the honourable thing to do.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed mutely. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} bright, unquailing eyes.|$|R
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, half smiling, half pouting; {{altogether}} bewitching.|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} brooding. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him {{suddenly}} in surprise.|$|R
60|$|As {{he looks}} down at her, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and whimpers: ‘My lungs is weakly; my lungs is dreffle bad. Poor me, poor me, my cough is {{rattling}} dry!’ and coughs in confirmation horribly.|$|E
6000|$|He takes {{back the}} sheet of paper, {{clutches}} his brow, and crosses to [...] the door. As he passes FAITH, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with eyes full of [...] expression. JOHNNY catches the look, jibs ever so little, and goes [...] out.|$|E
60|$|He pats {{her on the}} shoulder. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} beaming eyes and he goes out, much moved. Having {{disposed}} of him, she looks at Tanner. His back being turned to her, she gives a moment's attention to her personal appearance, then softly goes to him and speaks almost into his ear.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Britling {{as if she}} {{measured}} his understanding.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} her grey eyes, humiliated and lonely.|$|R
60|$|The woman hesitated. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the clock}} and down again.|$|R
6000|$|By {{the time}} I got ’ome next morning my eyes was so swelled up I could ’ardly see, and my nose wouldn’t let me touch it. I was so done up I could ’ardly speak, but I managed {{to tell my}} missus about it arter I had ’ad a cup o’ tea. Judging by her face anybody might ha’ thought I was telling ’er {{something}} funny, and, when I ’ad finished, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling and ses: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. I brought them, and {{she told}} me to wait, and looked up something. And then <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the clock, and 'Hurry up,' she says. 'Tell them to get me a taxi,' and she begins a-shoving on of her hat in front of the glass, and she was down in two ticks, almost as quick as I was, and I seed her going down the steps and into the taxi, and I heard her call out what I told you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see it's not so {{much what}} you call love. I don't know. You see I built on Lettie,"—he {{looked up at me}} shamefacedly, then {{continued}} tearing the shavings—"you must found your castles on something, and I founded mine on Lettie. You see, I'm like plenty of folks, I have nothing definite to shape my life to. I put brick upon brick, as they come, and if the whole topples down in the end, it does. But you see, you and Lettie have made me conscious, and now I'm at a dead loss. I have looked to marriage to set me busy on my house of life, something whole and complete, of which it will supply the design. I must marry or be in a lost lane. There are two people I could marry—and Lettie's gone. I love Meg just as well, as far as love goes. I'm not sure I don't feel better pleased at the idea of marrying her. You know I should always have been second to Lettie, and the best part of love is being made much of, being first and foremost in the whole world for somebody. And Meg's easy and lovely. I can have her without trembling, she's full of soothing and comfort. I can stroke her hair and pet her, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me, full of trust and lovingness, and there is no flaw, all restfulness in one another——" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him almost}} {{for the first}} time since her entrance.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him shyly, {{yet with}} unmistakable love transfiguring her countenance.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a little grimace and patted his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "'How dreadful ill {{and weak}} she do look, don't she?' says Emmy. Before I could say {{as much as}} 'Yes,' she stares up at us, and asks in a wild voice, though it wasn't very loud either, if we can tell her the way to Bangbury workhouse. Having pretty sharp eyes of our own, we both of us knew that a workhouse was no fit place for her. Her gown was very dusty, {{and one of her}} boots was burst, and her hair was draggled all over her face, and her eyes was sunk in her head, like; but we saw somehow that she was a lady--or, if she wasn't exactly a lady, that no workhouse was proper for her, at any rate. I stooped down to speak to her; but her baby was crying so dreadful she could hardly hear me. 'Is the poor thing ill?' says I. 'Starving,' says she, in such a desperate, fierce way, that it gave me a turn. 'Is that your child?' says I, a bit frightened about how she'd answer me. 'Yes,' she says in quite a new voice, very soft and sorrowful, and bending her face away from me over the child. 'Then why don't you suckle it?' says I. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me, and then at Jenny and shakes her head, and says nothing. I give my baby to Jemmy to hold, and went and sat down by her. He walked away a little; and I whispered to her again, 'Why don't you suckle it?' and she whispered to me, 'My milk's all dried up. I couldn't wait to hear no more till I'd got her baby at my own breast.|$|E
5000|$|This film {{inspired}} one of {{the greatest}} hits of The Four Seasons. As the character based on Bob Gaudio explains in the musical Jersey Boys, [...] "I'm watching the million dollar movie. Some cheesy John Payne western. He hauls off and smacks Rhonda Fleming across the mouth and says, 'What do you think of that?' <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him defiant, proud, eyes glistening - and she says, 'Big girls don't cry.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|As Spike {{heads off}} {{to look for}} Dana, Angel follows Lorne's {{suggestion}} to visit Dana's childhood home with a psychic. The psychic flashes back to Dana’s abduction and her family’s murder; the smell of molasses and a basement is “where her pain lives,” he says. Meanwhile, Dana goes to {{the basement of the}} building where she was held captive, flashing back to her torturer injecting her with various drugs. When <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his face, it’s Spike.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} an {{expression}} of pleading in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and answered, not him, but her own thoughts.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, {{and to his}} amazement {{her eyes}} were swimming.|$|R

50|$|One night, she {{is seen in}} {{an office}} window through the rifle scope of {{professional}} hit man Frank Logan, {{who is on the}} roof of the opposite building, as he prepares to shoot the occupant on another floor. Afterwards, rather than leaving, he removes his hat and steps out on to the ledge as he apparently prepares to jump. As Kate steps out onto the sidewalk, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the falling snow and sees Frank on the ledge. She cries out, startling him into safely falling backward onto the roof.|$|E
50|$|One night Horacio is {{smoking in}} his room when he sees Talita {{crossing}} the moonlit garden below, apparently heading to bed. A moment later, he thinks he sees La Maga appear and begin a game of hopscotch in the same general area; but when <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, he realizes it is Talita, who had turned and recrossed the garden. A kind of guilt, fed {{in part by the}} institution's gloomy atmosphere, begins to steal into his musings, and it is not long before he conceives of the idea of someone's trying to murder him while he is on duty—perhaps Traveler.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him. He stood {{a shadowy}} {{presence}} beyond the light.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a {{sound and}} saw her father {{standing}} in the doorway.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and {{a slight}} {{sinister}} smile contracted her white face.|$|R
