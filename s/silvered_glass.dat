5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially <b>silvered</b> <b>glass</b> optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E
6000|$|Professor W. H. Miller, the Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society, {{has since}} invented a yet more compact method of {{directing}} the flash, {{which he has}} described in the Proceedings of the Royal Society for 1865. It consists of a plate of <b>silvered</b> <b>glass,</b> one of whose rectangular corners is accurately ground and polished. On looking into the corner when the glass is properly held {{an image of the}} sun is seen, which overlays the actual flash. Beautifully simple as this instrument is, I do not like it so much as my own, for the very fact of its requiring no [...] "setting" [...] is its drawback. With mine, when the image of the sun is lost it is immediately found again by simply rotating the instrument on its axis; but with Professor Miller's the image must be felt for wholly anew.|$|E
60|$|She was crying, and caressing Margaret so vehemently {{that she}} gained her point.

5000|$|Mercury glass (or <b>silvered</b> <b>glass)</b> is {{glass that}} was blown double walled, then silvered between the layers with a liquid {{silvering}} solution, and sealed. Although mercury was originally {{used to provide}} the reflective coating for mirrors, elemental mercury was never used to create tableware. <b>Silvered</b> <b>glass</b> was free-blown, then silvered with a solution containing silver nitrate and grape sugar in solution, heated, then closed. Sealing methods include metal discs covered with a glass round or a cork inserted into the unpolished pontil scar. [...] "Mercury" [...] <b>silvered</b> <b>glass</b> was produced originally from around 1840 until at least 1930 in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), Germany and also manufactured in England from 1849 to 1855. Edward Varnish and Frederick Hale Thomson patented the technique for silvering glass vessels in 1849. The English examples were often cased {{with a layer of}} colored glass then cut to silver as illustrated in the photograph.|$|E

50|$|Early octants were {{constructed}} primarily in wood, with later versions incorporating ivory and brass components. The earliest mirrors were polished metal, since {{the technology to}} produce <b>silvered</b> <b>glass</b> mirrors with flat, parallel surfaces was limited. As glass polishing techniques improved, glass mirrors began to be provided. These used coatings of mercury-containing tin amalgam; coatings of silver or aluminum were not available until the 19th century. The poor optical quality of the early polished speculum metal mirrors meant that telescopic sights were not practical. For that reason, most early octants employed a simple naked-eye sighting pinnula instead.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, Alfred Bucherer (1908) {{conducted}} a precise measurement using a velocity filter similar to Bestelmeyer's. See Figs. 3 & 5. A radium beta source was {{placed at the}} center of a circular condenser consisting of two <b>silvered</b> <b>glass</b> plates spaced 0.25 mm apart and charged to about 500 volts, set in a homogeneous 140 Gauss magnetic field. The radium emitted beta rays in all directions, but in any particular direction α, only those beta rays exited the velocity filter whose speed was such that the electric and magnetic fields exactly compensated each other. After leaving the condenser, the rays were deflected by the magnetic field, and exposed a photographic plate set parallel to the condenser rim and perpendicular to the non-deflected rays.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to simply reflecting {{light of a}} specific wavelength, the helicoid structure also causes light of other wavelengths to be modified so that the wavelength converges to within a narrow range before being reflected, which acts to amplify the light at that specific wavelength. This process of constructive interference produces the most intense coloration of any living organism. The total reflectivity is about 30 % of that of a <b>silvered</b> <b>glass</b> mirror, and is the highest of any known biological material. The intense coloration makes the fruit attractive to some birds despite having no nutritional value. The birds sometimes decorate their nest with the berries, which {{over the long term}} helps to disperse the seeds.According to materials scientist Ullrich Steiner, who led the team which carried out the original research on structural color in plants, ...|$|E

25|$|A <b>silver</b> <b>glass</b> {{mirror is}} an {{ordinary}} mirror, coated {{on its back}} surface with silver, which produces images by reflection. This kind of glass mirror is produced by coating a silver, copper film and two or more layers of waterproof paint on the back surface of float glass, which perfectly resists acid and moisture. A <b>silver</b> <b>glass</b> mirror provides clear and actual images, is quite durable, and is widely used for furniture, bathroom and other decorative purposes.|$|R

50|$|A Nichols {{radiometer}} was {{the apparatus}} used by Ernest Fox Nichols and Gordon Ferrie Hull in 1901 for {{the measurement of}} radiation pressure. It consisted {{of a pair of}} small <b>silvered</b> <b>glass</b> mirrors suspended {{in the manner of a}} torsion balance by a fine quartz fibre within an enclosure in which the air pressure could be regulated. The torsion head to which the fiber was attached could be turned from the outside by means of a magnet. A beam of light was directed first on one mirror and then on the other, and the opposite deflections observed with mirror and scale. By turning the mirror system around so as to receive the light on the unsilvered side, the influence of the air in the enclosure could be ascertained. This influence was found to be of almost negligible value at an air pressure of about 16 mmHg (2.1 kPa). The radiant energy of the incident beam was deduced from its heating effect upon a small blackened silver disk, which was found to be more reliable than the bolometer when it was first used. With this apparatus the experimenters were able to obtain an agreement between observed and computed radiation pressures within about 0.6%. The original apparatus is at the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5000|$|In 1856-57 an {{improvement}} over speculum mirrors was invented when Karl August von Steinheil and Léon Foucault introduced the process of depositing an ultra thin layer of silver on the front surface (first surface) of a ground block of glass. <b>Silvered</b> <b>glass</b> mirrors were a vast improvement since silver reflects 90 percent of the light that hits it and is much slower to tarnish than speculum. Silver coatings can also {{be removed from the}} glass, so a tarnished mirror could be resilvered without changing the delicate precision polished shape of the glass substrate. Glass is also more thermally stable than speculum metal, allowing it to hold its shape better through temperature changes. This marked the end of the speculum-mirror reflecting telescope, with the last large one, the Great Melbourne Telescope with its 122-cm (48-inch) mirror, being completed in 1867. The era of the large glass-mirror reflector had begun, with telescopes such as Andrew Ainslie Common's 1879 36 inch (91 cm) and 1887 60 inch (152 cm) reflectors built at Ealing, and the first of the [...] "modern" [...] large glass mirror research reflectors, 60 inch (150 cm) Mount Wilson Observatory Hale telescope of 1908, and the 100 inch (2.5 m) Mount Wilson Hooker telescope in 1917.|$|E
