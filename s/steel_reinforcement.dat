5|$|The tunnel also suffers regular {{problems}} with strikes from over-height traffic, and vehicles {{running out of}} fuel. On 10 December 1996, a man drove a Mercedes truck supporting a crane towards the southbound tunnel, ignored warnings that his vehicle was over-height, and struck a gantry, breaking a <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> frame in the process. The entire tunnel was immediately closed, not only to retrieve the vehicle, but to perform additional safety checks. Because the Limehouse Link tunnel, which runs near to {{the north end of}} the Blackwall Tunnel, and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, part of the Dartford Crossing, were also closed on the same day, the accident caused one of the worst traffic jams in the capital. In February 2011, TfL reported that the tunnel had been closed 1,200 times in the previous year for a total of 157 hours, while New Civil Engineer magazine claimed it shut 1,448 times in 2010. To try to prevent closures of this nature, an LED noticeboard was set up in the northbound approach, counting the number of breakdowns and accidents per month occurring inside the tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Plastic {{reinforcement}} {{often is}} stronger, {{or at least}} has a better strength to weight ratio than reinforcing steels. Also, because it resists corrosion, it does not need a protective concrete cover as thick as <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> does (typically 30 to 50mm or more). FRP-reinforced structures therefore can be lighter and last longer. Accordingly, for some applications the whole-life cost will be price-competitive with steel-reinforced concrete.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} source of chloride ions is sea water. Sea water contains by weight approximately 3.5wt.% salts. These salts include sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and bicarbonates. In water these salts dissociate in free ions (Na+, Mg2+, Cl−, SO42−, HCO3−) and migrate with the water into the capillaries of the concrete. Chloride ions, which make up about 50% of these ions, are particularly aggressive {{as a cause of}} corrosion of carbon <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> bars.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy {{commissioned}} {{a study of}} Fallingwater’s structural integrity. Structural engineers analyzed {{the movement of the}} cantilevers over time and conducted radar studies of the cantilevers to locate and quantify the reinforcement. These showed that the contractor had indeed added reinforcement over Wright's plan; nevertheless, the cantilevers were still insufficiently reinforced. An architecture firm was hired to fix the problem. Both the concrete and its <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> were close to their failure limits. As a result, in 1997, temporary girders were installed beneath the cantilevers to carry their weight.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the larger sculptures was {{very similar to the}} temporary Hon installation at the Moderna Museet in 1966, but this time the artworks were outdoors and needed to withstand the longterm weathering effects of sun and rain. The basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar. A second layer of lighter-gauge <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> bars was added, followed by two layers of expanded metal. A specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure. A layer of tar for waterproofing, and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy, hollow structure ready for decoration.|$|E
25|$|The geology of the site, {{a former}} farmer's field on a slight slope, {{with a heavy}} clay soil that is subject to {{seasonal}} movements when wet, meant that substantial foundations and drainage had to be constructed. The main support for the above ground structures consists of 210 concrete piles extending vertically downwards into the soil, each up to 7 metres deep. These pilings were engineered in June 2009 by a specialist company, Wig-Palen, from Belgium, using a 62-ton machine to drill and compact the required holes. Concrete was then poured into the hollow drill {{to fill the void}} as the drill was extracted, and <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> cages were then placed into the still-wet concrete. This screw-piling technique ensured that the cemetery foundations were both end-bearing and friction-bearing in nature, increasing the stability of the pilings and the structures they support.|$|E

25|$|Most of the museum's {{collections}} of mammalian and dinosaur fossils remain hidden from public view. They {{are kept in}} numerous storage areas located deep within the museum complex. Among these, the most significant storage facility is the ten story Childs Frick Building which stands within an inner courtyard of the museum. During construction of the Frick, giant cranes were employed to lift steel beams directly from the street, over the roof, and into the courtyard, {{in order to ensure}} that the classic museum façade remained undisturbed. The predicted great weight of the fossil bones led designers to add special <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> to the building's framework, as it now houses the largest collection of fossil mammals and dinosaurs in the world. These collections occupy the basement and lower seven floors of the Frick Building, while the top three floors contain laboratories and offices. It is inside this particular building that many of the museum's intensive research programs into vertebrate paleontology are carried out.|$|E

The nose of the glider was hinged and opened to the side for ease of loading vehicles and cargo, and the crew of two pilots were seated in tandem in a cockpit on the top of the fuselage, which was accessed via an internal ladder and was fifteen feet above ground; they were eventually protected by a bullet-proof windscreen and a plate of armour behind the second pilot. An intercom was also added to provide communication between the pilots and the personnel below them. An initial design feature, which was eventually removed prior to full-scale production, was the installation of an under-fuselage hatch which would allow the prone firing of a Bren light machine gun as the glider approached the landing zone.|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focuses on}} an innovative design which {{can enhance the}} performance and durability of structural components. Pseudo-ductile cementitious composites (PDCC) {{is a group of}} fiber reinforced cementitious composites with excellent ductility and crack control capability, while glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) reinforcements can be used as replacements for <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcements</b> to eliminate the corrosion problem. By the combined use of these materials strategically, improvement in structural performance can be achieved. Using pseudo-ductile cementitious composites (PDCC) of relatively low water/binder ratio, permanent formworks are first fabricated. Normal concrete is then cast to make structural components. With low permeability and very high crack resistance, the permanent formwork acts as a very effective surface cover to prevent the corrosion of <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> The formwork can be made with PDCC alone, or with the incorporation of glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) rods. In some structural components, the GFRP reinforcements will be sufficient to provide the necessary load-carrying capacity. In others, <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcements</b> can be added to produce a component with very high durability (as steel is well protected) as well as ductile behavior. In this research, the design of PDCC mix is first presented, followed by bending test results on beams made with PDCC formwork and normal concrete. Emphasis will be placed on the assurance of proper bonding between the formwork and the cast concrete. Then, PDCC formworks with embedded GFRP are fabricated. Concrete beams with GFRP/PDCC formwork are prepared with and without additional <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> Based on the tests on these specimens, it is found that the formwork and the concrete behave as a composite system and interfacial debonding is the cause of failure in most cases. Nevertheless, for some of the specimens, the ultimate load approaches the calculated value for concrete crushing failure. Also, when both <b>steel</b> and GFRP <b>reinforcements</b> are present, good ductility can be achieved. Finally, issues related to durability and practical applications of PDCC formwork are studied. According to the result of the present investigation, the PDCC permanent formwork has a good potential for practical applications...|$|R
