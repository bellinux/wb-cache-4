40|$|Summary An {{emerging}} {{marketing management}} logic proposes {{a new perspective}} on service activities, which previously have been subject to a biased goods-dominant logic. According to this new logic, customers always are co-producers of services and co-creators of value, not simple marketing targets, because they mobilize knowledge and other resources in the service process that affect the success of a value proposition. This article explores this key proposition, analyzing service co-production and value co-creation phenomena in the business-to-business segment and focusing on the case of service-oriented architecture (SOA) with an in-depth, qualitative analysis of two firms pioneering the implementation of SOA <b>solutions.</b> <b>Service</b> dominant logic Co-production Service management...|$|E

40|$|Service-orientation enables {{cooperation}} between multiple organizations {{and has become}} a solution of choice to tackle the complexity of ubiquitous computing. The very nature of ubiquitous applications implies a need for dynamic <b>solutions.</b> <b>Service</b> oriented computing provides support for these dynamic applications. However, current solutions overlook important aspects, particularly when dynamically substituting services. Some applications may be mission-critical and therefore the disruption of a particular service could be harmful. Other applications may tolerate the disappearance of a service if the service returns within a predefined amount of time. Hence, guarantees regarding availability of services that compose an application are required. In this paper we propose to take into account service disruptions through service level agreements for dynamic service-oriented applications. Keywords. Dynamic SOC, service disruption, SLA, mission critical, OSG...|$|E

40|$|Part 7 : Strategic and Tactic Aspects of Enterprise InteroperabilityInternational audienceTraditional service {{composition}} approaches {{face the}} significant challenge {{of how to}} deal with massive individualized requirements. Such challenges include how to reach a tradeoff between one generalized solution and multiple customized ones and how to balance {{the costs and benefits of}} a composition <b>solution(s).</b> <b>Service</b> network is a feasible method to cope with these challenges by interconnecting distributed services to form a dynamic network that operates as a persistent infrastructure, and satisfies the massive individualized requirements of many customers. When a requirement arrives, the service network is dynamically customized and transformed into a specific composite solution. In such way, mass requirements are fulfilled cost-effectively. The conceptual architecture and the mechanisms of facilitating mass customization are presented in this paper, and a competency assessment framework is proposed to evaluate its mass customization and cost-effectiveness capacities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{shows how}} a {{provider}} of complex hardware with long operation times makes use of a structured methods approach to develop maintenance, repair and overhaul services and improve its service <b>solutions.</b> <b>Service</b> engineering is a methodical approach {{for the design of}} service offerings, and can be described by using the dimensions outcome, structure, processand management. So far, little is known about how firms implement such approaches. On the basis of a longitudinal case study within a large, product-based, high-technology business corporation, the paper shows that the use of a simplified service engineering model may be effective in supporting both the development and the maintenance of a comprehensive service business. More specifically, the case suggests the following factors to be important for success: A systematically applied engineering method, the presence of dedicated service champions, an ability to articulate and formalize new service roles, and deep technical knowledge of the involved hardware...|$|E
