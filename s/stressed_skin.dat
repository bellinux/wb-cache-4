25|$|The Percival Merganser was a light, civil {{transport}} {{of the late}} 1940s. It was a twin-engine, high-wing monoplane of all-metal, <b>stressed</b> <b>skin</b> construction with retractable tricycle undercarriage.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} {{and early}} cars utilised <b>stressed</b> <b>skin</b> aluminium bodywork, though later models incorporated chassis members of steel. The Minicar was amongst the first British cars to use fibreglass body panels.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1918 and 1939, {{aircraft}} technology developed very rapidly. By 1939 military biplanes were in {{the process}} of being replaced with metal framed monoplanes, often with <b>stressed</b> <b>skins</b> and liquid cooled engines.

50|$|Although foam-core panels gained {{attention}} in the 1970s, {{the idea of using}} <b>stress</b> <b>skinned</b> panels for construction began in the 1930s. Research and testing of the technology was done primarily by Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) in Madison, Wisconsin as part of a U.S. Forest Service attempt to conserve forest resources. In 1937, a small stressed-skin house was constructed and garnered enough attention to bring in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to dedicate the house. In a testament to the durability of such panel structures, it has endured the severe Wisconsin climate and was used by University of Wisconsin-Madison as a day care center up until 1998 when it was removed {{to make way for a}} new Pharmacy School building. With the success of the <b>stress</b> <b>skinned</b> panels, it was suggested stronger skins could take all of the structural load and eliminate the frame altogether.|$|R
5|$|A {{combination}} of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main longerons {{attached to the}} frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of alclad <b>stressed</b> <b>skinning</b> were attached. The fuselage plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.|$|R

25|$|The Reggiane Re.2000 is an Italian all metal, low-wing {{monoplane}} fighter aircraft. It {{holds the}} distinction of being the first aircraft to be designed by Reggiane to employ aluminum <b>stressed</b> <b>skin</b> construction, as opposed to the wooden or mixed wood and metal structures that had been traditionally used in contemporary Italian aircraft such as the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 (which had been previously produced by Reggiane under license). The <b>stressed</b> <b>skin</b> fuselage was highly streamlined, save for the protrusions of the hard-rivetted finish. The majority of the aircraft's exterior, including the tail, was metal-coated; however, the control surfaces had fabric coverings.|$|E
25|$|The Zeppelin-Staaken E-4/20 was {{a revolutionary}} four-engine {{all-metal}} passenger monoplane designed in 1917 by Adolf Rohrbach and completed in 1919 at the Zeppelin-Staaken works outside Berlin, Germany.

40|$|A 3 D {{microchannel}} in {{transient condition}} with hydro dynamically fully developed was investigated. The main aim {{to increase the}} turbulence of fluid with a helical twisted tape insert and compare with the channel without twisted tape. Since the more the turbulence in fluid more the convective heat transfer. A commercial CFD package is used for investigation. An isothermal wall condition with Re equal to 100 which is equal to inlet velocity of 0. 67 m/s is taken as boundary condition. The main aim is to compare the heat transfer rate, axial wall shear <b>stress,</b> <b>skin</b> friction coefficient, Nusselt number, wall fluxes and heat transfer coefficient for the channel with twisted tape {{with respect to the}} without twisted tape. It is found that the increase in turbulence occurs in microchannel due to the twisted tape insert. Also it is found that heat transfer characteristics like axial wall shear <b>stress,</b> <b>skin</b> friction coefficient, surface nusselt number and surface heat transfer coefficient are greater in with twisted tape with respect to without twisted tape...|$|R

50|$|Between 1918 and 1939 {{aircraft}} technology developed very rapidly. In 1918 most aircraft were biplanes {{with wooden}} frames, canvas skins, wire rigging and air-cooled engines.

25|$|The first Akaflieg Hannover glider was the Vampyr monoplane, which flew {{successfully}} at {{the first}} Rhön contest in 1921 and was probably the first heavier than air machine to use <b>stressed</b> <b>skin</b> construction.

5000|$|In {{scientific}} visualization {{skin friction}} lines {{are used to}} visualize flows on 3D-surfaces.

A skin friction line is a curve on the surface tangent to skin friction vectors. A limit streamline is a streamline where the distance normal to the surface tends to zero. Limit streamlines and skin friction lines coincide.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the <b>stresses</b> in the <b>skin</b> of an inflated nonstretchable sphere during normal, nonrotating impact with a hard flat surface, assuming infinite modulus of elasticity in the skin and infinite propagation speed of stress waves.

Curves are presented showing the stress distributions during impact for cases corresponding to those calculated in previous reports in which the impact motion and payload landing performance capabilities of the landing vehicle have been studied. It is found, assuming the force from the payload-suspension cords to be distributed continuously on the skin, that is, neglecting <b>stress</b> concentrations,that the <b>skin</b> <b>stresses</b> along a meridian are reduced by the presence of the suspended payload during impact, but that the maximum values of <b>skin</b> <b>stress</b> normal to a meridian are little affected...|$|R

The measurements further indicate that the boundary layer tends to attain significantly higher skin-friction values downstream of the interaction region as compared to upstream. Comparisons between measured wall shear stress and published results of some theoretical calculation schemes show that the general, but not detailed, behavior is predicted well by such schemes...|$|R

25|$|Oswald {{continued}} {{his interest in}} balloons and airships, and developed his own ideas about leak-tight inflatable envelopes for balloons, airships and the floats of seaplanes, particularly the use of goldbeater's skin. In 1913, he took charge of a new factory at Rochester, {{for the production of}} seaplanes and to enable them to fly from the River Medway. In 1916, he established another factory at Cardington, Bedfordshire, for the production of airships; in 1917, that was nationalised. In April 1917, Oswald assumed overall responsibility for the design of Short Brothers aircraft, following the death of Horace Short. In 1919, Oswald became chairman and managing director of the partnership then incorporated as Short Brothers (Rochester and Bedford) Ltd. He developed construction methods using aluminium alloys such as Duralumin, and in 1920 he patented monocoque and <b>stressed</b> <b>skin</b> aircraft construction techniques. In 1924, he applied the technology to flying boat designs to replace wooden structures that were prone to deterioration. His technology was licensed in the United States, France, and Japan. In the 1920s, Short Brothers manufactured thousands of lightweight bodies for omnibuses, until Oswald's monocoque and <b>stressed</b> <b>skin</b> methods became more widely acceptable to aircraft customers.|$|E

Unlike the Gull's wing, which is aircraft fabric-covered or optionally finished in sheet aluminium, the Tornado's wing is <b>stressed</b> <b>skin.</b> The Tornado has a tricycle undercarriage with a supplemental tailwheel castor, as the aircraft sits on its tail when unoccupied.|$|E

2500|$|The project {{aerodynamicist}} on {{the design}} of the Me 262 was Ludwig Bölkow. He initially designed the wing using NACA airfoils modified with an elliptical nose section. Later in the design process, these were changed to AVL derivatives of NACA airfoils, the NACA 00011-0.825-35 being used at the root and the NACA 00009-1.1-40 at the tip. The elliptical nose derivatives of the NACA airfoils were used on the horizontal and vertical tail surfaces. Wings were of single-spar cantilever construction, with <b>stressed</b> <b>skins,</b> varying from [...] skin thickness at the root to [...] at the tip. To expedite construction, save weight and use less strategic materials, late in the war, wing interiors were not painted. The wings were fastened to the fuselage at four points, using a pair of [...] and forty-two [...] bolts.|$|R
