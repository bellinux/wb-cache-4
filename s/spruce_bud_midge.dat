40|$|<b>Spruce</b> <b>bud</b> scale (Physokermes piceae Schrnk.) affects {{tree growth}} {{directly}} and indirectly. Direct injury {{appears in the}} form of tissue damage, as insects suck sap from tree phloem. Indirect injury appears as “honeydew”, which results in negative effects on tree growth. Plant sap is saturated with various carbohydrates called photosynthates that are difficult for scaly insects to digest. Therefore it is secreted in excrements, which are subsequently a food source for the black sooty mold (Apiosporium pinophilum Fuckel). The fungus covers needles blocking stomata, causing decreased transpiration and photosynthesis. An inexplicable wither of Norway spruce was reported in Latvia during 2010 due to black sooty mold. However, <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> scale was not evident. In 2011, mass propagation of <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> scale was observed following the 2010 Norway spruce loss. One objective of this research was to determine if Kraft tree growth classes could be applied to establish the factors responsible for tree foliage damage. Six 21 - 40 year old (second age class) Norway spruce stands were evaluated. Two circular sample plots with a 7. 98 m radius, and a 200 -m 2 area were randomly established per each forest stand hectare. Diameter at breast height (dbh, 1. 3 m), and height of approximately 30 trees was measured to model a trend. For all trees, Kraft class, and foliage damage level caused by <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> scale and black sooty mold were determined.

White spruce cones mature in late July and are harvested by red squirrels in August and September. These harvested cones are stored in a central cache and provide energy and nutrients for survival over the winter and reproduction the following spring. The fallen scales from consumed seed cones can collect in piles, called middens, more than a meter across. White spruce exhibits two- to six-year masting cycles, where a year of superabundant cone production (mast year) is followed by several years in which few cones are produced. American red squirrel territories may contain one or several middens.|$|R
40|$|Acetophenones are {{phenolic}} compounds involved in resistance of white spruce (Picea glauca) against spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferiana), a major forest pest in North America. The acetophenones pungenol and piceol commonly accumulate in spruce foliage {{in the form}} of the corresponding glycosides, pungenin and picein. These glycosides appear to be inactive against the insect, but can be cleaved by a spruce β-glucosidase, PgβGlu 1, which releases the active aglycons. The reverse glycosylation reaction was hypothesized to involve a family- 1 UDP-sugar dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT) to facilitate acetophenone accumulation in the plant. Metabolite and transcriptome profiling over a developmental time course of white <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> burst and shoot growth revealed two UGTs, PgUGT 5 and PgUGT 5 b, which glycosylate pungenol. Recombinant PgUGT 5 b enzyme produced mostly pungenin, while PgUGT 5 produced mostly isopungenin. Both UGTs were also active in vitro on select flavonoids. However, the context of transcript and metabolite accumulation did not support a biological role in flavonoid metabolism but correlated with the formation of pungenin in growing shoots. Transcript levels of PgUGT 5 b were higher than those of PgUGT 5 in needles across different genotypes of white spruce.

As {{a result of}} experiments, 15 proliferative cell lines (Cl) of L. sibirica were obtained from embryo culture. Cls differed in somatic embryo production, more specifically, in embryo quantity, size, and capability to mature, to germinate, and to form viable plantlets. The number of somatic embryos ranged from 2040 to 11103 per 1 gram of fresh weight of embryogenic callus (EC) in young (age up to one year) Cls. The proliferate activity of Cls are maintained during two–six years. Morphogenesis and maturation of somatic embryos are observed 45 days on the medium AI added by ABA. The number of mature somatic embryos ranged from 12 to 1220 per 1 gram of EC. Small somatic embryos of hybrid Cl 5 did not mature on AI medium. Different anomalies are observed in the morphogenesis of somatic embryos: destruction of embryo domain development and cytokinesis. The minimum embryo anomalies were observed in Cl 4. In this Cl viable embryos are 83. 31 ± 3. 00 %. The germination of somatic embryo occurred on medium AI hormones and due to elongation of hypocotyls and roots.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{diversity}} and composition of fungal communities in damaged and undamaged shoots of Norway spruce (Picea abies) following recent invasion of the <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> scale (Physokermes piceae) in Lithuania. Sampling was done in July 2013 and included 50 random lateral shoots from ten random trees in each of five visually undamaged and five damaged 40 - 50 -year-old pure stands of P. abies. DNA was isolated from 500 individual shoots, subjected to amplification of the internal transcribed spacer of fungal ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA), barcoded and sequenced. Clustering of 149, 426 high-quality sequences resulted in 1193 non-singleton contigs of which 1039 (87. 1 %) were fungal. In total, there were 893 fungal taxa in damaged shoots and 608 taxa in undamaged shoots (p < 0. 0001). Furthermore, 431 (41. 5 %) fungal taxa were exclusively in damaged shoots, 146 (14. 0 %) were exclusively in undamaged shoots, and 462 (44. 5 %) were common to both types of samples. Correspondence analysis showed that study sites representing damaged and undamaged shoots were separated from each other, indicating that in these fungal communities, these were largely different and, therefore, heavily affected by P. piceae. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that invasive alien tree pests may have a profound effect on fungal mycobiota associated with the phyllosphere of P. abies, and therefore, in addition to their direct negative effect owing physical damage of the tissue, they may also indirectly determine health, sustainability and, ultimately, distribution of the forest tree species...|$|R

40|$|Key message: In mature black <b>spruce,</b> <b>bud</b> burst {{process is}} {{anticipated}} by soil warming, while delayed by foliar applications of nitrogen; however, the effects depend on growth {{conditions at the}} site. Abstract: The observation of phenological events {{can be used as}} biological indicator of environmental changes, especially from the perspective of climate change. In boreal forests, the onset of the bud burst is a key factor in the length of the growing season. With current climate change, the major factors limiting the growth of boreal trees (i. e., temperature and nitrogen availability) are changing and studies on mature trees are limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of soil warming and increased nitrogen (N) deposition on bud burst of mature black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP]. From 2008 onwards, an experimental manipulation of these environmental growth conditions was conducted in two stands (BER and SIM) at different altitudes in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. An increase in soil temperature (H treatment) and a canopy application of artificial rain enriched with nitrogen (N treatment) were performed. Observations of bud phenology were made during May–July 2012 and 2013. In BER, H treatment caused an anticipation (estimated as 1 – 3 days); while N treatment, a delay (estimated as 1 – 2 days but only in 2012) in bud burst. No treatments effect was significant in SIM. It has been demonstrated that soil temperature and N availability can play an important role in affecting bud burst in black spruce but the effects of these environmental factors on growth are closely linked with site conditions...|$|R
50|$|The <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> moths of {{the genus}} Zeiraphera, transcontinental in range, are found {{frequently}} on white spruce but only occasionally on other spruces and firs (Rose and Lindquist 1985). Zeiraphera canadensis (Mutuura and Freeman Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), has caused {{a high incidence of}} multiple and abnormal leaders in white spruce in the Maritime provinces, Quebec, and Maine (Quiring et al. 1991). However, although severe feeding damage has seldom been extensive in forests, new shoots on open-grown white spruce are frequently disfigured (Rose and Lindquist 1985). The insect overwinters in the egg stage on the tree. The larva emerges in May and feeds underneath the bud cap, which it characteristically secures to the growing shoot with silk. The cap remains in place long after the other bud caps have been shed, an obvious impediment to the effectiveness of contact insecticides. When populations are high, it is not unusual to find several larvae feeding among the needles of a single shoot. The head and thoracic legs of young larvae are dark brown, but full-grown larvae are cream to yellow and about 10 mm long. Feeding is completed in June or early July, whereupon the larva drops to the ground and becomes a pupa in the litter. From mid-July to mid-August, moths emerge from the pupae to lay eggs singly or in groups of two to seven at the base of shoots of the current year. In a New Brunswick seed orchard, white spruce of intermediate height (1.5 to 3.73 m) were damaged most, and damage in one year was positively correlated with damage in the next. At four test sites, mean growth reduction of trees in the two most susceptible families was estimated to be approximately 30% higher than those of trees in the two least susceptible families. The lack of damage to some trees, among those trees suffering damage, suggested the existence of genetically based differences in susceptibility to this pest.|$|R

The gall midge Dasineura oxycoccana (Johnson) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) was identifi ed as a pest in rabbiteye blueberries (Vaccinium ashei Reade) in the southeastern United States in the early 1990 s. In 2004, Dr. Blair Sampson of USDA confi rmed that the blueberry gall midges collected in blueberry fi elds in Oregon and Washington were D. oxycoccana. SYMPTOMS Blueberry plants are damaged when blueberry gall midge larvae feed on fl ower buds and young shoot tips. In the southeastern United States, damage includes aborted fl ower buds and blackened young shoot tips. In the Northwest, blueberry gall midge seems to cause only aborted and/or blackened young shoot tips as well as distorted devel-oping leaves (Figure 1). In heavily infested fi elds, a witchesʼ-broom symptom may occur (Figure 2). Damage caused by blueberry gall midge in commercial blueberry fi elds might be confused with boron defi ciency or even with the black tip stage of plant development. DESCRIPTION AND BIOLOGY Described by Gagné in 1989, the plant-feeding gall midge Dasineura oxycoccana (Johnson) is a tiny, fragile fl y approximately 2 to 3 mm long. Newly hatched larvae are less than 1 mm long, white, and almost transparent. They then become reddish-orange second and third instar larvae, spending 2 to 4 days in each instar. Mature larvae are maggots about 1 mm long, 0. 3 mm wide, legless, and yellow to red in color. Larvae cease feeding and form puparia in 7 to 10 days. The estimated time from fi rst instar to adult fl y is about 2 to 3 weeks at room temperature with 12 hours of daylight. There are four or more generations in a growing season, and the fi nal generation of pupae overwinters in the soil. The blueberry gall midge life cycle is illustrated in Figure 3...|$|R

Biochemical analysis included quantification of the photosynthetic pigments and immunodetection of the NAPDH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Photosynthetic performance was monitored as the oxygen production at different light levels applied. Two POR isoforms were detected in buds while only one isoform was present in mature needles. The POR polypeptides in buds were expressed at different levels: the polypeptide of lower molecular mass had a level that was more enhanced than that of higher molecular mass.

40|$|Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) is a conifer {{belonging}} to the group gymnosperms and is an ecologically and economically important species in several parts of Europe. It is crucial for trees like Norway spruce to adapt timing of events such as bud set and growth cessation to the local environment {{in order to maximize}} the growth period while avoiding frost damage. This thesis aims at widening the knowledge about genetic control of annual growth rhythm in Norway spruce and particularly the control of <b>bud</b> set. Using <b>spruce</b> transformants ectopically expressing PaFT/TFL 1 -LIKE 2 (PaFTL 2) the prior hypothesis that PaFTL 2 induces bud set is confirmed. This is further supported by spatial and temporal expression patterns in seedlings and adult trees. It is further shown that gymnosperms possess at least two FLOWERING LOCUS T/TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (FT/TFL 1) -like genes with TFL 1 -like function, suggesting the ancestor of FT and TFL 1 to be more TFL 1 -like. PaFTL 1 appears to have complementary expression patterns to that of PaFTL 2 both spatially and temporally indicating they may act together to control growth in Norway <b>spruce.</b> Since <b>bud</b> set is controlled by photoperiod and circadian clock genes are implicated in this process, putative clock homologs were studied to gain insight into the circadian clock in gymnosperms. Several clock homologs were identified and their expression showed a diurnal pattern but the expression was rapidly damped in constant conditions. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing putative core clock genes from spruce indicate that at least three genes, PaCCA 1, PaGI and PaZTL, appear to have a conserved function between angiosperms and gymnosperms. Taken together these results suggest that gymnosperms have a similar core clock structure as angiosperms even though fundamental differences might exist since the cycling of the clock genes were rapidly damped in free-running conditions. The studies presented in this thesis support substantial conservation of pathway components controlling photoperiodic responses in angiosperms and gymnosperms and identify PaFTL 2 as a component of growth rhythm control. However, important changes in these processes are also evident. The results provide a solid basis for future research on molecular mechanisms controlling an adaptive trait in an important non-model organism...|$|R
