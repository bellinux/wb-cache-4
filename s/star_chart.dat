5|$|The oldest {{accurately}} dated <b>star</b> <b>chart</b> was {{the result}} of ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC.

5|$|Lacaille charted and {{designated}} ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Mu in 1756, however his Alpha Normae was transferred into Scorpius and left unnamed by Francis Baily, before being named N Scorpii by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who felt its brightness warranted recognition. Though Beta Normae was depicted on his <b>star</b> <b>chart,</b> it was inadvertently {{left out of}} Lacaille's 1763 catalogue, was likewise transferred to Scorpio by Baily and named H Scorpii by Gould. Norma's brightest star, Gamma2 Normae, is only of magnitude 4.0. Overall, there are 44 stars within the constellation's borders brighter {{than or equal to}} apparent magnitude 6.5.|$|E

25|$|In Western astronomy, Monoceros is a {{relatively}} modern constellation. Its first certain appearance was on a globe created by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius in 1612 or 1613 and it was later charted by German astronomer Jakob Bartsch as Unicornu on his <b>star</b> <b>chart</b> of 1624.|$|E

25|$|The planisphere was a <b>star</b> <b>chart</b> {{invented by}} Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī {{in the early}} 11th century. The {{astrolabe}} was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several {{different kinds of problems}} in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235. Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe, an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine with a gear train and gear-wheels, circa 1000 AD. The castle clock, a hydropowered mechanical astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari in 1206, was the first programmable analog computer.|$|E

25|$|Classical Chinese {{astronomy}} {{is recorded}} in the Han period and appears {{in the form of}} three schools, which are attributed to astronomers of the Warring States period. The constellations of the three schools were conflated into a single system by Chen Zhuo, an astronomer of the 3rd century (Three Kingdoms period). Chen Zhuo's work has been lost, but information on his system of constellations survives in Tang period records, notably by Qutan Xida. The oldest extant Chinese <b>star</b> <b>chart</b> dates to that period and was preserved as part of the Dunhuang Manuscripts. Native Chinese astronomy flourished during the Song dynasty, and during the Yuan Dynasty became increasingly influenced by medieval Islamic astronomy (see Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era). As maps were prepared during this period on more scientific lines they were considered as more reliable.|$|E
500|$|In the <b>star</b> <b>chart</b> to the right, {{declination}} {{is shown}} by the radial coordinate, starting at 90° north {{in the center and}} decreasing to 30° north at the outer edge.

500|$|Urania's Mirror; or, a view [...] of the Heavens {{is a set}} of 32 astronomical <b>star</b> <b>chart</b> cards, first {{published}} in November 1824. They had illustrations based on Alexander Jamieson's A Celestial Atlas, but the addition of holes punched in them allowed them to be held up to a light to see a depiction of the constellation's stars.

500|$|Navigators {{often use}} star charts to {{identify}} a star by its position relative to other stars. [...] References like the Nautical Almanac and The American Practical Navigator provide four star charts, covering different portions of the celestial sphere. [...] Two of these charts are azimuthal equidistant projections of {{the north and south}} poles. [...] The other two cover the equatorial region of the celestial sphere, from the declination of 30° south to 30° north. [...] The two equatorial charts are mercator projections, one for the eastern hemisphere of the celestial sphere and one for the western hemisphere. [...] Note that unlike familiar maps, east is shown to the left and west is shown to the right. [...] With this orientation, the navigator can hold the <b>star</b> <b>chart</b> overhead, and the arrangement of the stars on the chart will resemble the stars in the sky.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is an {{archaeologist}} {{and the central}} protagonist of Prometheus. After discovering a series of identical cave paintings depicting a <b>star</b> <b>chart</b> with her lover, Charlie Holloway, they convince Weyland Corporation founder Peter Weyland to finance an expedition to a probable origin candidate: the moon LV-223. After arriving at the moon and awakening in 2093 on the ship, the USCSS Prometheus, Shaw and Holloway introduce their theory that the star charts were created by Engineers: a hypothetical, technologically advanced species which created humanity. Entering the structure covering the Engineer ship, the Juggernaut (near where the Prometheus settled), Shaw discovers many Engineer corpses and a preserved head—proving her and Holloway's theory. After having sex with an infected Holloway, Shaw is impregnated with an extraterrestrial organism which she has surgically removed. She meets Peter Weyland, who had faked his death to remain alive long enough to meet an Engineer in cryosleep so his youth could be restored. After talking to Janek about the Engineers, Shaw concludes that they intended to destroy humanity and joins Weyland's expedition. She is subdued after she demands that an Engineer tell her why they intended to destroy humanity. After seeing the Engineer decapitate David and kill the expedition's crew, Shaw convinces Janek to sacrifice the Prometheus by flying the ship into the Juggernaut. She returns to the Prometheus life-support unit, where the Engineer attacks her; he is subdued and impregnated by Shaw's extraterrestrial offspring. David convinces Shaw to return for his head and body so he can pilot another Engineer ship, and she asks him {{to take them to}} the Engineer's home world. With a final report to Earth detailing the events, Shaw and David leave the moon. After David, whom Shaw has repaired, unleashes the mutagen against the Engineers and their ship crashes, Shaw sends a transmission of her singing [...] "Take Me Home, Country Roads" [...] by John Denver. David later confesses to Walter that she [...] "did not die in the crash", as he initially claimed to the team from the colony ship Covenant, ten years after her disappearance. Walter later finds her dissected corpse, which David had used for his experiments to create a perfect version of the Alien, whilst Daniels finds sketches of what David had done to her.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965 {{newspaper}} {{reports of the}} Betty and Barney Hill abduction brought Greys to international attention. The alleged abductees, Betty and Barney Hill, claimed that in 1961, alien beings had abducted them and taken them to a flying saucer or saucer-shaped spaceship. (The term [...] "Greys" [...] did not come into usage until many years later, but the beings described by the Hills generally fit many characteristics of the Greys.) From a <b>star</b> <b>chart</b> reported by Betty Hill, Marjorie Fish, an elementary-school teacher and amateur astronomer, located the home planet of these beings in the Zeta Reticuli star system (allegedly the fourth planet {{of one of the}} stars of the Zeta Reticuli binary system).
