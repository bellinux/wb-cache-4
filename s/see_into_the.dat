In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a murder for which the suspect presents an incredible alibi—that the death was foretold by an old man able to <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> future. Upon investigating the case, the duo discover an increasingly bizarre {{series of events that}} leads Mulder to believe time travel is involved.|$|E

Elsewhere, a man named Martin (Guy Fauchon) is arrested after slitting a babysitter's throat at a public park; despite the seemingly random nature of the crime, Black believes that the man may be connected to Bletcher's murder. However, he soon starts to suspect that Martin may be innocent of the crime he has been arrested for. Black also has a dream in which a mutilated Bletcher tries and fails to speak to him, which leads Black to believe he has lost his ability to <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> minds of others.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah {{points out that}} he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (the only thing she had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> monster, she finds that {{a piece of the}} cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in her chest, allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E

5|$|They {{are taken}} {{to the home of}} the queen, which lies near the ruins of the lost city of Kôr, a once mighty {{civilisation}} that predated the Egyptians. The queen and her retinue live under a dormant volcano in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of Kôr. There, Holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named Ayesha. Her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. She, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. When she shows herself, however, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that she has learned the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, a form of telegnosis and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably unable to <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> future. She tells Holly that she has lived in the realm of Kôr for more than two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, Kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage). Later, when Holly inadvertently and secretly discovers Ayesha in her hidden chamber, he learns that she may have some degree of power to reanimate the dead.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the idea}} of shadows, a major theme that {{received}} considerable notice by the academic public was the literal liberation of the young female voice during the Hasenjagd and, consequently, during the war. Reichart allowed the reader to <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mind of a tormented, silenced girl, thus freeing her voice. Through Reichart's book, the Austrian readers could feel they were making a positive and progressive movement in history by becoming aware of {{the tragedy of the}} war, and accepting their place and major faults in it.|$|E
25|$|Janus {{frequently}} symbolized {{change and}} transitions {{such as the}} progress of past to future, from one condition to another, from one vision to another, and young people's growth to adulthood. He represented time, because he could <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> past with one face and into the future with the other. Hence, Janus was worshipped at {{the beginnings of the}} harvest and planting times, as well as at marriages, deaths and other beginnings. He represented the middle ground between barbarism and civilization, rural and urban space, youth and adulthood. Having jurisdiction over beginnings Janus had an intrinsic association with omens and auspices.|$|E

25|$|On {{the death}} of Bishop da Incarnacão on 22 November 1752, Fre. Teodoro de Santa Maria, O.S.A., was {{presented}} for the see and confirmed by the Holy See. He belonged to the priory at Saint Thomas, but hesitated to receive episcopal consecration. Two Italian Barnabites destined for the Apostolic vicariate of Burma came with letters of commendation to the bishop-elect, who welcomed and speeded them to their destination. At last Fre. Teodoro, the bishop-elect, renounced the <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hands of Fre. Bernardo de São Caetano, O.S.A., who was then consecrated bishop. Bishop Bernardo in turn consecrated {{one of the two}} Barnabites just mentioned, Dom Percotto, Bishop and Apostolic Vicar of Burma, in 1768. But Bishop Percotto did not reach the field of his labours, as on his voyage back to Burma the vessel foundered.|$|E
25|$|Crabbe's {{shift in}} {{approach}} {{was not necessarily}} a bad thing. The flaw in Crabbe's poetry, however, is, according to Hazlitt, that, with all its detail, it misses much of life, emphasising much too heavily the oppressive and the squalid, along with the mean and malicious tendencies of human nature. Hazlitt points to ways in which all this might be incorporated into literature and yet made uplifting, as in tragedy. With Crabbe, we get mostly the oppressive. In this, Hazlitt finds Crabbe unimaginative. It is not that he doesn't indulge in flights of fancy, but rather that he doesn't use his imagination to see, and help the reader <b>see,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> minds and hearts of the poor, to feel what they feel in their situation. Instead, scrutinizing in detail the squalor of their surroundings, he attributes to them feelings he would have in their place.|$|E

500|$|At the western, North Korean-held base of Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{were the}} villages of Ogok and Tundok, [...] from the crest. A north-south {{mountain}} trail crossed a high saddle just north of these villages and up the west slope about halfway {{to the top of}} Battle Mountain. This road gave the North Koreans an advantage in mounting and supplying their attacks in the area. A trail system ran from Ogok and Tundok to the crests of Battle Mountain and P'il-bong. From the top of Battle Mountain an observer could look directly down into the North Korean-held valley. At the same time, from Battle Mountain the North Koreans could look down into the Haman valley eastward and observe the US 24th Infantry command post, supply road, artillery positions, and approach trails. Whichever side held the crest of Battle Mountain could <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rear areas of the other. Both forces, seeing the advantages of holding the crest of Battle Mountain, fought relentlessly to capture it in a six-week-long battle.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} carry out executions, players must {{approach}} a hunter from behind, undetected. To facilitate this, each scene is full of [...] "dark spots" [...] (shadows where the player can hide). Enemies cannot <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows (unless they see the player actually entering the area). A standard technique in the game is {{to hide in the}} shadows and tap a wall {{to attract the attention of}} a nearby hunter. When the hunter has examined the area and is moving away, players can emerge from the shadows behind them, and execute them. The game has three levels of execution, with each level progressively more violent and graphic than the last: [...] "hasty" [...] executions are quick and not very bloody, [...] "violent" [...] are considerably more gory, and [...] "gruesome" [...] are over-the-top blood-soaked murders. Players are entirely in control of which level they use; once players have locked onto an enemy, the lock-on reticule changes color over time to indicate the three levels: white, yellow and red.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and had sexual {{intercourse}} with the men. Every man told her: [...] "Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to something that looked like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her relatives, and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. She saw that her master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> realm of the dead. The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story [...] "Völsa þáttr," [...] where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld.|$|E

500|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} borders separating the earthly and heavenly spheres are {{often seen in}} Netherlandish art, usually {{in the form of}} frames or arches. A boundary is achieved here with the grisaille archway, strongly reminiscent of van der Weyden's work. Art historians speculate Christus may have imitated his c. 1455 [...] Instead of merely imitating, Christus innovated and extended the use of van der Weyden's arch motif; his arch is meant to be an opening, or a screen, for the viewer to <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> holy space, instead of a simple framing device in which figures are placed directly in-line or under the arch. [...] The multi-hued threshold stones at the bottom emphasize its function says Upton, who writes: [...] "it is an opening through which one passes: a true frame or doorway to the picture... Yet, since this arch is painted in grisaille, distinct {{from the rest of the}} panel, it must also be seen as a separate entity, much like an elaborate border around an illuminated manuscript page." [...] The shadows cast by the grisaille figures stress [...] "its function as a diaphragm between real and illusory space".|$|E
500|$|Tite and Cubitt's {{design was}} based around a three-storey main building, {{separated}} from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines. The private access road was intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and to avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road. The ground floor contained a grand entrance hall and staircase for mourners attending first and second class funerals, a smaller entrance hall and staircase for those attending lower classes of funeral, and two mortuaries which occupied {{the majority of the}} floor. A large room adjacent to the mortuary held a reserve stock of around 300 coffins. [...] Most mourners would have commissioned their own coffins, or used coffins bought by the deceased during their lifetime but, explained an official of the LNC (in 1898) the reserve of coffins was kept so that [...] "should a guest die in a hotel, and the landlord wished to keep it quiet, we are notified, {{and in the middle of}} the night we come for the corpse, and take it away in one of our ready-made wooden overcoats". The first floor held the LNC's boardroom, the LNC's funerary workshops, a series of separate waiting rooms for those attending second and third class funerals, and the building's main toilets. The second floor, level with the LSWR railway line, held the train shed covering the two private rail lines and the single platform at which the trains stopped, eight or nine waiting rooms for first class mourners, and further toilets for their use. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level. A glass roof was positioned in order that no shadow be cast on the hearse carriage waiting at the platform at the time the trains were scheduled to depart, and the western wall was windowless to avoid passengers using the LSWR station being able to <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Necropolis station. Glass panels inset between the two rail lines allowed sunlight through to the private access road below. Unlike most railway stations of the period, the designs of the first, second and third class waiting rooms were largely identical with only superficial differences.|$|E
500|$|Lucan's {{friends and}} family were {{critical}} of the inquest, which they felt offered a one-sided view of events. His mother told reporters {{that it did not}} serve [...] "any useful purpose at all". Veronica's sister, Christina, said that she felt [...] "great sadness and sorrow" [...] at the verdict. Susan Maxwell-Scott continued to press the earl's claims of innocence and claimed to feel [...] "awfully sorry" [...] for the countess. However, as Lucan remained absent, his description of [...] "a traumatic night of unbelievable coincidence" [...] came only from the letters he authored and the people he spoke with soon after Rivett's murder. While his fingerprints were not found at the scene, his assertions make no provision for the lead pipe discovered in the boot of the Ford Corsair, the claims by some that he discussed murdering his wife, or the lack of a viable suspect for the man he claimed to have seen fighting her. No sign of a forced entry was found, and officers attempting to demonstrate that Lucan could have seen into the basement kitchen, from the street, could only do so by stooping low to the pavement. The basement light was not working, making it even more difficult to <b>see</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room; its lightbulb (which was tested and found to be in working order) was found removed from its holder and left lying on a chair. Furthermore, Lady Lucan claimed not to have entered the basement that night, contradicting the earl's version of events; his wife's account is supported by the forensic examination made of the blood splashes and stains around the property. Some traces of her blood were found in the basement, the rear garden and on the canvas sack used to store Rivett's body; this may have been due to contamination at the scene. The man Lucan claimed to have seen could not have left through the basement's front door as it was locked, and the rear door led to a walled garden through which no trace of an escape was found. No signs that the man left by the ground level front door were discovered, and no witnesses reported seeing any such person near 46Lower Belgrave Street.|$|E
