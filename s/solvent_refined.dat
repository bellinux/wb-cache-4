25|$|Coal {{can also}} be {{converted}} into synthetic fuels equivalent to gasoline or diesel by several different direct processes (which do not intrinsically require gasification or indirect conversion). In the direct liquefaction processes, the coal is either hydrogenated or carbonized. Hydrogenation processes are the Bergius process, the SRC-I and SRC-II (<b>Solvent</b> <b>Refined</b> Coal) processes, the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process and several other single-stage and two-stage processes. In the process of low-temperature carbonization, coal is coked at temperatures between 360 and 750°C (680 and 1,380°F). These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar. The coal tar is then further processed into fuels. An overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available.|$|E

The deposits were found to be mainly metal oxides. An equilibrium thermodynamic analysis was employed to predict the chemical composition of the deposits. The agreement between the predicted and observed compounds was excellent. No hot corrosion was observed.

30|$|Coal {{consists}} of two components—organic matter (carbonaceous matrix) and inorganic matter (mineral matter). Organic matter can be extracted using solvent extraction which leaves behind <b>solvent</b> <b>refined</b> clean coal product which has negligible ash contents (Kihong et al. 2016). The role of the solvent is to break the coal–coal interactions {{and replace it with}} the coal solvent interactions. Coal being a heterogeneous polymer shows a tendency to swell in organic solvents (Takanohashi and Iino 1995; Hernández et al. 2012; Hu et al. 1998; Mathews et al. 2015). Some solvents that have the characteristic property of donating a pair of electrons show good swelling. Mostly N and O donors are considered to be good solvents for coal extraction. Swelling gives a good idea of the extent of coal interaction with the solvent that may not necessarily always account for good extraction e.g. ethylenediammine (EDA) (Krevelen 1993). Early studies on coal extraction include the use of some basic solvents such as benzene, CHCl 3, alcohol, ether, carbon disulphide as reported by Van Krevalan (1993). Coal derived solvents are also used for extraction. Coal tar and coal tar pitch were used by Honda et al. Higher boiling fractions like anthracene oils gave better extraction yields (Mishra and Sharma 1990; Elliott 1981). About 95 % extraction yield has been reported by Orchin et al. with the use of boiling phenanthrene as a solvent (Krevelen 1993).|$|E

Entropy-enthalpy compensation {{data indicated that}} the mechanism of retention (first 6 BP) was the same for planar and nonplanar aromatic solutes, but it was less informative than the vector-analysis techniques of linear correlation coefficient and Euclidian distance calculations. The latter provided a quantitative comparison of the BP. All EA BP had close similarity except for TNFP. NH 2 and 5 -NO 2 were somewhat similar to the EA BP. PFPh was not similar to the other EA BP. The EA BP were also examined {{for their ability to}} group aromatic solutes of similar ring size regardless of alkyl substitution. A new performance parameter RΓ (group resolution) was proposed and applied to these data. Using the calculated values for RΓ, the group-resolution effectiveness of the various BP followed the sequence: DNAP ≫ DNPMP, TNPMP, 5 -NO 2 3 ̆e TNDBSP, DNBMP, DNBAP 3 ̆e NH 2 3 ̆e TNFP ≫ PFPh. Retention of aromatic solutes as a function of planarity was also investigated. DNPMP was found to be slightly better than DNAP at separating bridged biphenyls. DNPMP was packed into a 0. 32 -mm x 300 -mm microcapillary liquid chromatographic (μLC) column.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} pectate lyase E (PelE) {{has been determined}} by crystallographic techniques at a resolution of 2. 2 A. The model includes all 355 amino acids but no <b>solvent,</b> and <b>refines</b> to a crystallographic refinement factor of 20. 6 %. The polypeptide backbone folds into a large right-handed cylinder, termed a parallel [beta] helix. Loops of various sizes and conformations protrude from the central helix and probably confer function. A putative Ca 2 +-binding site {{as well as two}} cationic sites have been deduced from the location of heavy atom derivatives. Comparison of the PelE and recently determined pectate lyase C (PelC) structures has led to identification of a putative polygalacturonate-binding region in PelE. Structural differences relevant to differences in the enzymatic mechanism and maceration properties of PelE and PelC have been identified. The comparative analysis also reveals a large degree of structural conservation of surface loops in one region as well as an apparent aromatic specificity pocket in the amino-terminal branch. Also discussed is the sequence and possible functional relationship of the pectate lyases with pollen and style plant proteins...|$|R
