2500|$|In 1977, Australian punk {{band the}} Saints {{appeared}} when their minor hit [...] "This Perfect Day" [...] made the lower {{reaches of the}} chart. Singer Chris Bailey deliberately mimed the lyrics out of time before continuing to sing after allowing the microphone {{to fall out of}} his hand. Meanwhile, guitarist Ed Kuepper stood stock <b>still,</b> <b>staring</b> blankly away from the camera whilst strumming intermittently {{at a fraction of the}} fast pace of the guitar on the record.|$|E
60|$|Ernest, never speaking, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> at Fanny, gets clumsily out again.|$|E
60|$|He rose {{upon one}} elbow; she <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> upon him, white with horror.|$|E
60|$|After this {{there was}} silence for a while. Caligula <b>still</b> sat <b>staring</b> with wide-open eyes before him, whilst the slaves held their breath, staring fascinated on that terrible whip, lying {{momentarily}} forgotten.|$|R
60|$|The other {{continued}} <b>still</b> unruffled, and <b>staring</b> {{over the}} edge idly as an angler stares down at a stream.|$|R
60|$|The lad stood quite <b>still</b> {{a moment}} <b>staring</b> at him, and Winston {{returning}} his gaze steadily felt his pulses throb.|$|R
60|$|He was <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> at {{the plastic}} bag when the room outside vanished.|$|E
60|$|Evan was <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> back curiously at the beaming and bearded {{creature}} behind him.|$|E
60|$|The {{official}} was <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> at the body. He {{was a man}} of slow apprehension.|$|E
60|$|This was {{not merely}} {{the work of an}} aroused imagination, but had {{something}} sensible to go upon; sounds of a stealthy approach were no doubt audible; and while he <b>still</b> stood <b>staring</b> at the lumber, the voice of his host sounded suddenly, and with even more than the customary softness of enunciation, from behind.|$|R
6000|$|The Expressman's {{face was}} turned anxiously towards Bill, who, after a hurried gulp of his {{remaining}} liquor, <b>still</b> stood <b>staring</b> at the window. Then he slowly drew {{on one of}} his large gloves. [...] "Ye didn't," [...] he said, with a slow, drawling, but perfectly distinct, articulation, [...] "happen to know old 'Skinner' Hemmings when you were over there?" ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the floor}} {{against the wall}} {{was a pair of}} Indian clubs. He picked these up and {{examined}} them owlishly. He gave them little tentative jerks. Finally, with the air of a man carrying out a great resolution, he began to swing them. He swung them in slow, irregular sweeps, his eyes the while, <b>still</b> glassy, <b>staring</b> fixedly at the ceiling.|$|R
60|$|The Demon {{sank into}} a chair, nerveless and limp, but <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> fearfully at the boy.|$|E
60|$|Gregory put {{the pistol}} slowly down, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> at Syme {{as if he}} were a sea-monster.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stobell, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> in a stony fashion, nodded slowly; Mr. Chalk {{after an}} effort found his voice.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{from without}} came a shrill call {{and the sound}} of rapid footsteps. Ellen leaned against the wall, <b>staring</b> <b>still</b> at Colter. [...] "Hey, Jim--what's the shootin'?" [...] called Springer, breathlessly.|$|R
6000|$|Snap {{had turned}} toward the buck, but now he got a sudden attack of [...] "buck fever" [...] {{as it is called}} and stood stock <b>still,</b> with eyes <b>staring</b> from his head.|$|R
60|$|Throughout this {{furious and}} rapid passage, Lawless had looked on helplessly, {{and even when}} all was over, and Dick, already re-arisen to his feet, was {{listening}} with the most passionate attention to the distant bustle in the lower storeys of the house, the old outlaw was still wavering on his legs like a shrub in a breeze of wind, and <b>still</b> stupidly <b>staring</b> {{on the face of}} the dead man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I--er--this is most extraordinary!" [...] ejaculated the man, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> at {{the country}} youth. [...] "I don't {{understand}} it." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{left the}} room, and walked dreamily {{back to the}} Postage Department, leaving the manager <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> glassily at nothing.|$|E
60|$|For a space she sat <b>still,</b> <b>staring</b> blankly before her. She sighed, rubbed a knuckle in a reddened eye, rose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't leave me," [...] said Angela to Mr. Fraser. [...] "God give me {{strength}} to bear it," [...] she went on, beneath her breath. She was <b>still</b> standing <b>staring</b> vacantly towards the door, pale, and her bosom heaving. The intensity of her anxiety had {{to some extent}} communicated itself to Mr. Fraser, for there are few things so catching as anxiety, except enthusiasm; he, too, had risen, and was standing in an attitude of expectancy.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} {{backwardness}} in complying, for the freight looked {{too much for the}} boat; but on Riderhood's protesting 'that he had had half a dozen, dead and alive, in her afore now, and she was nothing deep in the water nor down in the stern even then, to speak of;' they carefully took their places, and trimmed the crazy thing. While they were doing so, Riderhood <b>still</b> sat <b>staring</b> disconsolate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Chloe--I mean aunt Dinah--do take Eunice--I mean Victorine and Una--away, and--you know--tidy them; and you, Sarah--it's Sarah, isn't it?--lay some {{refreshment}} in {{the parlor}} for this gentleman. And, Bob, tell your sister Cynthia to come here with Eunice." [...] As Bob <b>still</b> remained <b>staring</b> at Mr. Bowers, she added, in weary explanation, [...] "Mr. Bowers brought me over from the Summit woods in his buggy--it was so hot. There--shake hands and thank him, and run away--do!" ...|$|R
60|$|Julian was <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> {{from one}} to the other of his visitors. His {{expression}} of blank astonishment had scarcely decreased.|$|E
60|$|She moved {{a step or}} so toward me, <b>still</b> <b>staring,</b> {{and then}} someone intervened, and near beside her I saw young Verrall.|$|E
6000|$|He paused, then continued, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> at {{the sinking}} sun, which made his remarks about us, whom {{he did not}} seem to see, uncanny-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The Colonel stared. There was {{something}} about young Lennan {{that he had not}} noticed before; a 'Don't take liberties with me!' look that made things difficult. But <b>still</b> he lingered, <b>staring</b> wistfully at the young man, who stood waiting with such politeness. Then a safe question shot into his mind: ...|$|R
40|$|To any {{who fear}} {{they are not}} capable or worthy of a {{graduate}} degree: You can do this, and you are most definitely worthy. “The human race is challenged {{more than ever before}} to demonstrate our mastery- not over nature but of ourselves” ~Rachel Carson ii Acknowledgements I am indebted to many, including but not limited to: My committee members for guidance and expertise; my statistics group including Zoe Rodriguez del Rey and Sarah Freed (without whom I would <b>still</b> be <b>staring</b> at my field data); Zoe also provided tremendous help with GIS; my lab mates in the Center for Lakes an...|$|R
60|$|Then {{all at once}} {{a strange}} thing happened. The scowl went right off his face and the anger out of his eyes. He looked astonished, and then foolish. I saw the color {{creeping}} up into his cheeks. As for me, I <b>still</b> stood there <b>staring</b> at him, not able to say a single word.|$|R
60|$|Sam got a pinch on the {{arm from}} 'is pal that nearly made him scream, then they both stood <b>still,</b> <b>staring</b> at the docker.|$|E
60|$|Then, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> at them {{as though}} they held his eyes in their hearts, Rames departed, and the captain led them to their lodging.|$|E
60|$|She was {{standing}} stock <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> at the pastry she was making. She turned to me, {{and there was}} a curious smile about her lips.|$|E
60|$|She {{struggled}} to her feet; her knees shook under her: {{for the moment}} {{she could not have}} moved if her very life had depended on it. So she stood still, propped against the table, her hands clutching convulsively at its edge for support, and her eyes dilated and <b>staring,</b> <b>still</b> searching round the room wildly for the key.|$|R
6000|$|If {{anything}} {{be worth}} anything here below! Do {{you know the}} story of the man who found a button in his hash, and called the waiter? [...] "What do you call that?" [...] says he. [...] "Well," [...] said the waiter, [...] "what d'you expect? Expect to find a gold watch and chain?" [...] Heavenly apologue, is it not? I expected (rather) to find a gold watch and chain; I expected to be able to smoke to excess and drink to comfort all the days of my life; and I am <b>still</b> indignantly <b>staring</b> on this button! It's not even a button; it's a teetotal badge!--Ever yours, ...|$|R
6000|$|He <b>still</b> kept <b>staring</b> at the picture. By and by it {{faded away}} in part, {{and a very}} vivid {{recollection}} of the misty, midnight, moonlit walk he had once taken with her came back, and refilled the canvas with its magic. He saw the ruined furnace; the dark, overhanging masses of rock, the trembling intricacies of foliage, and, above all, the flash of dark eyes under a mantilla at his shoulder. What a fool he had been! Had he not really been as senseless and stupid as this very Concho, lying here like a log? And she had loved that man. What a fool she must have thought him that evening! What a snob she must think him now! ...|$|R
