40|$|<b>Signaling</b> <b>protocols</b> in {{switches}} {{are primarily}} implemented in software for two important reasons. First, <b>signaling</b> <b>protocols</b> are quite complex with many messages, parameters and procedures. Second, <b>signaling</b> <b>protocols</b> are updated often requiring {{a certain amount}} of flexibility for upgrading field implementations. While these are two good reasons for implementing <b>signaling</b> <b>protocols</b> in software, there is an associated performance penalty. Even with state-of-the-art processors, software implementations of <b>signaling</b> <b>protocol</b> are rarely capable of handling over 1000 calls/sec. Correspondingly, call setup delays per switch are in the order of milliseconds. Towards improving performance we implemented a <b>signaling</b> <b>protocol</b> in reconfigurable FPGA hardware. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of 100 x- 1000 x speedup vis-à-vis software implementations on state-of-the-art processors.

In order to avoid the fragmentation in the market, Femto Forum initially focused on these areas.

It includes the specification of <b>signalling</b> <b>protocol</b> Home Node B Application Part (HNBAP) and RANAP User Adaptation (RUA).
