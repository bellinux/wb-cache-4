40|$|The {{methodology}} {{for the design}} of error-actuated digital <b>set-point</b> <b>tracking</b> controllers proposed by Porter and co-workers has emerged {{as a result of the}} pursuit of effective and practical solutions to the problem of designing digital control systems for unknown, dynamically complex multivariable plants with measurable outputs. In this thesis, such digital <b>set-point</b> <b>tracking</b> controllers and the resulting digital <b>set-point</b> <b>tracking</b> systems are enriched to embrace plants with unmeasurable outputs and plants with more outputs than manipulated inputs. In the study of the latter plants, the novel concepts of limit tracking (i. e. the tracking exhibited by plants with more outputs than inputs) is introduced and an associated {{methodology for}} the design of self-selecting controllers is proposed. Such controllers involve the selection of different <b>set-point</b> <b>tracking</b> controllers to control the most critical subset of plant outputs based upon the developed rigorous theoretical foundations for the limit-tracking systems. In such foundations, the classification of linear multivariable plants into Class I and Class II plants based upon their steady-state transfer function matrices facilitates the assessment of the feasibility of limit-tracking systems. Furthermore, the associated order-reduction technique simplifies the problem of deciding the minimum numbers of different subsets of plant outputs to be controlled by corresponding <b>set-point</b> <b>tracking</b> controllers. In addition, the dynamical properties of limit-tracking systems are also investigated using the phase-plane method and a methodology {{for the design of}} supervisory self-selecting controllers is proposed so as to prevent the occurrence of dynamical peculiarities such as limit-cycle oscillations which might happen in limit-tracking systems. The effectiveness of all the proposed methodologies and techniques is illustrated by examples, and the robustness properties of <b>set-point</b> <b>tracking</b> systems and limit-tracking systems in the face of plant variations and unknown disturbances are tested. Finally, self-selecting controllers are designed for a nonlinear gas-turbine engine and their practical effectiveness is clearly demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|To {{eliminate}} the steady-state error of systems with periodic disturbance, the repetitive control (RC) {{is a useful}} approach. For practical applications, the controller is designed to both steer system output to a given <b>set-point</b> (or <b>track</b> a given reference signal) and reject periodic disturbance. The learning procedure of RC and the control action to steer system output to a set-point may influence each other and prolong the convergence time RC. In order to reduce this interaction, this paper proposes a separated design approach. A linear parameter varying (LPV) system is considered. A repetitive predictive control (RPC) and a robust model predictive control (RMPC) are separately designed, respectively, corresponding to reject the periodic disturbance and steer system output to the set-point. The convergence of the proposed RPC sub-controller is derived. The numerical examples show that the proposed design is effective. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigates a {{pneumatic suspension}} system containing an air spring, air flow valve, and an accumulator, where {{the spring and}} damping functions are combined into one package. The spring and accumulator provide the spring characteristics, and the computer controlled adjustable valve provides the damping characteristics by automatically adjusting the air flow between the air spring and the accumulator. An extensive analysis and investigation of the plant dynamics is performed. A dynamic plant model is developed and tuned to experimental data. The plant model is then used {{in the design of}} a semi-active control system. A detailed description of the model tuning procedure is provided. Based upon the insights gained through analysis and system identification, a semi-active control methodology is developed, which exploits certain unique features of the system. Three potential controllers are developed and compared, where each controller uses different measurement feedback signals. However, all three controllers measure direct force generation through a pressure feedback signal. Both experimental and simulation data for the controllers is provided. The first controller uses an LQI (Linear Quadratic Impulse) optimal solution, based on Covariance Control Theory, to generate an optimal 2 ̆ 2 active 2 ̆ 2 damping control force, along with a <b>Set-Point</b> plus PI <b>tracking</b> controller to adjust the valve opening to cause the system to track this desired force during a switching event or control window of opportunity. The second controller uses a Modified Skyhook solution to generate the ideal tracking signal, along with a <b>Set-Point</b> plus PI <b>tracking</b> controller. The LQI controller is used in simulation (offline) to aid in setting the skyhook gain on the Modified Skyhook controller. The third controller uses a Relative Displacement solution to generate the ideal tracking signal, along with a <b>Set-Point</b> plus PI <b>tracking</b> controller. The LQI controller is used (offline) to aid in setting the gain on the Relative Displacement controller. This controller is probably the most useful for vehicular applications, since only relative coordinates and a pressure are required for feedback.

These two controllers can be designed independently to achieve good system performance for both <b>set-point</b> <b>tracking</b> and load rejection. Also, good robustness of the double-controller scheme to variations in system dynamics can be obtained by properly designing the load controller.

The current state-of-art is to decompose the optimizationinto the so-called two-layered structure, including real time optimization (RTO) and advancedcontrol. Due to model discrepancy and inconsistent time scales in different layers,this structure may render suboptimal solutions. Therefore, the dynamic real time optimization(D-RTO) or economically-oriented nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) that directly optimizes the economic performance based on first-principle dynamic modelsof processes has become an emerging technology. However, {{the integration of the}} firstprincipledynamic models is likely to introduce large scale optimization problems, whichneed to be solved online. The associated computational delay may be cumbersome for theonline applications. We first derive a first-principle dynamic model for an industrial air separation unit (ASU). The recently developed advanced step method is used to solve both <b>set-point</b> <b>tracking</b> andeconomically-oriented NMPC online. It shows that <b>set-point</b> <b>tracking</b> NMPC based on thefirst-principle model has superior performance against that with linear data-driven model. In addition, the economically-oriented NMPC generates around 6 % cost reduction comparedto <b>set-point</b> <b>tracking</b> NMPC. Moreover the advanced step method reduces the onlinecomputational delay by two orders of magnitude. Then we deal with a realistic <b>set-point</b> <b>tracking</b> control scenario that requires achievingoffset-free behavior in the presence of plant-model mismatch. Moreover, a state estimatoris used to reconstruct the plant states from outputs. We propose two formulations usingNMPC and moving horizon estimation (MHE) and we show both approaches are offsetfreeat steady state. Moreover, the analysis can be extended to NMPC coupled with othernonlinear observers. This strategy is implemented on the ASU process. After that, we study the robust stability of output-feedback NMPC in the presence of plantmodelmismatch. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is a widely-used technologyin industry is chosen as the state estimator. First we analyze the stability of the estimationerror and a separation-principle-like result indicates that the stability result is the same asthe closed-loop case. We further study the impact of this estimation error on the robuststability of the NMPC. Finally, nominal stability is analyzed for the D-RTO, i. e. economically-oriented NMPC,for cyclic processes. Moreover, two economically-oriented NMPC formulations with guaranteednominal stability are proposed. They ensure the system converges to the optimalcyclic steady state...|$|E
