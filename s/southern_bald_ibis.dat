50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is part of}} {{the genus}} Geronticus, which {{includes}} two distinct species. The <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> (Geronticus calvus) is restricted primarily to the southern regions of Africa whereas its counterpart, the waldrapp (Geronticus eremita) is found in the northern regions of the continent. Both species share common characteristics regardless of their geographic separation. Both species nest on rock cliffs and display distinct breeding behaviours adapted for their particular locations. Similarly, they both show evolutionary adaptations in foraging behaviours due to their dry habitats. The separation between these two species is believed to have occurred relatively recently. This separation, between G. calvus and G. eremita, is believed to have occurred only 335 000 to 1 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|The {{guidelines}} for the conservation and reintroduction of the northern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> were established in 2003 at an International Advisory Group for Northern <b>Bald</b> <b>Ibis</b> (IAGNBI) conference in Innsbruck at the Alpenzoo, which maintains the European studbook for the northern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> is {{currently}} listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, {{there is no}} immediate threat of the species going extinct. The bird is also listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), signifying that the trade of this species is substantially regulated.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is part of}} the family, Threskiornithidae, {{which is}} {{composed}} of birds from the warm temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the exclusion of Oceania. The group is defined by the lack of feathers on their face. This family is composed of the ibises and their close relatives, the spoonbills.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> (Geronticus calvus) {{is a large}} bird {{found in}} open {{grassland}} or semi-desert {{in the mountains of}} southern Africa.Taxonomically, it is most closely related to its counterpart in the northern regions of Africa, the waldrapp (Geronticus eremita).

50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is known}} to be a {{relatively}} quiet bird. This species in particular has been noted to make a weak gobbling sound. This is refers back to their old Afrikaans name of “Wilde-Kalkoen”, otherwise translated as “wild turkey”. This bird is most boisterous in the nesting areas and in flight. It projects a high-pitched keeaaw-klaup-klaup call, resembling that of a turkey’s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> is a {{bird that}} feeds and roosts in large groups. They travel in groups of up to 100 {{individuals}} to find suitable foraging areas. As insectivores, their diet is composed mainly of insects and other small invertebrates found in burnt grasslands. The species live on cliff edges where they build their nests {{and for the most}} part, breed in colonies. They do little vocalizing besides occasional gobbling sounds.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> is {{a species}} {{with a very}} {{restricted}} homerange.

50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> nests in {{cliffs and}} breeds on open ledges. Due to the mostly {{inaccessible}} {{nature of these}} areas, observations during breeding season are difficult to obtain. However, these birds are known to predominantly breed in colonies, while some pairs decide to nest away from the rest. The females lay their eggs anywhere from late July to mid-October. Following this, the young develop feathers for flight around mid-October and into the month of December.|$|E
50|$|The ibises are gregarious, long-legged {{wading birds}} with long down-curved bills. Along with the spoonbills they form one {{subfamily}} within the Threskiornithidae family. The northern bald ibis' closest relative, {{and the only}} other member of the genus, is the <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis,</b> G. calvus, of southern Africa. The two Geronticus species differ from other ibises in that they have unfeathered faces and heads, breed on cliffs rather than in trees, and prefer arid habitats to the wetlands used by their relatives.|$|E
50|$|Geronticus {{contains}} two living species. The {{northern bald ibis}} (G. eremita) has a neck crest of elongated feathers. It is a Critically Endangered species found around the Mediterranean. Its range had expanded after the last glacial period to the Alps of Germany and even a bit further north, but it was rendered extinct there mainly due to habitat destruction and unsustainable hunting. The <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> (G. calvus) with a red crown patch but no crest is classified as Vulnerable and is found in subtropical southern Africa.|$|E

The Komati Gorge is situated in {{the upper reaches of}} the Komati River and is the habitat of some endangered species such as the <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis.</b> [...] In 2001 the 115 m high wall of the Maguga Dam was completed south of Piggs Peak, Swaziland, [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} {{bald ibis}} is readily distinguished from its close relative, the <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> of Southern Africa, by the southern species' whitish face. The northern bald can also {{be confused with the}} similarly dark-plumaged glossy ibis, which overlaps its range, but it is larger and stockier than that species. In flight, when the bill and face colouration may not be visible, the bald ibis' less rounded wings and shorter neck give it a different profile from glossy ibis, and its relatively short legs mean that its feet do not project beyond the tail, unlike those of the glossy ibis.|$|E
5000|$|The Komati Gorge {{contains}} a great diversity of flora and fauna, including many large mammalian species. There are several discrete types of habitat present, including riparian zone, bluff habitat, thorn bushveld and highveld grassland. The river provides not only water for wildlife and aquatic vegetation, but also supports a robust riverine trout fishery. The bluffs support a very specialized ecosystem including vegetation {{adapted to the}} steep rocky vertical landform of the gorge sides. [...] In addition there are favourable opportunities for bird habitat, providing more protection from certain predators; for example the threatened <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> inhabits these cliff habitats.|$|E

50|$|The {{main cause}} of {{breeding}} failure at the Souss-Massa National Park {{is the loss of}} eggs to predators, especially the common raven which nest monitoring has shown to have had a serious impact at one sub-colony. The effects of predators on adult birds have not been studied, but the very similar <b>southern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis,</b> Geronticus calvus, is hunted by large raptors, particularly those that share its breeding cliffs. There is evidence of chick starvation in some years, but the main threats to breeding birds are human disturbance and the loss of feeding habitat. There was a dramatic mortality incident at the Moroccan colonies in May 1996, when 40 adults died or disappeared over a period of nine days. Although analyses have not identified the cause, an obscure virus, a toxin, or botulism are thought to be the most likely causes of the deaths.|$|E
40|$|MSc., Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 A {{selection}} of southern African bird species were modelled {{in terms of}} the probability of these species colliding with or being electrocuted on overhead power lines in South Africa, based on morphological and behavioral factors. Species were included in the model on the basis of internationally recognized vulnerability to these interactions at the family level. The collision model performed poorly when tested against the actual reported mortalities for species contained in the Eskom-EWT Strategic Partnership Central Incident Register CIR) (chi-square of goodness of fit) at the individual species, family and within family levels. The electrocution model performed slightly better at the family, and within family level. Both collision and electrocution models performed better for the physically larger species (and families) and for those species with higher modelled probability of collision or electrocution. As the product of random carcass detection and reporting, the CIR data are biased in various ways. Testing the models against the CIR is therefore equally important for highlighting inadequacies in the CIR, as in the model. A number of new species have emerged as being of high collision (including most importantly African Pygmy Goose, Southern Ground Hornbill, Black-bellied Bustard, Yellow-throated Sandgrouse, Caspian Tern, Hooded Vulture, Bateleur, African Marsh Harrier, Black Harrier, Pink-backed Pelican and Yellow-billed Stork) or electrocution (<b>Southern</b> <b>Bald</b> <b>Ibis)</b> probability in theoretical terms, and will require further investigation to determine their actual probability of interaction. By mapping the combined distributions of those species with high probabilities of collision and/or electrocution mortality, a number of priority high risk geographic areas emerge around the country...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenically induced climate change, {{coupled with}} the {{volatility}} of world oil markets, has accelerated the global implementation {{of a variety of}} renewable energy technologies (RETs). The southern African nation of Lesotho aims to utilise its aeolian resources by harnessing the power of the wind through the development of wind farms. The Lesotho government has approved the development of a 42 turbine wind farm in the Maluti-Drakensberg in north-eastern Lesotho. The development of a wind farm in this area is predicted to result in significant negative impacts on globally important populations of Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus and Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres, in addition to six other red-listed species, including Black Stork Ciconia nigra and <b>Southern</b> <b>Bald</b> <b>Ibis</b> Geronticus calvus. Concern over the impacts of wind farms on Lesotho's avifauna has resulted in calls for the development of an avian sensitivity map. Sensitivity maps have been developed in many countries, including South Africa, in order to provide locational guidance for the siting of wind farms and indicate areas where the development of wind farms could potentially result in negative impacts on sensitive bird species. This study has developed an avian sensitivity map for Lesotho by creating a species sensitivity index to determine the potential sensitivity of Lesotho's avifauna to wind farms and then mapping the distributions of 14 bird species considered most at risk to identify areas of "medium", "high", "very high", "maximum" and"unknown" senstivity. Individual species maps were converted to 1 -km square resolution allowing for a Composite scoring map, selecting the highest sensitivity score for each square, and a Cumulative scoring map, summing all sensitivity score within each square, to be created...|$|E
