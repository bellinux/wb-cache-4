5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with 3D printing equipment. The parts included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door <b>support</b> <b>struts.</b> The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, {{with some of the}} parts costing less than £100 per piece to manufacture, 3D printing already resulted in savings of more than £300,000 and would offer further potential cost savings of more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E

[...] The barrel sections are joined together by five major ring frames. [...] These ring frames receive and distribute loads. [...] The forward dome-to-barrel frame distributes the loads applied through the intertank structure and is also the flange for attaching the LH2 tank to the intertank. [...] The aft major ring receives orbiter-induced loads from the aft orbiter <b>support</b> <b>struts</b> and SRB-induced loads from the aft SRB <b>support</b> <b>struts.</b> [...] The remaining three ring frames distribute orbiter thrust loads and LOX feedline support loads. [...] Loads from the frames are then distributed through the barrel skin panels. [...] The LH2 tank has a volume of [...] at 29.3 psig (3.02 bar absolute) and [...] (cryogenic).|$|E

50|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of reflecting telescope designs, the secondary mirror has to be positioned at the central axis of the telescope and so has to be held by struts within the telescopes tube. No matter how fine these support rods are they diffract the incoming light from a subject star and this appears as diffraction spikes which are the Fourier transform of the <b>support</b> <b>struts.</b> The spikes represent a loss of light that could have been used to image the star.|$|E
50|$|Stinson {{therefore}} redesigned {{the aircraft}} with shorter span wings, shorter fuselage and {{a choice of}} less powerful engines as the SM-2 Junior. The aircraft was a strut-braced high-wing monoplane with a sturdy outrigger undercarriage which was braced against the wing <b>support</b> <b>struts</b> and the initial 110 h.p. Warner Scarab engine was normally left uncowled. The first SM-2 flew in mid-1928 and deliveries commenced that year. Later versions of the SM-2 had higher-powered engines of between 165 h.p. and 225 h.p.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes each wing {{has just}} a single lift strut, as on the Cessna 152, but they often come in pairs, {{sometimes}} parallel as on the Catalina, sometimes splayed or as V-form pairs (e.g. Auster Autocrat) joined to the fuselage at a single point. Many more complicated arrangements have been used, often with two primary lift struts augmented by auxiliary interconnections known as jury struts between each other or to the wing or the fuselage. Each pair of the inverted V struts of the Pawnee, for example, is assisted {{by a pair of}} vertical <b>support</b> <b>struts.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The 4300 Moguls {{were the}} maids of all {{work on the}} GWR network and later the Western Region of British Railways. Employing a Standard number 4 boiler and the <b>support</b> <b>struts</b> similar to those fitted to the '2800' class, the class very quickly earned an {{excellent}} reputation {{in its ability to}} handle most types of traffic, from local stopping goods to main line expresses.

50|$|According to a 2001 {{study by}} the civil {{engineering}} department of the University of Minnesota, cracking had been previously discovered in the cross girders {{at the end of}} the approach spans. The main trusses connected to these cross girders and resistance to motion at the connection point bearings was leading to unanticipated out-of-plane distortion of the cross girders and subsequent stress cracking. The situation was addressed prior to the study by drilling the cracks to prevent further propagation and adding <b>support</b> <b>struts</b> to the cross girder to prevent further distortion. The report also noted a concern about lack of redundancy in the main truss system, which meant the bridge had a greater risk of collapse in the event of any single structural failure. Although the report concluded that the bridge should not have any problems with fatigue cracking in the foreseeable future, regular inspection, structural health monitoring, and use of strain gauges had been suggested.|$|E
5000|$|This 368’ (112m) long steel {{stressed}} ribbon/arch combination {{bridge is}} {{the first of its kind}} in North America. A steel arch with a span of 163’ (49.5m) supports steel stress ribbons and precast concrete planks over the river complementing the adjacent historic Lancaster Avenue vehicular bridge. The arch spans the entire river and the steel stress ribbons rest upon the arch. The minimal sag profile of the stressed ribbons creates major tension loads which are balanced against the thrust loading in the opposite direction caused by the steel arch. The balancing of these opposing loads minimizes the required size of the foundations. Pre-fabricated concrete planks have been anchored directly to the steel stress ribbons to form the bridge walkway, eliminating the need for temporary scaffolding in the river and on the adjacent shorelines. The absence of vertical <b>support</b> <b>struts</b> reduces horizontal loads created by periodic river flooding. At night, the bridge is illuminated by a combination of white and blue LED lights.|$|E
50|$|To {{make the}} march across the continent, Octavian {{receives}} {{help from the}} great fury Alera and the northern icemen to coat the north in {{a thick layer of}} ice, as well as cause hurricane strength winds that constantly blow east. He has his engineers rig their ships that they used to sail from Canea with steel keels and <b>support</b> <b>struts,</b> so that they can sail across the ice like giant sleighs. While Octavian's forces are on the march, Riva falls to the Queen's onslaught. Her vast number of troops are bolstered by the feral furies of all the Alerans the Vord have slain, and Aquitainus is forced to retreat and evacuate civilians to the Calderon valley, where Bernard and Amara, Octavian's uncle and his wife, have been fortifying the valley in preparation for the Vord. During the assault, Aquitainus makes a show of claiming new furies to bolster his power in an attempt to draw out his wife Invidia, who had betrayed to the Vord and become the Queen's right hand. He succeeds but loses the ensuing fight, and is mortally wounded while Invidia escapes.|$|E
5000|$|Some multihulls use three foils; {{two main}} forward foils provide lift {{so that the}} boat [...] "flies" [...] while a {{horizontal}} foil on the rudder is trimmed to drive and control altitude. On catamarans, a single main foil can be attached between the hulls {{just in front of}} the center of gravity and at 2 degrees of incidence, spanning the tunnel with <b>supporting</b> <b>struts.</b> Hydrofoil catamarans are also called foilcats.|$|R
40|$|Background {{noise levels}} are {{measured}} in the NASA Ames Research Center 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel following installation of a sound-absorbent lining on the test-section walls. Results show that the fan-drive noise dominated the empty test-section background noise at airspeeds below 120 knots. Above 120 knots, the test-section broadband background noise was dominated by wind-induced dipole noise (except at lower harmonics of fan blade-passage tones) most likely generated at the microphone or microphone <b>support</b> <b>strut.</b> Third-octave band and narrow-band spectra are presented for several fan operating conditions and test-section airspeeds. The background noise levels can be reduced by making improvements to the microphone wind screen or <b>support</b> <b>strut.</b> Empirical equations are presented relating variations of fan noise with fan speed or blade-pitch angle. An empirical expression for typical fan noise spectra is also presented. Fan motor electric power consumption {{is related to the}} noise generation. Preliminary measurements of sound absorption by the test-section lining indicate that the 152 mm thick lining will adequately absorb test-section model noise at frequencies above 300 Hz...|$|R
40|$|Velocity {{measurements}} {{were made in}} the near wake of the front wheel of a Formula One car using a laser Doppler anemometer. Tests were carried out on a 50 % scale in a closed-return three-quarter open-jet wind tunnel. Three configurations were investigated to determine the effect of both the car and an external wheel <b>support</b> <b>strut</b> on the wheel wake. In each of the configurations the test Reynolds number, based on the wheel diameter, was 6. 8 × 105. Three components of the velocity were measured at two planes less than than 1. 0 D(whereDis the wheel diameter) downstream of the wheel axis. These data were used to visualise the extent of the wake, the flow structures present and also the streamwise turbulence intensity. The presence of the car was found to alter significantly the structure of the wheel wake when compared with an isolated wheel. In addition, the external <b>support</b> <b>strut</b> was found to have less impact {{in the presence of the}} car than previous isolated wheel studies have suggested. No previous such studies appear to have been published in the open literature...|$|R
