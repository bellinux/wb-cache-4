The two are divided by Islands Brow road and Snookerpool Avenue and are bordered {{on the west side}} by the rail line {{connecting}} Liverpool Lime Street with Wigan North Western. They are {{on the site of the}} old Rushy Park coal mine noted as the first mine to use the revolutionary Anderton <b>shearer-loader.</b> The slag heaps were created by the dumping of toxic chemical waste from the manufacture of glass by the towns Pilkington company. The exact composition of the slag heaps is unknown but a land study showed it to contain various poisonous elements such as Arsenic, Lead and Cadmium. Technically the land is private property belonging to Pilkington but the public have access and regularly use it for various activities. The exact age of the Burgies is unknown, however it is understood that the second burgies is actually the oldest. This older one is sometimes referred to as [...] "the dry Burgies" [...] with the newer first burgies referred to as [...] "the wet Burgies". These terms are used by older residents who remember the actual construction, as the first one is a drier waste with the second one being a thick liquid. This liquid was pumped through a pipe from Pilkingtonâ€™s across the second Burgies to the site of the first Burgies. Boards were erected as moulds to hold the liquid until it dried and then moulds were built on top of these to allow more liquid to be placed on top.On the evening of 18th July, 2017 a Chinook helicopter flew towards the area after self professed [...] "King of the Burgies" [...] Kev Gill declared Parr and Fingerpost independent states.|$|E

With an activated system the tractive effort on chains - the recognized feasibility limit for coal plough operation - could be reduced substantially (for identical coalwinning performance). With varying impact frequencies, clear trends could be plotted. The knowledge gained with respect to individual tools was made use of for the concept of an overall coalwinning system with a specially matched drive technology for engineering research. The cutting trials have shown that, in comparison to conventional coal plough systems, the new activated coalwinning machine brings about higher coalwinning performance in solid coal normally to be cut with difficulties or even extreme difficulties, and in the adjacent rock, in low worked thickness up to present out of the cost-effective application range of drum <b>shearer-loaders.</b> (orig.)
