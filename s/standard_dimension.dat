50|$|The use of modules in {{the fine}} arts has a long {{pedigree}} among diverse cultures. In the classical architecture of Greco-Roman antiquity, the module was utilized as a standardized unit of measurement for proportioning {{the elements of a}} building. Typically the module was established as one-half the diameter of the lower shaft of a classical column; all the other components in the syntax of the classical system were expressed as a fraction or multiple of that module. In traditional Japanese construction, room sizes were often determined by combinations of standard rice mats called tatami; the <b>standard</b> <b>dimension</b> of a mat was around 3 feet by 6 feet, which approximate the overall proportions of a reclining human figure. The module thus becomes not only a proportional device for use with three-dimensional vertical elements but a two-dimensional planning tool as well.|$|E

50|$|The {{thicknesses}} of {{the water}} pipe and tube walls can vary. Pipe wall thickness is denoted by various schedules or for large bore polyethylene pipe in the UK by the <b>Standard</b> <b>Dimension</b> Ratio (SDR), defined as {{the ratio of the}} pipe diameter to its wall thickness. Pipe wall thickness increases with schedule, and is available in schedules 20, 40, 80, and higher in special cases. The schedule is largely determined by the operating pressure of the system, with higher pressures commanding greater thickness. Copper tubing is available in four wall thicknesses: type DWV (thinnest wall; only allowed as drain pipe per UPC), type 'M' (thin; typically only allowed as drain pipe by IPC code), type 'L' (thicker, standard duty for water lines and water service), and type 'K' (thickest, typically used underground between the main and the meter). Because piping and tubing are commodities, having a greater wall thickness implies higher initial cost. Thicker walled pipe generally implies greater durability and higher pressure tolerances.|$|E

5000|$|These have {{standard}} size and shapes. These may be further divided into standard shapes and special shapes. Standard shapes have dimension that are conformed by most refractory manufacturers and are generally applicable to kilns or furnaces {{of the same}} types. Standard shapes are usually firebrick that have a <b>standard</b> <b>dimension</b> of 9 x 4-1/2 x 2-1/2 inches and this dimension is called a [...] "one brick equivalent". [...] "Brick equivalents" [...] are used in estimating how many firebrick {{it takes to make}} an installation into an industrial furnace. Special shapes are specifically made for particular kilns or furnaces.Precast refractory shape technology has become a specialized field within the refractory industry in recent years. As demands increase for greater refractory lining performance and lower maintenance costs, refractory users are finding that one effective way to achieve those goals is to incorporate a broader use of precast refractory shapes into their lining systems. Across virtually all industries - petrochemical, steel, power generation, metal casting and treatment, wood products, minerals processing and others - the applications for precast shapes are limited only by the imagination, and almost invariably their use results in better performance and lower cost. This article discusses the design and manufacture of precast refractory shapes, and the benefits to material properties and installation logistics.|$|E
50|$|When Yuya awakens in the <b>Standard</b> <b>Dimension</b> {{that has}} been reborn as the Pendulum Dimension, he had no memory of his {{experience}} across the dimensions or of Zuzu until Declan restored his memories and everyone else's with a reenactment of the Arc League Championship. Declan reveals that Riley used {{a moment in the}} dimensional divide to transfer Zarc's essence from Yuya into herself to keep the evil spirit from being scattered across the dimensions again. Riley turned into a catatonic infant girl as a consequence of her action. Declan fears that Zarc may eventually take over Riley's body and resume his rampage again. Yuya is told that only he, as Zarc's essence, can stop Zarc for good by using his Dueltaining skills to make Riley smile and pacify the possessing spirit. Yuya proceeds to travel to other dimensions and defeat the other Lancers with Riley watching the footage. On his way, Yuya finds Zuzu and her counterparts still inside the Arc-V Reactor in an inactive state. Though his counterparts help him tame the Four Dragons, Yuya learns he made no progress with Riley. He convinces Declan to let him take the professional duelist test right after he got promoted into Senior class, and Declan became his opponent. Learning who Zarc was in his life, Yuya and his counterparts manage to defeat Declan and pacify their past counterpart. This act awakened Ray, who appears in the Pendulum Dimension and revives as Zuzu, with her counterparts now a part of her, similar to Yuya's case. The two of them are reunited at last.|$|E

When hidden variables are present, however, <b>standard</b> <b>dimension</b> might no longer be appropriate. One should instead use effective dimension (Geiger et al. 1996). This paper is concerned with the computation of effective dimension. First we present an upper bound on the effective dimension of a latent class (LC) model. This bound is tight and its computation is easy. We then consider a generalization of LC models called hierarchical latent class (HLC) models (Zhang 2002). We show that the effective dimension of an HLC model can be obtained from the effective dimensions of some related LC models. We also demonstrate empirically that using effective dimension in place of <b>standard</b> <b>dimension</b> improves the quality of models learned from data.
