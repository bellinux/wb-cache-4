25|$|In other instances, {{molecular}} {{interactions between}} gas molecules previously adsorbed on a solid surface form significant interactions with gas molecules in the gaseous phases. Hence, adsorption of gas molecules {{to the surface}} {{is more likely to}} occur around gas molecules that are already present on the solid surface, rendering the Langmuir adsorption isotherm ineffective for the purposes of modelling. This effect was studied in a system where nitrogen was the adsorbate and tungsten was the adsorbent by Paul Kisliuk (1922–2008) in 1957. To compensate for the increased probability of adsorption occurring around molecules present on the substrate surface, Kisliuk developed the precursor state theory, whereby molecules would enter a precursor state at the interface between the <b>solid</b> <b>adsorbent</b> and adsorbate in the gaseous phase. From here, adsorbate molecules would either adsorb to the adsorbent or desorb into the gaseous phase. The probability of adsorption occurring from the precursor state is dependent on the adsorbate’s proximity to other adsorbate molecules that have already been adsorbed. If the adsorbate molecule in the precursor state is in close proximity to an adsorbate molecule that has already formed on the surface, it has a sticking probability reflected {{by the size of the}} SE constant and will either be adsorbed from the precursor state at a rate of kEC or will desorb into the gaseous phase at a rate of kES.

50|$|Frequently, porous {{adsorbents}} {{with large}} surface areas, but only weak adsorption sites, lack sufficient capacity for CO2 under realistic conditions.

Amine impregnated solids utilize the well-established acid-base chemistry of CO2 with amines, but dilute the amines by containing them within the pores of solids rather than as H2O solutions.

40|$|In {{the recent}} past carbon dioxide capture from gas streams has been done using {{multiple}} methods. These methods include cryogenic, membrane, O 2 /CO 2 recycle combustion systems, physical absorption, and chemical absorption. The most common of these methods is chemical absorption, which typically uses primary and secondary amines. MEA and DEA {{are the most common}} amines used for carbon dioxide capture. These amines bind carbon dioxide at a 2 : 1 molar ratio. These systems are liquid systems that require large amounts of energy for regeneration and recirculation. Liquid amine systems typically bind 2. 5 to 4 mol CO 2 /kg absorbent at the 2 : 1 molar ratio. Liquid tertiary amines and amidines have been shown to bind carbon dioxide at a 1 : 1 molar ratio, thereby reducing the volume of amine, but the binding is much slower. Amine blends have been used to compensate for this difference. In order to reduce regeneration and recirculation costs and increase CO 2 binding capacity <b>solid</b> <b>adsorbents</b> are being considered. <b>Solid</b> <b>adsorbents</b> using amidines allow for low regeneration costs and twice the carbon dioxide capacity per mol of adsorbent. This research focuses on the creation of amidine functionalized <b>solid</b> <b>adsorbents</b> to bind carbon dioxide in the presence of water. Amidine and guanidine functional groups increase capacity for carbon dioxide binding. Several amidine compounds and a guanidine containing compound have been synthesized and show increased binding capacity of carbon dioxide compared to conventional liquid systems. By reducing molecular weight of the nonbinding portion of the polymer, an amidine polymer can bind almost two times that of the other adsorbents created. The polyamidine bound 9. 30 mol CO 2 /kg polymer while the polyguanidine bound over 6 mol CO 2 /kg polymer. These experiments were done in a 10 mL batch reactor at 45 psi at room temperature. Water (liquid) was added prior to the experiment at a 1 : 1 molar ratio with the binding sites in the polymer.
