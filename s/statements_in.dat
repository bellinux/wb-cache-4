5|$|All of the Peano axioms {{except the}} ninth axiom (the {{induction}} axiom) are <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication {{and the order}} relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), {{but it can be}} transformed into a first-order axiom schema of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of Independent Counsel, on March 20, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno requested that Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr expand his inquiry to specifically include the travel office affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> previous testimony to the GAO, Congress, or the Independent Counsel.|$|E

50|$|The {{validity}} of the Principle of Plane Duality follows from the axiomatic definition of a projective plane. The three axioms of this definition can be written {{so that they are}} self-dual statements implying that the dual of a projective plane is also a projective plane. The dual of a true <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> a projective plane is therefore a true <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> the dual projective plane and the implication is that for self-dual planes, the dual of a true <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> that plane is also a true <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> that plane.|$|R
5|$|At the 2002 general {{election}} only the manifestos of the Green Party and the Labour Party explicitly {{referred to the}} rights of same-sex couples, but from 2004 all political parties, including the then Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Government, produced polices or made <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> favour of varying forms of recognition. In 2004, Fine Gael was the first party to launch an explicit policy document supporting civil partnerships.|$|E
5|$|During trials, {{the player}} cross-examines witnesses. They can move {{backwards}} and forwards through <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> the testimony, and {{can choose to}} press the witness {{for more information on}} a particular statement; sometimes, the witness will revise their testimony based on this. If the player spots a lie or a contradiction in the testimony, they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's confidence in the player will be lowered; if the judge's confidence in the player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Electoral success overtook {{the party}} and Janmaat began to make {{controversial}} <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> the media. Based on his conviction that high office should be restricted to third-generation Dutch nationals, he suggested that several cabinet ministers, including Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch-Ballin who was of Jewish descent, and Agriculture State Secretary Dzsingisz Gabor who was of Hungarian descent, should {{be removed from the}} Dutch leadership. This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, as well as the decision by the other parties in Parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around the party.|$|E

5|$|Financial Times {{questioned}} why the Japanese auditor firm {{signed off}} on the financial <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> the same year when other members of its global network apparently refused to give clean bills of financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as Gyrus in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees are up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E
5|$|Flann {{was chosen}} as the High King of Ireland, also known as King of Tara, {{following}} the death of his first cousin and stepfather Áed Findliath on 20 November 879. Flann's reign followed the usual pattern of Irish High Kings, beginning by levying hostages and tribute from Leinster and then to wars with Munster, Ulster and Connacht. Flann was more successful than most kings of Ireland. However, rather than the military and diplomatic successes of his reign, it is his propaganda <b>statements,</b> <b>in</b> the form of monumental high crosses naming him and his father, as kings of Ireland, that are exceptional.|$|E
5|$|Governor Luis Fortuño and his party, New Progressive Party (PNP), campaigned {{in favor}} of the {{proposed}} amendments. Most {{of the leaders of the}} party support him and will campaign with him. Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, asked voters to participate of the referendum and encouraged them to vote {{in favor of}} the amendments. Also, a group of chiefs of agencies made <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> favor of the amendments. The group, led by Chief of Staff Miguel Romero, included Guillermo Somoza (Justice), Yanitzia Irizarry (Family), Miguel Hernández Vivoni (Housing), Jesús F. Méndez (Treasury), Henry Neumann (Sports and Recreation), and Jesús González (Correction).|$|E

5|$|In 1984, {{former vice}} {{president}} and presidential candidate Walter Mondale, seen as an underdog, selected Ferraro to be his running mate in the upcoming election. Ferraro became the only Italian American to be a major-party national nominee {{in addition to being}} the first woman. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined soon faded, as damaging questions arose about her and her businessman husband's finances and wealth and her Congressional disclosure <b>statements.</b> <b>In</b> the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a landslide by incumbent President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, with Paul's {{increased}} support, {{the controversy}} over racist and homophobic <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> several Ron Paul newsletters in the 1980s and early 1990s once again gained media attention. During this time Paul supporters asserted that he was continually ignored by the media despite his significant support, citing examples of where television news shows would fail to mention Paul in discussions of the Republican presidential hopefuls {{even when he was}} polling second.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{complaint}} {{alleged that the}} defendants made numerous false <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> attempting to collect payments from consumers, claiming that the computer owner or someone else consented to receiving the pop-up payment demands until they paid, the owner of any computer that received the pop-ups was legally obligated to pay Movieland, and that the computer owner was obligated to satisfy any contract that any other person entered into while using the computer. The only customer service telephone number provided was a 900 number. When consumers called it, a recorded greeting {{told them that they}} would incur a $34.95 charge if they did not hang up within three seconds.|$|E
50|$|Watermeyer JA {{observed}} that Van der Linden's <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> his notes to Voet seems to differ from his <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> the Institutes.

5|$|Lincoln ran for {{election}} as governor {{in his own}} right in 1809, but he was perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the charisma of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson's economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked his <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> support of Jefferson, and he lost the election to Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist takeover of the Massachusetts government (the outgoing Jefferson administration's repeal of the embargo before the election notwithstanding).|$|E
5|$|Mustaine {{has made}} {{numerous}} inflammatory <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> the press, usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud stemmed from his ejection from the band, {{how it was}} conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits. Mustaine expressed his anger in the movie Some Kind of Monster, in a scene he later disapproved of as {{he felt he was}} mischaracterized, and that it did not represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|The Redskins {{controversy}} began receiving {{more attention}} in 2013, {{starting with a}} symposium in February on the topic at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York sponsored a series of radio ads in each city to coincide with games of the 2013 season, each featuring a targeted message. A broader range of persons spoke in favor of change or open discussion, including local government leaders, members of Congress, and President Barack Obama. <b>Statements</b> <b>in</b> support of a name change by civil rights and religious organizations were added to those that Native American groups have been making for decades.|$|E

5|$|The {{hearing in}} the case of Ruto, Kosgey and Sang took place in The Hague between 1 and 8 September 2011. The three {{defendants}} had all filed applications challenging the jurisdiction of the court which were rejected by the chamber. Although the defence teams had initially proposed calling 43 witnesses to the confirmation of charges hearings the chamber instructed them to present just two witnesses each at the confirmation hearings, which they did. Ruto and Sang additionally made unsworn <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> person.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series {{has not been}} universal. For example, the Star Trek franchise's lack of same-sex relationships {{has long been a}} sore spot with LGBT fandom, some of whom have organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced {{the head of his}} campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged that at the time when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E
