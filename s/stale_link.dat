Ad-hoc {{networks are}} characterized {{by a lack of}} infrastructure, and by a random and quickly changing network topology: thus the need for a robust dynamic routing protocol that can accommodate such an environment. In addition to this routing protocols face many challenges like short battery backup, limited processing capability. Two protocols AODV and DSR have compared in terms of number of routes selected, number of hop counts, number of RREQ packets and number of RREP packets. Simulation results shows that AODV compared with DSR reduces the number of hop count nodes, we will also see that AODV has less number of routes as compare to DSR, which helps AODV to be more efficient and less bulky.

40|$|A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a {{collection}} of mobile wireless nodes, which communication to each other without any centralized control. These networks are characterized by a lack of infrastructure, and by a random and quickly changing network topology: thus the call for a strong dynamic routing protocol that can accommodate in such an environment is generated. In addition to this, routing protocols face many challenges like short battery backup, limited processing capability. This paper is an effort to study the performance of two on-demand routing protocols (AODV and DSR) in terms of number of routes selected, number of hop counts, number of RREQ packets and number of RREP packets. Simulation on QualNet shows that AODV compared with DSR reduces the number of hop count nodes, and AODV has less number of routes as compared to DSR, which helps AODV to be more efficient and less bulky. While comparing route request packets AODV is again better by having more number of RREQ packets as compared to DSR which made it more efficient in finding a new route and each time in replacing a <b>stale</b> <b>link.</b> General Terms This paper is effort to study performance comparison of two on-demand routing protocols for mobile ad-hoc networks with the help of QualNet simulator...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Route caching {{strategy}} {{is important in}} on-demand routing protocols in wireless ad hoc networks. While high routing overhead usually has a significant performance impact in low bandwidth wireless networks, a good route caching strategy can reduce routing overheads by making use of the available route information more efficiently. In this paper, we first {{study the effects of}} two cache schemes, “link cache” and “path cache”, on the performance of on-demand routing protocols through simulations based on the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol. Since the “path cache ” DSR has been extensively studied, we focus in this paper on the “link cache ” DSR in combination with timer-based <b>stale</b> <b>link</b> expiry mechanisms. The effects of different link lifetime values on the performance of routing protocol in terms of routing overhead, packet delivery ratio and packet latency are investigated. A caching strategy incorporating adaptive link timeout is then proposed, which aims at tracking the “optimal ” link lifetime under various node mobility levels by adaptively adjusting the link lifetime based on the real link lifetime statistics. The performance of the proposed {{strategy is}} then compared with the conventional “path cache” DSR. The results show that without a timeout mechanism, a link cache scheme may suffer severe performance degradation due to the use of broken routes, while the proposed adaptive “link cache ” strategy achieves significantly improved performance by reducing the routing overhead when the network traffic load is high...|$|E
40|$|Internet traffic {{today is}} {{dominated}} by that of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Understanding the statistical characteristics of the data transferred via HTTP helps better model traffic patterns. In this work, we conduct an empirical study by employing an experiment that accesses roughly 34, 000 {{of the most popular}} websites on the Internet today and crawls their web pages. We collect metadata information on the retrieved roughly two million objects. We determine statistics and distributions based on object sizes, occurrence of specific types, and sizes of specific types. The data of the distributions produced {{can be used as a}} template model for web-traffic modeling in future research. We further note an intriguing result that 5. 7 % of HTTP traffic from web servers to clients is due to sending spacer objects (image files representing a 1 x 1 white-space pixel) or to <b>stale</b> <b>links</b> referencing non-existing files. Such squander in bandwidth is not due to overhead and can be minimized by simple additions to the HTML standard and by automating the process of removing <b>stale</b> <b>links...</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{protocol}} uses a reactive approach which {{eliminates the}} need to periodically flood the network with table update messages which are required in a table-driven approach. In a reactive (on-demand) approach such as this, a route is established only when it is required and hence the need to find routes to all other nodes in the network {{as required by the}} table-driven approach is eliminated. The intermediate nodes also utilize the route cache information efficiently to reduce the control overhead. The disadvantage of this protocol is that the route maintenance mechanism does not locally repair a broken <b>link.</b> <b>Stale</b> route cache information could also result in inconsistencies during the route reconstruction phase. The connection setup delay is higher than in table-driven protocols. Even though the protocol performs well in static and low-mobility environments, the performance degrades rapidly with increasing mobility. Also, considerable routing overhead is involved due to the source-routing mechanism employed in DSR. This routing overhead is directly proportional to the path length.|$|R
