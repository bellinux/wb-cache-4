5|$|Nasser died {{unexpectedly}} in November 1970, with Gaddafi {{playing a}} prominent role at his funeral. Nasser was succeeded by Anwar Sadat, who suggested that rather than creating a unified state, the Arab states <b>should</b> <b>create</b> a political federation, implemented in April 1971; in doing so, Egypt, Syria and Sudan received large grants of Libyan oil money. In February 1972, Gaddafi and Sadat signed an unofficial charter of merger, {{but it was never}} implemented because relations broke down the following year. Sadat became increasingly wary of Libya's radical direction, and the September 1973 deadline for implementing the Federation passed by with no action taken.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the deputies called months ago {{generated}} disputes about the role they should have. Mariano Moreno supported the May 25 invitation, and wrote at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspaper that the deputies <b>should</b> <b>create</b> a constituent assembly. Most of them, however, were aligned with the more moderated style of Saavedra. Led by Gregorio Funes from Córdoba, they requested to join the Junta, as told in the second invitation. Saavedra and Funes thought that, with this change, Moreno would be left in a minority group, unable to advance his more radical measures.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Akira Toriyama {{had created}} the popular manga Dr. Slump; within roughly six months, he wanted to end the series but his {{publisher}} Shueisha would only allow {{him to do so}} if he agreed to start another serial for them shortly after. He worked with his editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, on several one-shots but none were successful. Torishima then suggested that as Toriyama enjoyed kung fu films, he <b>should</b> <b>create</b> a kung fu shōnen manga. This led to the two-part , published in the August and October 1983 issues of Fresh Jump. It follows a boy, adept at martial arts, who escorts a princess on a journey back to her home country. Dragon Boy was very well-received and evolved to become Dragon Ball.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s Benjamin Britten had {{established}} himself as a leading composer of English opera, with several major works to his credit. In 1947 he suggested to his librettist Eric Crozier that they <b>should</b> <b>create</b> a children's opera, based on a bible story. Crozier gave Britten a copy of Pollard's book, as a possible source of material. Nothing came of this project immediately; instead, Britten and Crozier wrote the cantata Saint Nicolas (1948), the first of several works in which Britten combined skilled performers with amateurs. The cantata involves at least two children's choirs, and incorporates two congregational hymns sung by the audience. Britten also used this fusion of professional with amateur forces in The Little Sweep (1949), which forms the second part of his entertainment for children, Let's Make an Opera, that he devised with Crozier. Again, child singers (also doubling as actors) were used, and the audience sings choruses at appropriate points. In 1952, although Britten's collaboration with Crozier had ended, he used the Chester plays book as the source text for his Canticle II, based on the story of Abraham and Isaac.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a reunion of the games' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they <b>should</b> <b>create</b> something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them, as his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E

25|$|The most skilful {{forwards}} will, {{during a}} hit-up, look {{to release the}} ball to a supporting player before the tackle is completed; known as an off-load.

Al-Mawardi also said in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves <b>should</b> <b>create</b> a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, then the majlis should select from the list of candidates.|$|E
25|$|West Japan Heavy-Industries (now renamed Mitsubishi Shipbuilding & Engineering) and East Japan Heavy-Industries (now Mitsubishi Nihon Heavy-Industries) {{had also}} {{expanded}} their automotive {{departments in the}} 1950s, and the three were re-integrated as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 1964. Within three years its output was over 75,000 vehicles annually. Following the successful introduction of the first Galant in 1969 and similar growth with its commercial vehicle division, {{it was decided that}} the company <b>should</b> <b>create</b> a single operation to focus on the automotive industry. Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC) was formed on April 22, 1970 as a wholly owned subsidiary of MHI under the leadership of Tomio Kubo, a successful engineer from the aircraft division.|$|E
25|$|The Prahasanas(broad farces) of Chilakamarti can be {{classified}} into three kinds. As a matter of rule and as the word Prahasana connotes, it <b>should</b> <b>create</b> much laughter and hence known as a broad farce. Even a farce must have a purpose. Unless it conveys a message, it cannot be called genuine Prahasana. Keeping this in view, Chilakamarti wrote almost half of his prahasanas with specific aim of conveying a message. The second category is purely {{for the sake of}} farce; loud laughter is sometimes produced by mere dialogue and its articulation. The third category is much like an essay through which comment and caustic criticism is offered on the evils prevailing in the society.|$|E

25|$|Then God created {{human to}} {{supersede}} the Jinn from earth, Azazil {{and some other}} angels argued, why God <b>should</b> <b>create</b> a human being, who will shed blood and confusion like the jinn, whom they had just defeated before, while the angels prostrate before God and sing his glory day and night, thus would never failed Gods orders. Thereupon God ordered the angels to prostrate before human, as a test for the angels, because they thought being the favorite creation of God. Since Azazel insisted on being superior than any other creature, even compared to other angels, his status {{was reduced to a}} Satan endowed with the task to lead beings towards evil and wrong actions. As a devil, he was now able to procreate and fathered the demons.|$|E
25|$|Harris Super Markets began {{primarily}} as a family business. Most of Harris's brothers and sisters were employees, and brothers and brothers-in-law were store managers. His sister, Sarah, ran the accounting department and his wife's sister was Harris's personal secretary. His son, Donald Thomas Harris, began working for the company at 8years old by sweeping floors. Donald suggested that Harris Teeter should carry more than just food products, and recommended the introduction of health and beauty aids, school supplies, bakeware, kitchen tools, and seasonal items (such as coolers in the summer). His father liked the idea and told Don that he <b>should</b> <b>create</b> and run that division of the company, which he did {{until his retirement in}} 1995. He was the last member of the family who worked for the company.|$|E
25|$|Brigadiers {{should move}} with the advance and divisional commanders <b>should</b> <b>create</b> {{reserves}} by reorganizing their brigades. Headquarters should be placed where attacks could be seen, {{to keep in touch}} with events when communications broke down, a chronic problem which was increased by distance from the front line. Telephone links in the rear were far easier to maintain but became less important once the infantry battle began. Corps headquarters also had the benefit of air observation and less need of direct communication with troops on the battlefield, since their main role was counter-battery artillery-fire, which was independent of the infantry battle. The attack was to be maintained by the use of reserves moving towards objectives laid down before the attack, so as to make them independent of messages from the front line, which were often delayed and out of date if they arrived.|$|E

25|$|Warrior {{returned}} to WWE to be {{inducted into the}} Hall of Fame. During his induction, he mentioned that WWE <b>should</b> <b>create</b> an award to honor those behind the scenes called the Jimmy Miranda Award. Named after a long time WWE employee who passed away. Warrior passed away serval days after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. WWE decided to create the Warrior Award, an award for people who embodied the spirit of the Ultimate Warrior. The award was later given to Connor Michalek (a child that passed away from cancer), Joan Lunden (a journalist who was diagnosed with cancer), and Eric LeGrand (a former college student who suffered an accident and is now quadriplegic). In October 2017, used the tagline Unleash Your Warrior when promoting Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Since Warrior's passing, WWE has been accused of whitewashing and ignoring Warrior's past bigoted and controversial past comments.|$|E
25|$|Italian {{scientist}} Giovanni Battista Riccioli and {{his assistant}} Francesco Maria Grimaldi described the effect in connection with artillery in the 1651 Almagestum Novum, writing that rotation of the Earth should cause a cannonball fired to the north to deflect to the east. In 1674 Claude François Milliet Dechales described in his Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus how {{the rotation of the}} earth should cause a deflection in the trajectories of both falling bodies and projectiles aimed toward one of the planet's poles. Riccioli, Grimaldi, and Dechales all described the effect as part of an argument against the heliocentric system of Copernicus. In other words, they argued that the Earth's rotation <b>should</b> <b>create</b> the effect, and so failure to detect the effect was evidence for an immobile Earth. The Coriolis acceleration equation was derived by Euler in 1749 and the effect was described in the tidal equations of Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1778.|$|E
25|$|When she {{got back}} to the United States she {{submitted}} a very thorough and insightful report to Congress. One of her recommendations was that Congress <b>should</b> <b>create</b> a new State Department Bureau for African Affairs to be overseen by a new {{assistant secretary of state for}} African affairs. Bolton helped to see that this did in fact happen, and Congress created the new bureau in 1958. In addition to sharing information about her trip with Congress through her official report, Bolton also made an impressive effort to enlighten the American people about the diversity of the African continent by creating a film about her trip, entitled Africa: Giant With a Future, 1955. This film is an excellent resource for students and instructors wanting a look at several African countries/colonies in the mid-1950s, and has been made available on DVD by the National Archives. In addition to educating Congress and the general public about Africa, Bolton's trip helped to begin the process of opening doors for women to play a major role in US foreign relations.|$|E
