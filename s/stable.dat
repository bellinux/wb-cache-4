5|$|For 80 of the {{chemical}} elements, at least one <b>stable</b> isotope exists. As a rule, {{there is only a}} handful of <b>stable</b> isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.2 <b>stable</b> isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single <b>stable</b> isotope, while the largest number of <b>stable</b> isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin. Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no <b>stable</b> isotopes.|$|E
5|$|A {{major change}} in the {{development}} process of Perl 5 occurred with Perl 5.11; the development community has switched to a monthly release cycle of development releases, with a yearly schedule of <b>stable</b> releases. By that plan, bugfix point releases will follow the <b>stable</b> releases every three months.|$|E
5|$|All group 3 {{elements}} have an odd atomic number, {{and therefore}} few <b>stable</b> isotopes. Scandium has one <b>stable</b> isotope, and yttrium itself {{has only one}} <b>stable</b> isotope, 89Y, is also the only isotope that occurs naturally. However, the lanthanide rare earths contain elements of even atomic number and many <b>stable</b> isotopes. Yttrium-89 {{is thought to be}} more abundant than it otherwise would be, {{due in part to the}} s-process, which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by electron emission (neutron → proton). Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with atomic mass numbers (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually <b>stable</b> atomic nuclei with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively. 89Y has a mass number close to 90 and has 50 neutrons in its nucleus.|$|E

5|$|At least 32 {{metastable}} isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most <b>stable</b> {{of these is}} 192m2Ir, which decays by isomeric transition with a half-life of 241years, making it more <b>stable</b> than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least <b>stable</b> isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir {{was the first one}} of any element to be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E

5|$|At one time, <b>stable</b> carbenes {{were thought}} to {{reversibly}} dimerise through the so-called Wanzlick equilibrium. However, imidazol-2-ylidenes and triazol-5-ylidenes are thermodynamically <b>stable</b> and do not dimerise, and have been stored in solution {{in the absence of}} water and air for years. This is presumably due to the aromatic nature of these carbenes, which is lost upon dimerisation. In fact imidazol-2-ylidenes are so thermodynamically <b>stable</b> that only in highly constrained conditions are these carbenes forced to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|Aviary {{experiments}} {{conducted with}} captive flocks of scaly-breasted munia have tested whether producers and scroungers reach the predicted <b>stable</b> equilibrium frequency (see Evolutionarily <b>stable</b> strategy) when individuals {{are free to}} choose either behavior. The numbers choosing either producers and scrounger strategies {{have been shown to}} converge on <b>stable</b> frequencies while demonstrating that variation in tactics arise through frequency dependent pay-offs from the choice of different feeding strategies.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{the fifth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 7 in the periodic table, below manganese, technetium and rhenium. All {{the members of the}} group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more <b>stable</b> as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a <b>stable</b> +7 state. Technetium also shows a <b>stable</b> +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits <b>stable</b> +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohriate, , analogous to the lighter permanganate, pertechnetate, and perrhenate. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more <b>stable</b> bohrium(IV).|$|E

5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum <b>stable</b> angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum <b>stable</b> angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically <b>stable</b> contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically <b>stable</b> contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

5|$|Natural lead {{consists}} of four <b>stable</b> isotopes with mass numbers of 204, 206, 207, and 208, and traces of five short-lived radioisotopes.

Lead-208 has 126 neutrons, another magic number, {{which may explain why}} lead-208 is extraordinarily <b>stable.</b>|$|E
