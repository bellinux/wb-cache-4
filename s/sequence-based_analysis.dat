40|$|Abstract — <b>Sequence-based</b> <b>analysis</b> {{has been}} both a widely imitated and widely criticized {{approach}} to anomaly detection. In {{virtually all of the}} follow-up work to Forrest et al. (1996), though, the distinction between the initially proposed “lookahead pairs ” and the follow-on “full sequence” analysis methods has been overlooked. We have discovered that this oversight is significant: specifically, here we demonstrate that, on previously published and well-studied datasets, lookahead pairs produce significantly fewer false positives. Although lower false positive rates make lookahead pairs an attractive system call modeling technique, their usefulness may be compromised by an increased vulnerability to mimicry attacks. This threat can be mitigated through the use of larger sequences. Here we show that lookahead pairs produce relatively few false alarms even with longer sequences (n> 10); we also demonstrate a new technique, random schema masks, which permits the use of even longer sequences. With these new results and techniques, we conclude that the lookahead pair method should be considered as one of the benchmark techniques for modeling system calls. I...|$|E

A powerful cloning method that uses lambda integrase recombination to clone and manipulate DNA sequences has been adapted for use with the gram-negative α-proteobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti in two ways that increase {{the utility of the}} system. Adding plasmid oriT sequences to a set of vehicles allows the plasmids to be transferred to S. meliloti by conjugation and also allows cloned genes to be recombined from one plasmid to another in vivo by a pentaparental mating protocol, saving considerable time and expense. In addition, vehicles that contain yeast Flp recombinase target recombination sequences allow the construction of deletion mutations where the end points of the deletions are located at the ends of the cloned genes. Several deletions were constructed in a cluster of 60 genes on the symbiotic plasmid (pSymA) of S. meliloti, predicted to code for a denitrification pathway. The mutations do not affect the ability of the bacteria to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on Medicago sativa (alfalfa) roots...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of translation initiation sites (TISs) constitutes {{an important aspect}} of <b>sequence-based</b> genome <b>analysis.</b> An erroneous TIS annotation can impair the identifica-tion of regulatory elements and N-terminal signal peptides, and also may flaw the determi-nation of descent, for any particular gene. We have formulated a reference-free method to score the TIS annotation quality. The method is based on a comparison of the observed and expected distribution of all TISs in a particular genome given prior gene-calling. We have assessed the TIS annotations for all available NCBI RefSeq microbial genomes and found that approximately 87 % is of appropriate quality, whereas 13 % needs substantial improvement. We have analyzed a number of factors that could affect TIS annotation quality such as GC-content, taxonomy, the fraction of genes with a Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the year of publication. The analysis showed that only the first factor has a clear effect. We have then formulated a straightforward Principle Component Analysis-based TIS identifica-tion strategy to self-organize and score potential TISs. The strategy is independent of refer-ence data and a priori calculations. A representative set of 277 genomes was subjected t...|$|R
