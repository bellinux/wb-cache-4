40|$|A {{new study}} finds that Australians on average receive 8. 5 {{unsolicited}} telemarketing calls per month, reports JOSH FEAR EVERYBODY {{has a story}} to tell about telemarketing. Sales calls at dinner time, often from overseas and sometimes using a recorded message, are infuriating. Many people resent the invasion of personal space, the use of personal details without permission, the waste of precious time, and the sheer absurdity and futility of the process. Telemarketing is one form of “direct marketing,” along with junk mail, spam and face-to-face marketing. Direct marketing differs from traditional advertising in making a much stronger claim on our attention. We can switch off the television or the radio if we find an advertisement too annoying, but {{it is virtually impossible to}} avoid intrusive marketing altogether. According to traditional economic theory, the more information consumers have the better off they will be. Advertising and marketing are regarded simply as information, providing transparent signals about the nature, quality and price of goods and services. But this fails to take into account the potential for marketing to impose considerable costs on consumers - including wasted time and energy, difficulty evaluating the claims of <b>suppliers,</b> <b>choice</b> overload and psychological costs like frustration, irritation and disenchantment. Large corporations regularly employ direct marketing techniques and defend their actions on economic grounds. For example, Optus recently told the Australian Law Reform Commission that direct marketing “serves an important economic function and is a vital component of Australian business”. The Australian Direct Marketing Association opposed any move to offer consumers the opportunity to opt out at each marketing approach because “this ignored the need for organisations to communicate with their existing customers to ‘fulfill their wants and needs’. ” It also argued that doing so would place Australian businesses at a “distinct commercial disadvantage” internationally. In reality, of course, direct marketing does little to assist individuals to “fulfill their needs and wants” and plays absolutely no role in securing Australia’s international standing. For most people, it is simply an unwanted intrusion into their lives and some go to great lengths to avoid it. It is also a waste of valuable time, whether at home, at work or in public. The direct marketing industry in Australia is big business, spending around $ 12 billion per year - or more than one per cent of GDP. According to the Commercial Economic Advisory Service of Australia, in 2005 695, 430 people worked in direct marketing, including 229, 000 in telemarketing, 184, 000 in catalogues and 217, 000 as “stuffers” (that is, envelope stuffers). If these figures are correct, there are more people working in direct marketing than there are school teachers, nurses and doctors combined. Telemarketing is the target of a great deal of public criticism. More than one billion telemarketing calls are made in Australia each year, and telemarketing was identified as the most annoying “event or situation” in a recent study by the Australian Psychological Society. Responding to community concerns, in May 2007 the Australian government established a Do Not Call (DNC) Register to enable members of the community to opt out of unsolicited phone calls. However, under the new system some organisations (including charities, political parties and companies with “inferred consent”) can continue to make such calls. In fact, Australia’s regulation of telemarketing is more relaxed than India’s, where exceptions to its do not call regulations apply only to messages “relating to charities, national campaigns or natural calamities transmitted on the directions of the government” and messages “in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality. ” Some people go to great lengths to avoid being “marketed. ” They buy answering machines or caller ID devices, disconnect their phone altogether, display “No Junk Mail” signs, send junk mail back to its source, and cross the road when a marketer is in their path. Millions of people have joined the DNC Register, and many take every opportunity to “unsubscribe” from mailing or emailing lists. Still, community frustration persists about all forms of direct marketing. Residential letterboxes continue to receive massive amounts of junk mail, even where a “no junk mail” sign is displayed, and real estate agents are identified as common culprits. In addition, the increasing use of face-to-face marketing techniques in public spaces, shopping centres and other busy areas is changing the way that we perceive and interact with other people outside of home and work. To explore community attitudes to telemarketing and to measure the impact of the DNC Register since its introduction, the Australia Institute conducted an online survey of 1000 Australians. The findings (PDF) show that Australians on average receive 8. 5 unsolicited telemarketing calls per month, and the average telemarketing call lasts for 1. 45 minutes. Based on these figures, we estimate that the value of time wasted on unsolicited telemarketing calls across Australia is $ 1. 58 billion per year. Two in three survey respondents said that telemarketing should be prohibited in Australia. People whose number is on the DNC Register said they received fewer calls on average than those not on the Register (7 calls per month compared to 10 calls). In other words, the Register appears to have reduced telemarketing call volumes by around 30 per cent. This would be an indication of success if it were a “Call Me Less” Register, but as a “Do Not Call” Register it signals the partial failure of existing measures to mitigate the impact of intrusive marketing, which rely almost exclusively on an “opt-out” approach. Currently, members of the public have to take deliberate action if they wish to avoid direct marketing, but our research indicates that an “opt-in” system would be more effective in reducing the social costs of direct marketing. Such a system would assume that most people do not wish to receive direct marketing, and would prohibit unsolicited telemarketing calls to anyone has not indicated their desire to receive such calls. • Josh Fear is a Research Fellow at the Australia Institute, a public policy think tank based in Canberra Photo: Paul W.

40|$|We model a {{situation}} in which a single firm evaluates competing suppliers and selects just one. Suppliers submit bids involving both price and quality variables. The buyer makes a choice which from the supplier's perspective appears to contain a stochastic element - for example the buyer may have information, which is not shared with the suppliers, and that gives one supplier an advantage in the final choice. We use a discrete choice model of buyer choice (e. g. multinomial logit). Our main result is that the <b>supplier's</b> <b>choice</b> of the quality variables is not affected by the competitive environment. Thus the suppliers compete only on price. We compare this with a second model in which the buyer's weighting on different quality variables is uncertain at the time bids are made...|$|R

Therefore, the use of decision support systems that help solving problems by reusing and analyzing experiences with business intelligence methods is proposed. In order to transfer the experiences into computable data a solution adequacy index is calculated that aggregates the single experiences to represent the compiled experience for a specific solution.

To {{solve the}} supply chain {{decision}} problem of technology selection for electric drive production, the authors chose a game theoretic approach to model and solve the bargaining situation of manufacturer (OEM) and supplier. The OEM can decide between a same part strategy and a differentiating strategy with increasing sales potential as well as higher complexity and production costs. The supplier has to choose a production technology and can decide between a specialized technology (e. g. punching) and a flexible technology (e. g. laser). Using the specialized technology the variable costs per piece are lower but every additional variant causes additional tool investments (e. g. punching dies). The interdependence of a <b>supplier’s</b> <b>choice</b> of production technology and its customer’s decision, regarding the number of different product variants that he wishes to source, is modeled as a non-cooperative game in strategic form.

To analyze how value is distributed among the participants, a framework based on theories of firm strategy is applied, and a novel methodology {{is used to}} measure value capture in three phone models introduced from 2004 to 2008. The research shows that carriers capture the greatest value (in terms of gross profit) from each handset, followed closely by handset makers, with suppliers a distant third. However, the situation is reversed in terms of operating profit. Carriers shoulder the burden of network installation, maintenance, and upgrading, which absorbs much of the value from their subscription fees. Handset maker nationality, which may also influence <b>supplier</b> <b>choice,</b> is a key determinant of the geographic distribution of value capture. The results are also used to estimate the relationship of handset subsidies to carrier profits, which has been an issue of concern for antitrust authorities in several countries.

40|$|Abstract: A good {{supplier}} {{selection process}} does not merely frame {{the evaluation of}} several competitors to determine which supplier offers the lowest total cost of goods or services, but rather it starts a supplier relationship meant to convey certain, agreed-upon benefits to each party {{for a period of}} time usually measured in years. Keeping the big picture in mind while evaluating the details of an offer is a challenge to many, but sometimes we aren’t even looking at the right picture. This discourse asks you to consider the effect of your <b>supplier</b> <b>choices</b> on the entire supply chain and on the competitive business model linked to the firm’s sales proposition. There are many courses on supplier selection and evaluation that guide supply management professionals in their decision to choose one offeror over another. Many focus on the tangible elements of the supplier’s proposal, such as cost, delivery and resources available to meet demand. These are indeed important, however, there are less tangible considerations that nonetheless make a considerable impact on the success of the supply relationship. I’m speaking of the demands your business places on suppliers in order to meet its sales promises to customers and to gain competitive advantage in the marketplace...|$|R
40|$|Firms are {{coping with}} a {{competitive}} scenario characterized by quick changes produced by internationalization, concentration, restructuring, technological innovation processes and financial market crisis. On the one hand market enlargement have increased the number and the segmentation of customers and have raised the number of competitors, {{on the other hand}} technological innovation has reduced product life cycle. So firms have to adjust their management models to this scenario, pursuing customer satisfaction and respecting cost constraints. In a context where price is a variable fixed by the market, firms have to switch from the cost measurement logic to the cost management one, adopting target costing methodology. The target costing process is a price driven, customer oriented profit planning and cost management system. It works, in a cross functional way, from the design stage throughout all the product life cycle and it involves the entire value chain. The process implementation needs a costing methodology consistent with the cost management logic. The aim of the paper is to focus on Activity Based Costing (ABC) application to target costing process. So: -it analyzes target costing logic and phases, basing on a literary review, in order to highlight the costing needs related to this process; -it shows, through a numerical example, how to structure a flexible ABC model â€“ characterized by the separation between variable, fixed in the short and fixed costs - that effectively supports target costing process in the cost measurement phase (drifting cost determination) and in the target cost alignment; -it points out the effectiveness of the Activity Based Costing as a model of cost measurement applicable to the <b>supplier</b> <b>choice</b> and as a support for supply cost management which have an important role in target costing process. The activity based information allows a firm to optimize the <b>supplier</b> <b>choice</b> by following the method of minimizing the total cost of ownership (TCO). Moreover the activity based analyses reveals the opportunities for rationalizing the supply related activities and containing costs and it enables the effective involvement of the supplier in the process of target costing when he provides activity based information on the costs sustained to produce the product/service: the purchaser can evaluate the impact, in terms of cost, of the activities requested of the supplier and, as a result, he has the chance to rationalize these activities by reducing their number or intensity and enables the effective involvement of the supplier in the process of target costing. The paper gives a contribution in the advancement of costing methodologies applicable to the target costing, proposing the use of a flexible model that supports the decision process according to different time horizons so that effectively supports target costing. The model is suitable for production characterized by high complexity in terms of number and intensity of activitie...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{firms in}} {{capital-intensive}} industries face inherent demand volatility {{for their products}} and the inability to change their capacity quickly. To cope with these challenges, manufacturers often enter into contracts with their customers that offer greater certainty of supply in return for more predictable orders. In this paper, we study a "forecast-commitment" contract in which the customer provides a forecast, the supplier makes a production commitment to the customer based on the forecast, and the customer's minimum order quantity {{is a function of}} the forecast and committed quantities. We provide a complete analysis of the supplier's decisions when there is a single customer facing uncertain demand. We first show that the supplier has two dominant commitment strategies: committing to the forecast or committing to the production quantity. We then characterize the jointly optimal commitment and production strategy for the supplier and extend the results to consider a capacity constraint. We show that the proposed contract can moderate the supplier's motivation to underproduce, and due to the structure of the contract and the form of the supplier's optimal strategy, also limits the customer's incentive to overforecast. We also provide results for a capacitated two-customer example, which show that the <b>supplier's</b> <b>choice</b> of production quantity for each customer is not necessarily nondecreasing in the total available capacity. supply contracts, information sharing, capacity allocation, quantity flexibility...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{multiple}} criteria decision making (MCDM) is {{of determining the}} best choice among all of the probable alternatives. The problem of supplier selection on which decision maker has usually vague and imprecise knowledge is a typical example of multi criteria group decision-making problem. The conventional crisp techniques has not much effective for solving MCDM problems because of imprecise or fuzziness nature of the linguistic assessments. To find the exact values for MCDM problems is both difficult and impossible in more cases in real world. So, it is more reasonable to consider the values of alternatives according to the criteria as single valued neutrosophic sets (SVNS). This paper deal with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach and extend the TOPSIS method to MCDM problem with single valued neutrosophic information. The value of each alternative {{and the weight of}} each criterion are characterized by single valued neutrosophic numbers.

40|$|Purchasing {{agents are}} often {{employed}} as individual informants {{in studies of}} organizational buying. This practice occurs {{in spite of the}} fact that several researchers have identified problems with using individual informants to study group buying behavior. The purpose of this study is to examine the appropriateness of using either single or multiple informants both in non-new task and new task group buying situations. We compare the predictive accuracy of a single-informant. autocracy model with that of a multiperson, majority rule model. The study includes 104 group decisions made by buying centers in organizations. Overall, we find that data from multiple informants significantly outperforms single informant data for both new task and non-new task situations. and that singlefkey informant data should be used in organizational buying research only with care and caution. Organizational buying behavior researchers often identify and use buyers as individual informants to gain quantitative information about processes of group decision making and <b>supplier</b> <b>choice</b> (Moriarty and Bateson 1982). This practice is controversial given empirical evidence that key informant data has questionable reliability and validity (Phillips 1981; Silk and KaIwani 1982). Campbell (1955) suggests that key informants in quantitative research should be we 11 informed about the phenomenon of interest and able to communicate effectively with the researcher. When a buyer is chosen as the key informant based on his or her knowledge of and participation in the decision, this approximates the original purpose of informants (Mead 1953, Campbell 1955).

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{understand}} {{the factors that influence}} a <b>supplier’s</b> <b>choice</b> to treat selected customers more preferentially than others. Suppliers often lack the resources to treat all their customers equally, instead having to make choices to treat some customers as preferred. Empirical evidence indicates that preferential treatment by suppliers provides substantial benefits for the purchasing firm. Design/methodology/approach – This study applies a mixed-methods approach. First, a qualitative analysis of a sample of buyers from an automotive manufacturer was conducted. In the second step, the findings were triangulated via a quantitative survey among key account managers of the automotive firm’s suppliers. Findings – This paper is the first to provide quantitative data collected from a large sample of automotive suppliers about the drivers of preferential customer treatment. The authors were able to show that the growth opportunities for suppliers and customers’ operative excellence, reliability and relational behavior are factors that induce suppliers to award preferential customer treatment. In contrast, innovation potential for suppliers, customers’ support of suppliers, supplier involvement and contact accessibility do not show a significant effect on suppliers’ behavioral intentions toward preferential customer treatment. Originality/value – The mixed-methods approach is introduced as a form of academic enquiry in supply chain management. The factors influencing preferential customer treatment by suppliers are explored in discussions with purchasers and validated in a subsequent survey among suppliers. Recommendations for managerial practice and theory are drawn...|$|R
