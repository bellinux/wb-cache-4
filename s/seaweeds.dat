40|$|Biomethane {{produced}} from <b>seaweed</b> {{is a third}} generation renewable gaseous fuel. The advantage of <b>seaweed</b> for biofuel {{is that it does}} not compete directly or indirectly for land with food, feed or fibre production. Furthermore, the integration of <b>seaweed</b> and salmon farming can increase the yield of <b>seaweed</b> per hectare, while reducing the eutrophication from fish farming. So far, full comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of <b>seaweed</b> biofuel are scarce in the literature; current studies focus mainly on microalgal biofuels. The focus of this study is an assessment of the sustainability of <b>seaweed</b> biomethane, with <b>seaweed</b> sourced from an integrated <b>seaweed</b> and salmon farm in a north Atlantic island, namely Ireland. With this goal in mind, an attributional LCA principle was applied to analyse a <b>seaweed</b> biofuel system. The environmental impact categories assessed are: climate change, acidification, and marine, terrestrial and freshwater eutrophication. The <b>seaweed</b> Laminaria digitata is digested to produce biogas upgraded to natural gas standard, before being used as a transport biofuel. The baseline scenario shows high emissions in all impact categories. An optimal <b>seaweed</b> biomethane system can achieve 70 % savings in GHG emissions as compared to gasoline with high yields per hectare, optimum <b>seaweed</b> composition and proper digestate management. <b>Seaweed</b> harvested in August proved to have higher methane yield.

5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for <b>seaweeds,</b> sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals {{on the lookout for}} predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case of}} stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the <b>seaweeds</b> amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the potential role of <b>seaweed</b> in reducing global warming and climate change, contributing to food security and producing natural products. The role of <b>seaweed</b> on controlling climate change is through reducing carbon dioxide and converting <b>seaweed</b> into the bio fuel. The use of bio-fuel could reduce the traditional hydrocarbon as energy that produces carbon emission. Fresh and processed <b>seaweed</b> are commonly used as a food. This may contribute significantly to the food supply especially on the developing countries that have big potential of <b>seaweed</b> resources and farming. For example, Indonesia has potential production of <b>seaweed</b> Gracilaria and Kappaphycus which reaches about 170. 000 ton dryweight. This is an enourmous amount of <b>seaweed</b> production, and most people {{in the eastern part of}} Indonesia consume fresh <b>seaweed</b> as their daily meal. The other role of <b>seaweed</b> is producing natural products. Through delicate processing <b>seaweed</b> produce special substances that can be used in medicine, cosmetic, and agriculture as pesticide or fertilizer.

40|$|China {{is facing}} intense coastal eutrophication. Large-scale <b>seaweed</b> {{aquaculture}} in China is popular, now accounting for over 2 / 3 's of global production. Here, we estimate the nutrient removal capability of large-scale Chinese <b>seaweed</b> farms {{to determine its}} significance in mitigating eutrophication. We combined estimates of yield and nutrient concentration of Chinese <b>seaweed</b> aquaculture to quantify that one hectare of <b>seaweed</b> aquaculture removes the equivalent nutrient inputs entering 17. 8 ha for nitrogen and 126. 7 ha for phosphorus of Chinese coastal waters, respectively. Chinese <b>seaweed</b> aquaculture annually removes approximately 75, 000 t nitrogen and 9, 500 t phosphorus. Whereas removal of the total N inputs to Chinese coastal waters requires a <b>seaweed</b> farming area 17 {{times larger than the}} extant area, one and a half times more of the <b>seaweed</b> area would be able to remove close to 100 % of the P inputs. With the current growth rate of <b>seaweed</b> aquaculture, we project this industry will remove 100 % of the current phosphorus inputs to Chinese coastal waters by 2026. Hence, <b>seaweed</b> aquaculture already plays a hitherto unrealized role in mitigating coastal eutrophication, a role that may be greatly expanded with future growth of <b>seaweed</b> aquaculture...|$|R

Chemical analyses of dried marine red <b>seaweed</b> (Polysiphonia SPP) showed reasonable amounts of protein (32. 4 %); ether extract (17. 7 %), crude fiber (14. 9 %), ash (6. 0 %) and nitrogen free extract (23. 4 %). <b>Seaweed</b> contained appropriate amounts of minerals required by poultry. Leucine and lysine were the most abundant amino acids in <b>seaweed</b> protein. The content of each amino acid in <b>seaweed</b> protein is lower than the whole egg protein. Methionine is the first limiting amino acid (with chemical score 50. 0 %), valine and arginine were the second and third limiting amino acids in <b>seaweed</b> protein (with chemical score 71. 63 and 74. 33 %, respectively). The estimation of Essential Amino Acid Index (EAAI) was 63. 34 % and the average of Total Protein Efficiency (TPE) value is 1. 26. Thus <b>seaweed</b> is an intermediate source of protein for growing chicks. The metabolizable energy value of marine <b>seaweed</b> was 3518 kcal/kg. <b>Seaweed</b> up to 3 % as a pellet binder did not adversely influence growth performance of ducks. Also, the physical test showed some improvement in pellet hardness quality. The inclusion of <b>seaweed</b> meal in the diet for ducks had no significant effects on all of carcass traits.
