40|$|Abstract: Chicken skin is not {{removed from}} the whole carcass before cooking in Iran and people prefer chicken with higher weight. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to distinguish the mean percentage of chicken <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> visible <b>fat</b> to chicken carcass weight. The ratio of chicken <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> visible <b>fat</b> to total chicken carcass weight in 10 weight groups were studied. These groups had approximate weight of 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 g. Samples were randomly collected 10 times, each time 20 chickens from Kordan slaughterhouse product from each weight were selected. The <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> visible <b>fat</b> were {{removed from the}} carcass and weighted. The mean percentage of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> visible <b>fat</b> ratio to total chicken carcass weight were calculated in these 10 chicken weight groups separately. The mean percentage of poultry <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> visible <b>fat</b> ratio to total chicken carcass weight in these 10 weight groups were 11. 7 ± 1. 5, 12. 3 ± 1. 8, 12. 8 ± 1. 9, 13. 2 ± 1. 2, 14. 1 ± 1. 3, 14. 3 ± 1. 9, 14. 1 ± 1. 5, 14. 7 ± 2. 1, 14. 9 ± 1. 9, 15. 2 ± 2. 1 respectively. The minimum percentage was 8 % and the maximum was 20 % in total samples. Chicken carcass was conditioned in plastic bags without removing the <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> visible <b>fat</b> by the slaughterhouse. <b>Skin</b> <b>and</b> visible <b>fat</b> comprise 8 - 20 % of chicken carcass weight, chicken with higher weight have higher percentage of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> visible <b>fat.</b> Hence, chicken carcass with lower weight should be purchased <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> visible <b>fat</b> has to be removed before cooking...|$|R

Materials and Methods. We studied the results of cryosurgical treatment of 447 patients with various skin diseases, among them 350 — with benign skin neoplasms, 97 — with pyoinflammatory diseases of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> subcutaneous <b>fat.</b> For treatment of 38 patients we used self-designed instruments.

40|$|The article {{presents}} a literature review on late radiation injury (RI) of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> after surgical treatment and radiation therapy (RT) {{in patients with}} breast cancer (BC). In Russia, the rate of radiation injuries in patients after RT exceeds 10 – 15 %. Combination treatment of BC (surgery and radiation) carries a risk of RI of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> which might lead to dystrophic changes {{in the form of}} prominent radiation-induced fibrosis of the irradiated area, lower the quality of life, cause suffering and even death. Most of BC patients are of working age, so the problem of local RI is of social importance, and it requires effective methods of treatment and rehabilitation allowing for favorable conditions for patients’ social adaptation. Currently, there’s no consensus on the mechanisms of development of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> late RI, <b>and</b> it’s being considered from several angles. Therefore, problems of determination of individual sensitivity to ionizing radiation and further study of local RI of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> after surgical treatment and RT in BC patients are of utmost importance...|$|R

The FAME produced was tested for six parameters namely calorific value, cloud point, pour point, flash point, density and viscosity when compared to ASTM E 2515 - 11 standard values.

25|$|The TUG flap (also the TMG flap) {{consists}} of the gracilis muscle and a transversely-oriented island of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>fat</b> on the superior inner thigh. Sacrifice of the gracilis muscle does not result in functional impairment. The TUG flap is nourished by the ascending branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery with two venae comitantes, which come from the profunda femoris vessels. The vessels are routinely anastomosed to the internal mammary vessels, instead of to the thoraco-dorsal vessels in the axilla, because the blood vessels of the TUG flap are relatively short.|$|E

The surgical emplacement of breast implant devices (saline or silicone) introduces a foreign {{object to the}} patient's body (see capsular contracture). The TRAM flap (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap) procedure reconstructs the breast using an autologous flap of abdominal, cutaneous, and muscle tissues. The latissimus myocutaneous flap employs skin fat and muscle harvested from the back, and a breast implant. The DIEP flap (Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforators) procedure uses an autologous flap of abdominal <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>fat</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|Blood flow to <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>fat</b> are {{affected}} by skin and core temperature, and resting muscle perfusion {{is controlled by the}} temperature of the muscle itself. During exercise increased flow to the working muscles is often balanced by reduced flow to other tissues, such as kidneys spleen and liver. Blood flow to the muscles is also lower in cold water, but exercise keeps the muscle warm and flow elevated even when the skin is chilled. Blood flow to fat normally increases during exercise, but this is inhibited by immersion in cold water. Adaptation to cold reduces the extreme vasoconstriction which usually occurs with cold water immersion. Variations in perfusion distribution do not necessarily affect respiratory inert gas exchange, though some gas may be locally trapped by changes in perfusion. Rest in a cold environment will reduce inert gas exchange from skin, fat and muscle, whereas exercise will increase gas exchange. Exercise during decompression can reduce decompression time and risk, providing bubbles are not present, but can increase risk if bubbles are present. Inert gas exchange is least favourable for the diver who is warm and exercises at depth during the ingassing phase, and rests and is cold during decompression.|$|E

40|$|Lean-type Pekin duck is a {{commercial}} breed {{that has been}} obtained through long-term selection. Investigation of the differentially expressed genes in breast muscle <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> <b>fat</b> at different developmental stages will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the lean-type Pekin duck phenotype. In the present study, RNA-seq was performed on breast muscle <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> <b>fat</b> at 2 -, 4 - and 6 -weeks of age. More than 89 % of the annotated duck genes were covered by our RNA-seq dataset.

2500|$|The Ancient Greeks and Romans {{believed}} the blood, excrement, rectum, genitalia, eyes, tongue, hair, <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fat,</b> {{as well as}} the ash of different parts of the striped hyena's body, were effective means to ward off evil and to ensure love and fertility. The Greeks and Romans believed that the genitalia of a hyena [...] "would hold a couple peaceably together" [...] and that a hyena anus worn as an amulet on the upper arm would make its male possessor irresistible to women. [...] In West and South Asia, hyena body parts apparently {{play an important role in}} love magic and in the making of amulets. In Iranian folklore, it is mentioned that a stone found in the hyenas body can serve as a charm of protection for whoever wears it on his upper arm. In the Pakistani province of Sindh, the local Muslims place the tooth of a striped hyena over churns in order not to lose the milk's baraka. In Iran, a dried striped hyena pelt is considered a potent charm which forces all to succumb to the possessors attraction. In Afghanistan and Pakistan striped hyena hair is used either in love magic or as a charm in sickness. Hyena blood has been held in high regard in northern India as potent medicine, and the eating of the tongue helps fight tumors. In the Khyber area, burned striped hyena fat is applied to a man's genitals or sometimes taken orally to ensure virility, while in India the fat serves as a cure for rheumatism. In Afghanistan, some mullahs wear the vulva (kus) of a female striped hyena wrapped in silk under their armpits for a week. If a man peers through the vulva at the woman of his desire, he will invariably get hold of her. This has led to the proverbial expression in Dari of kus-e kaftar bay, as well as in Pashto of kus-e kaftar which literally mean [...] "it happens as smoothly as if you would look through the vulva of a female striped hyena". In the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan, the Pakhtun keep the vulva in vermilion powder, itself having aphrodesic connotations. The rectum of a freshly killed striped hyena is likewise used by homosexuals and bisexuals to attract young men. This has led to the expression [...] "to possess the anus of a [...] hyena" [...] which denotes somebody who is attractive and has many lovers. A striped hyena's penis kept in a small box filled with vermilion powder can be used for the same reasons.|$|E
