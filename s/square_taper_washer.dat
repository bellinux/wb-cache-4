2500|$|... a <b>square</b> <b>tapered</b> spindle. The taper is 2 degrees {{with respect}} to the centerline. There are at least two non-interchangeable {{dimensions}} (e.g. Shimano and Campagnolo use competing standards in <b>square</b> <b>taper,</b> viz. JIS and ISO respectively, where the ISO spindle is longer and its taper end is slightly smaller. [...] Most parts made by European manufacturers are to the ISO standard, and most Asian manufacturers use the JIS (Shimano) standard), and two orientations: diamond and square. The hole in the crank in which one screws a crank puller almost always has a diameter of 22 mm, though some old French cranks (Stonglight and T.A.) require a different puller.|$|R
50|$|In typical modern bikes, {{the bottom}} bracket spindle is {{separate}} from the cranks. This {{is known as a}} three-piece crankset. The cranks attach to the spindle via a common <b>square</b> <b>taper,</b> a cotter or via a variety of splined interfaces.|$|R

50|$|I-beams are {{commonly}} made of structural steel {{but may also}} be formed from aluminium or other materials. A common type of I-beam is the rolled steel joist (RSJ)â€”sometimes incorrectly rendered as reinforced steel joist. British and European standards also specify Universal Beams (UBs) and Universal Columns (UCs). These sections have parallel flanges, {{as opposed to the}} varying thickness of RSJ flanges which are seldom now rolled in the UK. Parallel flanges are easier to connect to and do away with the need for <b>tapering</b> <b>washers.</b> UCs have equal or near-equal width and depth and are more suited to being oriented vertically to carry axial load such as columns in multi-storey construction, while UBs are significantly deeper than they are wide are more suited to carrying bending load such as beam elements in floors.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the Friction Stir Welding has provided an alternative improved way of producing aluminium joints, in a faster and reliable manner. In this study the effect of tool pin profile on the mechanical and metallurgical properties of dissimilar AA 6351 - AA 5083 H 111 joints produced by FSW is analyzed. Five different tool pin profiles are developed such as straight cylindrical, threaded cylindrical, <b>square,</b> <b>tapered</b> <b>square,</b> and <b>tapered</b> octagon to weld the joints. All the welds are produced perpendicularly to the rolling direction for both alloys. Tensile tests {{are performed to evaluate}} the mechanical properties by using computerized universal testing machine. Color metallographic is carried out along various zones of the friction stir welded. Among the five tools square pin profile give better tensile strength and the stirred zone of the welded area has finer grains compared to other weld zones...|$|R

50|$|Not all <b>square</b> <b>taper</b> crank {{and bottom}} bracket {{combinations}} are compatible. Although nearly all spindles use a 2 degree taper, {{there are two}} competing standards, defined by the measurement across the flat {{at the end of}} the spindle. The JIS size is used by Shimano and most other Asian manufacturers. The ISO size is primarily used by Campagnolo and other European manufacturers, in addition to cranks that adhere to the NJS standards (Sugino 75). Some manufacturers make cranks and bottom brackets to both specifications.|$|R

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) {{process is}} a solid state joining method in which the {{material}} that is being welded does not melt and recast. This process uses a non-consumable tool to generate frictional heat in the abutting surfaces. The welding parameters {{play a major role}} in deciding the joint characteristics. In this investigation the effect of welding speed and tool pin geometry in friction stir welds of Aluminium alloy was studied. The welded joints were made of Aluminium alloy AA 6101 T 6 strips of 6 mm thickness with different tool pin profile (Cylindrical, <b>Taper</b> cylindrical, <b>Square</b> and <b>Taper</b> <b>Square).</b> All the welding operations were done at the room temperature. Charpy tests were carried out to find the impact strength. From this investigation it is found that strength is superior with <b>taper</b> <b>square</b> tool pin profile than cylindrical, <b>taper</b> cylindrical and <b>square</b> tool pin profile. The pieces weld at rotational speed of 1200 r. p. m and welding speed of 70 mm/min using <b>taper</b> <b>square</b> tool have higher strength...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{flexural strength}} behavior of isolated <b>square</b> <b>tapered</b> and beam-slab reinforced footings are presented. Yield line solutions are developed for generalized contact pressure distributions {{and the influence}} of taper, beam size, fillet size, negative moment capacity, and contact pressure distribution on the collapse load is brought out. In beam-slab footings the optimum relative beam capacity required to make the beam rigid is indicated. Results of experimental investigations on footings resting on sand reveal that tapered (with isotropic as well as with alternative reinforcement patterns) and beam-slab footings exhibit superior structural behavior in terms of normalized first crack load, collapse load, relative rigidity, relative efficiency, and failure mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The {{geometric}} {{shape of}} dental arch (<b>square,</b> <b>tapering,</b> ovoid) {{is an important}} factor in stress distribution pattern around dental implant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of arch form and the amount of bone loss (normal, moderate, high) in stress distribution around dental implant by considering different load direction. Three arch forms; <b>square,</b> ovoid, and <b>tapering</b> with three different stages of bone loss were designed. Models were divided into three-dimensional elements, which made 5500 nodes. The 143 N load was applied at two angles (straight, oblique) at the last fixture, 8 mm, and 16 mm from the center of implant on l!ie cantilever. The Sap 90 software was used for analyzing the stress distribution in this study. 54 different conditions were evaluated. Results showed that stress concentration changed from support toward fixture due to distally changing the load in the square and ovoid arch forms with normal bone. In the tapering arch with normal bone stress concentration was around the fixture. The amount of stress in normal tapering arch was more than physiologic extend, therefore, application of cantilever in tapering arches is not recommended...|$|R
