5|$|Cristián Blasser and Mario Gutiérrez, {{students}} from the Escuela Consolidada de <b>San</b> <b>Carlos</b> (now Liceo Politécnico de <b>San</b> <b>Carlos),</b> and Sergio Rojas, {{who worked at the}} school, formed a band in 1968. Upon hearing an announcement of a bands tournament organized by La Discusión radio station from Chillán, they recruited Germaín de la Fuente, who was well known in the local scene for his vocal abilities. Blasser and Gutiérrez played the guitar, Rojas the bass, and De la Fuente became the keyboardist and lead vocalist. Most of the band members were musically inspired by acts such as The Beatles except De la Fuente, who did not like them at all and wanted to do bolero music. As a result, they created a mixed style known as the Balada rockmántica or Bolero-beat.|$|E

5|$|British {{aircraft}} received fighter {{control from}} warships in <b>San</b> <b>Carlos</b> Water, although its effectiveness was limited by their being stationed {{close to the}} islands, which severely limited {{the effectiveness of their}} radar. The differences in tactics and training between 800 Squadron and 801 Squadron has been a point of criticism, suggesting that the losses of several ships were preventable had Sea Harriers from Hermes been used more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} he left Maracaibo, Morgan returned. He was told that a Spanish defence squadron, the Armada de Barlovento, {{was waiting for him}} at the narrow passage between the Caribbean and Lake Maracaibo, where the <b>San</b> <b>Carlos</b> de la Barra Fortress was sited. The forces, under the command of Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, had 126 cannon with which to attack Morgan, and had re-armed <b>San</b> <b>Carlos</b> de la Barra Fortress. The Spaniards had orders to end piracy in the Caribbean, and {{negotiations}} between Morgan and Espinosa continued for a week. The final offer put by the Spanish commander was for Morgan to leave all their spoils and slave and to return to Jamaica unmolested, but no agreement was reached that would allow Morgan and his men to pass the fleet with their spoils but without attack. Morgan put the Spaniards' offers to his men, who voted instead to fight their way out. As they were heavily outgunned, one privateer suggested that a fire ship aimed at Espinosa's flagship, Magdalen would work.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano {{completed}} his first {{studies at the}} <b>San</b> <b>Carlos</b> school, where he learned Latin, philosophy, logic, physics, metaphysics, and literature; he graduated in 1786. Domingo had sufficient success as merchant to send his two sons Francisco and Manuel to study in Europe. He expected them to study commerce, but Manuel decided to study law. Belgrano was so successful and attained such prestige that Pope Pius VI allowed him to study forbidden literature, even books deemed as heretical, excepting only the astrological and obscene books. In this way he {{came into contact with}} authors like Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Filangieri, who were forbidden in Spain.|$|E

25|$|The {{most famous}} place, of course, to hear music in Naples is the <b>San</b> <b>Carlo</b> opera house.

Besides being {{the home of the}} opera, <b>San</b> <b>Carlo</b> is the most frequent venue several times a year for large visiting orchestras. The nearby Teatro Mercadante, a charming old theater from the late 1790s—and along with <b>San</b> <b>Carlo</b> one of the official royal theaters of the day—has reopened after many decades of sporadic use.|$|R
5|$|The British army {{encountered}} {{an extremely}} hostile population, prepared to resist {{to the degree}} that even women, children and slaves voluntarily participated in the defense. The headquarters of the Regiment of Patricians were located at the Real Colegio de <b>San</b> <b>Carlos,</b> where Saavedra and Juan José Viamonte stopped the column of Denis Pack and Henry Cadogan, composed of British infantry and a cannon. Pack united his remaining forces with Craufurd and resisted inside the Santo Domingo convent. Cadogan took the nearby house of Pedro Medrano, and fired from the rooftop. Both groups were finally defeated by the local soldiers. Finally, the British General John Whitelocke surrendered, ending the attack and pledging to withdraw all British forces from Montevideo.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} fought at the {{location}} of the modern city of San Lorenzo, Santa Fe which is next to the Paraná River, at the point of its widest flow. The west bank of the river was tall and steep, forming a natural obstacle, and ships could only land troops and materials {{on that side of the}} river using man-made paths cut into the side. The battlefield was near one of these paths, shaped like a ladder, after which the terrain was a big plain with scattered bushes. The <b>San</b> <b>Carlos</b> Convent, the main nearby building, was a short distance away from the river.|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus {{was present}} {{on both sides}} of the Western Interior Seaway. Specimens have been {{described}} from 10 U.S. states: Utah, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and North Carolina. David Schwimmer has said Deinosuchus fossils have been found in South Carolina and Delaware as well, but none of them from those two states have been formally described. A Deinosuchus osteoderm from the <b>San</b> <b>Carlos</b> Formation was also reported in 2006, so the giant crocodilian's range may have included parts of northern Mexico. Deinosuchus fossils are most abundant in the Gulf Coastal Plain region of Georgia, near the Alabama border. All known specimens of Deinosuchus were found in rocks dated to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. The oldest examples of this genus lived approximately 82 Ma, and the youngest lived around 73Ma.|$|E
50|$|The {{church of}} <b>San</b> <b>Carlo</b> alle Quattro Fontane (Saint Charles at the Four Fountains), also called , is a Roman Catholic church in Rome, Italy. The church was {{designed}} by the architect Francesco Borromini {{and it was his}} first independent commission. It is an iconic masterpiece of Baroque architecture, built as part of a complex of monastic buildings on the Quirinal Hill for the Spanish Trinitarians, an order dedicated to the freeing of Christian slaves. He received the commission in 1634, under the patronage of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, whose palace was across the road. However, this financial backing did not last and subsequently the building project suffered various financial difficulties. It is one of at least three churches in Rome dedicated to <b>San</b> <b>Carlo,</b> including <b>San</b> <b>Carlo</b> ai Catinari and <b>San</b> <b>Carlo</b> al Corso.|$|R
