5|$|The famous University of the Philippines Diliman <b>Sunken</b> Garden {{was named}} as General Antonio Luna Parade Grounds.|$|E
5|$|Viking Bergen Island, a <b>sunken</b> {{island of}} the early Holocene.|$|E
5|$|A <b>sunken</b> gardinene, {{shaped like}} a lotus when viewed from above, {{features}} large stones engraved with quotes from world luminaries ranging from Shakespeare and Martin Luther King to Swami Vivekananda and Swaminarayan.|$|E
5|$|The Household Brigade {{crossed the}} crest of the Allied {{position}} and charged downhill. The cuirassiers guarding d'Erlon's left flank were still dispersed, and so were swept over the deeply <b>sunken</b> main road and then routed.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} form of decoration is relief. Relief became more extensive over time, and in late temples, walls, ceilings, columns, and beams were all decorated, as were free-standing stelae erected within the enclosure. Egyptian artists used both bas relief and <b>sunken</b> relief. Bas relief allowed more subtle artistry but involved more carving than <b>sunken</b> relief. <b>Sunken</b> relief was therefore used on harder, more difficult stone {{and when the}} builders wanted to finish quickly. It was also appropriate for exterior surfaces, where the shadows it created made the figures stand out in bright sunlight. Finished reliefs were painted using the basic colors black, white, red, yellow, green, and blue, although the artists often mixed pigments to create other colors. In some cases, gilding or inlaid pieces of colored glass or faience substituted for paint.|$|E
5|$|After {{a battle}} with Erinys, Kratos arrives in Sparta and {{witnesses}} a group of Spartans tearing down a statue of Ares, intent on replacing it with one of Kratos. Kratos then chases a dissenter loyal to Ares into the Spartan Jails, who attempts to kill Kratos by releasing the Piraeus Lion. Defeating both foes, Kratos journeys to the Temple of Ares, where he encounters the spirit of his child self and learns that he must return to the now <b>sunken</b> Atlantis and locate the Domain of Death. Before leaving, a loyal Spartan provides him with his former weapons—used during Kratos' days as a Captain of the Spartan army—the Arms of Sparta. After returning to the <b>sunken</b> Atlantis, Kratos receives great resentment from Poseidon for sinking his beloved city.|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Hurricane Kate sank one boat near Puerto Rico and {{disabled}} three others. The crew of five on the <b>sunken</b> boat were rescued after 17hours. Several homes in northern Puerto Rico were damaged, forcing hundreds to evacuate. Flooding was also {{reported in the}} Dominican Republic, including around the capital Santo Domingo.|$|E
5|$|Of the 74 German {{ships in}} Scapa Flow, 15 of the 16 capital ships, 5 of the 8 cruisers, and 32 of the 50 destroyers were sunk. The {{remainder}} either remained afloat, or were towed to shallower waters and beached. The beached ships were later dispersed to the allied navies, {{but most of}} the <b>sunken</b> ships were initially left at the bottom of Scapa Flow, the cost of salvaging them being deemed to be not worth the potential returns, owing to the glut of scrap metal left {{after the end of the}} war, with plenty of obsolete warships having been broken up. After complaints from locals that the wrecks were a hazard to navigation, a salvage company was formed in 1923, which raised four of the <b>sunken</b> destroyers.|$|E
5|$|Structure 2 is {{a pyramid}} on the {{northwest}} side of the <b>sunken</b> Plaza 8. It is largely unrestored. Structure 3 lies across the plaza to the southeast. It is a platform with a twin stairway facing northwest onto the plaza.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} along the Gulf Coast. Many marine vessels were blown ashore or <b>sunken</b> in Pensacola, and railroads {{in the city}} were severely damaged. Numerous wharfs were damaged or destroyed, and many roofs were torn off buildings. Three forts {{in the vicinity of}} Pensacola suffered damage. Electricity in the city was shut off. A total of 35 people were killed in Pensacola. Mobile and surrounding areas suffered similar damage, including destroyed timber, smashed windows, and <b>sunken</b> watercraft. In Mississippi, over 300,000 cotton bales were ruined during the hurricane, amounting to $12,000,000 in damage. Damage in New Orleans was minimal; however, Lake Pontchartrain overflowed, flooding the city. The hurricane killed a total of 134 people.|$|E
5|$|The parkway was {{proposed}} to help bridge {{a gap in}} the eastern part of the Long Island Parkway system. Construction began in 1949 with the opening of an interchange between Bay Shore Road and the Southern State Parkway. Work on the parkway itself began the following year, with plans calling for connections to three spurs: the Captree State Parkway (now Robert Moses Causeway), the <b>Sunken</b> Meadow Spur (<b>Sunken</b> Meadow State Parkway), and the Heckscher Spur (Heckscher State Parkway). The parkway was completed in 1952, closing the highway loop on Long Island. In 2001, a study by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) called for the Sagtikos State Parkway to be widened to include new bus and carpool lanes from end to end.|$|E
5|$|The {{right-of-way}} {{on which}} the parkway was built had originally {{been part of a}} private road leading to Sagtikos Manor. The parkway was designed to have connections with the <b>Sunken</b> Meadow Spur (the future <b>Sunken</b> Meadow State Parkway) and the Captree State Parkway (now known as the Robert Moses Causeway) proposed by New York City highway engineer Robert Moses. On November13, 1949, a new interchange between the Southern State Parkway and Bay Shore Road was opened to traffic. This interchange would eventually serve as the Southern State Parkway's junction with the Sagtikos, Heckscher and Captree state parkways. Proposals conceived at this time called for grading on the new Sagtikos State Parkway to begin in early 1950.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Azores, the extratropical {{remnants}} of Tanya produced high winds. As a result, extensive property damage occurred, which included destroyed or damaged houses, and <b>sunken</b> boats; {{there were also}} reports of significant damage to agriculture. However, an exact damage toll figure in unknown. In addition, there was one fatality and several injuries.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, {{the bulk}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. As they were the oldest German dreadnoughts, the Nassau-class ships were for the time {{permitted}} to remain in German ports. After the German fleet was scuttled, Nassau and her three sisters were surrendered to the victorious Allied powers as replacements for the <b>sunken</b> ships. Nassau was ceded to Japan in April 1920. With no use for the ship, Japan sold her to a British wrecking firm which then scrapped her in Dordrecht, Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Among other achievements, Bachelder {{developed}} {{methods for}} the purification {{of the rare}} elements tellurium and indium. Other aspects of her broad scientific expertise found application {{in the field of}} marine archaeology, when she determined the chemical composition of brass cannons found in the Aegean Sea on <b>sunken</b> ships. She also made contributions to astrochemistry, when NASA asked her to analyze the chemistry of Moon rocks which had been collected from the Moon's surface during the Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972.|$|E
5|$|Ariel and Eric reunite on {{the surface}} before Ursula gains full control of the entire ocean, {{creating}} a storm and bringing <b>sunken</b> ships to the surface. In her attempt to murder Ariel, Ursula herself is impaled to death {{by one of the}} wrecked ships. With Ursula slain, Triton and the other polyps are restored to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel truly loves Eric, Triton willingly changes her from a mermaid into a human and approves her marriage to Eric. Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800 three folly walls {{had been}} added to the {{existing}} ruined walls {{on the east side of}} the castle to make it look more impressive from Norton Priory, the home of SirRichard Brooke. One of these walls was demolished around 1906. During the Victorian era a <b>sunken</b> garden and two bowling greens were constructed within the castle enclosure. In 1977 the castle was leased to Halton Borough Council. In 1986–87 the site of the castle was excavated.|$|E
5|$|Ballcourt 1 (the <b>Sunken</b> Ballcourt) was {{dedicated}} in 699 by K'inich B'aaknal Chaak to mark three victories over K'inich Kan Balam II of Palenque. Sculptures of the torsos of six captured vassals of the Palenque king {{were used as}} ballcourt markers. One of these vassals is named as Yax Ahk (Green Turtle), who was the lord of Annay Te', a site that probably lay {{on the south side}} of the Usumacinta between Piedras Negras and Yaxchilán.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the study}} are Churchill's bedroom and his ensuite bathroom, with <b>sunken</b> bath. At {{the time of}} the house's opening to the public in 1966, these rooms were not made accessible, at the request of Churchill's family but, shortly before her death in 2014, Churchill's {{daughter}} Mary gave permission for their opening, and the Trust plans to make them accessible by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Claymore {{took place}} on 4 March 1941. The Germans were caught {{unprepared}} and the landings were unopposed. Within an hour No. 4 Commando had taken all its objectives. The raid was a success: 11 fish oil factories and storage tanks were destroyed, 10 ships sunk, 225 prisoners taken with {{an unknown number of}} German sailors killed on the <b>sunken</b> ships. An added bonus were the 315 Norwegian volunteers brought back to join the Free Norwegian Forces.|$|E
5|$|Development of Lae as a port, on {{the other}} hand, was envisaged from the start; but when the town was captured, the port was blocked by <b>sunken</b> barges and debris. The only {{discharge}} facilities were two rickety jetties unable to hold trucks. The first cargo was delivered by LST, and brought ashore over the beach by DUKWs, LCMs and lighters. Australian and American DUKWs were operated as a common pool. Initially, the US Navy would only allow the LSTs to arrive at night, {{and they had to}} shove off before daybreak. Only in November did it allow them to operate in daylight. <b>Sunken</b> Japanese barges were cleared away by a 150-ton floating crane. American engineers then installed a floating dock, which was towed to Lae in sections. It opened on 20 October, and a Type C1 ship, the Cape Kreig, discharged there that day. A new dock was completed on 23 November, although it was used to unload the Liberty ship Fremont Older on 15 November. A fuel jetty was built, along with a bulk petroleum storage facility, and the first tanker discharged there on 20 November. A 4-inch pipeline was run through to Nadzab.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval <b>sunken</b> spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.|$|E
5|$|El Sol {{settled on}} the bottom at a 45° angle with only the tops of her masts {{protruding}} above the surface; the Morgan Line house flag—a blue house flag with a red M inside a white star—still fluttered in the breeze. Even though the <b>sunken</b> vessel was not considered a hazard to navigation, in another fog two days later a Staten Island Ferryboat nearly hit El Sols wreck.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the passage}} of the hurricane, {{reinforcement}} workers quickly repaired the communication network, and other workers distributed aid to victims in Sonora. The Mexican government allocated about $ (1995USD, $ 1995 MXN, $ USD) in funds for the restoration of houses and the overall infrastructure. Officials distributed 4,800 sheets, 500 cushions, and 1,500 blankets to hurricane victims. All <b>sunken</b> ships and drowned bodies were ultimately recovered by divers.|$|E
5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} how England was settled with Anglo-Saxon people between c. 450 and 1066 AD, making {{the country a}} land of villages. Estate boundaries from this period survive in features such as <b>sunken</b> lanes and banks. The Scandinavian conquest of much of England from the late 9th century added more villages, though many with Scandinavian placename elements such as -by ('village') may simply have been renamed Saxon settlements.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 the CIA's Project Azorian, through billionaire Howard Hughes, {{commissioned}} the ship Hughes Glomar Explorer with {{the cover story}} of harvesting manganese nodules from the sea floor. That triggered a rush of activity to collect manganese nodules, which was not actually practical. The real mission of Hughes Glomar Explorer was to raise a <b>sunken</b> Soviet submarine, the K-129, {{with the goal of}} retrieving Soviet code books.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the wreck}} was located by Danish divers. The British marine {{archeologist}} Innes McCartney led a subsequent dive and {{confirmed that the}} wreck sits upright on the sea floor and is largely intact. Skeletal remains from the ship's crew are scattered around the <b>sunken</b> cruiser. The wreck was positively identified when McCartney's team recovered the ship's bell in 2001, which they donated to the Laboe Naval Memorial near Kiel, where the bell is currently on display.|$|E
5|$|In a {{hearings}} {{before the}} United States Steamboat Inspection Service, Captain Knowles of El Sol {{and the captain}} of Sac City were both cleared of wrongdoing in the collision, and the blame was laid on the heavy fog. On 31 July, The New York Times reported on the cargo salvage operations still underway on the wreck of El Sol. In three months of continuous operations, the salvage company reported that about 35% of the <b>sunken</b> ship's cargo had been recovered. The hulk of El Sol was scrapped later in 1927.|$|E
5|$|In archaeological nomenclature, Norte Chico is a pre-ceramic {{culture of}} the pre-Columbian Late Archaic; it {{completely}} lacked ceramics and apparently had almost no visual art. The most impressive achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large earthwork platform mounds and <b>sunken</b> circular plazas. Archaeological evidence suggests use of textile technology and, possibly, the worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian Andean cultures. Sophisticated government is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the Royal Crescent is a Ha-ha, a trench on which the inner side of which is {{vertical}} and faced with stone, with the outer face sloped and turfed, making the trench, in effect, a <b>sunken</b> fence or retaining wall. The ha-ha is designed not to interrupt the view from Royal Victoria Park, and to be invisible until seen from close by.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Margaret Chaloner, {{wife of the}} first Lord Gisborough, laid out formal gardens of a typical late-Victorian and Edwardian design with {{elaborate}} bedding schemes and gravelled paths. There was a rose garden and a <b>sunken</b> Italian garden with an ornamental pool at its centre. They were {{open to the public}} for a small fee and could be entered through a gateway on Bow Street. The gardens are now freely accessible.|$|E
5|$|New {{settlements}} appearing {{along the}} rivers Mureş, Someş, and Târnava reflects {{a period of}} tranquility in Gepidia until around 568. The common people in Biharia, Cenad, Moreşti, and other villages lived in <b>sunken</b> huts covered with gabled roofs but with no hearths or ovens. They were primarily farmers, but looms, combs, and other products evidence the existence of local workshops. Trading contacts between Gepidia and faraway regions is evidenced by finds of amber beads and brooches manufactured in the Crimea, Mazovia or Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|North Parade Bridge {{was built}} almost 100 {{years later in}} 1836 by William Tierney Clark. His {{original}} bridge was made of cast iron on stone abutments, with lodges and staircases. This was rebuilt in 1936 completely in stone. Many of the buildings in South Parade are now hotels and restaurants whilst some remain as private residences. The area which Wood envisaged as an area of <b>sunken</b> gardens matching the houses is now a car park.|$|E
5|$|Of humble origin, uneducated, and fatherless {{from a young}} age, {{he watched}} over his family's flock of sheep before apprenticing to a {{shipbuilder}} {{near his home in}} present-day Maine. He moved to Boston to start a business building ships and soon began to embark on treasure-hunting expeditions to the West Indies. He became famous in London and Boston for recovering a large treasure from a <b>sunken</b> Spanish galleon, a feat that earned him instant wealth and a knighthood.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1943, {{during the}} Battle of the Bismarck Sea, General George Kenney ordered Allied patrol boats and {{aircraft}} to attack Japanese rescue vessels, {{as well as}} the survivors from the <b>sunken</b> vessels on life rafts and swimming or floating in the sea. This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination and promptly returned to active service. These orders violated the Hague Convention of 1907, which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Piper Maru, a French salvage vessel, is {{exploring}} the Pacific Ocean. Gauthier, {{a member of}} the ship's crew, dives down into the sea and finds a <b>sunken</b> fighter plane from World War II. He is shocked to find a man alive in the plane's cockpit, with what looks like black oil in his eyes. When Gauthier returns to the surface, he has become possessed by the black oil.|$|E
