50|$|Conductive CNT {{coatings}} {{have recently}} become a prospective substitute based on {{wide range of}} methods including <b>spraying,</b> <b>spin</b> coating, casting, layer-by-layer, and Langmuir-Blodgett deposition. The transfer from a filter membrane to the transparent support using a solvent or {{in the form of an}} adhesive film is another method for attaining flexible and optically transparent CNT films. Other research efforts have shown that films made of arc-discharge CNT can result in a high conductivity and transparency. Furthermore, the work function of SWCNT networks is in the 4.8 to 4.9 eV range (compared to ITO which has a lower work function of 4.7 eV) leading to the expectation that the SWCNT work function should be high enough to assure efficient hole collection. Another benefit is that SWCNT films exhibit a high optical transparency in a broad spectral range from the UV-visible to the near-infrared range. Only a few materials retain reasonable transparency in the infrared spectrum while maintaining transparency in the visible part of the spectrum as well as acceptable overall electrical conductivity. SWCNT films are highly flexible, do not creep, do not crack after bending, theoretically have high thermal conductivities to tolerate heat dissipation, and have high radiation resistance. However, the electrical sheet resistance of ITO is an order of magnitude less than the sheet resistance measured for SWCNT films. Nonetheless, initial research studies demonstrate SWCNT thin films can be used as conducting, transparent electrodes for hole collection in OPV devices with efficiencies between 1% and 2.5% confirming that they are comparable to devices fabricated using ITO. Thus, possibilities exist for advancing this research to develop CNT-based transparent electrodes that exceed the performance of traditional ITO materials.|$|R

Indeed, polymer-based materials in space exhibit larger degradation effects due to the combination of energetic UV radiations, vacuum, atomic oxygen, as well as large temperature gradients, which generate thermal stresses inside the structures. The health monitoring of composite structures in the aerospace and astronautic fields is a concept of great interest in view of the potential re-usability of such structures. Main applications include earth-deck panels and lateral panels of spacecrafts, in particular addressing shape and stress monitoring during ground testing and orbit operation. An open question in structural health monitoring (SHM) for composites remains the integration of sensors into the components, and the characterization of their micromechanical behavior.

A range of edible materials {{can be used as}} shell materials of encapsulates, including polysaccharides, fats, waxes and proteins (see Chap. 3 of this book). Encapsulates for typical industrial applications can vary from several microns to several millimetres in diameter although there is an increasing interest in preparing nano-encapsulates. Encapsulates are basically particles with a core-shell structure, but some of them can have a more complex structure, e. g. in a form of multiple cores embedded in a matrix. Particles have physical, mechanical and structural properties, including particle size, size distribution, morphology, surface charge, wall thickness, mechanical strength, glass transition temperature, degree of crystallinity, flowability and permeability. Information about the properties of encapsulates is very important to understanding their behaviours in different environments, including their manufacturing processes and end-user applications. E. g. encapsulates for most industrial applications should have desirable mechanical strength, which should be strong enough to withstand various mechanical forces generated in manufacturing processes, such as mixing, pumping, extrusion, etc., and may be required to be weak enough in order to release the encapsulated {{active ingredients}} by mechanical forces at their end-user applications, such as release rate of flavour by chewing. The mechanical strength of encapsulates and release rate of their food actives are related to their size, morphology, wall thickness, chemical composition, structure etc. Hence, reliable methods which can be used to characterize these properties of encapsulates are vital.

A better solution to the icing problems is the introduction of an anti-icing surface which hinders ice formation and reduces ice adhesion if formed. Such surfaces have received {{a great deal of attention}} the last years, and one of the most investigated candidates is superhydrophobic surfaces. Such surfaces offer several advantages as they repel water, reduce the probability of ice forming due to low contact area, and can reduce ice adhesion, but their durability and performance under icing conditions have been questioned. In this work superhydrophobic surfaces, exhibiting contact angles above 150 degree and roll-off angles lower than 10 degree, on steel have been produced by a simple and scalable method. The substrates have been sandblasted with both fine and coarse sand and SiO 2 -nanoparticles have been deposited, yielding a hierarchical surface structure. The surface chemistry has been altered by the addition of a hydrophobic coating layer based on the precursor 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane. The method for depositing both nanoparticles and the hydrophobic top layer has been optimized by a systematic investigation of several coating techniques, including dip coating, <b>spray</b> coating, <b>spin</b> coating and vapor deposition.

The electrochemical cell used was a stan-dard three-electrode system. Indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting glass (Applied Films, 20 ~/a) and plati-num foil were used as working and counter electro-des, and Ag/AgCI(3. 8 M KCI) as a reference elec-trode. A PAR Model 372 potentiostat and an HP Model 7005 B X-Y plotter were used for electro-chemical measurements. The spectroelectrochemi-stry studies were carried out with a Philips Model PU 8620 spectrometer. The deposition solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of molybdenum foil in 6 ml of hydrogen peroxide (30 %). When the metal wa...|$|R

Taylor is an Assistant Professor of Chemical & Environmental Engineering at Yale University. Runtime: 63 : 30 minutesOne {{of the key}} {{challenges}} facing the widespread use and commercialization of promising energy devices (i. e. fuel cells, batteries, organic solar cells etc.) is {{the high cost of}} the electrocatalytic and electrolyte materials and inefficiencies in their assembly and utilization. In this talk, I will present three examples of how we are designing nanomaterials such as graphene-based carbons and bulk metallic glass (BMG) alloys that can be incorporated into multifunctional composites for high performance nanostructured-enabled energy devices. 1) Electrocatalysts. We will describe a new class of materials, Pt 58 Cu 15 Ni 5 P 22 bulk metallic glass that can circumvent Pt-based anode poisoning and agglomeration/dissolution typically associated with supported catalysts during long-term operation in fuel cells. These amorphous metal alloys can serve as an interesting platform for next-generation catalysts and devices. 2) <b>Spin</b> <b>Spray</b> Layer-by-Layer (SSLBL) Assembly. We have developed a fully automated SSLBL system with deposition at sub-second cycle times allowing nano-level control over film growth and efficient formation of a conducting network not available with other solution based deposition methods for lithium ion battery electrodes. 3) Network Electrodes (See Fig.). Here we describe a technique for developing freestanding multifunctional SWNT composite thin films that provides a fundamental engineering basis {{to bridge the gap between}} their nano and macroscale properties for solar cell transparent conductive electrodes. We will also describe recent efforts in using these films as active layers in hybrid SWNT/Si solar cell device as well as the use of Förster resonance energy transfer for high efficiency polymer solar cells...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, {{a process}} for {{producing}} 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiopene (EDOT) and 3, 4 -propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) containing π-conjugated conducting polymers (CP) via solid state oxidative conversion (SOC) of novel processable poly(arylene-alt-silylene) (the silane) precursors is reported. The primary advantage is the processability in the precursor stage, and conversion to CP after the desired shape has been casted. The significance of the preparation and conversion of the silane precursors is due to the emergence of poly(EDOT) (PEDOT) over the years as an industrially applicable material for the production of optically transparent conductive coatings, hole injection layers in organic light emitting diodes and organic photovoltaics, to name a few. High molecular weight silanes are prepared in good yield in one pot from aryl moiety and dialkyldichlorosilane. The precursors have good thermal properties, store well, and processing via conventional techniques (e. g. dip, <b>spin,</b> <b>spray</b> coating etc.) is feasible. ^ Two modes of solid state precursor conversion to CP are described: (1) Electrochemical (Chapters 3, 4) and (2) Solvent-free bromine vapor (Chapter 5). In the former, films of the precursor on the working electrode are converted to CP by electrodesilylation in the presence of an electrolyte. In the latter approach, exposure to bromine vapor followed by heat, ensues a tandem bromodesilylation and in-situ couplings generating CP with poly(dimethylsiloxane). Previous reports of solid state polymerization in crystalline small molecules are therefore complemented with amorphous polymeric systems. ^ Conducting π-conjugated polymers (CPs) attract much attention from academia and industry as they offer specific advantages over inorganics by virtue of their polymeric nature. The rigid π-conjugated backbone, however, render them insoluble, intractable, and infusible. Thus, the wide variety of processing technologies for commodity plastics cannot be applied to these elite materials. In order to harness these materials as commercially viable products, processing of these materials into devices is crucial. The work outlined herewith suggests a step towards overcoming this hurdle, and make conjugated polymers industrially attractive. The conversion of poly(arylene- alt-silylene) to predominately CP can be applied to a multitude of thiophene monomers and is anticipated to be applicable to furans, pyrroles and other heteroaromatics. ...|$|R
