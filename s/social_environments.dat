40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to examine how managers’ {{personal}} values and managers’ attitudes towards the natural and <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> are shaping the ethics of those same managers in public administration. The findings are based on a sample of 212 managers from Slovenian public administration. Personal values were measured using the Schwartz value survey, while attitudes toward natural and <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> were measured with a validated questionnaire. Results show that managers’ self-enhancing values are positively related to their attitudes toward both natural and <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> and their ethics. Managers’ self-transcendence values were found to be negatively associated with their attitudes toward the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> and their ethics. Managers’ attitudes toward natural and <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> are both positively related with the managers’ ethics. The mediation effect of the attitudes towards the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> on the relationships between managers’ personal values and their ethics is positive and significant. The main cognition is that managers’ attitudes towards the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> are a significantly stronger predictor of managers’ ethics than are managers’ personal values...|$|R
40|$|Parks {{increase}} their users’ {{health and well-being}} because they offer settings suitable for physical activity, social interaction, enjoying nature, etc. Applying the socio-physical approach, “park use” behaviour is influenced by several environmental characteristics, including physical <b>environment,</b> <b>social</b> <b>environment,</b> and cultural environment. This study seeks to understand the influence of park <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> based on the perspectives of adolescent park users aged 15 - 18. A qualitative study (interviews) with 17 adolescents aged 15 - 18 (including male and female) shows that the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> of an urban park {{plays an important role}} among adolescents. The research contributes to understanding how the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> influence on park use and thus assists urban planners in measuring key targeted actions to improve the perception of <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> among adolescents to increase park use...|$|R

A range of 1.8% to 3.7% extrapair paternity implies a range of 96% to 98% genetic monogamy. Although the incidence of genetic monogamy may vary from 70% to 99% in different cultures or <b>social</b> <b>environments,</b> {{a large percentage of}} couples remain genetically monogamous during their relationships.

25|$|A schema (pl. schemata) is {{the mental}} {{framework}} that is created as children {{interact with their}} physical and <b>social</b> <b>environments.</b> For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because it comes {{up in the morning}} and goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.|$|E
40|$|Initial mate {{choice and}} re-mating {{strategies}} (infidelity and divorce) influence individual fitness. Both of {{these should be}} influenced by the <b>social</b> <b>environment,</b> which determines the number and availability of potential partners. While most studies looking at this relationship take a population-level approach, individual-level responses to variation in the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> remain largely unstudied. Here, we explore carry-over effects on future mating decisions of the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> in which the initial mating decision occurred. Using detailed data on the winter social networks of great tits, we tested whether the probability of subsequent divorce, a year later, could be predicted by measures of the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> at the time of pairing. We found that males that had a lower proportion of female associates, and whose partner ranked lower among these, as well as inexperienced breeders, were more likely to divorce after breeding. We found no evidence that a female’s <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> influenced the probability of divorce. Our findings highlight the importance of the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> that individuals experience during initial pair formation on later pairing outcomes, and demonstrate that such effects can be delayed. Exploring these extended effects of the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> can yield valuable insights into processes and selective pressures acting upon the mating strategies that individuals adopt. </p...|$|R

25|$|Because {{the small}} number of Chinese {{surnames}} leads to confusion in <b>social</b> <b>environments,</b> and because some Chinese parents have a desire to give individuality, some Chinese have received unusual given names. As of April 2009, about 60 million Chinese people have unusual characters in their names. A 2006 report by the Chinese public security bureau stated that of about 55,000 Chinese characters used in the People's Republic of China, only 32,232 of those are supported by the ministry's computers. The PRC government has asked individuals with unusual names to change them so they can get new computer-readable public identity cards, and the diversity prevents them from receiving new identity cards if they do not change their names.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} (or {{more specifically}} evolutionary psychopathology or psychiatry) {{has also been}} proposed as an overall theory, positing that many mental disorders involve the dysfunctional operation of mental modules adapted to ancestral physical or <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> but not necessarily to modern ones. Other theories suggest that mental illness could have evolutionary advantages for the species, including in enhancing creativity. Some related behavioral abnormalities {{have been found in}} non-human great apes. Evolutionary psychology applies Darwinian principles to human behavior by saying that human minds are products of natural selection and have specific functions. Humans strive to carry on their genetic legacy through their offspring. This theory identifies the environment as having a great effect on a person's mental development.|$|E

40|$|While {{the process}} by which organisations adapt to their task {{environment}} has received much attention from managers and researchers, the non-task, or <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> has received relatively little attention. This paper examines social strategy-environment co-alignment with respect to an organisation's <b>social</b> <b>environment.</b> Based upon a critical examination of the concept of corporate social responsibility orientation (CSRO) as a descriptor of the mode of adaptation to the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> sought by an organisation, it is argued that a new, theoretical construct of CSRO is required, which is based on an organisation's goals, goal-related behaviour and goal-related transactions with the <b>social</b> <b>environment.</b> Propositions are advanced relating an organisation's social adaptation to its level of exposure to the <b>social</b> <b>environment,</b> its philosophy and values, and its ability to derive competitive advantage from stakeholder relationships. Finally, ways in which the new construct can advance theory and practice are offered...|$|R
40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} is to examine {{associations}} between the neighborhood <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) 1 and walking among women, and whether these associations are mediated by perceived personal safety. Methods Women (n = 3784) living in disadvantaged urban and rural neighborhoods within Victoria, Australia completed a self-administered survey on five <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> variables (neighborhood crime, neighborhood violence, seeing others walking and exercising in the neighborhood, social trust/cohesion), perceived personal safety, and their physical activity in 2007 / 8. Linear regression analyses examined associations between <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> variables and LTPA and walking. Potential mediating pathways were assessed using the product-of-coefficients test. Moderated mediation by urban/rural residence was examined. Results Each <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> variable was positively associated with engaging in at least 150 min/week of LTPA (OR = 1. 16 to 1. 56). Only two <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> variables, seeing others walking (OR = 1. 45) and exercising (OR = 1. 31), were associated with ≥ 150 min/week of walking. Perceived personal safety mediated all associations. Stronger mediation was found in urban areas for crime, violence and social trust/cohesion. Conclusion The neighborhood <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> is an important influence on physical activity among women living in disadvantaged areas. Feelings of personal safety should not be included in composite or aggregate scores relating to the <b>social</b> <b>environment...</b>|$|R
25|$|Multimodality in {{classrooms}} {{has brought about}} the need for a new definition of literacy. According to Gunther Kress, a popular theorist of multimodality, literacy, when defined, usually refers to the combination of letters and words to make messages and meaning and can often be attached to other words in order to express knowledge of the separate fields, such as visual- or computer-literacy. However, as multimodality becomes more common, not only {{in classrooms}}, but in work and <b>social</b> <b>environments,</b> the definition of literacy extends. Instead of referring only to reading and alphabetic writing, or being extended to other fields, literacy and its definition now encompass multiple modes. It has become more than just reading and writing, and now includes visual, technological, and social uses among others.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling is a {{means for}} sharing and {{interpreting}} experiences. Peter L. Berger says human life is narratively rooted, humans construct their lives and shape their world into homes in terms of these groundings and memories. Stories are universal in that they can bridge cultural, linguistic and age-related divides. Storytelling can be adaptive for all ages, leaving out the notion of age segregation. Storytelling {{can be used as}} a method to teach ethics, values and cultural norms and differences. Learning is most effective when it takes place in <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> that provide authentic social cues about how knowledge is to be applied. Stories function as a tool to pass on knowledge in a social context. So, every story has 3 parts. First, The setup (The Hero's world before the adventure starts). Second, The Confrontation (The hero's world turned upside down). Third, The Resolution (Hero conquer's villain, but it's not enough for Hero to survive. The Hero or World must be transformed). Any story can be framed in such format.|$|E
25|$|Gender roles within social {{hierarchies}} {{are concerned}} with the question of agency in the conduct of physical violence. Men are expected to exert violence, while women are victimized by it. In conflict situations, rape against men dissolves this relationship and puts men in the ‘receiving’ role of the victim. Similarly, the ‘penetrating’ role of men as opposed to the ‘receiving’ role of women in (conventional) sexual intercourse illustrates this constructed power relationship. Hence, male rape victims experience the worst possible ‘humiliation’ with regards to the ingrained social roles they are traditionally expected to fulfill. Moreover, their stigmatization takes on particularly severe dimensions within conservative <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> in which homosexual intercourse – regardless of consent – is punished harshly. For example, Ugandan male rape victims explain their choice to not speak out with the fear of being branded homosexuals. As homosexuality is widely condemned in Uganda, male victims of sexual violence often struggle to get proper support because they are accused of being gay. In certain cases, gender roles concerning violence and sexual conduct are so deeply ingrained that the mere existence of male rape is denied.|$|E

To do this, I manipulated <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> (2 ̆ 7 same sex 2 ̆ 7 versus 2 ̆ 7 dual sex 2 ̆ 7) and socio-sexual status (2 ̆ 7 high 2 ̆ 7 versus 2 ̆ 7 low 2 ̆ 7) of the males. I then determined what effect these manipulations had on an index of immunocompetence, namely cell-mediated immune response, and two indices of sexual signalling (bill colour and song rate). I found that <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> influenced cell-mediated immune response and sexual signalling in low-status males. These males had lower immune responses and increased sexual signalling in the dual-sex environment compared with the same-sex environment. In contrast, high-status males had similar immune responses and sexual signalling regardless of <b>social</b> <b>environment.</b> These results suggest that <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> can influence immune response and sexual signalling; however, the nature of this effect was context-dependent, with low-status males more affected than high-status males...|$|R

500|$|This {{study has}} been {{extensively}} discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably Adolph Wagner and Henry Morselli, who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant–Catholic differences in suicide seemed {{to be limited to}} German-speaking Europe and thus may have always been the spurious reflection of other factors. Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized {{as an example of the}} logical error termed the ecological fallacy. However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's work really contained an ecological fallacy. More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the micro–macro relations underlying Durkheim's work. Some, such as Inkeles (1959), Johnson (1965) and Gibbs (1968), have claimed that Durkheim's only intent was to explain suicide sociologically within a holistic perspective, emphasizing that [...] "he intended his theory to explain variation among <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals".|$|E
500|$|Expressed {{justifications}} {{for refusing to}} obey laws because of conscience vary. Many conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, members of the historic peace churches are pacifist by doctrine. Other objections can stem from {{a deep sense of}} responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from the conviction that even acceptance of work under military orders acknowledges the principle of conscription that should be everywhere condemned before the world can ever become safe for real democracy. A conscientious objector, however, does not have a primary aim of changing the law. John Dewey considered that conscientious objectors were often the victims of [...] "moral innocency" [...] and inexpertness in moral training: [...] "the moving force of events is always too much for conscience". The remedy was not to deplore the wickedness of those who manipulate world power, but to connect conscience with forces moving in another direction- to build institutions and <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> predicated on the rule of law, for example, [...] "then will conscience itself have compulsive power instead of being forever the martyred and the coerced." [...] As an example, Albert Einstein who had advocated conscientious objection during the First World War and had been a longterm supporter of War Resisters' International reasoned that [...] "radical pacifism" [...] could not be justified in the face of Nazi rearmament and advocated a world federalist organization with its own professional army.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This article reviews {{evidence}} relating <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> {{characteristics to}} patterns of neuroendocrine regulation. To date, {{although there has}} been considerable interest in the effects of social ties and support on health and longevity, less attention has been given to the effects of such <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> characteristics on actual physiologic parameters. Method: Animal and human studies from 1960 s to the present are reviewed for evidence linking <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> characteristics to patterns of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and cardiovascular activity. Results: Community and laboratory-based studies document that characteristics of the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> influence patterns of neuroendocrine reactivity. These effects seem to be highly sensitive to aspects of the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> such as relative social status, the relative stability of the social ordering and, importantly, the quality of social relationships. Although supportive social relationships are often associated with attenuated patterns of HPA and SNS activation, the converse also seems to be true as nonsupportive social interactions are frequently associated with enhanced reactivity. Conclusion: Available evidence regarding links between <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> characteristics and neuroendocrine regulation documents a link between the social and biological realms that may have important consequences for health and longevity. The data provide support for the hypothesis that observed associations between social ties and health and longevity result, at least partially, from the positive influence of such <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> characteristics in reducing neuroendocrine reactivity. The evidence regarding nonsupportive or hostile social relationships highlights the importance of taking a broader view of the potential health effects of the <b>social</b> <b>environment,</b> one that encompasses the potential for both positive and negative effects.
