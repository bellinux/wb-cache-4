It could be nothing else but the captured transport with troops from Esmeralda. She carried no lights. The noise of her steaming, growing louder every minute, would stop at times altogether, and then begin again abruptly, and sound startlingly nearer; as if that invisible vessel, whose position could not be precisely guessed, were making straight for the lighter. Meantime, that last kept on sailing slowly and noiselessly before a breeze so faint that it was only by leaning over the side and feeling the water slip through his fingers that Decoud convinced himself they were moving at all. His drowsy feeling had departed. He was glad to know that the lighter was moving. After so much stillness the noise of the steamer seemed uproarious and distracting. There was a weirdness in not being able to see her. Suddenly all was still. She had stopped, but so close to them that the <b>steam,</b> <b>blowing</b> off, sent its rumbling vibration right over their heads.|$|E

The boiler configuration, located atop an over 400 foot tall tower, in a large solar thermal collection plant poses some challenges not associated with other steam supply methods. As {{a result of the}} flow path configurations and steam mass required for blowing the cold reheat, reheater, and hot reheat portions of the plant, attemperation is required to control temperatures in the reheater. The use of multiple flow paths and stages through the reheater also requires some additional consideration. Where in a fossil powered plant the losses through the reheater are based on the inlet vs. outlet conditions, additional vendor data is required to model the internal sections of the reheater in greater detail. Methodologies developed for fossil powered plants can be applied to large solar thermal collectors with special consideration for the unique configurations and constantly changing solar conditions associated with the plants. The smaller margins associated with these plants requires more rigorous modeling of the system components...|$|E

40|$|The {{foremost}} {{attempt in}} this thesis is aimed to added progression of the Transient Plane Source (TPS) technique, to measure thermal properties of solids. The modified TPS technique referred to as Advantageous Transient Plane Source (ATPS) technique, offers the possibility to measure thermal properties which {{are directly related to}} heat conduction such as thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and heat capacity per unit volume, with more simplicity and enhanced precision. The newly designed system accomplished the -major objectives like, to acquire data with high speed and accuracy; interactively process/analyze measured data for an immediate use or store it for future post-processing; in addition, this system allows for an easy adjustment and enhancement of instruments by revision of software programs. Also specimen size variation is incorporated very well by using the TPS sensors of different sizes. Small sized sensors and specimen could be used without any significant loss of accuracy. It is also possible to get the information about Cp by very simple experiment. To check the validity of the ATPS technique, it was calibrated by using fused quartz, carbon steel and silver chloride crystals. Materials selected for calibration are representative of insulators, conductors and crystalline materials. All measurements were done form room down to liquid nitrogen temperature. Thermal data for AgC 1 crystals is an addition to the existing literature. For measurements at elevated temperatures modified sensors were designed and calibrated. Two sets of insulating materials. namely, ceramics fibres and synthetic insulating foams were studied. Ceramic fibres include VK. - 60, ABK and Nextel/VK- 80 fibres. The investigation of thermal properties of three different types of ceramic fibers showed that all materials have good thermal insulation properties and that fibers produced by the <b>steam</b> <b>blowing</b> technique Le. VK- 60, {{can be used as a}} substitute for more costly analogous materials obtained from the nozzle dissemination technique. Insulating foams consist of fibre glass, closed cell foam and foam samples. The samples which are studied in the present. work, are used as insulators for the temperature control of air-conditioned space and thus for saving energy. From this point of view, the closed cell foam insulation is a better choice. So these materials are suitable for insulation purposes and may be very vital in saving energy. Various Bi-based superconducting compositions were prepared and analyzed but the detail of the most reproducible composition is given. High-Tc superconducting samples with nominal composition Bi 1. 6 Pb 0. 4 Sr 1. 6 Ba 0. 4 Ca 2 Cu 3 Oy were prepared by solid state reaction method. Samples were characterized by dc electrical resistivity, ac susceptibility, X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. All the tests showed that the samples were with almost single phase. Thermal diffusivity data are an addition to literature as previously one can hardly find any data for superconducting samples. Simultaneous measurement of thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity makes it possible to estimate specific heat and the Debye temperature (H) D, as well as to separate the electron and phonon contributions to thermal conductivity and diffusivity. The simultaneous measurement also provides a useful check on the reliability and the consistency of the analyses. All the above measurements show that Advantageous Transient Plane Source technique is working very well under extreme environmental conditions. Thermoelectrical power (TEP) measurements were. done by a newly designed and calibrated. apparatus. Simplicity, ease of use and precision are the major plus of the designed TEP system. Electrothermal conductivity and figure of merit are also calculated showing that the sample composition could be a potential candidate for thermoelectric devices...|$|E
40|$|Black liquor is {{the residue}} from the cooking of wood, straw or other fibrous {{plants in the}} alkali pulping process. Recovery of the {{chemicals}} used, {{as well as of}} the energy contained in the organics, is important for the economics of the paper mill. Nowadays, Tomlinson recovery boilers are used to generate heat from the organic compounds and to recover the cooking chemicals contained in the black liquors, but there are some safety problems and the energy efficiency is relatively low. Gasification of black liquor is a promising alternative for recovery systems in the pulping process. Two gasification processes have been commercialized: a low temperature process operating at about 600 ℃, and a high temperature process operating at 950 - 1000 ℃. Low temperature processes have problems achieving good conversion while avoiding ash agglomeration; high temperature processes suffer material problems caused by extremely corrosive conditions. It is of interest to combine direct causticization of black liquor by TiO 2 with gasification. Firstly, a high temperature needed for both gasification and direct causticization can be realized in a single reactor. Secondly, direct causticization with TiO 2 produces high melting point products which minimize the smelt formation problem associated with high temperature gasification processes. Thirdly, the sodium penta-titanate formed in the gasifier is leached with water, forming solid sodium tri-titanate and sodium hydroxide, The sodium tri-titanate is separated and recycled to the gasifier. Illuminated by the black liquor gasification with steam at low temperature, one would naturally consider gasification with steam at relatively high temperature, fortunately, using TiO 2 this process maybe feasible without smelt formation. The steam gasification research began with the pyrolysis experimental study. The swelling of kraft black liquor was tested at 400 - 800 ℃ under nitrogen atmosphere with a visualized single droplet reactor. The main permanent pyrolysis gas components of three kraft liquors were investigated at temperatures up to 850 ℃. The measurements of H 2 S release during pyrolysis were realized by iodometry, the total sulfur release was evaluated through char analysis. Steam and CO 2 gasification of black liquor at low temperature were conducted with tube furnace. The effect of temperature, atmosphere and reaction time on carbon conversion, sulfate reduction and sulfur release were investigated. Nearly all sulfur release to gas phase except for sulfur in sulfate. Sulfate can be reducted by carbon at solid state. the gasification rates of organic carbon by steam at these low temperature(600 and 650 ℃) are very slow, though we already know this according literature before, compare with fluidized bed, mass transfer limitation may worsen this problem. For improving of gas-solid contact, a small bench scale fluidized bed was constructed, with an external heater and a <b>steam</b> <b>blowing</b> system. The feedstock of quartz sand, sawdust can be easily fluidized in the small FB. Regretfully, the liquid feedstock of black liquor never successfully realized fluidization. Unlike MTCI low temperature process, the material sprayed into the bed cannot be quickly dried and pyrolyzed, poorly design may account for the failure. When switch to solid feedstock of black liquor mixed with titanium dioxide, fluidization condition cannot be gained all the same, but after 30 min of steam gasification at 800 ℃, the agglomeration of feedstock in the middle of the bed was found but without any organic carbon remaind. Given the presence of titanium dioxide, the reason for agglomeration was not clear then. Puzzled by the serious problem of agglomeration, and Encouraged by the good carbon conversion at high temperature, we conducted experimental of kraft black liquor high temperature steam gasification with direct caustisization using tube furnace or called fixed bed which can be easily operated. Fortunately, mass transfer limitation doesn’t show too much negative effect on the carbon conversion at relatively high temperature. When choosing pure anatase titanium dioxide as the direct causticization agent, agglomeration of bed material never appeared. All reactions concerned gained high conversion at high temperature, including organic carbon gasification, decarbonization, penta-titanate hydrolyzing. Recycling titanates show similar effects with fresh titanium dioxide, no agglomeration was found either. Anyhow, we reckon the high temperature steam gasification using titanates a promising alternative to conventional recovery process. Method of decreasing organic sulfur emission and improving sulfate reduction need further research. 黑液是碱法制浆的副产物，其中含有需要回收的制浆化学品和能源。Tomlinson型碱回收锅炉是当今处理黑液的主要设备，燃烧黑液有机物生产蒸汽并以熔融态回收制浆化学品。始终无法消除的熔融物遇水爆炸隐患以及热力学效率低等问题使得业界开发替代回收方案的努力一直在进行，其中气化技术获得了广泛和持久的研究。 本文首先全面回顾国际上黑液低温和高温气化技术 30 多年来的发展历程，找出高、低温气化各自存在的主要问题。低温气化由于运行温度低因而碳转化速率较低，高温气化以熔融态回收碱因而耐高温耐腐蚀材料问题成为制约其发展的障碍之一。二氧化钛直接苛化技术可以将Na 2 CO 3 在炉内直接脱去CO 2 ，因而苛化和气化在一个反应器中即可进行，固体产物五钛酸盐可水解出氢氧化钠，难以进一步水解的三钛酸盐则回收继续用于直接苛化反应，省去了传统的石灰苛化循环；直接苛化产物具有较高的熔点因而可以在相对较高的温度(例如 800 ℃) 运行而又不引入熔融相。 黑液气化结合直接苛化工艺目前处于试验研究阶段，提高温度(800 ℃以上) 的黑液水蒸气气化结合直接苛化目前未见任何研究报导，本文将以此为方向探索可行的黑液气化工艺路线。 实验方面，首先对硫酸盐黑液的热膨胀特性进行了初步了解，分析了热解产物得率与热解气体组成。硫释放到气相是气化不同于燃烧的一个特点，对热解导致的硫释放及其形式做出了分析。 在对黑液的热解特性有了基本了解之后，模拟黑液低温气化的温度和气氛条件对黑液气化过程的碳转化、硫酸盐还原和硫释放进行了研究。实验结果表明硫酸盐还原在低温气化工艺所要求的温度范围内是可以进行的，提高温度有助于硫酸盐还原，但是允许提高的温度范围有限。低温气化条件下，除未还原硫酸盐硫之外，其它所有形式的硫如有机硫、Na 2 S等通过一定转变全部排入气相。试验中发现黑液热解焦中有机碳气化速率非常缓慢，除了温度较低的原因外，传质阻力使得气固接触不够充分可能是重要原因。 流化床是黑液低温气化工艺普遍采用的反应器，为了比较理想地考察硫酸盐黑液气化过程硫的行为，以及考虑到提高温度的直接苛化试验的需要，建立了外加热的小规模流化床水蒸气气化反应器，进料量约 500 g/批。该流化床采用石英砂、木屑、碳酸钠二氧化钛混合物均可实现稳定运行。黑液液体进料试验未能成功，原因主要在于没有实现黑液的快速干燥热解成焦；黑液干燥固体进料也因膨胀没有顺利流化；当采用二氧化钛与黑液固体混合进料高温运行时虽然流化仍然失败，但是发现有机碳转化速率相比低温气化有极大提高，遗憾的是固体产物有比较严重的结块。 高温直接苛化工艺成功的几个关键之处在于苛化反应是否足够迅速以避免形成熔融物，产物是否具有良好的颗粒性，水解是否容易进行，三钛酸钠能否循环利用等。流化床试验遇到的严重结块的问题原因已经找到，而后对直接苛化工艺涉及的一系列热点问题进行了试验探索。试验结论认为：高温水蒸气气化与直接苛化是一条可行的黑液气化法碱回收方案，在有机碳气化、碳酸钠脱CO 2 、五钛酸盐水解、三钛酸盐循环利用等方面均不存在问题。含硫化合物的转变还需要进一步研究，探索减少有机硫排放和提高芒硝还原率的工艺条件...|$|E
