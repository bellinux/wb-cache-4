50|$|A main {{disadvantage}} of conventional CGH is {{its inability to}} detect structural chromosomal aberrations without copy number changes, such as mosaicism, balanced chromosomal translocations, and inversions. CGH can also only detect gains and losses relative to the ploidy level. In addition, chromosomal regions with short repetitive DNA sequences are highly variable between individuals and can interfere with CGH analysis. Therefore, repetitive DNA regions like centromeres and telomeres need to be blocked with unlabeled repetitive DNA (e.g. Cot1 DNA) and/or can be omitted from screening. Furthermore, the resolution of conventional CGH is a major practical problem that limits its clinical applications. Although CGH {{has proven to be}} a useful and reliable technique in the research and diagnostics of both cancer and human genetic disorders, the applications involve only gross abnormalities. Because of the limited resolution of metaphase chromosomes, aberrations smaller than 5-10 Mb cannot be detected using conventional CGH.For the detection of such abnormalities, a high-resolution technique is required.Array CGH overcomes many of these limitations. Array CGH is characterized by a high resolution, its major advantage with respect to conventional CGH. The standard resolution varies between 1 and 5 Mb, but can be increased up to approximately 40 kb by supplementing the array with extra clones. However, as in conventional CGH, the main {{disadvantage of}} array CGH is its inability to detect aberrations that do not result in copy number changes and is limited in its ability to detect mosaicism. The level of mosaicism that can be detected is dependent on the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the clones. At present, rearrangements present in approximately 50% of the cells is the detection limit. For the detection of such abnormalities, other techniques, such as SKY (<b>Spectral</b> <b>karyotyping)</b> or FISH have to still be used. Another disadvantage is the lack of commercial availability of the arrays. Until now, BAC and cDNA clones can be obtained from, for example, the Sanger Center, BACPAC Resources, Invitrogen and Research Genetics. However, array preparation still needs to be performed by the investigators themselves. Inconsistencies in visualization and imaging software as well as interpretation parameters also make it difficult for replications and comparisons to be made by different laboratory teams.|$|E

To address whether loss of DNMT 1, or the related protein DNMT 3 b, results in genomic instability in human cancer cells, we used a near-diploid human colorectal cancer cell line, HCT 116, in which one or both DNMT genes were disrupted by homologous recombina-tion. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization analyses indicated that double, but not single, DNMT knock-out cells display two specific alterations in regional DNA copy number, suggesting that DNMT deficiency and genomic DNA hypome-thylation are not associated with widespread genomic amplifications or deletions in human cancer cells. However, <b>spectral</b> <b>karyotype</b> analyses revealed that DNMT-deficient HCT 116 cells are highly unstable with respect to large-scale chromosomal alterations; furthermore, this effect is charac-terized by a high degree of individual cell heterogeneity.

We report that compared with wild-type (WT) cells, B cells from TCL 1 -tg mice activated in a manner resembling a T-dependent GC reaction show enhanced resistance to FAS-mediated apoptosis with CD 40 stimulation, independent of a B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) rescue signal. Mitogenic stimulation of TCL 1 -tg B cells also resulted in increased expression of Aicda. These GC-related enhancements in survival and Aicda expression could underlie B-cell transformation. Supporting this notion, no B-cell lymphomas developed for 20 months when TCL 1 -tg mice were crossed onto an Oct coactivator from B cell (OCA-B) –deficient background to yield mice incapable of forming GCs. <b>Spectral</b> <b>karyotype</b> analyses showed that GC lymphomas from TCL 1 -tg mice exhibit recurrent chromosome translocations and trisomy 15, with corresponding MYC overexpression. We conclude that pEμ-B 29 -TCL 1 transgenic B cells primed for transformation must experience the GC environment and, for at least some, develop genome instability to become fully malignant...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for human disease treatment using human pluripotent stem cells, including {{embryonic stem cells}} and {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs), also carries the risk of added genomic instability. Genomic instability is most often linked to DNA repair deficiencies, which indicates that screening/characterization of possible repair deficiencies in pluripotent human stem cells should be a necessary step prior to their clinical and research use. In this study, a comparison of DNA repair pathways in pluripotent cells, as compared to those in non-pluripotent cells, demonstrated that DNA repair capacities of pluripotent cell lines were more heterogeneous than those of differentiated lines examined and were generally greater. Although pluripotent cells had high DNA repair capacities for nucleotide excision repair, we show that ultraviolet radiation at low fluxes induced an apoptotic response in these cells, while differentiated cells lacked response to this stimulus, and note that pluripotent cells had a similar apoptotic response to alkylating agent damage. This sensitivity of pluripotent cells to damage is notable since viable pluripotent cells exhibit less ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage than do differentiated cells that receive the same flux. In addition, the importance of screening pluripotent cells for DNA repair defects was highlighted by an iPSC line that demonstrated a normal <b>spectral</b> <b>karyotype,</b> but showed both microsatellite instability and reduced DNA repair capacities in three out of four DNA repair pathways examined. Together, these results demonstrate a need to evaluate DNA repair capacities in pluripotent cell lines, in order to characterize their genomic stability, prior to thei...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in {{children}} occurs predominantly as two major histologically defined subtypes called embryonal RMS (RMS-E) and the prognostically less favorable alveolar RMS (RMS-A). Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) {{was performed on}} 21 RMS and identified consistent gains affecting chromosomes 2 (8 / 10), 5 (5 / 10), 6 (3 / 10), 7 (7 / 10), 8 (9 / 10), 11 (6 / 10), and 12 (5 / 10) in RMS-E. Losses/deletions involved chromosomes 19 (2 / 10) and chromosomes 4, 9, 10, 17, 21 (1 / 10 each). High copy number amplification, involving the 2 p 24 region (5 / 11) and less frequently, the 12813 - 21 (2 / 11), 9 p 22 (1 / 11), and 17822 - 25 (1 / 11) regions, was detected in RMS-A. Gene amplification at band 2 p 24 was present in 6 / 12 alveolar tumors, and in each case, MYCN was amplified, together with the distally placed DDX 1 gene. For these patients there was a shorter disease free interval and a higher mortality than patients with tumors without amplification. Detailed <b>spectral</b> <b>karyotype</b> analysis (SKY) was performed on two RMS cell lines (one of each subtype) and identified a surprisingly high level of structural change. Gene expression studies with the Atlas Human Cancer Array (588 genes) showed that 153 genes generated a signal of similar intensity in both cell lines, and 45 genes appeared to have subtype-specific expression. The chromosomal location of differentially expressed genes was compared to the pattern of genomic alteration in RMS as determined by CGH {{in this study and}} the literature...|$|R
