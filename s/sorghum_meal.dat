40|$|Kafirin and zein are alcohol-soluble prolamin-type {{proteins}} {{that can be}} used to make biodegradable, environmental-friendly bioplastic films and coatings. Despite this potential, there is no commercial process for kafirin extraction. Zein, though commercially produced, is expensive. Factors affecting kafirin and zein extraction and bioplastic quality were studied. Specifically, the effects of sorghum and maize grain particle size, inclusion of glacial acetic acid and sodium hydroxide in the aqueous ethanol extractant on extract filtration time, protein preparation purity and yield; as well as effect of heating kafirin and zein films on water uptake and film digestibility were investigated. <b>Sorghum</b> <b>meal</b> with particle size > 1 mm gave more rapid extract filtration time than sorghum flour with particle size < 250 ?m, due to larger inter-particle spaces. Sorghum flour yielded a kafirin preparation with lower purity (50 %) than <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal</b> (58 %). Kafirin extracted from distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) had a higher purity (78 %) than kafirin from <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal</b> (68 %) and zein (69 %). Washing decorticated sorghum and maize meals to remove starch prior to protein extraction substantially increased protein preparation purity. Inclusion of sodium hydroxide resulted in a slightly higher protein preparation purity and yield than inclusion of acetic acid. SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions revealed more dimers in kafirin than zein, while kafirin from DDGS contained polymers, indicating polymerisation due to cross-linking occurring during DDGS drying. All films absorbed water but remained whole on soaking. Heat treated films prepared from kafirin extracted from washed <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal</b> absorbed less water (approximately 42 %), compared to zein films (approximately 47 %) due to its greater hydrophobicity and heat induced intermolecular disulphide cross-linking. Heating had no effect on DDGS kafirin film water uptake because it was highly cross-linked. In vitro pepsin and total digestion were less for kafirin films than zein films, probably due to the greater hydrophobicity of kafirin. Heating the films resulted in reduced digestibility, probably due to heat induced disulphide bonding. Extraction of kafirin and zein from coarse meal enables more rapid filtration than from fine flour. Acetic acid-ethanol method appears to be a simpler extraction procedure than NaOHethanol method as it does not require protein neutralisation. Washing decorticated sorghum and maize meals prior to protein extraction improves protein preparation purity. Sorghum DDGS shows potential as a starting material for kafirin extraction for use in film making, based on high purity and low film water uptake. Heating the films decreases water uptake properties and reduces film digestibility. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 Food ScienceMScUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Marama bean (Tylosema esculentum (Burch) A. Schreib) is an underutilised, drought- {{tolerant}} legume {{native to}} the semi-arid areas of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. The edible seeds of marama beans are good sources of protein and fat, and its flours can potentially enhance the nutritional quality of sorghum porridge, a staple in many African countries. Sorghum has a low protein content and is deficient in lysine. Compositing sorghum with lysine-rich marama flour when preparing porridges would address this problem. Utilisation of marama flour in composite porridge depends on sensory acceptance. In this study nutritional and sensory quality of marama-sorghum composite flours and porridges are investigated. Full fat and defatted flours from unheated and dry heated (150 °C / 20 min) marama beans were composited with condensed tannin-free <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal</b> (30 : 70). Marama flours, <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal,</b> marama-sorghum composite flours and porridges were analysed for proximate composition, amino acid composition, energy value, fatty acid composition, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Porridges (10 % solids) were subjected to descriptive sensory analysis, consumer acceptance test (n= 52), texture analysis, pasting profiles and colour measurements. Sorghum porridge and porridge composite with full fat marama flour from heated beans were more acceptable than other composite porridges. Compositing <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal</b> with marama flour reduced the cooked sorghum aroma/flavour intensities prominent in sorghum porridge. Dry heating marama beans prior to milling resulted in a roasted nutty flavour in the final product. Porridges from heated marama beans were darker in colour than porridges from unheated beans. This {{could be attributed to}} flavour and colour development due to Maillard reaction during dry heating. Composite porridges from full fat marama flours were described as buttery/creamy. A bitter taste and aftertaste was perceived in porridges from defatted flours. Presence of fat seems to mask bitterness in porridges. Marama-sorghum composites and Tsabotlhe porridges were less viscous than sorghum porridge. This was confirmed by pasting profiles (low final viscosities) and texture analysis indicating reduced firmness. Starch contributes greatly to the textural properties of sorghum porridge. Marama flour has no starch. Compositing the flour with sorghum reduced starch levels in the composite porridges. This explains the reduction in viscosity and firmness of the porridges. Compositing <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal</b> with marama flours significantly increased protein and fat contents in flours and porridges. The fat content in marama-sorghum flours was in the range of 5. 6 to 14. 6 %. Protein increase ranged from 61 % to 96 % in marama-sorghum composite porridges compared with sorghum porridge. There was 11 - 24 % energy value increase in marama-sorghum composite porridges compared with sorghum porridge. Porridges composited with full fat flours contributed to higher energy values than those composited with defatted flours. This is because of fat energy contribution. Lysine content in marama flour was significantly higher than <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal.</b> Lysine content was 3 to 4 times higher in marama-sorghum porridges than in sorghum porridge. Unsaturated fatty acids were the most present in both marama-sorghum composite porridges and sorghum porridge. There was an increase in oleic acid as marama flour was composited with sorghum. Marama flours had higher levels of total phenolics than sorghum flour. Marama flour has high levels of tyrosine which could react with the Folin Ciocalteu reagent thus leading to an increase in measurable phenols. Marama flours from dry heated beans had higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity than flours from unheated beans. Heating may have increased phenolic compound extractability due to release of bound phenolics. There was a positive correlation between the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity (r = 0. 80, p < 0. 05) in all samples. Findings from this study indicate that marama flour can potentially be used to improve the nutritional quality of sorghum porridges. Furthermore this study shows that use of full fat flour in marama-sorghum composite porridges give more acceptable sensory properties. Dissertation (MScAgric) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

Apparent digestion {{coefficients for}} dry matter, protein and {{essential amino acids}} in terrestrial ingredients for Pacific shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (Decapoda: Penaeidae). Protein quality mainly depends on the essential amino acid (EAA) profile, but also on its bioavailability, because EAA digestibility is generally lower than the analyzed amounts. This information is needed in the aquaculture industry for aquafeed formulation. For this purpose, the apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter, protein, and essential amino acids of eight feedstuffs of terrestrial origin were determined for the juvenile whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (15 - 19 g), using 1 % chromic oxide as an inert marker. A reference diet was formulated and produced in the laboratory. Eight experimental diets were prepared each with 30 % {{of one of the}} experimental ingredients added to the reference diet: casein, porcine byproduct meal poultry byproduct meal, corn meal, wheat gluten meal, soybean paste, <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal,</b> and wheat meal. The experiment consisted of a single-factor, completely randomized design with three replicates per treatment. Samples of ingredients, diets and feces were analyzed for nitrogen and amino acids. For amino acid assay, we used reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. To avoid partial loss of methionine and cystine, samples of ingredients, diets, and feces were oxidized with performic acid to methionine sulfone and cysteic acid prior to acid hydrolysis. The apparent dry matter and protein digestive utilization coefficients varied from 68 % to 109 % and from 70 % to 103 %, respectively. Apparent digestibility of protein for casein, soy paste, wheat meal and wheat gluten were very high (over 90 %), corn gluten and poultry byproducts meal showed high protein digestibility (over 80 %), but porcine byproducts meal and <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal</b> had low digestibility (76 % and 70 %, respectively). There was a reasonable, but not total, correspondence between apparent protein digestibility and average essential amino acid digestibility coefficients, except for arginine in corn gluten, phenylalanine and leucine in <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal,</b> phenylalanine in soy paste and lysine in wheat meal and poultry by-product meal. The most digestible feed ingredients for whiteleg shrimp were: wheat gluten, wheat meal and soy paste; poultry byproduct meal and corn gluten were less digestible and the lowest digestibility occurred in porcine byproduct meal and <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal.</b> Feedstuffs exhibited great variability in dry matter, protein and amino acid digestive utilization coefficients, which should be considered when formulating shrimp feeds.

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the prospects for}} expanding commercial utilization of these crops. On {{the basis of a}} utilization survey, a review of price data, and discussions with industry representatives, it appears that the best opportunity for expanding the use of sorghum is in the opaque beer brewing industry. A target of 75 % substitution over the next 5 years would create a demand for 1800 t per year of high quality white sorghum. According to industry representatives, the main constraint limiting the use of sorghum and pearl millet in animal feeds is the relative grain price. If sorghum is available at competitive price, 5 years from now it could account for at least 5 % of the grain used by the industry, or 5000 t per year. The potential size of the market for milled sorghum and pearl millet meal is difficult to estimate, because of uncertainty about the strength of consumer preferences for alternative grains. Nonetheless, the milling industry can set a target of replacing perhaps 5 % of the maize meal sold in Dar es Salaam with <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal,</b> generating a demand for more than 20, 000 t of grain per year. The prospects for pearl millet are less favorable than for sorghum given its generally higher price and lower yields and labor productivity. However, there may be small market niche for pearl millet-based meals, particularly in communities drawn from pearl millet production zones. The milling industry could test this market with an initial throughput of 500 to 1000 t of pearl millet grain per yea...|$|E
40|$|One hundred forty-four {{finishing}} pigs (124 lb avg initial wt) {{were used}} {{to determine the effects of}} extruding <b>sorghum,</b> soybean <b>meal</b> (SBM), and whole soybeans on growth performance and nutrient digestibility. Treatments were: 1) control diet with ground sorghum, SBM, and soybean oil; 2) diet 1 with the ground sorghum, SBM, and soybean oil blended and extruded; 3) sorghum and whole soybeans extruded separately and blended; and 4) sorghum and extruded soybeans blended and extruded together. Extrusion was in an Insta-Pro extruder. All diets were formulated to be equal in concentrations of metabolizable energy (ME) and lysine. Pigs fed diets with extruded ingredients had improved F/G. Extrusion of sorghum and extruded soybeans together was of greater benefit than extruding those ingredients separately. Diets with extruded ingredients had greater digestibilities of DM and N, but fat thickness at the last rib was not affected by treatment. Overall, optimum nutrient digestibility was achieved by feeding extruded diet ingredients, and efficiency of gain was maximized by feeding an extruded blend of sorghum and whole soybeans...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the {{inclusion}} of non-starch polysaccharide degrading enzymes, with predominantly xylanase activity, in wheat-based poultry diets has become routine (1). More recently, the acceptance of microbial phytase feed enzymes has increased in response to increasing concerns over phosphorus (P) pollution in the environment. The hydrolysis of phytate by phytase increases the utilisation of phytate-bound P (phytate-P) and reduces P excretion but increasingly research suggests that phytase also improves protein and energy utilisation (2). Possible interactions between phytase and xylanase following their simultaneous inclusion in wheat-based broiler diets have attracted interest in recent years (Ravindran et al (1999). Despite the increasing likelihood of phytase and xylanase being used simultaneously in practice, published reports on their combined application are limited. The object {{of this study was}} to determine the influence of a commercial xylanase (Natugrain BlendTM; BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany), and a microbial phytase (Natuphos®; BASF) alone and in combination, on the apparent amino acid digestibility of feed ingredients commonly used in the poultry industry, namely: wheat, <b>sorghum,</b> soyabean <b>meal,</b> canola meal, cottonseed meal, and lupins (L. angustifolius) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{reliable}} greenhouse method {{was developed to}} screen chickpeas for resistance to collar rot caused by Scleroaum rolfisii Sacc. Groundnut shells were superior to <b>sorghum</b> straw, sand-maize <b>meal,</b> and potato dextrose broth in supporting the growth and formation of sclerotia of the pathogen. Soil infested with sclerotial inoculum developed on groundnut shells was used to study the reactions of 12 chickpea cultivars to the collar rot pathogen. There were significant differences in their susceptibility to seed rot, damping off, and collar rot. Seed treatment with Rizolex(R) or a mixture of Thiram(R) + Rizolex(R) was effective in controlling seed rot and collar rot...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum is {{the main}} crop grown in Botswana, but despite this, its {{consumption}} seems to be declining. In order to identify constraints and opportunities for enhancing utilisation of the crop, socio-economic and market surveys were carried in selected urban and peri-urban areas. These studies showed that sorghum still remains the most consumed cereal in peri-urban areas, accounting for 74 % of total cereal consumption in these areas, but only 47 % in urban areas. Consumption of sorghum on daily basis declined from 89 % in 1982 to 75 % in 1998 in selected villages of the Southern District. The crop is consumed mainly as <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal,</b> prepared as fermented or non-fermented soft (motogo) and semi-stiff porridge (bogobe). Other common sorghum products are traditional and commercial sorghum beer (Chibuku and Power), Morvite, and extruded sorghum-soy meals (Tsabana and Tsabotlhe). Preference for these products {{is dependent on the}} age, place of origin, household size, educational level, residential area and gender of the consumer. Generally, traditionally pound sorghum flour is preferred over the commercial sorghum flour. Several commercial sorghum flour brands are available throughout the country, but their quality is very variable. Consumers defined quality in terms of colour, texture and taste, and these parameters were linked to sorghum varieties and the type of milling process. Studies revealed consumers ’ desires for “modern” products formulated from sorghum. Typical products named include bread, biscuits, pasta, “rice”, breakfast flakes and fermented beverages (mageu). This is the first study to identify consumer attitudes to sorghum foods in Botswana. The findings suggest that sorghum formulated products would be acceptable if they are nutritious, healthy, affordable, and could maintain traditional flavours...|$|E
40|$|Tanzania {{produces}} over 5000, 000 t of sorghum and 2000, 000 t of {{pearl millet}} per year. Yet {{virtually the entire}} production is subsistence-orienated. The lack of commercial market as limited farmer interest in improving crop management, and average sorghum and pearl millet yields have changed little over the past 15 years. This report analyzes the prospects for expanding commercial utilization of these crops. On {{the basis of a}} utilization survey, a review of price data, and discussions with industry representatives, it appears that the best opportunity for expanding the use of sorghum is in the opaque beer brewing industry. A target of 75 % substitution over the next 5 years would create a demand for 1800 t per year of high quality white sorghum. According to industry representatives, the main constraint limiting the use of sorghum and pearl millet in animal feeds is the relative grain price. If sorghum is available at competitive price, 5 years from now it could account for at least 5 % of the grain used by the industry, or 5000 t per year. The potential size of the market for milled sorghum and pearl millet meal is difficult to estimate, because of uncertainty about the strength of consumer preferences for alternative grains. Nonetheless, the milling industry can set a target of replacing perhaps 5 % of the maize meal sold in Dar es Salaam with <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal,</b> generating a demand for more than 20, 000 t of grain per year.

40|$|The {{microflora}} {{of various}} foods in Burundi was isolated and identified. Fusarium moniliforme was the predominant fungus isolated from corn and sorghum. Very few molds were isolated from rice and millet. Fusarium semitectum and Fusarium equiseti {{were the most}} common species isolated from haricot beans. Fusarium semitectum was also predominant in peanut samples. Peas were predominantly contaminated with Aspergillus ochraceus and Aspergillus wentii. Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus sydowi were the predominant species isolated from dried Ndagala fish. Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium corylophilum, and Penicillium chrysogenum were the predominant molds isolated from dried crushed cassava tuber and cassava flour. ^ The ability of these molds to produce aflatoxins, cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and fumonisins, {{as well as the}} presence of these mycotoxins in the foods were investigated. Thirty-seven of 95 isolates of Aspergillus flavus and all five isolates of Aspergillus parasiticus produced aflatoxins. Sixty-seven of the 95 isolates of Aspergillus flavus produced CPA. Ten of 20 isolates of Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus tamarii produced CPA. Fifty-one of 56 isolates of Fusarium moniliforme and all four isolates of Fusarium proliferatum produced fumonisins. Relatively high concentrations of fumonisin B 1 (12. 2 to 75. 2 μg/g) were detected in samples of corn and <b>sorghum</b> <b>meal.</b> Neither aflatoxins nor CPA were found in any of the foods. ^ Bacillus pumilus produced an extracellular metabolite inhibiting mycelial growth and/or mycotoxin production of many Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium species. The metabolite was isolated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. It was soluble in water and other relatively polar solvents. The metabolite was heat stable (121 ∘C for 30 minutes) and active over a wide range of pH (2 to 10). It was resistant to hydrolysis by proteases, peptidases and other enzymes. The metabolite was also resistant to denaturation by protein-denaturing detergents. Based on its resistance to hydrolysis by carboxypeptidase A and negative reaction with fluorescamine and ninhydrin, the metabolite appeared to be either a protein/peptide with blocked carboxyl and amine termini or a non-protein/peptide. ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the use of <b>sorghum,</b> cottonseed <b>meal</b> and millet in broiler diets and their interaction when they are used simultaneously. In Experiment 1, a corn-soybean meal control diet was compared with eight experimental treatments based on low tannin sorghum (S 30, S 45 and S 60), cottonseed meal (CM 15, CM 40) or both ingredients included in the same diet (S 30 /CM 40, S 45 /CM 25 and S 60 CM 15). Results showed that BW gain was not affected by the inclusion of <b>sorghum</b> or cottonseed <b>meal.</b> However, feed intake tended {{to be affected by}} the cereal type with the highest values with sorghum-based diets. Feed conversion ratio increased (P< 0. 001) with sorghum-based diets compared with the control diet, whereas a combination of cottonseed <b>meal</b> and <b>sorghum</b> in the same diet did not affect the feed conversion ratio. Significant differences (P< 0. 001) were observed in apparent ileal digestibility (%) of protein and energy with the cottonseed meal and sorghum/cottonseed meal-based diets having lower protein and energy digestibility compared with corn-based diets. In Experiment 2, a control diet was compared with six diets in which corn was substituted at 60 %, 80 % or 100 % by either sorghum or millet and other three diets with simultaneous inclusion of these two ingredients (S 30 /M 30, S 40 /M 40, S 50 /M 50). Single or combined inclusion of sorghum and millet resulted in similar feed intake and growth performance as the control diet. Apparent ileal digestibility of protein and energy was higher with millet-based diets (P< 0. 001). Total tract digestibility of protein in sorghum and millet-based diets tended to decrease linearly with the increasing level of substitution. Sorghum-based diets resulted in lower total tract digestibility of fat compared with millet and sorghum/millet-based diets (P< 0. 001). Higher total tract digestibility of starch were obtained with the control diet and millet-based diets compared with the sorghum-based treatments. Results of the two experiments suggest that broiler growth performance was not affected by the dietary level of sorghum, millet or cottonseed meal. Nutrient digestion can, however, be affected by these feed ingredients. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The number of 90 broiler DOC were used in this study. They were randomly allocated into 18 unit of cages. During the study, the chicken were given 6 feeding treatments, i. e. : R- 0 (98. 0 % base diet + 2. 0 % filler; as control diet), RB- 1 (98. 0 % base diet + 1. 0 % garlic meal + 1. 0 % filler), RB- 2 (98. 0 % base diet + 2. 0 % garlic meal), RT- 1 (98. 0 % base diet + 1. 0 % white turmeric meal + 1. 0 % filler), RT- 2 (98. 0 % base diet + 2. 0 % white turmeric meal), and RB 1 T 1 (98. 0 % base diet + 1. 0 % garlic meal + 1. 0 % white turmeric meal). The base diet was composed of: yellow corn, soybean meal, fish meal, rice polishing <b>meal,</b> <b>sorghum,</b> poultry meat <b>meal,</b> mineral mix, and was design to contain 17. 5 % crude protein and metabolizable energy 2, 900 kcal/kg.
