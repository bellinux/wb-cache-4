40|$|Rapid {{internationalization}} {{of economic}} activities takes an important {{place in the}} last decades in the world economy. Services make a huge contribution to the international trade and their expansion grows constantly. It is very important nowadays to investigate the internationalization process of business service firms, their motivations and modes of entering into the new unexplored market. Moreover, correct choice of entry mode and evaluation of the incentives can affect the firm’s performance and {{the duration of the}} presence in a foreign market. It is also very important to understand the implications of initial mode of operations for different kinds of services. The purpose of this thesis is to gain better understanding of internationalization process of service firms, their incentives to enter new market and choice of entry mode. This is gained by evaluating such service firms that provide financial services as Swedbank and <b>SEB</b> <b>Bank</b> and their international performance in Baltic countries and Ukraine. These chosen companies provide the study cases for this paper. For this study, deductive approach is used in order to observe the theory, empirical findings and then to draw specific conclusion. Empirical data consists of two study cases of Swedbank and <b>SEB</b> <b>Bank.</b> Through the literature review a theoretical framework is developed in order to help the authors evaluate the motives which influence bank´s decision in selecting an entry mode. The findings of this research are that the main incentive of SEB to internationalize is following its customers and increasing market power in order to become a leader in providing financial services. While for Swedbank customer following and profit incentives are identified as crucial ones when going international. The results show that acquisition is an identical entry mode for both banks and is chosen as most sufficient one. Key words: internationalization process of service firms, banks, incentives, entry modes and acquisition...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} an impact on an option pricing within NASDAQ OMX Stockholm Market, if the underlying asset prices include jumps. The current financial crisis, when jumps are much more evident than ever, makes this issue very actual and important in the global sense for the portfolio hedging and other risk management applications for example for the banking sector. Therefore, an investigation is based on OMXS 30 Index and <b>SEB</b> A <b>Bank.</b> To detect jumps the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard non-parametric bipower variation test is used. First it is examined on simulations, to be finally implemented on the real data. An affirmation of a jumps occurrence requires to apply an appropriate model for the option pricing. For this purpose the Kou model, a double exponential jump-diffusion one, is proposed, as it incorporates essential stylized facts not available for another models. Th parameters in the model are estimated by a new approach - a combined cumulant matching with lambda taken from the Barrndorff-Nielsen and Shephard test. To evaluate how the Kou model manages on the option pricing, it is compared to the Black-Scholes model and to the real prices of European call options from the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The results show that the Kou model outperforms the latter...|$|R
40|$|Problem definition: In service organizations, front-line {{employees}} {{are considered to}} be the primary element when providing the organization’s services as they interact directly with customers and influence their perception of service quality. In other words, if the front-line {{employees are}} satisfied they will deliver the organization’s services in the best way which will directly lead to customer satisfaction. So it is worth studying how the service organizations use internal marketing tools towards their front-line employees in order to achieve their satisfaction.     Purpose of the Research: The purpose of this thesis is to describe and analyze the human resources practices aimed at front-line employee’s satisfaction that is related to internal marketing at SEB and to show how using the various methods implemented by SEB has took the organization to the position as of now.   Research Questions: How the Internal marketing elements are practiced by human resources at <b>SEB</b> <b>bank</b> in order to achieve front-line employee´s satisfaction?   Methods: In order to fulfil the purpose of dissertation the primary and secondary data has been analyzed based on the theoretical concepts. The theoretical concepts are based on academic data from books and scientific articles. The empirical data consists of both primary and secondary data. The primary data has been collected by conducting two interviews, one with the manager from human resource department at SEB and another with a front-line employee. The secondary data were collected from SEB’s webpage.     Conclusion: This study explores the potential effect the organization can have on the services due to the workings of the front-line employees. It can be concluded from the theoretical and empirical analysis that SEB’s management sees internal marketing practices (such as empowering, motivations and rewarding, job security and training) as a fundamental approaches to achieve their front-line employee’s satisfaction. SEB considers its employees as the most vital asset that can create and achieve its customer’s satisfaction, which has led to its immense growth...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four chapters concerning the topics of nonlinearities and time scales in economics. The focus is on market frictions and price rigidities that may cause nonlinearities and different relationships between economic variables over time. It also focuses on applying robust econometrical methods. Chapter two evaluates the size and power of some nonlinear tests for panel unit roots {{in the presence of}} cross-sectional dependency and spatial dependency. Based on the simulated results some robust tests for nonlinear panel unit roots have been found. Chapter three applies robust linear and nonlinear tests for panel unit roots in order to investigate the purchasing power parity theory in developing regions. The main finding is that nonlinearities is an important phenomenon in the real effective exchange rates in developing regions and that support for several regions may be found by applying the nonlinear panel unit root test. Chapter four investigates if positive asymmetric price transmission (APT) exists in the Swedish mortgage loan market. Here robust quantile regression is used on data for the Swedish <b>SEB</b> <b>bank.</b> The main contribution is that positive APT effects are found, which implies that there is a higher propensity for the bank to rapidly increase its mortgage interest rates for customers following an increase in its borrowing costs, compared with the propensity for the bank to decrease its customers’ mortgage rates subsequent to a corresponding borrowing cost decrease. Chapter five investigates the causal relations between exchange rates and interest rate differentials using wavelets. Also the sign {{of the relationship between the}} two variables is studied using impulse response functions. The data used is for seven country pairs in which Sweden is included in all of the different combinations. In this chapter one key empirical finding is that the causal relationship between the two variables becomes stronger as the time scale increases. The other key empirical finding is that more evidence of negative relationships is found at the shorter time scales and more positive relationships at the longer time scales...|$|E

40|$|Social {{media have}} made it {{possible}} for companies and customers to have an open dialogue with each other, where people have the opportunity to participate in discussion in the public debate. This multi-way communication lets customers contribute with ideas and opinions and in return companies receive feedback and can develop real-time demand products and services (Grafström et. al. 2010, Kaplan et. al. 2010). With this thesis we aim to understand how the interaction between the Swedish major banks and their customers in social media is organized, and what the banks’ purpose is of using social media. We also aim to know the banks’ view of the multi-way communication. To be able to fulfil our aim of this thesis we have done qualitative interviews with one informant from each major bank: Swedbank, SEB, Handelsbanken and Nordea. Almost three years ago the first Swedish major <b>bank,</b> <b>SEB,</b> entered Facebook and it did not take long before Swedbank, Handelsbanken and Nordea did the same (Informant 2).

40|$|Companies {{within the}} banking {{industry}} are facing the challenge to attract new competences in order {{to react to the}} forces of digitization. This paper examines how employer branding is used as a tool to achieve this through appealing to a broader target group. It also identifies problems that can arise in this process. We extend the theoretical knowledge on this topic by developing a theoretical framework, which combines corporate brand, employer branding, industry image and P-O fit literature. The framework outlines the process of adapting the employer brand and was used as the base for a case study of the Swedish <b>bank</b> <b>SEB.</b> The empirical research contained semistructured interviews as well as secondary data. The results support the importance of leadership in employer branding and indicate that while symbolic benefits are gaining in importance, functional benefits might work as a differentiator across industries. In addition, we found support of a effect of industry image on the employer image. Lastly, our findings show that the P-O fit is created through a two step process and can reinforce the corporate brand and employer brand, and vice versa. In accordance with these findings we provide directions for future research as well as several managerial implications...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{competition in}} the business world has forced firms to become innovative as well as effective in their promotion activities. PR is a promotion tool that has gained increasing importance in recent times, since it is perceived as both cost effective and highly credible. PR is a set of communications techniques which are designed to create and maintain favourable relations between an organization and its publics. This study aims to provide {{a better understanding of how}} banks utilize PR in communicating with their publics. The role of corporate reputation and trust development is also examined within this study. To this end, case studies were conducted of two large Swedish <b>banks,</b> <b>SEB</b> and Handelsbanken. The cases explain the roles, objectives, functions and tools of PR at the banks. Findings show that banks do not define their communication activities as PR, but still utilize it to a high degree. While objectives are different in the banks, one common priority is the building and maintaining of relationships with the publics. Banks utilize many different tools to reach PR objectives: many of these are used at the local branch level. Similarly, banks consider corporate reputation and trust as vital for the organization’s capability to sell financial services, and therefore manage this with high priority.
