25|$|Following {{the success}} of the Concord, Sauer {{branched}} out and began experimenting with Vitis vinifera including Sémillon and Chenin blanc. These early vinifera plantings didn't survive in the rich-soil that they Concords were planted and soon Sauer began looking at the steep hills with poorer soils. In 1973, when a friend had a buyer back out at the last minutes on Cabernet Sauvignon cuttings, Sauer took the cuttings and planted 3 acres even though he didn't know at the time if Cabernet Sauvignon was a white wine grape or a red wine grape. During this same time, Sauer was working with Dr. Walter Clore of the WSU extension and research facility in Prosser to plant an experimental vineyard of grapes like Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and other varieties to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> grapes could survive the cold Yakima Valley winters and grow to full ripeness.|$|E
25|$|The film {{rights were}} picked up by Rogue Pictures in 2006, with the remake being the first film {{produced}} by Wes Craven's new production studio Midnight Pictures. Craven, who wrote and directed the 1972 original, was interested to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> film could be produced on a large budget, as the limited funds in 1972 forced him to eliminate scenes {{he had wanted to}} film to tell a complete story. Alleca's original script included elements of the supernatural, which prompted the studio to reject it and bring in Ellsworth to perform a rewrite. One of the elements director Iliadis wanted to avoid with this film, given its graphic nature, was turning it into torture porn — a subgenre of horror popularized by the Saw franchise. For Craven and Iliadis, The Last House on the Left primarily illustrates how even the most normal of families can be driven to evil acts if pushed too far.|$|E

Burton played her tycoon husband Paul Andros in Anthony Asquith's The V.I.P.s (1963), an ensemble cast film described by Alpert as a [...] "kind of Grand Hotel story" [...] that was set in the VIP lounge of London Heathrow Airport; it proved to be a box-office hit despite mixed reviews. It was after The V.I.P.s that Burton became considerably more selective about his roles crediting Taylor for this as he simply acted in films [...] "to get rich" [...] and that she [...] "made me <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> rubbish I was doing". Burton divorced Sybil in April 1963 after completing The V.I.P.s while Taylor was granted divorce from Fisher on 6 March 1964. Taylor then took a two-year hiatus from films until her next venture with Burton, The Sandpiper (1965). The supercouple, now dubbed [...] "Liz and Dick" [...] by the press, continued starring together in films in the mid-1960s, earning a combined $88million over the next decade and spending $65million. Regarding their earnings, in a 1976 interview with Lester David and Jhan Robbins of The Ledger, Burton stated that [...] "they say we generate more business activity than one of the smaller African nations" [...] and that the couple [...] "often outspent" [...] the Greek business tycoon Aristotle Onassis.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1998 NFL Draft, Moss, who was {{projected}} {{as a high}} first-round pick, {{was taken}} by the Minnesota Vikings with the 21st overall pick after a number of NFL clubs—even those in need of a WR—were concerned with Moss' well-documented legal problems. Before the draft Moss was quoted as saying teams that passed on him [...] "will regret it once they <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a player I am and what kind of guy I really am." [...] The team most often cited for passing on Moss is the Dallas Cowboys. Moss grew up a Cowboys fan and wanted to play for the Cowboys. The Cowboys wanted Moss, but because of many off-field incidents of their own, team owner and GM Jerry Jones did not feel the team could draft Moss. [...] Moss felt that the Cowboys lied to him because they had told him they would draft him. On draft day, Dallas {{went so far as to}} have a scout in Charleston, West Virginia, the same town where Moss and his mother were watching the draft. Dallas star receiver Michael Irvin even called to apologize to Moss, because Irvin's own off-field problems were a main reason Moss was not drafted by Dallas. [...] After the draft, Moss made a point of beating the Cowboys any time he faced them, getting his first opportunity to do so in Week 13 of his rookie season. In a game held at Texas Stadium, Moss torched Dallas with a 163-yard, 3-touchdown performance.|$|E
