5000|$|Static {{configuration}} of VLAN membership information via management mechanisms, which allow {{configuration of}} <b>static</b> <b>VLAN</b> registration entries.|$|E
50|$|Static VLANs {{are also}} {{referred}} to as port-based VLANs. <b>Static</b> <b>VLAN</b> assignments are created by assigning ports to a VLAN. As a device enters the network, the device automatically assumes the VLAN of the port. If the user changes ports and needs access to the same VLAN, the network administrator must manually make a port-to-VLAN assignment for the new connection.|$|E
5000|$|Multiple Spanning Tree Instance (MSTI): Unlike IST, {{this kind}} of {{instance}} comprises all <b>static</b> <b>VLANs</b> specifically assigned to it and at least, must include one VLAN.|$|R
30|$|In smart substation, {{multicast}} transmission is adopted for SMV and GOOSE messages. Namely, switch will broadcast and transmit SMV and GOOSE messages, and all intelligent devices will receive related messages, {{which will be}} filtered by network card and then be transmitted to application module, thus the network load of SMV and GOOSE will have influences on the intelligent devices in the whole network. In present smart substation, the SMV flow and GOOSE flow of one bay do not exceed 8  Mbps and 0.1  Mbps respectively. For a substation with 30 bays, the load of process level network in the whole substation won’t exceed 240  Mbps. If Gigabit LAN is adopted, the load of process level network won’t exceed 25 %. This flow is relatively small for switch, but not so for intelligent devices like protection devices and BCU, etc., and the load of process level network needs to be reduced by proper means. Process level messages may be isolated in one bay through {{virtual local area network}} (<b>VLAN),</b> <b>static</b> multicast management or GARP multicast registration protocol (GMRP), in order to control the flow of process level data. By proper means, the influences of process level data on intelligent devices may be greatly lowered, and the shared-network of SMV and GOOSE will be possible.|$|R
