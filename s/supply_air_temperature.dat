50|$|Constant Air Volume (CAV) {{is a type}} of heating, ventilating, and {{air-conditioning}} (HVAC) system. In {{a simple}} CAV system, the supply air flow rate is constant, but the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> is varied to meet the thermal loads of a space.|$|E
50|$|Controls are {{necessary}} to regulate every aspect of an air handler, such as: flow rate of air, <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> mixed air temperature, humidity, air quality. They may {{be as simple as}} an off/on thermostat or as complex as a building automation system using BACnet or LonWorks, for example.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} VAV system incorporates one {{supply duct}} that, when in cooling mode, distributes supply air {{at a constant}} temperature of approximately 55 F. [...] Because the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> is constant, the air flow rate must vary to meet the rising and falling heat gains or losses within the thermal zone served.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{conditioned}} <b>air</b> is <b>supplied</b> {{directly into}} the occupied space, <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> must be higher than mixing systems (usually above 63 °F or 17 °C) to avoid cold draughts at the floor.

50|$|In mid- to large-size buildings, new central CAV {{systems are}} {{somewhat}} rare. Due to fan energy savings potential, variable air volume (VAV) systems are more common. However, in small buildings and residences, CAV systems {{are often the}} system of choice due to their simplicity, low cost, and reliability. Such small CAV systems often have on/off control, rather than <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> modulation, to vary their heating or cooling capacities.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} indoor air quality, air handlers commonly have provisions to allow the introduction of outside air into, and the exhausting of air from the building. In temperate climates, mixing {{the right amount of}} cooler outside air with warmer return air can be used to approach the desired <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> A mixing chamber is therefore used which has dampers controlling the ratio between the return, outside, and exhaust air.|$|E

5000|$|Many factors, {{including}} the ceiling height, diffuser characteristics, number of diffusers, <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> total flow rate, cooling load and conditioning mode affect the ventilation efficiency of UFAD systems. [...] Swirl and perforated-floor-panel diffusers {{have been shown}} to create a low air velocity in the occupied zone, while linear diffusers created the highest velocity in the occupied zone, disturbing thermal stratification and posing a potential draft risk. Additionally, floor diffusers add an element of personal control within the reach of the occupant, as users can adjust the amount of air that is delivered by the diffuser though rotating the diffuser top.|$|E
50|$|Even {{a simple}} VAV system has several {{advantages}} over a CAV system. One is more precise temperature control. To meet a space cooling load, a CAV unit operates the fan and compressor at full capacity until the temperature drops to a specified limit, {{and then the}} compressor turns off. This on/off cycling causes the temperature to fluctuate {{above and below the}} temperature setpoint. In a single-zone VAV unit, the fan speed varies depending on the actual space temperature and the temperature setpoint, while the compressor modulates the refrigerant flow to maintain a constant <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> The result is more precise space temperature control.|$|E

5000|$|The energy {{assessment}} of UFAD systems is a not fully solved issue, {{which has led}} to numerous research projects within the building science and mechanical engineering community. Proponents of UFAD point to the lower fan pressures required to deliver air in a building via the plenum as compared to through ducts. Typical plenum pressures are [...] (0.1 inch of water column) or less. The improvements in cooling-system efficiency inherent in operation at higher temperatures save energy, and relatively higher <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> allow longer periods of economizer operation. However, an economizer strategy is highly climate-dependent and necessitates careful control of humidity to avoid condensation. Critics, on the other hand, cite the shortage of rigorous research and testing to account for variations in climate, system design, thermal comfort and air quality to question whether UFAD is able to deliver improved energy efficiency in practice. Limited simulation tools, the shortage of design standards and relatively scarcity of exemplar projects compound these problems.|$|R

50|$|ASHRAE Research Project (RP-1522) {{developed}} a simplified tool that predicts the vertical temperature {{difference between the}} head and ankle of occupants, the supply air flow rate for one plenum zone, number of diffusers and the air distribution effectiveness. The tool requires users to specify the zone cooling load and the fraction of the cooling load assigned to the underfloor plenum. It also requires users to input the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> either at the diffuser or at the duct but with the ratio of plenum flowrate to zonal supply flowrate. The tool allows users to select from three type of diffusers and is applicable to seven type of buildings, including office, classroom, workshop, restaurant, retail shop, conference room and auditorium.|$|E
50|$|Plenum <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> rise is the {{increase}} of the conditioned air due to convective heat gain as it travels through the underfloor supply plenum from the plenum inlet to the floor diffusers. This phenomenon is also named thermal decay. Plenum air temperature rise is caused by cool supply air coming into contact with warmer than air concrete slab and raised floor. According to a modeling study, air temperature rise can be quite significant (as much as 5 °C or 9 °F) and subsequently, compared to an idealized simulated UFAD case with no air temperature rise, elevated diffuser air temperatures can lead to higher supply airflow rate and increased fan and chiller energy consumption. The same study found that air temperature rise in summer is higher than in winter and it also depends on the climate. The ground floor with a slab on grade has less temperature rise compared to middle and top floors, and an increase of the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> causes {{a decrease in the}} temperature rise. The temperature rise is not significantly affected by the perimeter zone orientation, the internal heat gain and the window-to-wall ratio. Supply plenum air temperature rise, thus, has implications on the energy saving potential of UFAD systems and their ability to meet cooling requirements with supply temperatures above those of conventional overhead systems. Current research suggests that both energy and thermal performance can be improved in UFAD systems by ducting air to perimeter zones where loads tend to be the greatest. Critics suggest however that such underfloor ducting reduces the benefit of having a low-pressure plenum space, as well as adding design and installation complications when fitting ducts between floor tile pedestals.|$|E

In this paper Test Reference Year (TRY) data for Italy were processed to estimate using potential of multistage integrated evaporative HVAC systems. Specific humidity and wet-bulb temperature were computed to define five regions for external air, and then to evaluate hours per year and relative energy saving for each of these regions and Italian climatic areas. The systems subjected to comparison were a multi-stage evaporative—direct, indirect and mechanical—and a traditional mechanical one; both all air, single duct, single zone, constant volume systems with wet-bulb economizer. The method of analysis is based on a strongly simplified approach. It is not intended as a substitute for accurate modelling schemes to simulate building and system behaviour, but as a tool to estimate the energy saving potential related to the Italian climate. The following parameters have been assumed as constant throughout: sensible heat ratio of the conditioned space, adiabatic saturation and heat exchanger effectivenesses, indoor space and <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> and relative humidities.

40|$|Most air {{handling}} units (AHUs) in commercial buildings have an air economizer cycle for free cooling under certain outside air conditions. During the economizer cycle, the outside air and return air dampers are modulated to seek mixing air temperature at <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> setpoint. Mechanical cooling is always required when outside air temperature {{is higher than the}} <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> setpoint. Generally the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> setpoint is set at 55 ?F for space humidity control. Actually the dehumidification is not necessary when outside air dew point is less than 55 ?F. Meanwhile the space may have less cooling load due to envelope heat loss and/or occupant schedule. These provide an opportunity to use higher <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> to reduce or eliminate mechanical cooling and terminal box reheat. On the other hand the higher <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> will require higher air flow as well as higher fan power.

40|$|In {{a single}} duct {{variable}} air volume (SDVAV) system, the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> is usually set as a constant value. Since this constant setpoint is selected {{to satisfy the}} maximum cooling load conditions, significant reheat will occur once the airflow reaches the minimum and the heating load increases. Resetting the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> (SAT) higher during the heating season can reduce the reheat. However, air flow will increase when the SAT is higher which consume extra fan power. Therefore, to minimize the total operating cost of a SDVAV system, the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> is typically reset based on outside air temperature (OAT) with a linear reset schedule. However, the linear reset schedule is often determined based on the engineer?s experience {{and it may not}} represent the optimal reset schedule for each building. This thesis documents a study to determine the optimized <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> reset schedule for SDVAV systems and analyzes the influencing factors under different operation scenarios. The study was divided into five main sections. The first section introduces the research background and objective. Literature review is documented after the introduction. The third section describes the methodology used in this study and the fourth section develops an in-depth discussion and analysis {{of the impact of the}} key influencing factors: minimum air flow ratio; ratio of exterior zone area to total floor area (i. e., exterior area ratio); internal load and the prices of the electricity; the cooling and the heating energy. The simulation results using EnergyPlus Version 2. 1. 0 for various operation scenarios are investigated in this section. The last section is a conclusion of the whole study. The optimized <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> can be set with respect to the OAT. The study found that instead of a simple linear relationship, the optimal reset schedule has several distinctive segments. Moreover, it is found that the optimal <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> reset schedule should be modified with the change of operation conditions (e. g., different minimum flow ratios and internal loads). Minimum air flow ratio has a significant impact on energy consumption in a SDVAV system. Exterior area ratio determines zone load distribution and will change system load indirectly. For buildings with small internal load, a more aggressive <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> reset tactic can be implemented. In addition, the cost of electricity, cooling and heating energy can determine which end use energy (i. e., reheat energy and fan power) should take the priority...|$|E
