The proposed ANCTB {{can be interpreted}} as a Physical Layer Network Coding (PLNC) for non-regenerative multi-way relaying, where the network coding is performed via beamforming. Thus, the RS does not need to know the modulation constellation and coding which are used by the nodes. This is the difference of the proposed beamforming-based PLNC to the PLNC proposed for two-way relaying in [6, 31].|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Dual Electroabsorption Modulated Laser (D-EML) is a {{transmitter}} technology <b>specially</b> <b>design</b> for dual drive. It {{is composed}} of an integrated Distributed Feed Back (DFB) laser and an Electro-Absorption Modulator (EAM) with dual independent modulation access. By controlling independently laser and modulator modulation amplitudes, it's possible to adjust the chirp of this optical source and thus increase the transmission distance far beyond the chromatic dispersion limit. We develop a D-EML model based on experimental characterizations in order to study benefits of dual modulation scheme for optical systems at 10 Gb/s and above. In this paper, we propose to analyze {{the impact of the}} EAM chirp profile on the performances...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{vibration}} of {{pipe systems}} not only worsens their working environment, but also {{may result in}} the loosening of mechanical connections between pipelines, {{as well as the}} structural fatigue damages. This paper presents a new method for vibration control of pipe systems, by <b>specially</b> <b>designing</b> some pipe structures based on two vibration reduction mechanisms of phononic crystals, for the vibration frequency in the actual tests. Some numerical analyses are then performed about the effects of the parameters of vibrator, for instance, the ratio of material components, and the numbers of period. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed phononic crystals structures can reduce the vibration of pipe systems effectively...|$|R

According to him, he would not be able to design something significantly different from the Renaissance inspired roman like Trinité. In 1989 however, he was approached by the designer of the Van Dale dictionary, who wanted to test Trinité for use at 7pt. De Does suggested to <b>specially</b> <b>design</b> a new typeface instead.|$|R

5|$|Broaching was {{originally}} developed for machining internal keyways. However, {{it was soon}} discovered that broaching is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> for the geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E

This is not a significant disadvantage in many types of material, as good joint strengths can be achieved, however for certain material classes such as ceramics or metal ceramic composites, such processing can significantly limit joint strength.
