40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{importance}} of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> on entrepreneurship. To measure differences in the interconnectedness of <b>social</b> <b>contacts,</b> we compare rural and agglomerated areas. A smaller community size in rural areas generates greater network closure. Agents' neighborhoods {{are more likely to}} overlap, which intensifies <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> and thus facilitates resource mobilization. Analyzing the impact of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> across regions, we find that greater network closure increases the likelihood of being an entrepreneur by 1. 9 to 14. 2 percentage points, depending on the number of underlying <b>social</b> <b>contacts.</b> These results remain robust after applying matching techniques and concentrating on young entrepreneurs.

40|$|Background. Recent {{research}} suggests that the health gain from economic resources and psychological assets may be systematically larger for Whites than Blacks. Aim. This study aimed to assess whether the life expectancy gain associated with <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> over a long follow up differs for Blacks and Whites. Methods. Data came from the Americans’ Changing Lives (ACL) Study, 1986 – 2011. The sample was a nationally representative sample of American adults 25 and older, who were followed for up to 25 years (n = 3361). Outcome was all-cause mortality. The main predictor was <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> defined as number of regular visits with friends, relatives, and neighbors. Baseline demographics (age and gender), socioeconomic status (education, income, and employment), health behaviors (smoking and drinking), and health (chronic medical conditions, obesity, and depressive symptoms) were controlled. Race was the focal moderator. Cox proportional hazard models were used in the pooled sample and based on race. Results. More <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> predicted higher life expectancy in the pooled sample. A significant interaction was found between race and <b>social</b> <b>contacts,</b> suggesting that the protective effect of more <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> is smaller for Blacks than Whites. In stratified models, more <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> predicted an increased life expectancy for Whites but not Blacks. Conclusion. <b>Social</b> <b>contacts</b> increase life expectancy for White but not Black Americans. This study introduces <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> as another <b>social</b> resource that differentially affects health of Whites and Blacks...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to explore whether {{unemployment}} influences adolescents' subjective perception of health and whether perceived financial stress and <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> can mediate the effect of employment status on health. We are also interested in the differences in financial situation and <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> between unemployed secondary school leavers and their employed and studying counterparts. Methods: Data were obtained from 844 adolescents (mean age 19. 6) from Slovakia. The effect of unemployment on several health indicators was measured and subsequently controlled for perceived financial strain of respondents and their <b>social</b> <b>contacts.</b> Results: The results showed highest financial strain among unemployed, whereas only small differences in <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> were found between three groups. Negative influence of unemployment on perceived health of respondents was confirmed. Nevertheless, strong influence was found only on long-term well-being and mental health. Financial situation and <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> contributed to the prediction of almost all health outcomes, and to some extent mediated the effect of unemployment. Conclusions: Although unemployment was found to have a negative impact on health of adolescents, sufficiency of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> and good financial situation seem to decrease this effect and protect the health of unemployed people...|$|R

Other calls include a down-slurred keeur given when an adult is approaching the nest with a fish, and a kip uttered during <b>social</b> <b>contact.</b> Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, and siblings also recognise each other's vocalisations from about the twelfth day after hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>contacts</b> {{of older}} people have {{consistently}} been associated with good health and longevity. The extent of individual <b>social</b> <b>contacts,</b> however, varies considerably between countries. We study why countries differ in amounts of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> of older adults. Using theory on income inequality and neo-materialism, we expect the amount of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> {{of older people}} to be highest in countries with low income inequality and comprehensive welfare spending. Furthermore, we hypothesize {{that the impact of}} country characteristics on <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> differs with individual income and age. We combine individual-level data from the European Social Survey with country-level data from Eurostat, and test two dimensions of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> of people aged >= 60 years: having a close contact and meeting socially. Cross-national comparison of 27 European countries is realized through linear and logistic multilevel modelling. The results reveal partial support for our expectations. Income inequality and old-age poverty reduce the likelihood of having a close contact. Welfare spending, specifically expenditure on care for older adults and health services, has the potential to cancel out some of these negative effects. However, there were only small differences between age groups. The implications of these findings are being discussed...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} analyze of {{maintaining}} <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> of senior age group. <b>Social</b> <b>contacts</b> maintaining is investigated {{in terms of}} social inclusion to the social mainstream. Current sociological science examines social inclusion as multidimensional process which possesses different manifestation – political, economic and sociocultural dimensions. Sociocultural manifestation consists of social participation and maintaining <b>social</b> <b>contacts.</b> Previous research experience demonstrates that <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> are important source of moral and material supports. Permanent communication (as joining to the social networks) is able to protect from social exclusion. Results of complex sociological research are highlighted in the paper – combination of quantitative (analyze of European Social Survey data, the ESS, 2010 / 11) and qualitative (original study based on in-depth interview conducted in Kiev) approaches was applied. Empirical object of research is age group of persons 60 years and older. Both volume (the number of contacts) and quality (opportunities for financial assistance and moral support) of <b>social</b> <b>contacts,</b> which are maintained by senior age group, are considered during the study. The results demonstrated various <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> of senior age group mostly provide the moral support. Yet they are very difficult converted to material resources in Ukraine...|$|R

Thus economies with dense social networks can exhibit apparently low labor force quality and, as a result, low returns to firms’ investment and depressed aggregate productivity. We employ US and European data for the 1990 ’s to test the key prediction that <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> distort workers’ occupational choices in a direction that reduces their apparent productivity. We find that the use of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> helps …nd jobs one to two months sooner but leads to individual wage discounts of 5 % to 7 % and produces negative externalities on aggregate productivity...|$|R

Occupational Choice and <b>Social</b> <b>Contacts</b> Across Regions This paper tests the relative importance of strong versus weak social ties on self-employment. Strong ties arising from frequent interaction should create trust that facilitates resource mobilization. To measure differences in <b>social</b> <b>contacts,</b> we compare the impact of club memberships on the likelihood of being self-employed in peripheral and agglomerated areas. In peripheral areas, we expect that more membership overlappings will lead to stronger ties. Analyzing the different impact of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> on becoming self-employed across regions, we find that strengthening social ties increases the likelihood of being self-employed by 1. 9 to 14. 2 percentage points, depending on the number of underlying <b>social</b> <b>contacts.</b> These results remain robust after applying matching techniques...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies in}} the {{migration}} literature have hypothesized that <b>social</b> <b>contacts,</b> in particular contacts with natives, are important for immigrant employment. Empirical work, however, has been inconclusive whether <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> indeed have a causal effect. This study uses the German Socio-Economic Panel (1984 — 2004) to estimate the effect of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> {{of male and female}} immigrants on their employment position. Results show that contacts with family, friends and neighbours and being active as a volunteer have no significant effect on employment for both immigrant men and women. It is also found that having contacts with Germans increases the likelihood of male and female employment. The positive effect of having German <b>contacts</b> remains when <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> are lagged, when host-country human capital is taken into account and also when unmeasured time-constant characteristics of immigrants are considered...|$|R

Results show that general <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> {{have a positive effect}} on the occupational status and, in particular, annual income of immigrants. We also find that bridging ties with Germans lead to higher occupational status, but not to increased income. These effects remain visible even when <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> are measured (at least) 1 year prior to the economic outcomes, as well as when earlier investments in German human capital are considered. Finally, we show that co-ethnic concentration in the region of residence weakly affects economic returns to German language proficiency and schooling...|$|R

Social capital refers {{to a wide range of}} social phenomena; however, we focus on <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> with family and friends. We derive hypotheses about cross-national differences in social capital from theories on the nature of welfare state regimes. We test these hypotheses with multi-level analyses on Eurobarometer data, collected in thirteen countries. We find significant variance across different countries. This variance is partly explained by individual characteristics: religious people and people living in medium-sized or rural towns have more <b>social</b> <b>contacts.</b> Moreover, we find quite differential effects of other individual characteristics on <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> and no effects of political stances. Differences in the cross-national compositions in educational attainment and household size also account for the variance in <b>social</b> <b>contacts.</b> Finally, people living in social-democratic regimes turn out to have the smallest amount of <b>social</b> <b>contacts,</b> whereas people living in the Latin Rim have the largest amount.
