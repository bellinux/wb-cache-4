5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was at Paramount Pictures for {{producer}} Roger Edens. Funny Face contains {{four of the}} original George and Ira Gershwin songs from the otherwise unrelated 1927 Broadway musical {{of the same name}} that had starred Fred Astaire. Loosely based on the life of fashion photographer Richard Avedon, who was also the visual consultant and designed the opening title sequence for the film, it was written by Leonard Gershe and included additional music by Gershe and Edens. Donen and Edens began pre-production at MGM, but had difficulty juggling Astaire and Audrey Hepburn's Paramount contracts, the Warner Brothers – owned rights to the Gershwin music that they wanted and their own MGM contracts. Eventually a deal was reached that both released Donen from his MGM contract and allowed him to make his next two films at Paramount and Warner Brothers respectively. Astaire plays an aging fashion photographer who discovers the intellectual bohemian Hepburn at a used bookstore in Greenwich Village and turns her into his new model while falling in love with her in Paris. Donen, Avedon and cinematographer Ray June collaborated to give the film an abstract, smokey look that resembled the fashion photography of the period despite protests by Paramount, which had recently spent a fortune developing the crisp VistaVision. Funny Face was screened in competition at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and received good reviews from critics like Crowther. <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sound,</b> in contrast, accused it of being anti-intellectual.|$|E

Bells and candles are also frequent symbols. These are symbols of film, <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> <b>sound,</b> and Tarkovsky's film frequently has themes of self-reflection.|$|E

500|$|Bosley Crowther {{wrote that}} the film had [...] "a strangely obscure, inferential, almost studiedly perplexing quality". Variety staff praised the film's visuals for reminiscence to Japanese prints, costumes and set design, and the {{performances}} of Masayuki Mori and Machiko Kyō.

500|$|The acting {{was also}} praised {{by many of}} the critics; Lejeune thought that [...] "the acting of the countless small {{character}} parts that the plot brings together is splendid", while the reviewer for The Monthly Film Bulletin considered that [...] "each character, and indeed every individual member of the lengthy cast, provides a gem of comedy acting at its highest and best". The Manchester Guardian reviewer was critical about aspects of the direction which, it was said, was undertaken [...] "with barely sufficient skill to sustain the fun". The critic Henry Raynor, writing for <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sound,</b> thought that the film [...] "sacrificed a comic enquiry into motives and personality to a farcical romp... It was carried through, not by wit or polish, but by a sometimes hysterical jollity".|$|E

500|$|McNeile had a quiet {{life after}} the war; his biographer Jonathon Green notes that [...] "as in the novels of fellow best-selling writers such as P. G. Wodehouse or Agatha Christie, it is the hero who lives the {{exciting}} life". Although he was an [...] "unremittingly hearty man", he suffered from delicate health following the war. He had a loud voice and a louder laugh, and [...] "liked to enliven clubs and restaurants with the <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> <b>sound</b> of military good fellowship"; his friend and collaborator Gerard Fairlie described him as [...] "not everybody's cup of tea", and commented that [...] "he was loud in every possible way—in his voice, in his laugh, in his clothes, in the unconscious swagger with which he always motivated himself, in his whole approach to life".

He also considered Buster Keaton, Robert Altman, Werner Herzog, and Martin Scorsese to be his favorite directors. He expressed his general distaste for [...] "top ten" [...] lists, and all movie lists in general, but contributed a top ten list to the 2012 <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sound</b> Critics' poll. Listed alphabetically, those films were Aguirre, the Wrath of God; Apocalypse Now; Citizen Kane; La Dolce Vita; The General; Raging Bull; Tokyo Story; The Tree of Life; and Vertigo.

500|$|On the whole, {{international}} {{critics of}} the time praised Loves of a Blonde, with positive reviews published by Saturday Review, The New Yorker, America, <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sound,</b> Harper's, and The New York Times. One of the film's most influential champions was Jean Collet, writing in Cahiers du cinéma that, by capturing the momentary indiscretions of his characters on the screen, Forman forces the audience into a voyeuristic situation that induces embarrassment and laughter. There were dissenting voices, however: Phillip J. Hartung, writing in Commonweal, compared the film unfavorably with Ivan Passer's contemporaneous Intimate Lighting, while Robert Hatch, in The Nation, felt that Loves of a Blonde was an [...] "endearing but artless" [...] film, with its long central section of the big dance having {{little to do with}} the main plot. In a lengthy article in Film Comment, Kirk Bond compared the [...] "ordinariness" [...] of Loves of a Blonde unfavorably with other Czech films of the period that he believed displayed greater mastery of narrative technique.|$|E

500|$|Battles in Final Fantasy XI {{take place}} in the world in which players move around, a first in the series, where battle had {{previously}} taken place in a separate screen via random encounters. The surprise of the random encounter system is achieved via aggressive monsters, who will attack players based on different factors such as <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> <b>sound.</b> This format would continue in future Final Fantasy games. Monsters within the game operate under a system of [...] "claim" [...] and [...] "". A monster is claimed the moment a player performs any offensive action upon it, whether physical, magical or ability related. With some exceptions, once a monster is claimed it can only be attacked by players in the party or alliance of the player that claimed it.

500|$|Thompson's Academy success {{continued}} with Sense and Sensibility (1995), {{generally considered to}} be the most popular and authentic of the numerous film adaptions of Jane Austen's novels made in the 1990s. Thompson—a lifelong lover of Austen's work—was hired to write the film based on the period sketches in her series Thompson. She spent five years developing the screenplay, and took the role of the spinster sister Elinor Dashwood despite, at 35, being 16 years older than the literary character. Directed by Ang Lee and co-starring Kate Winslet, Sense and Sensibility received widespread critical praise {{and is one of the}} highest-grossing films of Thompson's career. Shelly Frome remarked that she displayed a [...] "great affinity for Jane Austen's style and wit", and Graham Fuller of <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sound</b> saw her as the film's auteur. Thompson received a third nomination for Best Actress and won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay, making her the only person in history to win an Oscar for both acting and writing. She also earned a second BAFTA Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay.|$|E
500|$|Prior to its UK release, Spectre mostly {{received}} positive reviews. Mark Kermode, {{writing in}} The Guardian, gave the film {{four out of}} five stars, observing that the film did not live up to the standard set by Skyfall, but was able to tap into audience expectations. Writing in the same publication, Peter Bradshaw gave the film a full five stars, calling it [...] "inventive, intelligent and complex", and singling out Craig's performance as the film's highlight. In another five star review, The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin described Spectre as [...] "a swaggering show of confidence'", lauding it as [...] "a feat of pure cinematic necromancy." [...] Positive yet critical assessments included Kim Newman of <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sound,</b> who wrote that [...] "for all its wayward plotting (including an unhelpful tie-in with Bond’s childhood that makes very little sense) and off-the-peg elements, Spectre works" [...] as he felt [...] "the audience’s patience gets tested by {{two and a half hours}} of set-pieces strung on one of the series’ thinner plots"; and IGN's Chris Tilly, who rated the film 7.2 out of 10, considering Spectre [...] "solid if unspectacular", and concluding that [...] "the film falls frustratingly short of greatness." ...|$|E
