40|$|ANSI Standard IT 9. 9 - 1990 is one {{methodology}} commonly {{recommended for}} predicting dark <b>storage</b> <b>print</b> life for color photographic materials. This methodology focuses primarily on measurement {{of changes that}} occur due to temperature at one relative humidity (50 % ± 3 %). Of greater concern for dark stability of inkjet prints, however, is humidity levels that are higher than 50 % RH, especially as consumer usage of inkjet continues to expand all over the world. Ink/media combinations exist today that respond almost immediately to humidity in excess of 50 % RH, even at ambient temperatures, and these instabilities are a major concern for both manufacturer and user. In addition, the effects of elevated humidity on inkjet prints vary widely between different ink/media combinations. Several quantitative measures are necessary to adequately describe the resultant behaviors. The objective {{of this paper is}} to begin to explore these relationships providing a foundation of understanding that will ultimately lead to a robust model that correctly predicts the image quality degradation as a result of exposure to variable dark keeping conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Small offices/home offices have <b>storage</b> and <b>print</b> {{requirements}} {{that are very}} hard to fulfill. They require that the methods used are both economical and efficient. Network printers can be very expensive, {{and to provide a}} print server for a small network (say 15 stations) is also not economically viable. On the same lines, providing specialized network-attached storage devices too is an expensive option. We aim to solve this problem, by providing a cost-effective, yet efficient solution for <b>storage</b> and <b>print</b> requirements for SOHOs by making efficient use of the IXP 425 Network Processor. Internet SCSI (iSCSI) is an official standard that allows the use of SCSI over TCP/IP networks. The recent shift to gigabit ethernet has seen a rapid acceleration in the usage of the iSCSI protocol. Although iSCSI has predominantly seen use in Storage-Area Networks (SANs), nothing in its architecture prevents its use in other devices. We exploit this device independent nature of iSCSI, and that which is seen inherently in SCSI, by providing both <b>storage</b> and <b>print</b> solutions, with the same back bone architecture. We also provide host independent printing, which is to say that, we provide a medium for printing directly without the intervention of a host machine. We use a network processor (IXP 425) to implement the solution effectively, making use of its inherent support of networking features, so that we can provide an efficient solution to the task at hand.

40|$|As {{university}} libraries devote increasing {{portions of}} staff time and budget dollars to electronic resources, many {{are looking for}} cost- and labor-efficient ways of storing and ensuring access to legacy print collections. Shared print repositories have emerged as one possible solution, but setting up a shared storage system is never easy. Issues of selection, preservation, access and use, and interoperability must be resolved, but first comes one pivotal question: Where {{are we going to}} put all these books? Collocating shared <b>print</b> <b>storage</b> is one answer. Rather than securing holdings in place, The Committee on Institutional Cooperation’s Shared Print Repository selects volumes for preservation from multiple universities, relocating materials as necessary to create a comprehensive print collection. Collocating the collection means more secure conditions can be maintained and better user services supported by holding some bodies of print content in common thus relieving each individual school of the obligation to commit the necessary resources to manage these resources on its own. Nonetheless, physically transferring items, but not ownership, to other locations creates specific challenges.
