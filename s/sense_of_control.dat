25|$|Findings {{have shown}} in {{specific}} cases that paranormal belief {{acts as a}} psychodynamic coping function {{and serves as a}} mechanism for coping with stress. Survivors from childhood sexual abuse, violent and unsettled home environments have reported to have higher levels of paranormal belief. A study of a random sample of 502 adults revealed paranormal experiences were common in the population which were linked to a history of childhood trauma and dissociative symptoms. Research has also suggested that people who perceive themselves as having little control over their lives may develop paranormal beliefs to help provide an enhanced <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
25|$|DeNeve (1999) {{argued that}} there are three trends in the {{relationship}} between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies (emotional stability, positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. trust, affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an optimistic fashion, having a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{levels of}} the technology, the thought of abandoning control to a machine, and {{psychological}} comfort of passengers in such situations were the major discussion topics initially. The commuters also stated {{that they did not}} want to see everything the car was doing. This was primarily a referral to the auto-steering wheel with no one sitting in the driving seat. Intel also learnt that voice control regulator is vital, and the interface between the humans and machine eases the discomfort condition, and brings some <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> back. It is important to mention that Intel included only 10 people in this study, which makes the study less credible. In a video posted on YouTube, Intel accepted this fact and called for further testing.|$|E

25|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} among high achieving professionals who seek challenging situations that require resilience. Research has examined 13 high achievers from various professions, {{all of whom had}} experienced challenges in the workplace and negative life events over the course of their careers but who had also been recognized for their great achievements in their respective fields. Participants were interviewed about everyday life in the workplace as well as their experiences with resilience and thriving. The study found six main predictors of resilience: positive and proactive personality, experience and learning, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> flexibility and adaptability, balance and perspective, and perceived social support. High achievers were also found to engage in many activities unrelated to their work such as engaging in hobbies, exercising, and organizing meetups with friends and loved ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{additional}} funding, though significant, {{expanded the}} scope of the game and causes some setbacks, and for some periods, the Greens lived off loans and donations during the development. Following Joel's death March 2014, Ryan was further committed to completing the game to honor Joel's memory and as a way to cope with his loss, and turned back to work a few days after Joel's funeral. The game, up to that point, had been written based on unknowing of Joel's fate, but with his death, the team recognized that much of what they had in place was more focused on the narrative from Ryan and Amy's side, and made it feel more of a selfish work. There were also concerns from investors about the interactivity of the title. They rewrote about 70% of the game to make it more focused on the interactions with Joel. Originally, the game would have ended with the player witnessing a machine with numerous levers that could be pulled, giving the player some <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> but when they examined the machine's internals, found that all of the levers were disconnected, and that they had no control of the situation. Following Joel's death, they felt this scene was no longer applicable, and instead replaced it with the players interacting a final time with Joel in a cathedral in an afterlife-type setting as to bring closure to their story. With the change, Ryan hoped that the game would help others to cope and open up with others with the loss of loved ones. One design decision made was to represent the characters in the game with feature-less faces. Ryan stated that this was both that being a small team they did not have the technical capability to fully program and animate the character's faces, and that by leaving the faces feature-less, it would help players engage by imagining themselves in the place of the game's characters.|$|E
500|$|The novel's {{title is}} taken from the popular Dominican merengue Mataron al chivo ("They Killed the Goat"), which refers to Trujillo's {{assassination}} on May 30, 1961. Merengue is a style of music created by Ã‘ico Lora in the 1920s and actively promoted by Trujillo himself. It's now considered the country's national music. Cultural critics Julie Sellers and Stephen Ropp comment about this particular merengue that, by envisaging the dictator as an animal who could {{be turned into a}} stew (as frequently happened with goats struck down on the Dominican Republic's highways), the song [...] "gave those performing, listening to, and dancing to this merengue a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> over him and over themselves that they had not experienced for over three decades."

500|$|The song {{opens with}} Brown's laugh, {{followed}} by [...] "undislodgeable [...] piano notes." [...] Over these notes, the first {{lines of the}} refrain are rapped in a call and response interaction between Brown and Halliwell. The words [...] "tell," [...] "really" [...] and [...] "I wanna" [...] are repeated, so that the vocal tone and lyrics build up an image of female self-assertion. The refrain ends with the word [...] "zigazig-ha," [...] a euphemism for female desire, which is ambiguously sexualised or broadly economic. The first verse follows; Brown, Halliwell, Chisholm, Bunton sing one line individually, in that order. In this part, the lyrics have a pragmatic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> of the situation; they begin, [...] "If you want my future, forget my past." [...] This, according to musicologist Sheila Whiteley, taps directly into the emotions of the young teenage audience.|$|E
500|$|Like all intellectuals of his age, Matthias was {{convinced}} that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals' life and on the history of nations. Galeotto Marzio described him as [...] "king and astrologer", and Antonio Bonfini said Matthias [...] "never did anything without consulting the stars". Upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, Johannes Regiomontanus and Marcin Bylica, set up an observatory in Buda and installed it with astrolabes and celestial globes. Regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by Christopher Columbus to Matthias. The King appointed Bylica as his advisor in 1468. According to Scott E. Hendrix, [...] "establishing a prominent astrologer as his political advisor provided an anxiety-reduction mechanism that boosted morale for the political elites within his realm while strengthening his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> {{in the face of the}} multiple adversities the Hungarians faced" [...] in his reign.|$|E
500|$|The {{aforementioned}} {{study by}} Barden-O'Fallon et al., which surveyed 940 women and 661 men, indicated that, despite {{their knowledge and}} awareness, many people in Malawi do not feel personally susceptible to HIV infection. On average, only 23% of the adults who were surveyed during this study, both male and female, {{believed that they were}} likely to contract HIV and die of AIDS. Greater HIV/AIDS awareness among men does not seem to correspond with increased perceived risk; on the other hand, increased levels of knowledge about HIV/AIDS do correlate positively to perceived risk among women. Another study conducted in rural Malawi between 1998 and 2001 by Kirsten P. Smith et al. indicated that concerns about personal vulnerability to HIV/AIDS declined during this four-year time frame, probably because the increased use of preventative strategies gave people a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> In fact, many participants in this study claimed that they were [...] "not at all worried" [...] about HIV/AIDS; unless they had simply adopted a fatalistic standpoint towards the epidemic, these respondents probably felt that they had successfully reduced their risk of exposure through personal behavioral changes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>control</b> is {{indicated}} {{in many ways}} which includes, going {{out of the way}} to obtain specific foods, spending unnecessary amounts of money on foods to satisfy cravings.

Other ways to indicate the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> are craving food despite being full. One may set rules to try to eat healthy but the cravings over rule and the rules are failed to be followed. One big indicator <b>of</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>control</b> due to food addiction is even though one knows they have a medical problem caused by the craved foods, they cannot stop consuming the foods, which can be detrimental to their health.|$|R

Davis stated that the high-speed gameplay was [...] "incredibly engaging" [...] and artistic on both a visual and technical level. A reviewer of GamePro enjoyed the idea of using different ships in races and also praised the game's online multiplayer, stating that it [...] "adds a whole new dynamic to the game". O'Donnell cited the developer's intention of blending ulta-fast gameplay as [...] "clever". In addition, O'Donnell acknowledged that Sony Studio Liverpool [...] "learned from their mistakes" [...] from the poor gameplay of its predecessor, Wipeout Fusion, and created what O'Donnell considered as [...] "the most polished futuristic racer to ever hit the market". Chang similarly opinionated that the previous instalment was [...] "obtuse" [...] and did not present a positive experience to the Wipeout franchise, however he agreed that Wipeout Pure resulted in becoming an [...] "extremely polished" [...] and playable futuristic racing game, further adding that the developers trimmed off elements that were considered ineffective in previous games. A reviewer of Edge praised the game's different modes as dynamic and vicious, stating that the game delivers an [...] "absolute" [...] <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Kelly considered the online multiplayer [...] "superbly executed" [...] and the large amount of weapons in the game well-designed.|$|E
500|$|Several {{scenes in}} Inside Man {{required}} multiple-camera setups, {{which meant that}} Libatique had to instruct and work with multiple camera operators. Lee {{wanted to create a}} visual distinction between the characters Russell (Owen) and Frazier (Washington), while incorporating visual metaphors. Russell's scenes, in which he masterminds the bank heist, were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character is in control. Frazier's scenes, in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation, were filmed with multiple hand-held cameras to display the character's confusion. Libatique explained, [...] "I said, 'We want to create a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and largely centered frames with Cliveâ€™s character, and we want to have movement with Denzelâ€™s.' Having three operators on the same character, Iâ€™d watch all three. In a handheld shot, a long lens has a little bit of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother. I would actually talk to the operator and tell him not to be so steady. It was the first time Iâ€™d worked with so many operators where I wasnâ€™t one myself." [...] Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios. [...] Steadicam operator Stephen Consentino estimated that 80% of the film was shot with hand-held cameras or a Steadicam. A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released. A Technocrane was used for a crane shot that would cover the following moment, in which the hostages are placed in buses.|$|E
500|$|Pilotwings 64 {{was well}} {{received}} by most reviewers. The game's combination of 3D graphics, realistic settings, and flight simulation were applauded by many news sources and major gaming publications. In his release {{review of the}} Nintendo 64, The Seattle Times contributor Steven L. Kent found that the flight mechanics and vast areas featured in Pilotwings 64 make {{it one of the}} most impressive games ever made. Glenn Rubenstein of the website GameSpot summarized, [...] "The graphics, sound, control, and all around excitement add up to make Pilotwings 64 one hell of a great ride." [...] Staff reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and IGN all voiced positive comments on the game's polygon rendering and frame rates, as well as its <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and flying. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the game's large environments, exclaiming, [...] "You'll not believe just how huge the islands really are and, because certain elements are hidden at first, it'll take you months to see everything." [...] IGN's Levi Buchanan described this low-pressure, [...] "challenge without competition" [...] aspect of the game as a design philosophy adopted by later Nintendo titles such as Nintendogs. Rich Leadbetter of Maximum said that [...] "The sedate nature of the gameplay might not appeal to everyone, but the bottom line is that PilotWings 64 is an unparalleled test of skill, dexterity and control. It is a game that you must own and whilst not quite in the same league of 'must-have'itude as Super Mario 64, it remains an astounding achievement and another triumph for Nintendo." [...] A Next Generation critic remarked that once beyond the introductory missions the game becomes satisfyingly challenging, and succeeds as both a flight simulation and an example of Nintendo's surrealistic gameplay: [...] "It's a weird mix of total realism and self-conscious videogame elements, and the two don't grate." ...|$|E
