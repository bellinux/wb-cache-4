50|$|Thermal {{spraying}} {{need not}} be a dangerous process, if the equipment is treated with care, and correct spraying practices are followed. As with any industrial process, {{there are a number of}} hazards, of which the operator should be aware, and against which specific precautions should be taken. Ideally, equipment should be operated automatically, in enclosures specially designed to extract fumes, reduce noise levels, and prevent direct viewing of the <b>spraying</b> <b>head.</b> Such techniques will also produce coatings that are more consistent. There are occasions when the type of components being treated, or their low production levels, requires manual equipment operation. Under these conditions, a number of hazards, peculiar to thermal spraying, are experienced, in addition to those commonly encountered in production or processing industries.|$|E

The vessel is a common disposable spray can (2) with an integrated shut-off valve (12). The spray head (1) forms, together with the drive unit (5, 20, 21, 22), a single unit which can be clamped onto the common disposable spray can (2) and has a handle (6) to which a holding device (30, 32) receiving the disposable spray can (2) can be joined, through which the disposable spray can (2) is pressed against a trigger pin (11) provided on the spray head, thus opening the shut-off valve (12) and creating the connection to the pump (4) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} {{cleaning}} and verifying the cleanliness {{of the interior}} surfaces of hollow items, such as small bottles, tanks, pipes and tubes, employs a rotating <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> for supplying a gas-liquid cleaning mixture to the item's surface at a supersonic velocity. The <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> incorporates a plurality of nozzles having diverging cross sections so that the incoming gas-liquid mixture is first converged within the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> and then diverged through the nozzles, thereby accelerating the mixture to a supersonic velocity. In the preferred embodiment, three nozzles are employed; one forwardly facing nozzle {{at the end of}} the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> and two oppositely facing angled nozzles exiting on opposite sides of the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> which balance each other, and therefore impart no net side load on the <b>spray</b> <b>head.</b> A drive mechanism is provided to rotate the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> and at the same time move the head back and forth within the item to be cleaned. The drive mechanism acts on a long metal tube to which the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> is fixed, and thus no moving parts are exposed to the interior surfaces of the items to be cleaned, thereby reducing the risk of contamination...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{sprinklers}} used in lawn irrigation, pop-up <b>spray</b> <b>heads</b> and rotors. <b>Spray</b> <b>heads</b> have a fixed spray pattern, while rotors have one or more streams that rotate. <b>Spray</b> <b>heads</b> are used to cover smaller areas, while rotors are used for larger areas. Golf course rotors are sometimes so large that a single sprinkler is combined with a valve and called a 'valve in head'. When used in a turf area, the sprinklers are installed with {{the top of the}} head flush with the ground surface. When the system is pressurized, the head will pop up out of the ground and water the desired area until the valve closes and shuts off that zone. Once there is no more pressure in the lateral line, the sprinkler head will retract back into the ground. In flower beds or shrub areas, sprinklers may be mounted on above ground risers or even taller pop-up sprinklers may be used and installed flush as in a lawn area.|$|R

50|$|The drying gas {{enters the}} system via the heater. A {{new kind of}} heater system allows for laminar air flow.

50|$|Throughout {{the latter}} part of the 20th century, a number of inventors {{patented}} various coffeemaker designs using an automated form of the drip brew method.

40|$|Low-pressure centre-pivot {{systems are}} usually {{equipped}} with <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> sprinklers {{that can have}} different types of deflector plates and thus produce different drop sizes causing different effects on the infiltration process. Field tests using low-pressure (140 kPa) <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> sprinklers with smooth and medium groove deflector plates and maximum water applications rates between 99 and 125 mm/h were carried out in a Mediterranean soil. These tests {{made it possible to}} study the effect of the deflector plate on irrigation uniformity, runoff and sediment yield. Medium groove deflectors produce lower irrigation uniformity, but apply water with larger water droplets which are less affected by wind and can lead to less evaporation and wind drift losses. However, these droplets have higher impact energy over the soil surface, increasing surface sealing and crust formation, which reduce infiltration and increase runoff. Higher runoff amounts and soil particles detachment produced by grooved deflectors also lead to more sediment yield and soil erosion...|$|R
40|$|The development, construction, and {{operation}} of the Colonie Landfill Leachate Management System (LLMS) was first conceived as a two-year project in 1987, but took {{more than six years}} to reach the final reporting stage, during which time substantial regulatory hurdles were encountered and overcome. During the summer of 1987, a work plan for the project was developed. It was determined that a pilot leachate-spraying study should be undertaken to provide additional information on the potential environmental impacts due to surface runoff and moisture front penetration through the landfill cap. To achieve this, a { 1 / 4 }-acre (100 ` x 100 `) test area was prepared and equipped with a single leachate <b>spray</b> <b>head,</b> a collection point for runoff, a rain gage, and four pan lysimeters (at depths of 6 inch, 12 inch, 18 inch, and 24 inch) to measure moisture advancement through the cap. A similarly equipped control area, minus the <b>spray</b> <b>head,</b> was prepared nearby...|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} drip {{coffee maker}} {{can also be}} referred to as a dripolator. It normally works by admitting water from a cold water reservoir into a flexible hose in the base of the reservoir leading directly to a thin metal tube or heating chamber (usually, of aluminum), where a heating element surrounding the metal tube heats the water. The heated water moves through the machine using the thermosiphon principle. Thermally-induced pressure and the siphoning effect move the heated water through an insulated rubber or vinyl riser hose, into a <b>spray</b> <b>head,</b> and onto the ground coffee, which is contained in a brew basket mounted below the <b>spray</b> <b>head.</b> The coffee passes through a filter and drips down into the carafe. A one-way valve in the tubing prevents water from siphoning back into the reservoir. A thermostat attached to the heating element turns off the heating element as needed to prevent overheating the water in the metal tube (overheating would produce only steam in the supply hose), then turns back on when the water cools below a certain threshold. For a standard 10-12 cup drip coffeemaker, using a more powerful thermostatically-controlled heating element (in terms of wattage produced), can heat increased amounts of water more quickly using larger heating chambers, generally producing higher average water temperatures at the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> over the entire brewing cycle. This process can be further improved by changing the aluminum construction of most heating chambers to a metal with superior heat transfer qualities, such as copper.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the field}} of [...] "nano" [...] spray drying a new heating system is used to provide the drying gas to produce the particles. The gas flow in the system is laminar and not {{turbulent}} as in common spray drying. The advantage of a laminar flow is that the particles fall straight down from the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> and do not stick to the glass wall.|$|R

25|$|Aerosol paint, {{also called}} spray paint, {{is a type}} of paint that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a valve button. A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many rolled or brushed paints. In 1949, Ed Seymour of Sycamore, Illinois invented aerosol paint, which he based on the same principle as spray deodorizers and insecticides.
