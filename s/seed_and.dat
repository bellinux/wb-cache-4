5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of <b>seed,</b> <b>and</b> the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aquilonia adapts {{readily to}} {{cultivation}} in humid or temperate climates, but is rarely cultivated. A fast-growing plant, it can grow in acidic soils from pH 3.5 to 6.5. Propagation is generally by <b>seed,</b> <b>and</b> plants flower at {{four to six}} years of age. Vegetative propagation is possible from semi-hardened cuttings of pencil thickness. The flower spikes attract birds to the garden. It can also be grown in a pot, with its branches heavily pruned to keep foliage dense.|$|E
30|$|Native {{plant cover}} {{decreased}} in both <b>seeded</b> <b>and</b> unseeded plots over the seven-year period (Table 3).

5|$|Banksia canei lacks a {{lignotuber}} {{and appears}} to regenerate from bushfire by seed, although its response to fire has been little studied. The follicles remain closed until burnt, although some do open spontaneously after five years or so. The fungus Banksiamyces toomansis, of the order Helotiales, infects older cones and <b>seed,</b> <b>and</b> hence seed older than about five years is often not viable. Plectronidium australiense is a species of anamorphic fungus that was recovered from a dead branch of B. canei at Healesville Sanctuary and described in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Flowering {{may take}} some years from seed; a minimum of four years is average. Buying an {{advanced}} plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant. Banksia ericifolia can be propagated easily by <b>seed,</b> <b>and</b> {{is one of the}} (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E

However, as world champion he qualified automatically for every tournament in the season as the number two <b>seed</b> (<b>and</b> number one seed for the 2006 World Championship). He was invited {{to play in the}} Premier League Snooker, a non-ranking tournament with a 25-a-second shot clock, but he went out in the round-robin stage.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: Evaluate {{the effect}} of {{planting}} herb or vegetable <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> seedlings on the household availability {{of fruits and vegetables}} through an intervention study combining various actions (educational practices, home visits, <b>and</b> distribution of <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> seedlings) for the promotion of fruit and vegetable consumption in multiple settings. Methods: Data from 70 families were analyzed. Using the stratified sampling technique, the participant families were selected from a stratum within a population of 1, 743 families living in three low-income communities in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Three post-intervention groups were formed and compared: families that did not receive the <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> seedlings during the intervention; families that received but did not plant the <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> seedlings; families that received <b>and</b> planted the <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> seedlings. Results: Among the families that did not grow their own fruits and vegetables before the intervention, those that received <b>and</b> planted the <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> seedlings achieved an increase in household availability of fruits and vegetables (Δ=+ 5. 8 percentage points) up to three times higher (p< 0. 05) than that achieved by the families who did not receive the <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> seedlings (Δ=+ 1. 8 5 percentage points) and those that received but did not plant them (Δ=+ 2. 3 percentage points). As for the families that grew their own fruits and vegetables before the intervention, the comparison between those that did not receive the <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> seedlings, those that received and planted them, and those that received but did not plant them showed no differences in the household availability of fruits and vegetables. Conclusion: The planting of the <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> seedlings that they received by the families that did not grow their own fruits and vegetables before the intervention contributed to {{a significant increase in the}} household availability of fruits and vegetables...|$|R
30|$|<b>Seeds</b> <b>and</b> starch {{samples were}} visualized with a SEM {{according}} to the previously published method of Fujita et al. (2003). Gold-coated <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> starch samples were observed using a SUPRA 55 VP Scanning Electron Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).|$|R
5|$|Propagation both by <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> {{cuttings}} is difficult, reducing {{potential production}} by plant nurseries. Germination rates of soil-stored seeds {{have been found}} to increase substantially with the application of heat and aqueous solutions of smoke. The most satisfactory results from cuttings can be achieved by using tip growth, taken six weeks after the cessation of flowering, and kept under a fogging system for twenty weeks. Plantsman Neil Marriott recommends semi-hardened cutting material taken in spring and autumn. Roots of cuttings are brittle and easily damaged.|$|E
5|$|Since {{producers}} {{search for}} food and scroungers wait for opportunities to join, prey crypsis imposes a producer specific cost that shifts the producer scrounger equilibria towards more scrounging. Prey crypsis resulted in increased latency to eat the <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> increased number of detection errors. Moreover, {{the presence of a}} competitor negatively affected foraging efficiency under cyptic backgrounds. The foraging efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with a competitor on cryptic seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed. Thus, the costs of foraging on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers.|$|E
5|$|The 2015–16 season saw Kevin McHale {{fired after}} a bad start where the team only won 4 {{of its first}} 11 games, and {{assistant}} J. B. Bickerstaff took over coaching duties.
