500|$|During {{the writing}} process, the [...] "Yoda" [...] {{character}} gradually became younger. Taylor later explained {{that this was}} not a specific decision but instead <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> occurred naturally. Casting director Ron Surma contacted agents of a few well known actors in the hope that they could get a notable actor to portray the character, now named Arturis. One of those actors who were not required to audition was Ray Wise, as he had previously appeared in the [...] episode [...] "Who Watches the Watchers". Meanwhile, Taylor and Braga auditioned over 50 unknown actors. The crew hoped to get a classically trained actor, as they wanted to ensure that they did not show any 20th-century mannerisms in the portrayal of a futuristic character.|$|E

500|$|Almost {{immediately}} Sholes {{discovered a}} problem while recording Presley. RCA Victor had always insisted their performers stay still as they sang so the microphone {{would pick up}} the vocals; even the slightest tilt of the head would result in missing sound. Sholes had told Presley to stand on a painted X on the floor, telling him [...] "Whatever you do, don't move". During the recording of [...] "I Got a Woman", Sholes noticed that Presley's voice and guitar were not always being {{picked up by the}} microphone. Presley explained to Sholes that he had to [...] "jump around to sing it right. It's <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> happens—just a part of the way I sing". Sholes arranged for the whole studio to be re-miked so that Presley's voice and guitar could be picked up from anywhere in the studio, and recording continued.|$|E

MTV General Manager Stephen Friedman stated [...] "his is not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> came together—we've been in talks with [...] for a while... We felt there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message." [...] She worked with several world-renowned choreographers, including Dave Scott, Cris Judd, Brian Friedman, Wade Robson, Tyce Diorio, Travis Payne, Jeri Slaughter, Laurie Ann Gibson, Mia Michaels and Tina Landon, with her personal creative director, Gil Duldulao, coordinating the performance. Gil Kaufman of MTV commented [...] "earing a black-and-white, skintight leather dress with matching pants, Janet busted some of her and Michael's signature moves, flawlessly re-creating her late brother's steps as they were projected on the screen behind her." [...] Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly commented, [...] "she worked that stage harder than an underpaid assistant doin’ overtime, and as tributes go, this was as energetic as it was heartfelt." ...|$|E
500|$|Singer James Brown guest {{stars as}} himself. Brown makes an {{appearance}} at the [...] "Do What You Feel" [...] festival, during which he sings his 1965 song [...] "I Got You (I Feel Good)". After a bandstand collapses, he proclaims [...] "Hey, wait a minute, hold on here! This bandstand wasn't double-bolted!" [...] He described the experience as [...] "good, clean, and humorous. And we need more of that around." [...] According to Mirkin, the writers like to give guest stars awkward lines which then sound funny coming from them. They knew Brown would not be [...] "the greatest actor in the world" [...] but still [...] "gave him these incredibly hilarious, stiff lines that killed." [...] Mirkin described Brown's line as [...] "horrible" [...] but because of Brown's reading, [...] "you have <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> sounds perfectly wrong {{and it makes it}} funny." [...] In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes James Brown's performance as [...] "hilariously over-the-top" [...] and uses it {{as an example of how}} the early seasons of the show would include celebrity cameos and not point out the [...] "enormity of their fame".|$|E

500|$|At the BFI London Film Festival, Nagy {{said she}} titled the film Carol, not The Price of Salt, because Highsmith herself {{had changed the}} title to Carol when the novel was republished, and she also [...] "liked the sort of strange, obsessive nature of calling it by someone's name." [...] There were later other discussions with Haynes. Haynes said that the film is called Carol because the novel [...] "is locked into the {{subjectivity}} of the younger woman" [...] and Carol is [...] "really the object of desire in the story." [...] "There's an element of, something aloof ... something unsettled about , that puts Therese and these new feelings ... on edge {{throughout much of the}} film. That relationship of who's the object and who's the subject does shift in the story, but it made sense ultimately that that would be the name for the film." [...] On the universal theme of the story, Haynes said [...] "the real determining question is not whether society will accept [...] feelings or not; it's, will this person return her love or not? ... That is what transcends the class of love, or the period in which it's occurring, and makes it <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> humbles us all and levels us all in the throes of those experiences that most of us have." ...|$|E
500|$|Murdock {{begins the}} season {{wearing a black}} costume (called the [...] "vigilante outfit" [...] by production), {{inspired}} by the one worn by the character in Frank Miller's The Man Without Fear, rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops. Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications. On the design process, DeKnight revealed that [...] "we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented {{with a lot of}} different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> felt right." [...] DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the [...] "real-world" [...] of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit. Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to [...] "look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store." [...] Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that [...] "really conform to his head" [...] but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.|$|E
500|$|After various failed relationships, Lex finally {{believes}} he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang. In [...] "Hypnotic", {{in an effort to}} stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drives Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons. Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years, but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on—he succeeded. When Clark and Lana's relationship crumbled, because of Clark's deceit, Lex was waiting. Rosenbaum believes that Lana was [...] "tired of the boy and wanted a man around". By contrast, Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship [...] "turned into much more". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because [...] "she knows she will never really love him." [...] Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in [...] "Void", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex. Kreuk feels that if Lex had chosen a different path after the events of [...] "Lexmas", then Lana {{would have been able to}} truly love him.|$|E

500|$|The {{beginning}} of season five saw, for the first time, Clark and Lana in a happy relationship together, one that was void of dishonesty and secrets. The return of Clark's powers in [...] "Hidden", {{as well as the}} secrets and lies that accompany them, caused stress on their relationship. In the series' 100th episode, Clark finally took a chance and told Lana the truth. When it resulted, indirectly, in her death and he was allowed to live the day over again Clark chose not to tell her his secret. In [...] "Hypnotic", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drove Lana into Lex's arms.

2500|$|For scenes where Peyton {{is drawing}} or painting, Ward stated, [...] "...there {{would likely be}} very light lines for her to follow. Often I would give a {{finished}} version and an unfinished for this purpose. If I remember correctly, it was usually the words that I left undone." [...] Regarding the evolution of Peyton's artwork over the years, she said, [...] "I {{look back at the}} first season and think the drawings are awful! I certainly became more comfortable working in her style, but I think her style also evolved to fit mine. Does that make sense?" [...] Ward clarified, [...] "Initially I was trying to do <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> didn’t flow well from me. The drawings were too clean. A little forced and not at all the way I liked to work." [...] Ward said that as the show progressed, she began to put more of my own style in them, and became more comfortable and the work got better. In Season 3, the artwork was promoted through the album Friends with Benefit. In Season 6, it is seen in color instead of in black and white, to reflect the character's happiness.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 August 2008, George Friedman, US {{military}} analyst, and a CEO of a US-based think-tank Stratfor, {{wrote in}} the institution's report: [...] "There had {{been a great deal}} of shelling by the South Ossetians of Georgian villages for the previous three nights, but while possibly more intense than usual, artillery exchanges were routine. [...] It is very difficult to imagine that the Georgians launched their attack against U.S. wishes. The Georgians rely on the United States, and they were in no position to defy it. [...] the United States either was unaware of the existence of Russian forces, or knew of the Russian forces but -- along with the Georgians -- miscalculated Russia's intentions. [...] Putin did not want to re-establish the Soviet Union, but he did want to re-establish the Russian sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union region. [...] He did not want to confront NATO directly, but he did want to confront and defeat a power that was closely aligned with the United States, had U.S. support, aid and advisers and was widely seen as being under American protection. Georgia was the perfect choice. [...] The war in Georgia, therefore, is Russia's public return to great power status. This is not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> happened — it has been unfolding ever since Putin took power, and with growing intensity in the past five years." ...|$|E
