In recent years, many improvements and variations have been proposed for deep sequence models in general, and LSTMs in particular. We propose and analyze a series of augmentations and modifications to LSTM networks resulting in improved performance for text classification datasets.

40|$|In practice, {{feedback}} control design {{consists of three}} steps: modelling, model reduction and controller design for the reduced model. Systems with flow are often complicated, and there is yet no standard algorithm that integrates these steps. In this thesis we make a modest effort by considering two applications: climate control for food storage, and UV disinfection of fluids. The goal is twofold. First, {{the aim is to}} come to a controller design that is practically relevant. The controller has to easy implementable and of high quality. Second, we try to retain as much physical information from the system as possible. The advantage of a controller that contains physical information lies in the time saving when designing the system and the controller simultaneously. For the food storage room a realistic but relatively simple model is derived. This model is validated and calibrated by experimental results. The factors that {{stand in the way of}} standard model reduction and controller design, are air flow and the input that is not continuous, but switches between two values. Via a combination of standard model reduction techniques (Pad approximation, linearization, timescale decomposition) the system is reduced to a first order linear system with the switching time as input. For this, a <b>simple</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> controller is designed. The controller is tested successfully on the basic model. The system dynamics is parameterized by the physical properties of the system, which can give great numerical advantages for the system design. For a UV disinfection reactor a realistic basic model is derived. The factors that stand in the way of standard model reduction and controller design, are flow, nonlinear input, and the extremely large state space that is needed for an accurate discretisation. Via a combination of standard model reduction techniques (Pad approximation, linearization, input/output balancing) the system is reduced to a first order linear system. For this, a <b>simple</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> controller is designed. The controller is tested successfully on the basic model. A drawback is that the input/output balancing does not retain any physical system information. Further, the model describes a very specific case. As an alternative, a modelling technique is designed that uses the measured residence time distribution. The advantage here is that the resulting model is linear and suited for practical controller design. Moreover, the model is automatically calibrated to the experimental data that it is based on. The drawback is that the model does not hold any physical system information...|$|E
40|$|Clustering of a {{data set}} {{can be done}} by the {{well-known}} Pairwise Nearest Neighbor (PNN) algorithm. The algorithm is conceptionally very <b>simple</b> <b>and</b> gives <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> solutions. A drawback of the method is the relatively large running time of the original (exact) implementation. Recently, an efficient version of the exact PNN algorithm has been introduced in literature. In this paper we give a faster implementation of this algorithm. The idea is to postpone the updating of the nearest neighbor information {{in order to reduce the}} number of cluster distance calculations. Correctness of the algorithm follows from the monotony of the cluster distances. Practical tests show that the new organization of the algorithm decreases the running time of PNN by ca. 35 per cent...|$|R

40|$|Large convex aspheres are {{notoriously}} difficult to fabricate {{because of the}} tremendous cost and difficulty of making accurate measurements of the optical surfaces. The new 6. 5 -and 8 -rn-class telescopes require convex secondary mirrors that are larger, more aspheric, and more accurately figured than those for existing telescopes. Two powerful measurement techniques have been implemented at the Mirror Lab and demonstrated to be accurate and economical. The polished surfaces are interferometrically measured using holographic test plates. This measurement technique uses full-aperture test plates with computer-generated holograms (CGH) fabricated onto spherical reference surfaces. When supported a few millimeters from the secondary and properly illuminated with laser light, an interference pattern is formed that shows the secondary surface errors. The hologram consists of annu-lar rings of metal drawn onto the curved test plate surface using a custom-built writing machine. This test has been implemented for secondaries up to 1. 15 -m diameter, with 4 nm mis surface measurement accuracy. In addition to this test, a swing arm profilometer was built to measure the rough surface during aspherization and loose abrasive grinding. The machine uses <b>simple</b> motions <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> components to achieve 50 nm mis measurement accuracy over 1. 8 -m mirrors...|$|R
40|$|Yttria-stabilized {{zirconia}} (YSZ) {{has been}} used as a thermal/environmental barrier coating for gas turbine engine blades. Current methods of fabrication include air plasma spraying (APS) and electron-beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD). The APS technique results in a coating that loses effectiveness with thermal cycling. The EB-PVD technique deposits a columnar microstructure which accommodates thermal expansion mismatch, but the process is capital intensive and also line-of-sight. A technique currently being investigated is chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which can reduce the need for costly capital equipment, is <b>simpler,</b> <b>and</b> can deposit <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> coatings on hidden surfaces. Further, CVD coatings can act also as a top coat to seal an EB-PVD coating from ingress of damaging salts from the combustion environment. In our continuing work, YSZ has been successfully deposited on α-Al 2 O 3 and the turbine blade material (Mar-M 247) with reasonable agreement between modeled and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{integrated}} planning {{of production and}} distribution for a pulp company is considered. The tactical decisions included regard transportation of raw materials from harvest areas to pulp mills; production mix and contents at pulp mills; inventory; distribution of pulp products from mills to customers and the selection of potential orders and their levels at customers. The planning period is one year and several time periods are included. As a solution approach we make use of two different heuristic approaches. The main reason to use heuristics {{is the need for}} quick solution times. The first heuristic is based on a rolling planning horizon where iteratively a fixed number of time periods is taken into consideration. The second heuristic is based on Lagrangian decomposition and subgradient optimization. This provides optimistic bounds of the optimal objective function value that are better than the LP relaxation value, which {{can be used as a}} measure of the heuristic (pessimistic) solution quality. In addition, we apply the proposed rolling horizon heuristic in each iteration of the subgradient optimization. A number of cases based on real data is analysed which shows that the proposed solution approach is <b>simple</b> <b>and</b> provides <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> solutions.

40|$|Abstract [...] In this Reactive power {{optimization}} is a nonlinear, multi-variable, multi-constrained programming problem, {{which makes}} the optimization process multifaceted. In this paper, based {{on the characteristics of}} reactive power optimization, a mathematical model of reactive power optimization, including comprehensive concern of the practical constraints and reactive power regulation means for optimization, is established. Reactive Power reduces power system losses by adjusting the reactive power control variables such as transformer tap-settings, generator voltages and other sources of reactive power such as capacitor banks. Reactive Power provides better system voltage control resulting in improved voltage profiles, system security, power transfer capability and overall system operation. Also Differential Evolution (DE) Algorithm has been studied, and the technique based on improved DE Algorithm for reactive power is going to be taken in this paper Optimization for the IEEE 14 -bus and IEEE 57 bus system proves that the improved DE algorithm used for reactive power optimization is valuable. The algorithm is <b>simple,</b> convergent <b>and</b> of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> for optimization, <b>and</b> thus appropriate for solving reactive power optimization problems, with some application view...|$|R
40|$|Proyecto Final de Graduación (Bachillerato en Ingeniería en Biotecnología). Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Biología, 2010. The use of biogas as an {{alternative}} energy source is being limited {{by the need to}} remove certain gases which reduce the combustion potential of methane present in biogas. Among these gases, H 2 S can lead to corrosion problems which restricts biogas from being compressed and stored. On the other hand, CO 2 is not a combustible gas, therefore it reduces the calorific value of biogas. The aim of this reasearch project was to build and put into function a small-scale purification system for biogas at the ITCR, which was <b>simple</b> <b>and</b> would generate <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> CH 4. The system established consisted of a biological desulfurisation process to reduce the concentration of H 2 S, and a scrubber for the chemical absorption of CO 2 using NaOH. In order to evaluate the purification system´s efficiency, the composition of the biogas treated was analyzed before and after the purification processes took place. For the biological desulfuration of biogas, a tank was designed to hold a liquid phase consisting of a culture of the aerobic bacteria A. thiooxidans y S. novella capable of sulphur oxidation, so that in presence of air, H 2 S would be consumed by the bacteria when biogas passed through the tank. Among the design parameters for the tank, a retention time of 1 hour was established and also the air introduced in the tank did not exceed 5 % of the volume of biogas in it. The tank design and the bacteria allowed a 56 % removal rate of H 2 S from biogas. Meanwhile the absorption scrubber was adapted to one of the experimental biodigesters at the ITCR, in order to remove CO 2 from the biogas produced. The scrubber constructed was packed and allowed a counter-current absorption process, using NaOH 2. 5 M as the absorbent. Certain problems with the design and functioning of the column, the introduction of uncompressed biogas with a small flow rate and a very concentrated absorbent, were possible reasons why this process was not an efficient method for the purification of biogas, since the expected increase in the percentage of CH 4 in the biogas did not occur.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to analyse meat and fat quality traits using {{quantitative}} genetic methods. This study has demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to establish <b>simple</b> laboratory practices <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> rapid analyses of meat and fat quality traits at a research abattoir. Developed multivariate calibration methods and Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data were used to predict many of the traits studied, and large-scale recordings provided the basis for the genetic analysis of the meat and fat quality traits. In addition, estimated genetic parameters of body composition traits from large-scale Computed tomography (CT) scan of live boars yielded new information about the growth of various body tissues. The results show that low labour, large-scale measuring methods can provide high heritabilities for several traits. The meat quality traits: pH in M. gluteus medius, M. gluteus profundus and M. longissimus dorsi and drip loss, meat colour and meat composition traits of M. longissimus dorsi showed heritabilities from 0. 12 to 0. 50 in Landrace and from 0. 22 to 0. 62 in Duroc. The fat quality traits: fatty acid composition, fat moisture content, and fat colour in subcutaneous fat showed heritabilities from 0. 06 to 0. 67 in Landrace and from 0. 01 to 0. 57 in Duroc. The CT traits: growth of muscle, fat, bone and internal organs showed heritabilities from 0. 19 to 0. 53 in Landrace and from 0. 43 to 0. 59 in Duroc. On the basis of the parameters estimated here, breeding for a higher lean meat percentage and lower feed convention ratio is expected to result in deterioration of meat and fat quality traits. In view of the genetic parameters and size of the heritabilities and genetic correlations, some new traits for meat, fat and carcass quality are recommended in the breeding programme for Norwegian Landrace and Duroc. Among the traits investigated, the traits of greatest importance are NIRS predicted intramuscular fat, drip loss, a* value in meat and NIRS-predicted moisture and fatty acids composition in subcutaneous fat. The percentage of oleic acid, C 18 : 1 n- 9, from the NIRS analysis is highly heritable and may improve technological quality, sensory properties and human health. A selection for L* value or reflectance in meat is discouraged due to the undesirable influence of the IMF in the measuring. CT scanning makes it possible to select directly for the growth rate of muscle, fat, bones and internal organs of live boars. Pig meat has many qualities important for human nutrition, and is a good source for essential minerals and nutrients, e. g. heme iron, protein with a good amino acid profile and good fatty acids. This study has demonstrated the possibilities of selecting for some of these component traits...|$|R
