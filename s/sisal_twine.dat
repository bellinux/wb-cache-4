2500|$|The Grandcamp was a {{recently}} re-activated 437-foot-long (133 m) Liberty ship. Originally named the SS Benjamin R. Curtis in Los Angeles in 1942, the ship {{served in the}} Pacific theatre and was mothballed in Philadelphia after World War II. In a Cold War gesture, the ship {{was assigned to the}} French Line to assist in the rebuilding of Europe. Along with ammonium nitrate—a very common cargo on the high seas—it was carrying small arms ammunition, machinery, and bales of <b>sisal</b> <b>twine</b> on the deck. Another ship in the harbor, the SS High Flyer, was docked about 600 feet (200 m) away from the SS Grandcamp. The High Flyer contained an additional [...] of ammonium nitrate and [...] of sulfur. The ammonium nitrate in the two ships and fertilizer in the adjacent warehouse {{was on its way to}} farmers in Europe. The Grandcamp had arrived from Houston, where the port authority did not permit loading of ammonium nitrate.|$|E

50|$|The {{tensile testing}} of the {{polypropylene}} and sisal twines {{was done with the}} aid of an Instron tensile testing machine using capstan grips in the Material Science Lab at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire. At the point of each type of twine’s ultimate tensile strength, it is apparent that polypropylene is a stronger material. With approximately an ultimate tensile strength of 270 MPa, it has more than 100% more tensile strength than that of <b>sisal</b> <b>twine</b> which has an ultimate tensile strength of 100 MPa. The two twines broke differently, however, as it {{can be seen in the}} two videos. Polypropylene twine had a straight break, where all of its fibers broke at once; this resulted in the straight line dropping to zero on the graph. The <b>sisal</b> <b>twine</b> broke in a different fashion. As the force load increased on the twine sample, individual fibers that were carrying the load broke and new ones became engaged. Thus was created the popping noises in the video; these properties directly correlate to the strength properties. Because all the fibers are engaged at once in polypropylene, it gives the twine high strength; the downside is that all the fibers break at once. Because only certain fibers in <b>sisal</b> <b>twine</b> carry the force of the load at one time, it doesn’t have as high of a strength as polypropylene twine. It does, however, allow the twine to stay intact much longer as each new fiber becomes engaged.|$|E

50|$|The {{peninsula}} has {{a considerable}} number of major archeological sites, including Chichén Itza, Uxmal, and the La Ruta Puuc, a series of small archeological sites. The state capital of Mérida was founded in the colonial era and experienced a major boom in the nineteenth century with the expansion for the market for its <b>sisal</b> cordage or <b>twine,</b> so that the city has a number of mansions of the former sisal barons. Campeche is Mexico's only walled city.|$|R
50|$|Sisal fibers {{are made}} of 65% cellulose, 12% Hemicellulose, 9.9% Lignin, and 2% Waxes. Sisal fibers can be {{available}} as plaid, herringbone, or twill. The fibers have good sound and impact absorbing properties. They have natural anti-static properties that do not trap dust or absorb moisture easily. The original plain color allows it to easily be dyed and allow for a large range of different color. <b>Sisal</b> <b>twine</b> is also naturally biodegradable.|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} {{her studies}} in Aubusson, Adams returned to New York in 1956. She brought a tapestry loom from Aubusson to weave her own designs, but her practice began {{to depart from}} traditional tapestry technique. Working on what conventionally had been {{the back of the}} tapestry, she developed surface articulation and added materials like rope, <b>sisal</b> <b>twine,</b> and found objects to the traditional wool and cotton surface. She and other innovators, like Lenore Tawney, Claire Zeisler and Sheila Hicks, moved weaving off the loom and into the realm of three-dimensional form. Her work was part of the influential “Woven Forms” exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in 1963.|$|E
50|$|Madrazo Tecoh Project saw Pardo {{renovate}} {{a ruined}} estate an hour out of Mérida, Mexico. The site was originally a farm and factory for manufacturing <b>sisal</b> <b>twine,</b> reaching its apex of productivity in the 1920s and ‘30s. The estate gradually went into disrepair {{in the postwar}} years, following the introduction of synthetic fibers. Pardo’s refurbishment is founded on the history and aesthetic of the site, calling on local craftspeople for construction assistance. Like 4166 Sea View Lane, Pardo meticulously designed {{every aspect of the}} building’s structure and interior elements. “Every element in Tecoh is laboriously thought over by being designed and redesigned, the formalism of the near-cubist angular surfaces further reinforcing not only the “irregular topography”, but also the ongoing conversation so crucial to Pardo’s work.”. The catalogue for this project consisted of a book of photographs of the site, where Pardo superimposed glowing color fields.|$|E
