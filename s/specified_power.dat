25|$|Power supply {{imperfections}} (e.g., {{power signal}} ripple, non-zero source impedance) {{may lead to}} noticeable deviations from ideal operational amplifier behavior. For example, operational amplifiers have a <b>specified</b> <b>power</b> supply rejection ratio that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on the power supply inputs. Power supply inputs are often noisy in large designs because the power supply is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once. As a consequence, when a component requires large injections of current (e.g., a digital component that is frequently switching from one state to another), nearby components can experience sagging at their connection to the power supply. This problem can be mitigated with appropriate use of bypass capacitors connected across each power supply pin and ground. When bursts of current are required by a component, the component can bypass the power supply by receiving the current directly from the nearby capacitor (which is then slowly recharged by the power supply).|$|E

50|$|The {{class was}} well liked by the railway unions as NZR had {{worked closely with}} them in the design phase of the EW class. This led to the cabs being laid out in an {{ergonomic}} fashion which made them easy to operate, making them a favourite of the unions. They were also fairly reliable, and were also capable of generating twice their <b>specified</b> <b>power</b> output as evidenced by an NZR engineer during a test in the 1960s when EW 1806 produced a power output of 3,600 hp.|$|E

50|$|The {{layout of}} the engine was {{completed}} by 15 August 1939 and the engineering drawing by 15 October. The first prototype began bench tests on 29 November 1939. A total of five prototypes were built in 1939 and another five in 1940. They could not reach the engine's <b>specified</b> <b>power</b> output and suffered from broken crankshafts, pinion shafts and crankcase covers. Production had been planned to begin in 1941, but this was postponed while further development work continued. More prototypes were built between 1941 and 1943 and the engine began its state acceptance tests in December 1943. It failed the tests and was cancelled in early 1944.|$|E

Most of the powers granted to the federal parliament can also be exercised by the state parliaments, though because of section 109 of the Australian Constitution federal laws will prevail in case of inconsistency.

5000|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) {{had several}} {{improvements}} to enhance reliability and power. This explains {{phrases such as}} [...] "Main engines throttling up to 104 percent." [...] This did not mean the engines were being run over a safe limit. The 100 percent figure was the original <b>specified</b> <b>power</b> level. During the lengthy development program, Rocketdyne determined the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104 percent of the originally specified thrust. NASA could have rescaled the output number, saying in essence 104 percent is now 100 percent. To clarify this would have required revising much previous documentation and software, so the 104 percent number was retained. SSME upgrades were denoted as [...] "block numbers", such as block I, block II, and block IIA. The upgrades improved engine reliability, maintainability and performance. The 109% thrust level was finally reached in flight hardware with the Block II engines in 2001. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106 percent or 109 percent used for mission aborts.|$|E

After 9 March bombing altitudes rarely exceeded 20,000 feet, reducing the amount of climb required to assemble and further conserving fuel and engine life.
