Researches showed, that that way we can produce data, that are used by meteorologists for weather observation and weather forecasts. With the experiment, we checked, whether there is a connection/correlation between zenith wet delay, estimated with GNSS gathered data and meteorological data of presence of water vapor. The distribution of water vapor is closely connected to the distribution of clouds and rainfall. First, we compared graphical presentation of data on distribution of water vapor, collected with GNSS on the area of Slovenia, with the rainfall radar picture. It proved that we can't compare those data and that the connection between water vapor and rainfalls is not that simple. Then we also compared GNSS observation of water vapor with meteorological calculation of water vapor density. Results of statistical analysis showed, that there is a middle to strong connection between both types of data. Results of the researches and analysis that were done abroad show, that GNSS analysis of presence of water vapor, along with cooperation of experts from both, geodesy and meteorology, could maybe become useful as a replacement tool for meteorological observations, or at least an improvement or completion of them. ...|$|R

Among them it was selected the techniques of visual and automatic interpretation of <b>sattelite</b> data. One <b>sattelite</b> image is a composition of patterns which are indicators of things and events related to the physical, biological and cultural conditions of the land occupation. The type and the amount of information which one can extract from an image are proportional to the knowledge, experience, hability and dedication to the work of the analyst-interpreter responsible for one particular area. The map legend shows the subject matter and indicates the analyst's point of view in defining the nature of work. Besides that the legend orients the photo-interpreter in his work giving uniformity in the identification of the homogeneity of the land utilization in the studied area. Due to the experience obtained in the surveys carried on in the Distrito Federal and in the States of Paraná, Santa Catarina, and São Paulo the Crop Forecasting Project developed an improved procedure of constructing a map legend. The analysis and the study of the correlation between visual interpretation, field information and statistical data have been used as subsidies in the pattern definition during this phase of the work giving the conditions for regrouping or subdividing the legend before the final definition.
