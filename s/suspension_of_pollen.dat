40|$|Assessing the environmental, health, {{and climate}} impacts of bioaerosols {{requires}} {{knowledge of their}} size and abundance. These two properties were assessed through daily measurements of chemical tracers for pollens (sucrose, fructose, and glucose), fungal spores (mannitol and glucans), and Gram-negative bacterial endotoxins in two particulate matter (PM) size modes: fine particles (  75  %), as expected for particles greater than 2. 5  µm. Rainfall on 2  May corresponded to maximum atmospheric pollen tracer levels and a redistribution <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> tracers to the fine PM fraction (>  80  %). Both changes were attributed to the osmotic rupture <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> grains {{that led to the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> fine-sized <b>pollen</b> fragments. Fungal spore tracers peaked in concentration following spring rain events and decreased in particle size, but to a lesser extent than pollens. A short, heavy thunderstorm in late summer corresponded to an increase in endotoxin and glucose levels, with a simultaneous shift to smaller particle sizes. Simultaneous increase in bioaerosol levels and decrease in their size have significant implications for population exposures to bioaerosols, particularly during rain events. Chemical mass balance (CMB) source apportionment modeling and regionally specific pollen profiles were used to apportion PM mass to pollens and fungal spores. Springtime pollen contributions to the mass of particles <  10  µm (PM 10) ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 8  µg m − 3 (0. 2 – 38  %, averaging 4  %), with maxima occurring on rainy days. Fungal spore contributions to PM 10 mass ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 5  µg m − 3 (0. 8 – 17  %, averaging 5  %), with maxima occurring after rain. Overall, this study defines changes to the fine- and coarse-mode distribution of PM, pollens, fungal spores, and endotoxins in response to rain in the Midwestern United States and advances the ability to apportion PM mass to pollens...|$|R

40|$|Wild-type petunia pollen accumulates {{high levels}} of {{flavonol}} 3 -O-glycosides. Pollen from conditionally male-fertile petunia has no flavonols and is unable to germinate. Pollen function is restored both in vivo and in vitro by providing flavonol aglycones, but not flavonol glycosides, to the pollen. In the present study, incubation of an in vitro <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> conditionally male-fertile <b>pollen</b> with kaempferol or quercetin resulted in the accumulation of kaempferol and quercetin 3 -O-glycosides in the pollen. We identified two glycosyltransferase activities associated with the intact pollen grain that catalyze {{the formation of a}} gametophyte-specific class of flavonol glycosides. Feeding studies showed that product formation was highly specific for flavonols with an unsubstituted 3 -hydroxyl group and was not dependent on an external source of UDP-hexose. Ultraviolet spectral analysis, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance, and 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance identified the products as kaempferol and quercetin 3 -O-(2 "- O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl) -beta-D-galactopyranoside, identical with the flavonol 3 -O-glycosides present in wild-type pollen. The sugars are linked in a 1 [...] > 2 configuration that results in a pollen-specific class of compounds. To retain both glycosyltransferase activities in a cell-free extract, it was necessary to add triton X- 100, suggesting that {{one or both of the}} proteins may be associated with a pollen membrane.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect <b>of</b> DPP <b>suspension</b> and extract on APH-induced rats. Methods APH was induced in adult castrated Wistar rats by both s. c. injection of testosterone (0. 5 mg/rat/day) and smearing citral on shaved skin once every 3 days for 30 days. Saw palmetto (100 mg/kg), DPP suspension (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg), and lyophilized DPP extract (150, 300 and 600 mg/kg) were given orally daily for 30 days. All medications were started 7 days after castration and along with testosterone and citral. Results The histopathological feature in APH-induced prostate rats showed evidence of hyperplasia and inflammation. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the expressions of IL- 6, IL- 8, TNF-α, IGF- 1 and clusterin were increased, while the expression of TGF-β 1 was decreased that correlates with presence of inflammation. Moreover, histopathological examination revealed increased cellular proliferation and reduced apoptosis in ventral prostate. Both saw palmetto and DPP treatment has ameliorated these histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in APH-induced rats. These improvements were not associated with reduction in the prostatic weight that may be attributed to the persistence of edema. Conclusion DPP may have a potential protective effect in APH-induced Wistar rats through modulation of cytokine expression and/or upregulation of their autocrine/paracrine receptors. </p...|$|R

Grains viability was estimated by using three different techniques: acetic carmine, fluorescein diacetate and germination. The three techniques obtained statistically different data, with acetic carmine always showing the highest values but staining also heat-killed pollen grains. Fluorescein diacetate and germination were significantly correlated with a high R 2 (0. 862). The number <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> grains significantly varied among the cultivars and between the two years. The average number <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> grains per anther ranged from 65, 722 ('Ascolana Tenera') up to 97, 160 ('Cazzinicchio'). A significant difference was detected between the two years for the number <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> grains per anther, ranging from 98, 037 in 2006 ('on' year) down to 70, 630 in 2007 ('off' year). The study also showed that the viability (with all the techniques) <b>of</b> the <b>pollen</b> grains was significantly higher in the 'off' year {{with respect to the}} 'on' one, with important consequences on the fertilization process...|$|R
