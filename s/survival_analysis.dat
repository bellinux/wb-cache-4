25|$|In 2012, {{the flow}} cytometry {{community}} {{has started to}} release a set of publicly available datasets. A subset of these datasets representing the existing data analysis challenges is described below. For comparison against manual gating, the FlowCAP-I project has released five datasets, manually gated by human analysts, {{and two of them}} gated by eight independent analysts. The FlowCAP-II project included three datasets for binary classification and also reported several algorithms that were able to classify these samples perfectly. FlowCAP-III included two larger datasets for comparison against manual gates as well as one more challenging sample classification dataset. As of March 2013, public release of FlowCAP-III was still in progress. The datasets used in FlowCAP-I, II, and III either have a low number of subjects or parameters. However, recently several more complex clinical datasets have been released including a dataset of 466 HIV-infected subjects, which provides both 14 parameter assays and sufficient clinical information for <b>survival</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Neurodevelopmental Disorders is {{the failure}} to achieve proper {{neurologic}} functional capabilities. One {{of the causes of}} Neurodevelopmental Disorders is neonatal encephalopathy caused by neonatal asphyxia which carries a high morbidity and mortality. To date, however, there is no study on early detection of Neurodevelopmental Disorders in children with neonatal encephalopathy caused by neonatal asphyxia. Objective: To evaluate the effect of neonatal encephalopathy caused by neonatal asphyxia on the incidence of Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Method: A prospective cohort study to assess Neurodevelopmental Disorders using Bayley Infant Developmental Screener. Subjects were 40 babies, including 20 with neonatal encephalopathy caused by neonatal asphyxia and 20 with neonatal asphyxia admitted to NICU and High Risk Baby Care Unit of Dr Kariadi Hospital, Semarang, during August 2006 – June 2007. Hypothesis was tested by Chi-square test, RR > 2 was stated as the risk factor. Onset of Neurodevelopmental disorders was determined by Kaplan-Meier <b>survival’s</b> <b>analysis,</b> and the interval between the occurrence of Neurodevelopmental Disorders and neonatal encephalopathy caused by neonatal asphyxia was assessed by log-rank test.
