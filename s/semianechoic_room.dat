40|$|General {{recommendations}} are given concerning the equivalence of {{radiated immunity testing}} results obtained experimentally in a <b>semianechoic</b> <b>room</b> (SAR) and a reverberation chamber (RC). The relation between the parameters influencing the results, i. e., the number of aspect angles in an SAR {{and the number of}} tuner steps in an RC has been inventoried in an extensive experimental campaign and is discussed in detail. To that purpose, an innovating canonical equipment under test), designed as a common reference equipment for standardized testing in both environments, has been constructed. The RC was equipped with two different and innovative tuning systems. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{reduction}} of tonal noise annoyance from axial flow rotors is presented {{which is based on}} the uneven circumferential blade spacing. After a short description of the basic theory of the tonal noise generation from turbomachinery bladings, the existing methods for the circumferential spacing choice are analyzed and their practical drawbacks pointed out. A new systematic approach is presented in which a large number of balanced geometries are generated and then evaluated by means of an arbitrary objective function. To test the method, several objective functions have been calculated and the effect of the main parameters has been analyzed. Finally an optimized rotor representative of automotive applications has been realized and tested in the Johnson Electric- GATE <b>semianechoic</b> <b>room</b> in presence of a strong upstream velocity perturbation. The resulting acoustic pressure power spectra have been compared with those of an evenly spaced rotor equipped with the same blades, thus allowing for estimating the interference function of the unevenly spaced rotor. The good agreement with the theoretically expected trend proves that even in presence of strong velocity perturbation the obtained acoustic pressure power spectrum changes according to the theory which may thus be employed...|$|E
40|$|This paper mainly {{focuses on}} the representable problem of Φ-OTDR {{distributed}} vibration signals. The research included a signal extraction part and a signal representation part. Firstly, in order to extract the better Φ-OTDR signal, the time-domain data should be fully preserved. The 2 D-TESP method is used to extract data in this paper. There are 29 characters in the traditional TESP method. The characters’ number is reduced from 29 to 13 and the characters’ dimension is expanded from 1 to 2 in the 2 D-TESP method. Secondly, in order to represent Φ-OTDR signal better, the characteristics of Φ-OTDR data and damped vibration signals are combined in the paper. The EMD method and the NMF method are combined to form the new method in the paper. Some parameters in the proposed method are optimized and adjusted by GA method. After Φ-OTDR data {{is represented by the}} proposed method, there is excellent performance both on the length dimension and on the time dimension. Lastly, some experiments are carried out according to the physical truth in this paper. The experiments are carried out in the <b>semianechoic</b> <b>room.</b> The methods of the paper have better performance. The methods are proved to be effective through these experiments...|$|E
