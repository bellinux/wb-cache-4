40|$|Resume - <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Certificates</b> for Medicinal Products Nowadays, the {{pharmaceutical}} industry {{plays an important role}} in the world's economy and {{the pharmaceutical}} research has a decisive impact on the continuing improvement in public health. The system of patent law is of cardinal significance to the industry because it confers monopolies, for a limited period of time, on using innovations and provides a crucial incentive for basic research activities. Innovative companies require the guaranteed period of market exclusivity afforded by patents in order to sustain drug prices, recoup research and development expenditures and finance the development of new products. Although the availability of a patent protection for chemical and pharmaceutical products has, from a historical perspective, only been reaffirmed in the near past, it has been widely accepted as a global standard mainly through the provisions of the WTO's TRIPS agreement. On the other hand, despite the existence of various international treaties harmonising patent laws, patents have to date in their effects remained strictly limited to individual jurisdictions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the areas of}} patent law and copyright law {{in the context of}} Britain’s exit from the European Union, or “Brexit. ” Although neither area of intellectual property (IP) is fully harmonized, the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could nonetheless have a sizable impact on both sets of rights.

40|$|From the Introduction. Regulation 1768 / 921 created <b>supplementary</b> <b>protection</b> <b>certificates</b> (hereinafter, ‘SPCs’) for {{medicinal}} products (hereinafter, “pharmaceuticals”) protected by patents. SPCs afford the same exclusive rights as those conferred by patents once these expire {{and may be}} granted for a maximum of five years. 2 Italy enacted similar legislation in 1991, the most salient difference between both texts being that, pursuant to Law No. 349 / 91, 3 holders of Italian patents for pharmaceuticals could be granted supplementary protection for a maximum period of 18 years after the expiration of the patent. Following the enactment of Regulation 1768 / 92, SPCs granted by the Italian authorities were brought {{in line with the}} period provided for in that text. However, pharmaceuticals for which supplementary protection was sought in the lapse between the adoption of Law No. 349 / 91 and Regulation 1768 / 92 (around 400 products) continued to enjoy the protection provided for in the former text. 4 Several steps were taken by the Italian authorities to progressively reduce the length of protection granted to these products...|$|E
30|$|Another {{possibility}} {{to extend the}} market exclusivity by pursuing legal avenues is provided through obtaining of <b>supplementary</b> <b>protection</b> <b>certificates</b> (SPCs). SPCs are an additional protective mechanism introduced by EU {{to serve as an}} extension to the patent right (Hitchcock and Tugal 2003). For the pharmaceutical sector, SPCs can be issued to compensate the efforts put into research and development and the elapsed period between the patent filing and obtaining market authorization to place the approved drug on the market. SPCs extend the effective protection of products already on the market by a maximum of 5  years upon patent expiry. However, the protection granted through SPC can be legally challenged and declared as invalid. A similar practice has been adopted by US and Japan under the name of “patent term restoration” in the 1980 s. In US, the innovator-companies can apply for up to five additional years of patent protection for the new drug {{to make up for the}} time lost while the product was subject to the FDA’s regulatory review (Title II of the Hatch–Waxman Act) (Agrawal and Thakkar 1997). Building on this legislation, brand owners can file a patent infringement suit, after an ANDA with paragraph IV certification is filed by a generic manufacturer. 4 The FDA cannot approve the ANDA until the court decision, thereby leading up to 30  months extension of market exclusivity (Bhat 2005).|$|E
50|$|The EPC {{requires}} all jurisdictions {{to give a}} European patent a term of 20 {{years from}} the filing date, the filing date being the actual date of filing an application for a European patent or the date of filing of an international application under the PCT designating the EPO. The filing date {{is not necessarily the}} priority date, which can be up to one year earlier. The term of a granted European patent may be extended under national law if national law provides term extension to compensate for pre-marketing regulatory approval. For EEA member states this is by means of a <b>supplementary</b> <b>protection</b> <b>certificate.</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>supplementary</b> <b>protection</b> <b>certificate</b> is {{currently}} considered to represent an accessory {{of a national}} or European patent granted in order to extend {{the duration of the}} rights that said patent confers on its owner in respect of an active substance or a combination of active substances. Based on the above-mentioned patent and on the certificate, the owner shall have the exclusive right of manufacturing and commercializing the patented product, as well as the right to oppose to any form of counterfeiting of the patented product. The grant of this protection title for medicaments is regulated on the territory of the European Union by the Regulation (EC) No 469 / 2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 concerning the <b>supplementary</b> <b>protection</b> <b>certificate</b> for medicinal products (Codified version). The conditions for obtaining the certificate are stipulated under Art. 3. The paper is intended to present the decisions made by the Romanian courts in the cases concerning the controversial interpretation of Art. 3 letter d) of the Regulation, which provides that the valid authorization to place the medicament on the market in accordance with Directive 2001 / 83 /EC or Directive 2001 / 82 /EC, as the case may be, should be the first authorization to place the product on the market as a medicament. At the same time, the paper presents the differences in the approach and the judgment of such cases by OSIM (State Office for Inventions and Trademarks) and by the national courts. The paper aims at analyzing said decisions as compared to the European practice, with a view to identifying solutions for a uniform interpretation of Community legislation {{at the level of the}} Romanian courts...|$|R
40|$|The {{legal nature}} of the rights derived from the patent was object of {{numerous}} theories and discussions in literature. Their main features represent recognized characteristics for the property right, nevertheless the limitation in time, in space and the ubiquity make the difference. Especially for new medicinal or plant protection products, due to the limitation in time, the period of effective protection under the patent is insufficient to cover the investment put into the research. There exists a risk of research centres situated in the Member States relocating to countries that offer greater protection. The uniform solution at Community level was created in form of regulations, as the most appropriate legal instrument to prevent the heterogeneous development of national patent laws affecting the free movement of products in the internal market. The duration of the protection granted by the patent may be extended to additional 5 years, by a <b>supplementary</b> <b>protection</b> <b>certificate,</b> granted, under same conditions provided by the regulation, by each Member State. The Community regulations created a legal form of a new national sui generis right, belonging both to the intellectual property right, namely patent right, and the administrative right of the marketing authorization. The main objective of the paper consists in informing the Romanian specialists in the field about the latest evolutions in intellectual property rights, especially in protection of the inventions, {{as a consequence of}} Romania’s accession to the European Community...|$|R
40|$|In Europe {{there are}} 25 000 deaths per {{year as a}} result of {{antimicrobial}} resistance and in the world the estimated annual number of deaths is 700 000. By 2050, it has been predicted that 10 million people per year could die from being resistant to antibiotic compounds. Market monopoly makes it possible for the pharmaceutical industry to make a profit that can recover the costs of R&D. Antibiotics courses are short and expected to be cheap. Additionally, there is a public health imperative to restrict the use of new antibiotics to mitigate the spread of resistance which makes it hard to recover extensive investments, creating an economic risk for the pharmaceutical companies. The economic incentives are insufficient for the development of new antibiotics and therefore there is a risk that we face a future without effective antibiotics. The purposes of this thesis is to review why the legal incentives in the patent system within the EU are insufficient in relation to research of new antibiotic compounds and to discuss how legal instruments could incentivise the development of new antimicrobial drugs. The thesis will review and analyse the following legal mechanisms in relation to antibiotics R&D; pharmaceutical patents, <b>supplementary</b> <b>protection</b> <b>certificate,</b> orphan drug designation, regulatory data protection and transferable patent rights. In brief conclusion, the thesis found that IP rights and regulatory incentives could serve as incentives for antibiotics R&D. The effect is however varying depending on if it is a novel class of antibiotics or analogues antibiotics. Overall, legal mechanisms are proven to be important and effective as pull mechanisms and that they carry the development of new antibiotic compounds forward. In combination with some political initiatives based on de-linking, legal mechanisms that are constant in comparison to politics can possibly ensure the pharmaceutical companies of reimbursement when conducting research in new antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|The term of {{a patent}} is an {{essential}} feature of the patent system. This feature is arguably even more essential {{in the area of}} pharmaceutical patents, burdened with inherent formalities delaying a product’s arrival on the market. The inability for pharmaceutical patents to exercise their exclusive rights for an effective duration has a negative knock-on effect on the research and development for innovative drugs, which in turn, impinges on public health and society at large. Thus, the European Community has sought to address these issues with a <b>supplementary</b> <b>protection</b> <b>certificate</b> (“SPC”), which essentially prolongs the effective lifespan of a patent. However, recent case law shows that national courts are applying diverging approaches when it comes to combination drugs, leading to heterogeneity within the Community. Most recently, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) produced an Opinion on the joined cases of C- 322 / 10 and C- 422 / 10 Medeva BV and Georgetown et al. v Comptroller-General of Patents (“Medeva et al. ”) and posed an approach which {{would make it easier for}} combination drugs to obtain an SPC. However, it also limited the grant of such to one SPC per patent. The effect of this on combination drugs is potentially damaging as it could serve to undermine the development of combination vaccines and hinder the possibility for immunisation against multiple diseases, particularly for babies. The CJEU currently has an opportunity in its upcoming preliminary ruling on Medeva to create a degree of uniformity in the approach of granting SPCs for combination drugs. Whether they follow the approach presented by the Advocate-General in Medeva et al. will be most interesting for those affected by pharmaceutical patents. This thesis explores the policies behind the regime, the competing interests at stake, and the differing approaches by the courts and their effects on different scenarios of combination drugs, in order to examine the current adequacy of the regulatory regime in relation to combination drugs. In particular, it focuses on the recent approach posed by the Advocate-General in Medeva et al. and examines the adequacy of such in light of combination drugs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Before any {{medicinal}} product is authorised {{for use in}} adults, it must undergo extensive pharmaceutical consistency and stability tests, toxicological tests and clinical trials {{to ensure that it}} is of high quality, safe and effective. The same approach may not always be applied to {{medicinal product}}s used to treat children. Studies showed that over 50 % of the medicinal products used in children may not have been tested for use in this age group. The absence of suitable authorised medicinal products to treat conditions in children results from the fact that pharmaceutical companies do not adapt medicinal products {{to the needs of the}} paediatric population. This leaves health care professionals with no alternative other than to use medicinal products "off-label" and to use unauthorised products with the associated risks of inefficacy and/or adverse reactions. The Regulation (EC) No 1901 / 2006 sets up a system of requirements, rewards and incentives, together with horizontal measures, to ensure that medicinal products are researched, developed and authorised to meet the therapeutic needs of children. The Regulation is addressed to: 1. The pharmaceutical industry by setting out the legal framework for receiving rewards and incentives by conducting clinical trials in the paediatric population. 2. The Member States to set out to support research into, and the development and availability of, medicinal products for paediatric use. 3. The Community as funds for research into medicinal products for the paediatric population shall be provided for in the Community budget in order to support studies relating to medicinal products or active substances not covered by a patent or a <b>supplementary</b> <b>protection</b> <b>certificate.</b> The legal framework for conducting clinical trials, including children/minors, is set up in Directive 2001 / 20 /EC, the Clinical Trials Directive (CTD), for the European Union (EU). The CTD establishes specific provisions regarding conduct of clinical trials, including multi-centre trials, on human subjects involving medicinal products and in particular relating to the implementation of good clinical practice. Compliance with this good practice provides assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are protected, and that the results of the clinical trials are credible. The CTD is addressed to all investigators conducting clinical trials including clinical trials in the paediatric population and had to be applied accordingly. In the framework of the authorisation of medicinal products regulated by the Regulation (EC) No 726 / 2004 and Directive 2001 / 83 /EC as amended and the CTD, and additional implementing Directives and guidelines, the new Regulation (EC) No 1901 / 2006 is an important new piece of legislation focusing on the requirements to improve the situation for the paediatric population.
