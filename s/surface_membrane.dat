5|$|The {{range of}} {{structural}} and biochemical effects that viruses {{have on the}} host cell is extensive. These are called cytopathic effects. Most virus infections eventually result {{in the death of}} the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis, alterations to the cell's <b>surface</b> <b>membrane</b> and apoptosis. Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activities because of suppression by virus-specific proteins, not all of which are components of the virus particle.|$|E

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>membranes</b> {{isolated}} from mouse fibroblasts contain RNA organized in ribosome-like particles. These <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> can incorporate radioactive amino acids into material insoluble in hot trichloroacetic acid. Characterization of the radioactive products {{indicated that they}} are large polypeptides. Most requirements and inhibitors of the system {{were similar to those}} of the microsomal system of the endoplasmic reticulum. Further comparisons were made with microsomal and pH 5 fractions prepared from L-cells by standard procedures and by two methods attempting to simulate the conditions necessary for isolating <b>surface</b> <b>membranes.</b> The amount of L-leucine incorporated by the <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> per mg of RNA was comparable to the values obtained by the microsomal and pH 5 fractions prepared by standard procedures. In contrast, the activity of the two other microsomal fractions was less than 10 per cent of this amount. The most striking difference noted was in the products formed by the <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> and by the microsomal systems. These products were demonstrated to be quite different by electrophoresis on acrylamide gels. It is suggested that the <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> participate actively in protein synthesis in vivo, and that, because of this location, the protein-synthesizing mechanism may be able to perform special functions more efficiently...|$|R
40|$|Resolution of {{leishmaniasis}} {{is associated}} with host immunological responsiveness to parasite antigens. In clinical disease, leishmania are found as amastigotes contained with macrophages. We investigated the possibility that Leishmania antigens are expressed on the infected macrophage surface by reacting infected macrophages with antibody to Leishmania. In vitro-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages were labelled with antibody to amastigotes when examined with immunofluorescent or immunoelectron microscopic techniques. Infected macrophages were poorly labelled by antibody to promastigotes (insect forms of Leishmania). Certain antisera that reacted with the <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> of amastigotes did not label the infected macrophage surface. These results indicate that human macrophages infected in vitro express Leishmania amastigote antigen(s) on their <b>surface</b> <b>membranes,</b> that such antigen(s) may not be present in large quantities in promastigotes, and that certain antigen(s) on the amastigote surface are not expressed on the <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> of infected macrophages...|$|R

25|$|An {{increased}} intracellular ATP:ADP ratio {{closes the}} ATP-sensitive SUR1/Kir6.2 potassium channel (see sulfonylurea receptor). This prevents potassium ions (K+) from leaving the cell by facilitated diffusion, {{leading to a}} buildup of intracellular potassium ions. As a result, {{the inside of the}} cell becomes less negative with respect to the outside, leading to the depolarization of the cell <b>surface</b> <b>membrane.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Notch-mediated signaling, the signal {{transduction}} mechanism can be relatively simple. As shown in Figure 2, activation of Notch can cause the Notch protein to be altered by a protease. Part of the Notch protein is released from the cell <b>surface</b> <b>membrane</b> and takes part in gene regulation. Cell signaling research involves studying the spatial and temporal dynamics of both receptors and the components of signaling pathways that are activated by receptors in various cell types.|$|E
25|$|The {{phospholipid}} bilayer {{that forms}} the cell <b>surface</b> <b>membrane</b> consists of a hydrophobic inner core region sandwiched between two regions of hydrophilicity, one at the inner surface and one at the outer surface of the cell membrane (see lipid bilayer article {{for a more detailed}} structural description of the cell membrane). The inner and outer surfaces, or interfacial regions, of model phospholipid bilayers have been shown to have a thickness of around 8 to 10 Å, although this may be wider in biological membranes that include large amounts of gangliosides or lipopolysaccharides.|$|E

50|$|Sialic acid-rich {{oligosaccharides}} on the glycoconjugates (glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans) {{found on}} <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> help keep {{water at the}} surface of cells. The sialic acid-rich regions contribute to creating a negative charge on the cells' surfaces. Since water is a polar molecule with partial positive charges on both hydrogen atoms, it is attracted to cell <b>surfaces</b> and <b>membranes.</b> This also contributes to cellular fluid uptake.|$|R
25|$|Ion {{channels}} {{located on}} the <b>surface</b> <b>membrane</b> of the neuron allows for an influx of sodium ions and outward movement of potassium ions during an action potential. Selectively blocking these ion channels will decrease the likelihood of an action potential to occur. The drug riluzole is a neuroprotective drug that blocks sodium ion channels. Since these channels cannot activate, there is no action potential, and the neuron does not perform any transduction of chemical signals into electrical signals and the signal does not move on. This drug is used as an anesthetic {{as well as a}} sedative.|$|E
25|$|Thirty-three blood-group {{systems have}} been {{identified}} by the International Society for Blood Transfusion {{in addition to the}} common ABO and Rh systems. Thus, in addition to the ABO antigens and Rh antigens, many other antigens are expressed on the RBC <b>surface</b> <b>membrane.</b> For example, an individual can be AB, D positive, {{and at the same time}} M and N positive (MNS system), K positive (Kell system), Lea or Leb negative (Lewis system), and so on, being positive or negative for each blood group system antigen. Many of the blood group systems were named after the patients in whom the corresponding antibodies were initially encountered.|$|E
25|$|A newborn's {{shell size}} {{depends on the}} egg size since the shell {{develops}} from the egg's <b>surface</b> <b>membrane.</b> As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; {{there will be no}} further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.|$|E

40|$|Background: The human liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, is {{designated}} as a group 1 carcinogen, and is the major risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma in endemic countries throughout Southeast Asia. Proteins in the excretory-secretory products and tegumental <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> of the fluke have been proposed to play pivotal roles in parasite survival in the host, and subsequent pathogenesis. These macromolecules are therefore valid targets {{for the development of}} vaccines and new drugs to control the infection. Tetraspanins (TSP) are prominent components of the tegument of blood flukes where they are essential for tegument formation, are directly exposed to the immune system, and are major targets for a schistosomiasis vaccine. We propose that similar molecules in the <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> of O. viverrini are integral to tegument biogenesis and will be efficacious vaccine antigens...|$|R
25|$|Mutations {{in these}} repeating {{segments}} {{can affect the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of proteins, with the potential for producing gradual and predictable changes in protein action. For example, length changes in tandemly repeating regions in the Runx2 gene lead to differences in facial length in domesticated dogs (Canis familiaris), with an association between longer sequence lengths and longer faces. This association also applies to a wider range of Carnivora species. Length changes in polyalanine tracts within the HoxA13 gene are linked to Hand-Foot-Genital Syndrome, a developmental disorder in humans. Length changes in other triplet repeats are linked to more than 40 neurological diseases in humans, notably triplet expansion diseases such as fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease. Evolutionary changes from replication slippage also occur in simpler organisms. For example, microsatellite length changes are common within <b>surface</b> <b>membrane</b> proteins in yeast, providing rapid evolution in cell properties. Specifically, length changes in the FLO1 gene control the level of adhesion to substrates. Short sequence repeats also provide rapid evolutionary change to surface proteins in pathenogenic bacteria; this may allow them to keep up with immunological changes in their hosts. Length changes in short sequence repeats in a fungus (Neurospora crassa) control the duration of its circadian clock cycles.|$|E
25|$|Neurons {{are known}} as excitable cells because on its <b>surface</b> <b>membrane</b> there are an {{abundance}} of proteins known as ion-channels that allow small charged particles to pass {{in and out of}} the cell. The structure of the neuron allows chemical information to be received by its dendrites, propagated through the perikaryon (cell body) and down its axon, and eventually passing on to other neurons through its axon terminal. These voltage-gated ion channels allow for rapid depolarization throughout the cell. This depolarization, if it reaches a certain threshold, will cause an action potential. Once the action potential reaches the axon terminal, it will cause an influx of calcium ions into the cell. The calcium ions will then cause vesicles, small packets filled with neurotransmitters, to bind to the cell membrane and release its contents into the synapse. This cell is known as the pre-synaptic neuron, and the cell that interacts with the neurotransmitters released is known as the post-synaptic neuron. Once the neurotransmitter is released into the synapse, it can either bind to receptors on the post-synaptic cell, the pre-synaptic cell can re-uptake it and save it for later transmission, or it can be broken down by enzymes in the synapse specific to that certain neurotransmitter. These three different actions are major areas where drug action can affect communication between neurons.|$|E

40|$|It has {{recently}} been proposed that the semipermeable surface barrier of living cells is in fact provided by water polarized in multilayers by the cellular protein, and not by the lipids of the cell membrane as had been widely supposed. This review paper summarizes a large and diverse body of recent experimental work, concerned with the structure and function of biological membranes in general and with the passive permeability properties of cell <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> in particular, which {{does not support the}} polarized water hypothesis. Indeed, there exists a great deal of experimental evidence which supports the concept that the lipid bilayer is a central structural feature of cell <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> and that one of the major functions of this lipid bilayer is to provide the selective, semipermeable barrier found at the surface of living cells...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} cell-surface antigens have been {{identified}} and isolated from Trypanosoma cruzi, {{all of which are}} glycoconjugates. These include a 90000 mol. wt. glycoprotein capable of inducing protective immunity in mice which is found on all stages of the parasite life cycle; a 72000 mol. wt glycoprotein found on insect stages of the life cycle which has been implicated in the control of differentiation; and a complex glycolipid (lipopeptidophospho-glycan) containing lipid, carbohydrate, phosphate and amino acids whose function is unknown. The structure and possible function of these and other glycoproteins from T. cruzi which have been less extensively studied is reviewed and possibly unusual biosynthetic pathways for glycosylation highlighted. <b>Surface</b> <b>membranes</b> of cells exhibit a number of housekeeping properties such as ion balance maintenance and nutrient transport.

40|$|The resting ionic conductances of frog sartorius {{muscle fibers}} have been {{determined}} {{in a variety}} of conditions in order to measure the potassium conductance of the tubular and <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> (gKt and gKs) and the chloride conductance of the tubular and <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> (gClt and gCls). In both normal fibers and fibers without tubules, measurements of input resistance and diameter were made at normal pH and at low pH when the chloride conductance was very small. These measurements permitted the separation of the ionic conductances: gCls = 219 µmhos/cm 2; gClt = 0 µmhos/cm 2; gKs = 28 µmhos/cm 2; gKt = 55 µmhos/cm 2. Possible sources of systematic error are discussed and a statistical analysis of the effects of random error is presented.

5000|$|A report {{working with}} human {{neutrophils}} proposed that G2A was a receptor for a phospholipid, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and a Sphingomyelin, sphingosylphosphorylcholine. [...] However, these studies {{did not give}} evidence that these lyso-phospholipids actually bound to G2A; some 4 years later this report was withdrawn. Nonetheless, many of LPC's activities do depend on G2A; more recent data suggest that rather than acting directly as a ligand that binds to G2A, LPC alters G2A's distribution within the cell by increasing its movement from the cell interior to the cell surface and/or by preventing its movement away from the cell surface to the cell interior. That is, in neutrophils and other cell types which have internal stores of G2A in membrane-bound secretory vesicles, G2A-containing vesicles continuously merge with and move back out of a cell's <b>surface</b> <b>membrane.</b> [...] Lyso-phospholipids may act as a)) detergents to increase a cell's permeability thereby allowing entry of small extracellular molecules such as ionic calcium which trigger {{the movement of the}} intracellular vesicles to the <b>surface</b> <b>membrane</b> or b) agents that intercalate or wedge into the cell's <b>surface</b> <b>membrane</b> to promote this vesicle movement or slow this visicle movement out of the membrane [...] [...] Such effects increase the expression of G2A at the cell <b>surface</b> <b>membrane</b> which, if G2A has a sub-stimulatory level of activity when normally express but stimulatory when it is overexpressed at the <b>surface</b> <b>membrane,</b> may lead to G2A-dependent cellular responses. With respect to this view, small decreases in extracellular pH reduce the internalization of G2A thereby increasing its <b>surface</b> <b>membrane</b> expression.|$|E
40|$|Incubation of live adult Schistosoma mansoni in {{a variety}} of media {{released}} tegumental material containing membrane bound alkaline phosphatase, mannosyl transferase and galactosyl transferase activities. Centrifugation of the tegumental material released by incubation of worms in phosphate-buffered saline in sucrose density gradients yielded a pellet and four fractions, two of which consisted mainly of <b>surface</b> <b>membranes.</b> The distribution of the enzymes in the gradient, espeically in the two surface membrane-containing subfractions was similar. Application of the "digitonin shift" technique showed that the membranes containing the enzyme reactivities were moved to an equal extent into a denser part of the sucrose gradient.

It is concluded that the transferases, like the alkaline phosphatases, are located in the <b>surface</b> <b>membranes</b> of S. mansoni and the consequences of this location for the host-parasite interaction are discussed...|$|R
