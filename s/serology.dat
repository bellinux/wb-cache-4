5|$|Evidence {{based on}} the fossil record, <b>serology,</b> karyology, behavior, anatomy, and {{reproduction}} reflect closer affinities with Procyonidae than Ursidae. However, ecological and foraging specializations and distinct geographical distribution in relation to modern procyonids support classification in the separate family Ailuridae.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} tests (NAATs), direct fluorescein tests (DFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are highly}} sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present. <b>Serology</b> testing for antibodies {{is not as}} useful since {{the presence of the}} microorganisms in healthy people can confound interpreting the antibody titer levels, although antibody levels can indicate whether an infection is recent or long-term.|$|E
5|$|Clavaria zollingeri {{contains}} lectins, a {{class of}} proteins that bind specific carbohydrates {{on the surface of}} cells, causing them to clump together. A Korean study demonstrated that extracts of the fungus caused lymphoagglutination, a specific form of agglutination that involves white blood cells. In general, lectins are used in blood typing and <b>serology,</b> and they are widely used in affinity chromatography for purifying proteins.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} a systematic infectious screening program {{for patients who}} present with sudden or progressive sensorineural hearing loss (SHL) of unknown cause (negative history and clinical examination). METHOD: Retrospective study of 182 patients with idiopathic SHL. One hundred six patients presented with sudden SHL, and 76 presented with progressive SHL. <b>Serologies</b> for herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses (immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G titers), Lyme disease (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), syphilis (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption or microhemagglutination-Treponema pallidum test) and human immunodeficiency virus were performed. RESULTS: The <b>serologies</b> were negative in 179 patients. Two patients had positive <b>serologies</b> for Lyme disease and another tested positive for syphilis. Both cases of suspected Lyme disease were later excluded by Western blot analysis and lumbar puncture (two false-positives). The patient with serologic syphilis was diagnosed as having latent syphilis after neurosyphilis was excluded. CONCLUSION: The infection screening was positive in only 1 (0. 6 %) of 182 patients: the patient who was diagnosed with latent syphilis. On {{the basis of these}} results and taking into account the cost of systematic screening, we propose that serologic tests be limited to patients with suspect histories or symptomatologies, except for patients with a diagnosis of syphilis...|$|R
5|$|Detection of {{particular}} antibodies {{is a very}} common form of medical diagnostics, and applications such as <b>serology</b> depend on these methods. For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis, a titer of antibodies directed against Epstein-Barr virus or Lyme disease is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected or the infection occurred {{a very long time}} ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed.|$|E
5|$|Complement, an {{important}} component for <b>serology,</b> was first isolated from {{the blood of the}} guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue fever may {{be confirmed by}} microbiological laboratory testing. This {{can be done by}} virus isolation in cell cultures, nucleic acid detection by PCR, viral antigen detection (such as for NS1) or specific antibodies (<b>serology).</b> Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. All tests may be negative {{in the early stages of}} the disease. PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days. In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{systemic}} {{nature of this}} disease, leukemic cells {{can be found in}} peripheral blood, lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, liver, skin.

HTLV-1 <b>serologies</b> are negative, and serum immunoglobins are within normal limits with no paraproteins present.|$|R
5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute {{phase of the}} illness {{with the exception of}} <b>serology.</b> Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|E

Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) occurs at a rate of 1:200 in first-time use, but <b>serology</b> (measuring antibodies against aprotinin in the blood) is not carried out in practice to predict anaphylaxis risk because the correct interpretation of these tests is difficult.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} methods used for {{diagnosing}} Bartonella infection including microscopy, <b>serology,</b> and PCR.

25|$|Bartonella spp. often evade {{an immune}} response, thus {{antibodies}} {{may not be}} detected even concurrent with an infection, resulting in an IFA false negative rate of up to 83% in chronically infected patients when other test results (e.g. organism isolation or PCR) are positive.

25|$|Several {{forms of}} {{laboratory}} testing for Lyme disease are available, {{some of which}} have not been adequately validated. The most widely used tests are <b>serologies,</b> which measure levels of specific antibodies in a patient's blood. These tests may be negative in early infection as the body may not have produced a significant quantity of antibodies, but they are considered a reliable aid in the diagnosis of later stages of Lyme disease. Serologic tests for Lyme disease are of limited use in people lacking objective signs of Lyme disease because of false positive results and cost.|$|R
25|$|<b>Serology</b> may be {{used for}} adults and {{adolescents}} who have already been infected for several weeks to determine whether antibody against pertussis toxin or another virulence factor of B. pertussis is present at high levels in the blood of the person. By this stage, they have been contagious for some weeks and may have spread the infection to many people. Because of this, adults, who are not in great danger from pertussis, are increasingly being encouraged to be vaccinated.|$|E
25|$|Screening for rubella {{susceptibility}} {{by history}} of vaccination or by <b>serology</b> is recommended in the United States {{for all women}} of childbearing age at their first preconception counseling visit to reduce incidence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
