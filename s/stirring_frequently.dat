50|$|Cajeta {{is made by}} {{simmering}} goat's milk, or {{occasionally a}} sweetened liquid, <b>stirring</b> <b>frequently,</b> until it becomes very viscous due to evaporation of water, and caramelized. While goat milk is the most usual base, other liquids or juices may be used.|$|E
5000|$|The {{extracted}} {{liquid is}} combined with the sugar and any other ingredients, and thickened to a creamy consistency by cooking on the stove for about 45 minutes (or in the microwave oven for 12-15 minutes), <b>stirring</b> <b>frequently.</b> The cream is then poured into appropriate containers (dessert cups, muffin molds, shallow baking pans, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} of Canadian Confederation (1867), songwriting had become a favored means of {{personal}} expression across the land. In {{a society in which}} most middle-class families now owned a harmonium or piano, and standard education included at least the rudiments of music, the result was often an original song. Such <b>stirrings</b> <b>frequently</b> occurred in response to noteworthy events, and few local or national excitements were allowed to pass without some musical comment.|$|R
60|$|Cluster {{all these}} {{individuals}} together, as they sometimes were, with other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group, and, {{for the time}} being, it made the Custom-House a <b>stirring</b> scene. More <b>frequently,</b> however, on ascending the steps, you would discern-- in the entry if it were summer time, or in their appropriate rooms if wintry or inclement weathers--a row of venerable figures, sitting in old-fashioned chairs, which were tipped on their hind legs back against the wall. Oftentimes they were asleep, but occasionally might be heard talking together, in voices between a speech and a snore, and with that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of alms-houses, and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on charity, on monopolized labour, or anything else but their own independent exertions. These old gentlemen--seated, like Matthew at the receipt of custom, but not very liable to be summoned thence, like him, for apostolic errands--were Custom-House officers.|$|R
40|$|The results {{presented}} {{indicate that}} the production of diacetyl in butter cultures and pure cultures of citric acid fermenting streptococci can be greatly increased by growing the cultures under 30 pounds or more of air pressure per square inch, provided the cultures are agitated by aeration or <b>stirring.</b> This increase <b>frequently</b> amounts to several hundred percent. In some cases the yield of acetylmethylcarbinol was increased by aeration under pressure, and in other cases it was not. Occasionally, the increase was relatively large. Pressure without agitation was not effective in increasing the diketone content. The cultures under pressure must be agitaed by aeration or stirring {{in order to bring}} about an increased formation of diacetyl. Pressures exceeding 15 pounds per square inch were necessary for substantially increased yields of diacetyl. Although the highest yields of diacetyl were found in cultures ripened under 60 pounds pressure, intermediate pressures produced satisfactorily large amounts and caused less difficulty in operation. It is probable that agitation under pressure changes the normal anaerobic dissimilation of citric acid by the citric acid fermenting streptococci rather than that the acid is more rapidly fermented. The effect of the high diacetyl content of butter cultures is to give a high flavor and aroma. Butter churned with such cultures uniformly possesses a high flavor and aroma. The results obtained in this investigation suggest new methods in butter making practice. High flavor cultures may benefit the dairy industry in either of two ways. Such cultures may aid in the production of butter with an unusually high flavor and aroma, or less culture may be used to obtain the same flavor and aroma as normal cultures impart to butter...|$|R
5000|$|Creole Toilet Water - to 6.75 {{ounces of}} orris root cut in small pieces put 1.5 pint of French brandy. Allow this mix {{to stand for}} 2 weeks, <b>stirring</b> <b>frequently.</b> Then filter the mix and add 3 pints of French brandy and 3 drops of oil of orange blossoms. Add 0.75 fluid ounce of oil of geranium. Distill and add a little {{coumarin}} essence.|$|E
50|$|The advised {{method of}} cooking, by boiling, yields an {{impressive}} output from the ingredients. Generally, the hot cereal {{is made with}} a 4:1 water to cereal ratio, which can be adjusted to personal consistency preferences (for example, using 3:1 to later add milk to taste). To make 4 servings combine 4 cups of water, 1 cup of Red River Cereal and 1/4 t. salt (optional). Bring to a boil, <b>stirring</b> <b>frequently.</b> Reduce heat and boil gently for approximately 5 minutes or until desired consistency, stirring occasionally. Cover, {{remove from heat and}} let stand for a few minutes.|$|E
50|$|Rice absorbs a {{great deal}} of water as it cooks, {{expanding}} its volume and using up the cooking water. The moisture and heat gelatinize and soften the starch granules in the rice. The cooking time for raw rice (not parboiled beforehand) ranges from about 15 minutes and up, depending upon the type and freshness of rice, method, and desired result (from separate grains to disintegrated porridge). Some rices, such as white rice, long-grain rice and African rice, break up more easily. Some cooking methods are more likely to break the rice (fragmenting it with a mortar and pestle before cooking, or <b>stirring</b> <b>frequently).</b> Some rice is stickier. Most recipes will therefore not work for all rices.|$|E
30|$|RH {{was washed}} {{thoroughly}} {{with water to}} remove the soluble particles, dust, and other contaminants present, whereby the heavy impurities such as sand are also removed. It was then dried in an air oven at about 110 °C for 24 h. The dried RH was refluxed with an acidic solution (HCl, HNO 3, and CH 3 COOH in different concentrations) for nearly 90 min by <b>stirring</b> <b>frequently.</b> It was cooled and kept intact for about 20 h. It was then decanted and thoroughly washed with warm distilled water until the rinse became free from acid, and this was designated as RH′. The wet RH′ was subsequently dried in an oven at 110 °C for 24 h.|$|E
30|$|For amplifying {{the test}} signal, AuNPs-MUC 1 ampters chelate was prepared. Heat 100  mL HAuCl 4 {{solution}} (0.01  %) to boiling and add 2.7  mL trisodium citrate (1  %) for 10  min, <b>stirring</b> <b>frequently,</b> followed with washing, filtering, and drying, {{and after that}} we get the AuNPs. 1  mL AuNPs solution and 6  μL TCEP were added into 50  μL MUC 1 ampters (10  μM), and then stirred for 2  h. The MUC 1 aptamers were self-assembly on AuNPs via Au-S bonds and TCEP was the reducing agent in the reaction. Following, 100  μL of 14.1  μM dATP {{was added to the}} solution and stirred for 1  h. The dATP was served as a sealing agent to close the redundant sites on the AuNPs. The AuNPs-MUC 1 ampters chelate was achieved after centrifugalizing. Lastly, the chelate was dissolved 1  mL of 0.01  M PBSB (PBS pH 7.4, 1  % BSA) solution, thus 500  nM AuNPs-MUC 1 ampters solution has been prepared and stored at 4  °C for the following test. BSA can protect the activity of biological reagent even under ultra-low concentration.|$|E
