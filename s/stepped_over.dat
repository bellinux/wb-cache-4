5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has <b>stepped</b> <b>over</b> it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{the court}} {{sentenced him to}} {{imprisonment}} and confiscation of goods; that was challenged by Rejtan. Eventually, on 21 April, most of the deputies had signed the act of the confederation, which was accepted by the king. Troops {{made it difficult for}} the other deputies to be present in the Sejm chambers, although a dwindling number of deputies, including Rejtan, still were present. To finish forming the confederation and elect Poniński its marshal, some confederation deputies entered the Chambers, passed a motion, and were attempting to leave. This is when Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held (leaving of the chamber signified the end of the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion). Others tried to block the passage too. Their gesture was dramatic but futile, as the leaving deputies just <b>stepped</b> <b>over</b> Rejtan, and in a commotion pushed through the others. Eventually, just a few deputies, including Rejtan, were left inside; they refused to leave, hoping to be removed by foreign troops, which would be a symbol of the foreign intervention. Around 22 April, Rejtan and the remaining colleagues left the Sejm chamber after about 36 hours of having little sleep and food (Rejtan is said to have refused to eat in the Sejm chamber, saying it would disrespect it). Eventually however, they left in return for a guarantee from the foreign diplomats that the sentence passed on him would be nullified, and no other repercussions would be carried out.|$|E
5|$|United {{responded with}} their first {{extended}} period of possession of the half, working the ball into wide areas to be crossed into the middle, but Rooney's first couple of attempted centres were well cleared by Piqué. At the third attempt, though, Rooney's cross evaded the Barcelona defence as Touré kicked at thin air; however, it also failed to find a Manchester United player in the penalty area, both Ronaldo and Park going close. After Ronaldo was called offside in the 59thminute – despite appearing to be level with the last defender – Giggs stole the ball mid-way inside the Barcelona half before playing the ball to Ronaldo on the left wing. The Portuguese forward <b>stepped</b> <b>over</b> the ball several times {{in an attempt to}} wrong-foot Puyol, before cutting inside and playing the ball across the edge of the area towards Carrick. A sliding challenge from Busquets prevented a shot, only for the English midfielder to slide the ball out for a Barcelona goal kick while attempting to play Rooney through. Rooney was again played down the right wing a few moments later, but his low cross was diverted behind by Piqué, and the resulting corner came to nothing. A left-wing attack from Ronaldo followed, but after cutting inside, he gave the ball away cheaply. Barcelona immediately went on the attack down the other end, but Henry was unable to get past O'Shea and his shot was well saved by Van der Sar low at the near post.|$|E

40|$|International audience— Humanoid robots {{are getting}} {{increasingly}} {{attention in the}} robotics community, {{not only for the}} scientific challenge of the complex multibody system issues and mechatronic designs, but also due to their high mobility and versatility. Humanoid robots have the potential to navigate through complex environ-ments such as the standard living surrounding of humans. This is mainly due to the bipedal legged nature of the robotic system, which allows higher mobility than its wheeled counterpart. One of the advantages is that it can negotiate obstacles by <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> them, which is the topic of the work presented in this paper. The main focus of this research is to investigate <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> large obstacles. Previous work has reported on algorithms using quasi-static balancing, which resulted in somehow unnatural slow motions. This work however is focussing on <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> larger obstacles in a fluent dynamic motion, using stability criteria on zero moment point instead of center of gravity. All the work is formulated in function of the elaborate HRP- 2 humanoid research platform. In this paper a preliminary 2 D study on <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> leg trajectories and their dynamic implications on the overall stability are investigated. The paper discusses the implementation of the <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> procedure in the overall dynamic motion generator, the implications on the kinematics and dynamics and finally the actual <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> foot trajectory planner...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{proposes a}} {{complete}} solution {{to make the}} humanoid robot HRP- 2 dynamically <b>step</b> <b>over</b> large obstacles. As compared to previous results using quasi-static stability [1] where the robot crosses over a 15 cm obstacle in 40 s, our solution allows HRP- 2 to <b>step</b> <b>over</b> the same obstacle in 4 s. This approach allows the robot to clear obstacles as high as 21 % of the robot's leg length (15 cm) while walking.

25|$|When Stevenson {{heard the}} {{fighting}} between Walthall and Geary, he ordered Pettus to take three regiments {{from the summit}} to assist Jackson. By this time, Moore's Alabamians were moving up amidst Walthall's retreating men, and they fired on Ireland's New Yorkers from 100 yards. Unable to see {{the size of the}} force resisting it through the fog, the Union men retreated beyond a stone wall. Moore's 1,000 men took positions in the rifle pits facing the wall and waited for the inevitable counterattack. Ireland's men were too exhausted to make an immediate move. As Whitaker's brigade arrived after 1 p.m., they <b>stepped</b> <b>over</b> Ireland's men and rushed into the attack. Candy's brigade was moving up the mountain side on Whitaker's left, followed by the brigades of Woods and Grose.

25|$|The {{debugger}} allows setting breakpoints (which allow execution to {{be stopped}} temporarily at a certain position) and watches (which monitor the values of variables as the execution progresses). Breakpoints can be conditional, meaning they get triggered when the condition is met. Code can be <b>stepped</b> <b>over,</b> i.e., run one line (of source code) at a time. It can either step into functions to debug inside it, or step over it, i.e., {{the execution of the}} function body isn't available for manual inspection. The debugger supports Edit and Continue, i.e., it allows code to be edited as it is being debugged. When debugging, if the mouse pointer hovers over any variable, its current value is displayed in a tooltip ("data tooltips"), where it can also be modified if desired. During coding, the Visual Studio debugger lets certain functions be invoked manually from the Immediate tool window. The parameters to the method are supplied at the Immediate window.|$|E

Los Angeles rallied to force a 94–94 tie {{at the end of}} {{regulation}} before scoring the first five points of the overtime period, but the 76ers closed the game on a 13–2 run for a 107–101 triumph. Iverson hit a go-ahead three-pointer with 1:19 to go in the extra period, and followed that with a jump shot after which he infamously <b>stepped</b> <b>over</b> Tyronn Lue after making the basket. Eric Snow hit a running jump shot in the waning seconds with the shot clock expiring to clinch the stunning victory. The series would come back to Philadelphia even as Los Angeles took Game Two, 98–89. In Game Three, Shaquille O'Neal fouled out late in the fourth quarter, and the Sixers pulled to within a point with less than a minute to play after trailing by 12 earlier in the second half. Robert Horry, however, hit a clutch three-pointer in that final minute, and the Lakers prevailed, 96–91. Los Angeles wrapped up the second of what would be three consecutive NBA titles with a 100–86 win in Game Four and a 108–96 victory in Game Five.|$|E

Its base is [...] square. The angle between opposite sides at its tip is 34°48'. It weighed [...] before lightning strikes removed a small amount of aluminum from its tip and sides. Spectral analysis in 1934 showed that it was composed of 97.87% aluminum with the rest impurities. It has a shallow depression in its base to match a slightly raised area atop the small upper surface of the marble capstone, which aligns the sides of the apex with those of the capstone, and the downward protruding lip around that area prevents water from entering the joint. It has a large hole in the center of its base to receive a threaded [...] diameter copper rod which attaches it to the monument and used to form part of the lightning protection system.|$|E
