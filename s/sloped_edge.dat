50|$|When {{the teeth}} {{are moving in}} the {{unrestricted}} (i.e., forward) direction (see Figure 2), the pawl easily slides {{up and over the}} gently sloped edges of the teeth, with a spring forcing it (often with an audible 'click') into the depression between the teeth as it passes the tip of each tooth. When the teeth move in the opposite (backward) direction, however, the pawl will catch against the steeply <b>sloped</b> <b>edge</b> of the first tooth it encounters, thereby locking it against the tooth and preventing any further motion in that direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{single storey}} {{residence}} is sited {{close to the}} western boundary with the Racecourse, approximately straddling the common boundary of the allotments. This provides a wide buffer of space {{between it and the}} road traffic. All exterior boundaries are lined with established trees and planting, allowing only partial glimpses of the house. There are two entries onto the site from Tor Street, however only the one toward the north-east corner is currently in use. The allotments are largely flat, and the house is founded on a base of raised ground, approximately half a metre high. This provides a 1.5m wide skirt of flat ground around the house, the edges of which slope steeply away. The <b>sloped</b> <b>edge</b> is less prominent at the south-east corner. The front facade best reflects the principles of unforced symmetry to which the design of the house largely adheres.|$|E

40|$|Optical extensions, {{laid out}} by Sematech and others, have {{implications}} for simulation, calling for new solutions. Phase-shifting masks need new models, to accurately predict the intensity imbalance and to forecast conditions under which defects print. This paper shows areas where the lithographer may expect strong assistance through simulation. The results of a study, using mask modeling for optimizing edge topography of Alternating Phase Shift Mask are presented. The new 3 D-simulator (TMASK) configuration of SOLID-CM is used to the study phase errors (CD sensitivity, image log. slope, CD placement), influence of <b>sloped</b> <b>edge</b> profiles and phase defects...|$|E
40|$|In electroplating-based {{flip-chip}} technology, the Cu stud and solder {{deposition process}} {{is one of}} the most important factors affecting the reliability of solder joints. The growth of Cu-Sn intermetallic compounds (IMC) also plays a critical role. In this paper, the effect of Cu stud surface roughness and microstructures on the reliability of solder joint was studied. The micro-structural morphology of the Cu-Sn IMC layer was affected by Cu stud surface structure. The Cu stud with <b>sloped</b> <b>edge</b> can impacted the adhesion of solder bump and UBM (Under Bump Metallurgy) layer. Insufficient solder wetting at edge of the Cu stud can further degrade the reliability of solder joints. We observed the thickness of epsilon-phase Cu(3) Sn layer increased continuously instead of eta-phase Cu(6) Sn(5) due to the deficiency of tin at the bottom of solder bump after extended thermal aging. The adhesion of Cu stud and UBM layer was weakened due to the growth of Cu(3) Sn at the edge of Cu stud. Both of the Cu-Sn IMC layers grew at the top of Cu stud as the aging time increased. The mean thickness of two IMC levers increased linearly with the square root of aging time. We found that cracks formed easily at the interface of Cu-Sn IMC layer and solder bump, especially at the Pb-rich layer and IMC layer interface. Cracks led to low bump shear strength after extended thermal aging. We did not observe cracks formed at the Cu(6) Sn(5) and Cu(3) Sn interface. The SEM and EDAX analysis suggested that the fracture surface structure was influenced by the Cu stud microstructure and solder bump deposition process...|$|E

5000|$|The {{acquisition}} {{on multiple}} spectral bands is enabled {{by the use}} of multiple elementary optical filters juxtaposed to each other. Regarding the technology developed by Sodern, this juxtaposition is obtained by assembly of strips, the strip being a sub-set containing all the functions of an elementary filter. The final component is called [...] "assembled strip filter".The number of elementary filters and their characteristics (centring, width, rejection, <b>sloping</b> <b>edges,</b> etc.) depend on the type of the satellite (Earth observation in the visible, infrared, etc.).|$|R
30|$|As we all know, if the {{thickness}} of a sliding mass on a slope is {{much smaller than the}} slope’s length, the slope can be called an infinite slope. For an infinite <b>slope,</b> <b>edge</b> effects can be neglected in stability analysis. That is to say, the safety factor of the slope can be determined by analysis of a rigid wedge or rigid slice of material of unit width and unit thickness. Here, in an area scale, {{the thickness}} of the landslide is much smaller than the length. Thus, the infinite slope assumption can be used in this study.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} function of bargeboards is {{to act as}} vortex generators, redirecting and energizing airflow. The upper, downward <b>sloping</b> <b>edge</b> can shed a large vortex downstream around the sidepods, where it can interact favorably with flip-ups, or aid in sealing the low pressure underbody flow from the ambient stream. The bottom edge of the bargeboard can also shed vortices that energize the airflow to the underbody, which can help delay flow separation and allow the use of more aggressive diffuser profiles. In recent years, these two edges have acquired relatively large serrations or protruding tabs to enhance this aspect of their performance.|$|R

Carl sighted back at Frazer's pew, hoping that he would miraculously be there to confront the dictator. The pew was empty as before.

Unlike most standard methods working exclusively with the MR image magnitude, in our case both the MR image magnitude and the MR image phase were used in the enhancement process.

40|$|In {{an indoor}} environment, <b>slope</b> and <b>edge</b> {{detection}} {{is an important}} problem in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which is a basic requirement for mobile robot autonomous navigation. Slope detection allows the robot to find areas that are more traversable while the edge detection can prevent robot from falling. Three-dimensional (3 D) solutions usually require a large memory and high computational costs. This study proposes an efficient two-dimensional (2 D) solution to combine <b>slope</b> and <b>edge</b> detection with a line-segment-based extended Kalman filter SLAM (EKF-SLAM) in a structured indoor area. The robot is designed to use two fixed 2 D laser range finders (LRFs) to perform horizontal and vertical scans. With local area orthogonal assumption, the <b>slope</b> and <b>edge</b> are modelled into line segments swiftly from each vertical scan, and then are merged into the EKF-SLAM framework. The EKF-SLAM framework features an optional prediction model that can automatically decide whether the application of iterative closest point (ICP) is necessary {{to compensate for the}} dead reckoning error. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of building an accurate 2 D map swiftly, which contains crucial information of the <b>edge</b> and <b>slope...</b>|$|R
