5000|$|In {{refrigeration}} and {{air conditioning}} systems, the suction pressure (also called the low-side pressure) is the intake pressure generated by the system compressor while operating. The suction pressure, along with the <b>suction</b> <b>temperature</b> and the wet bulb temperature of the discharge air are {{used to determine the}} correct refrigerant charge in a system.If some solute is dissolved in water its diffusion pressure decreases. The difference between diffusion pressure of pure water and solution is called diffusion pressure deficit (DPD). [...] When a plant cell is placed in hypotonic solution, water enters into a cell by osmosis and as a result turger pressure develops. The cell membrane get stretched and osmotic pressure of cell decreases. As cell absorbs more and more water its Total Pressure increases and Osmotic Pressure decreases. When a cell is fully turgid, its OP is equal to TP and DPD is zero. Turgid cells cannot absorb any more water. Thus, with reference to plant cell, the DPD can be described as actual thirst of cell for water and can be expressed as DPD=OP-TP.|$|E

The low <b>suction</b> <b>temperature</b> down to - 162 ? brings about big challenges in design of the BOG compressor. In this paper, the three-dimensional finite element model was used to simulate both the static and periodic transient temperature distribution in the cylinder of a BOG compressor, and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was established to calculate the flow and heat transfer inside the compression chamber and suction/discharge pockets. A test rig was built up to validate the simulated results. The results showed that, the average temperatures in the suction and discharge pockets were about - 109 ? and - 60 ?, respectively, and the temperature of the compression chamber was in-between. The maximum temperature difference between outer and inner surface of the compressor cylinder reached up to 84 ? during start-up of the compressor, which yielded a thermal strain and stress in the cylinder much larger than those during steady operation of the compressor with only 31 ? of temperature difference. A variety of pre-cooling temperatures ranging from - 20 ? to - 60 ? were examined, and the results showed pre-cooling down to - 20 ? before start-up was good enough.

The goal is to adapt this test stand {{so that it could}} be used to test a reciprocating compressor in this region. A control program is written to maintain a constant saturated <b>suction</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>suction</b> <b>temperature,</b> and saturated discharge temperature. The program was able to maintain control with errors of ± 0. 2 °C at most points. At each test point, refrigerant mass flow rate, compressor input power, and discharge temperature is monitored. The amount of heat removed by the condenser was within 7 % of the compressor input power and the inverter efficiency was within 5 % of the compressor input power for all test points. The inverter efficiency is lowest at low speed. The isentropic efficiency is found to drop off significantly for low pressure ratios. A similar drop off is not expected for reciprocating compressors, so a model for reciprocating compressors is developed. The model is able to predict refrigerant mass flow rate and compressor input power as a function of shaft speed as well as suction and discharge pressures and temperatures. The model is able to accurately predict the mass flow rate with an RMS error within 0. 5 % and for the power model, the RMS errors are within 3. 6 %.

The effect of four soil moisture suctions and four soil temperatures on the rates of transpiration, photosynthesis and respiration of monterey pine seedlings was studied. Transpiration was determined by a constant water level device which recorded {{the total amount of}} water used by the plant. Leaf resistances to CO 2 and water vapour were calculated. In general, the rates of photosynthesis, respiration and transpiration decreased with increasing soil moisture suction. Photosynthesis and transpiration decreased sharply from 0. 35 bars to 0. 70 bars soil moisture suctions. The rates of transpiration increased faster than the rate of photosynthesis with increasing soil temperature. The rates of respiration fluctuated with soil temperature. Where the ratio of transpiration to photosynthesis is constant as between 600 F and 800 F at all soil moisture suctions except 0. 35 bars, the same process was assumed to be limiting (probably stomatal control).

Examination of the mineralogy of various bentonites showed that a good correlation can be generally established between the montmorillonite content and the cations exchange capacity (CEC) or the specific surface area (S). Nevertheless, both the basic geotechnical properties and the swelling potential seem to depend not only on the montmorillonite content but also on other factors such as the nature of base exchangeable cations.

The exact knowledge about this characteristic is quite important for the manufacturer to optimize the products.

40|$|An initial {{review of}} the various {{theories}} of frost heave indicated that Miller's theory of secondary heave was the most convincing. The crucial area in this is {{the representation of the}} behaviour in the partially frozen region, known as the frozen fringe, which exists below the lowest ice lens. However, the computational difficulties of the associated mathematical model were likely to limit its application. A simpler quasi-static approach for a semi-infinite region had therefore been initiated, for a restricted range of conditions, by Holden. The work described in this thesis traces the development of the quasi-static approach and its application to the unidirectional freezing of a finite soil column. The resulting generalised model successfully predicts the freezing behaviour under a wide range of conditions. In particular, it is applicable to all overburden pressures, including zero. At low overburdens the frozen fringe disappears, but the final phase is nevertheless modelled to its ultimate equilibrium state. The predictions of the model agree with published experimental data from a number of investigators, and thus support the validity of Miller's theory. Parametric studies with the model have highlighted the importance of the hydraulic conductivity and the relationship between <b>suction,</b> <b>temperature</b> and ice content in the frozen fringe. Simulations are relatively insensitive to variations in thermal conductivity. The model has proved to be robust and stable and should form a sound basis for further studies.

The equipment cycles radically creating high peak demands and low load factors. An ice bank thermal energy storage (TES) and ice water vapor condenser were installed. The existing equipment and TES system were computer monitored to determine energy consumption and potential for load shifting. Using thermal energy storage results in a load shift of 174. 5 kw. With TES, total energy consumption and operating costs are reduced by $ 13, 400 per season. This is a result of low off-peak energy rates and increased compressor efficiency at night. The ice bank thermal energy storage system has a 4. 4 year simple payback. While building ice, the refrigeration system operated at a 6. 26 Coefficient of Performance (COP). The refrigeration system operated more efficiently at night because the compressors ran fully loaded, had a higher average <b>suction</b> <b>temperature,</b> a lower average discharge pressure, and benefitted from increased subcooling.

Afterwards, the observation that volumetric behaviour of saturated and unsaturated soils at high temperature is similar, leads to the proposal of a combined constitutive law employing <b>suction</b> and <b>temperature</b> as additional constitutive variables. The paper closes with a review of the behaviour of soils under chemical actions and with the description of a constitutive model that accounts for the effects of cation exchange in expansive clays.

In this thesis, a study of the thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) behaviour of kaolin clay under different conditions is presented. A series of experimental unsaturated tests was carried out, including <b>temperature</b> and <b>suction</b> controlled oedometer tests, and suction measurements to obtain the soil water retention curves at different temperatures. In order to describe the dependency of the soil water retention curves on temperature, the influences of temperature on the contact angle of menisci and the microstructure of the soil samples were studied. Moreover, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy was employed for studying the microstructure of the soil at certain conditions of interest. A new <b>suction</b> and <b>temperature</b> controlled oedometer cell was designed, developed and calibrated for investigating THM behaviour of kaolin clay. The oedometer was used to examine the combined effects of <b>suction</b> and <b>temperature</b> on compressibility and collapse behaviour of the soil. In this thesis, special attention was given to the filter paper methodology for suction measurements at different temperatures. The calibration curve of Whatman No. 42 filter paper was determined at 10, 25 and 50 ºC using the vapour equilibrium technique with sodium chloride solutions at different concentrations and the axis translation technique. Based on the experimental data, a unique calibration equation was proposed; taking into account the effect of temperature. The experimental results showed that temperature has a relevant influence on filter paper suction measurement and that misleading results can be obtained if temperature is not taken into account in the calibration equation...|$|R

Assuming variable suction at the plate, approximate solutions are obtained for velocity, temperature, concentration, Nusselt number, Sherwood number and skin friction.
