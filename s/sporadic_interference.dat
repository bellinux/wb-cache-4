40|$|Abstract—While {{previous}} {{interference rejection}} techniques {{suitable for the}} widely spread GSM/EDGE standard either require multiple antennas or are highly complex, this paper investigates {{the performance of a}} low-complexity single antenna interference rejection technique suitable for implementation in today’s GSM terminals. The study is performed both on the link level in different scenarios and on the system level with fully dynamic radio network simulations. The link level simulations show significant gains. For example, with a single co-channel interferer, the gain over a conventional receiver is up to 10 dB. On the system level it is shown that the introduction of the proposed interference rejection method in all terminals gives a large increase in downlink speech capacity in a tightly planned GSM network. The strong but <b>sporadic</b> <b>interference</b> in such a network is an ideal environment for efficient interference rejection...|$|E
40|$|Three {{children}} with frontonasal dysplasia associated with tetralogy of Fallot are reported. All cases had true hypertelorism and a median nasal groove with {{absence of the}} nasal tip. There was no mental deficiency. The facial anomaly is a <b>sporadic,</b> non-genetic <b>interference</b> of the normal development of the face. This is the first report of frontonasal dysplasia associated with a cardiac defect. Multifactorial inheritance of this syndrome is proposed...|$|R
40|$|A {{selection}} of statistically stable (robust) algorithms for data variance calculating has been made. Their properties have been analyzed via computer simulation. These algorithms {{would be useful}} if adopted in radio astronomy observations {{in the presence of}} strong <b>sporadic</b> radio frequency <b>interference</b> (RFI). Several observational results have been presented here to demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in RFI mitigation...|$|R
5000|$|In June 1945, the FCC {{decided that}} FM {{would have to}} move from the {{established}} 42 [...] - [...] 50 MHz pre-war band to a new band at 88 [...] - [...] 108 MHz. According to 1945 and 1946 FCC documents, the three major factors which the commission considered in its decision to place FM in the 88 [...] - [...] 108 MHz band were <b>sporadic</b> E co-channel <b>interference,</b> F2 layer interference, and extent of coverage.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{observations}} of natural mass-dependent fractionation of the isotopic composition of molybdenum (Mo), using multi-collector {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry. Variations in the isotopic composition of Mo are reported as δ 97 / 95 Mo analytical precision of δ 97 / 95 Mo is 1 ‰ between sediments deposited under anoxic conditions (δ 97 / 95 Mo = + 1. 02 to + 1. 52 ‰ 0 relative to our in-house standard) and ferromanganese nodules (δ 97 / 95 Mo = - 0. 63 to - 0. 42 ‰). δ 97 / 95 Mo of Pacific Ocean seawater (δ 97 / 95 Mo = + 1. 48 ‰) lies {{within the range of}} values for anoxic sediments, closest to modern Black Sea anoxic sediments. Molybdenites from continental ore deposits have intermediate δ 97 / 95 Mo ranging from - 0. 26 to + 0. 09 ‰. Variations in the abundances of 92 Mo, 95 Mo, 96 Mo, 97 Mo and 98 Mo are consistent with mass-dependent fractionation. A <b>sporadic</b> unidentified <b>interference</b> occurs at mass 94 and 100 Mo is not measured. We hypothesize that the δ 97 / 95 Mo offset between anoxic sediments and ferromanganese nodules results from Mo isotope fractionation during inefficient scavenging of Mo from seawater by Mn oxides under oxic conditions. The similarity in δ 97 / 95 Mo of anoxic sediments and seawater is consistent with the very efficient removal of Mo from seawater under anoxic conditions in the presence of H 2 S. The data can be interpreted in terms of a steady-state mass balance between the Mo flux into the oceans from the continents and the Mo flux out of the oceans into oxic and anoxic sediments. Such an interpretation is quantitatively consistent with existing estimates of the removal fluxes of Mo to anoxic and oxic sediments. These findings suggest that δ 97 / 95 Mo in seawater may co-vary with changes in the relative proportions of anoxic and oxic sedimentation in the oceans, and that this variation may be recorded in δ 97 / 95 Mo of anoxic sediments. Hence, the Mo isotope system may be useful in paleoredox investigations. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
