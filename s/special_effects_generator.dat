40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the improvement of verbal and nonverbal behaviors of teachers through the use of split-screen audio-video recording and systematized self-analysis. Twenty elementary teachers from the C. R. Richardson school and twenty elementary teachers from the Paul C. Garrison school in Richmond, Indiana served as subjects for the study. Each teacher was videotaped for twenty minutes on a split-screen format while teaching reading and mathematics. The tailings occurred twice with a lapse of a one month interval. The split-screen format allowed the teachers to observe personal teaching techniques well as student and teacher interaction. Self-analysis criteria for verbal and nonverbal behavior were used by each participant after viewing the tapes. Teachers in the experimental group had added assistance in the form of suggestions for improvement from their principal. The instrument selected for verbal analysis was based on the Flanders Interaction Analysis System. The instrument chosen for nonverbal analysis was based on the categories ofnonverbal characteristics formulated by Galloway and Scholl. Response alternatives were quantified one through five on a Likert-type scale for comparative analysis. Some of the items were reverse keyed in the analysis to provide positive direction on all items. A coefficient alpha calculation determined a reliability coefficient of. 90 for the verbal scale and. 87 for the nonverbal scale. Inservice meetings were held with each faculty to present theoretical knowledge of the process and an overview of the components of interaction analysis. Practice in the use of the criterion-referenced instruments to codify teacher verbal and nonverbal behaviors was provided. The video taping with split-screen capability was manipulated by two technicians. Two cameras were employed as well as a <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> <b>generator</b> to produce the split-screen effect which allowed teachers to view their own action and student action simultaneously. The t-test was used to determine statistical differences between the first and second analyses of the two recordings. Statistically significant differences were found for both the experimental and control groups on verbal behavior and on nonverbal behavior at the. 05 level. Eighty-five percent of the experimental teachers increased their scores in a positive direction on verbal behavior for an average gain of 4. 5 for the group. Nonverbal behavior scores showed an average gain of 5. 3 with ninety-five percent of experimental teachers moving in a positivedirection. Average gain of control teachers was 1. 75 on verbal and 1. 55 on nonverbal scores. Eighty percent of the control group moved in a positive direction on both verbal and nonverbal behavior. Multivariate analysis of covariance tested the hypotheses of no statistically significant differences between mean scores of the two groups on verbal and nonverbal behavior. The F value for testing verbal adjusted posttest means was 6. 642 (P/,. 014) and adjusted nonverbal posttest means was 18. 08 (P<. 0002) which were both statistically significant at the. 05 level. This study assessed a sample of elementary teachers in two mid-western elementary schools. Assessment was made in terms of improvement on verbal behavior and nonverbal behavior as perceived by teachers after analyzing video tapes made in their classrooms. The findings indicated that teacher self-analysis using feedback from split-screen video tapes was an effective vehicle for improving teacher behavior. Although limited in generalizability, if self-analysis processes could be instigated on a non. -threatening basis, positive contributions to self concept could have positive results to effectiveness and cooperation of teachers.
