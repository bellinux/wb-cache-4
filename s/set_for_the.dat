5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared <b>set</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, for the country's centennial, {{the venue}} was inaugurated as the Jubilee Stadium with an {{unofficial}} match between Belgium and the Netherlands. At that time, the stadium had {{a capacity of}} 75,000. In 1946, it was renamed Heysel Stadium after its city quarter. This new name became associated with the tragedy preceding the 1985 European Cup final between Juventus and Liverpool; 39 spectators died after riots in the then antiquated building. Three years after the disaster, plans were unveiled for a renovation; in 1995, {{after two years of}} work, the modernised stadium was named after the late King Baudouin. In May 2013, the Brussels-Capital Region announced that the King Baudouin Stadium would be replaced by Eurostadium, elsewhere on the Heysel Plateau; two years later, a 2019 date was <b>set</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stadium's completion.|$|E

5|$|James {{was born}} in Kirkdale, Liverpool, {{the son of the}} Rev. Dr. David James, who was rector of Panteg, Monmouthshire, from 1856 to 1871. Herbert James was educated at King Henry VIII Grammar School, Abergavenny, and then studied at two Oxford colleges. He matriculated at Jesus College in 1863, before winning a {{scholarship}} and moving along Turl Street to Lincoln College in 1864, obtaining a first-class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1867. He was appointed a Fellow of St John's College in 1869 and was President of the Oxford Union Society in 1871 (where he nominated H. H. Asquith to the Standing Committee). He was then ordained, and received his Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1874. Later, on 31 May 1895, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity, having previously been excused by the University from satisfying the requirements normally <b>set</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> award of the degree.|$|E
5|$|Later, but not {{precisely}} dated, eruptions from the Lassen volcanic area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which {{at first glance}} appears as a parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been more heavily glaciated and thus is older. Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak. An upper limit of 10,000years has been <b>set</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> domes next to Lost Creek (north domes). All of these domes must have risen with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake, since drained and fertilised silage fields are less {{suitable}} for breeding than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms, and the loss of many birds – up to 14,000 a year – in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets <b>set</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E
