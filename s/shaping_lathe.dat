50|$|The {{highlight}} of the large hall are the bell <b>shaped</b> <b>lathe</b> turned pillars of dark grey stone (soap stone). So well polished are the pillars that they sparkle with reflected light. According to the Kamath, this is a standard characteristic of Western Chalukya pillar art, later to become popular with the Hoysala architects as well. The main decoration on these pillars are the horizontal rings of moldings. There are other pillars on square bases whose shafts are octagonal or 16-sided with round capitals. The columns that stand between the two halls are extremely ornate and belong to an entirely different workmanship. The ceiling in the large hall between pillars are highly decorative with designs such as rosettes with imaginary beasts (Kirtimukhas) at the four corners. Mention must {{be made of the}} central domed ceiling in the large hall which rises in concentric ornamental circles. The doorjamb and lintel decoration is worthy of mention, especially {{at the entrance to the}} closed hall from the south. The sanctum is now empty but would have at one time housed a linga, the universal image of the god Shiva. Though this temple has been called a Jain temple, according to Cousens, there is no trace of any images directly related to Jainism. On the contrary, there are numerous sculptures in relief of the Hindu gods such as Shiva, Vishnu, Ganapati, Brahma and Kali.|$|R
50|$|Bowling pins are {{constructed}} by gluing blocks of rock maple wood into the approximate shape, and then turning on a lathe.

5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required <b>shapes</b> using a <b>lathe.</b> Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|R

40|$|The present work {{involves}} {{the study of}} tool deflection and tool failure due to vibration while turning on the lathe. The problem of tool failure monitoring in machining operations, has been an active area of research {{for quite a long}} time. The accurate prediction of tool failure or fracture is important to have a better product quality and dimensional accuracy. In This work Experiments were performed with mild steel as work piece and HSS as a tool material and the various machining forces have been measured experimentally. Lathe tool model being designed by taking existing lathe tool dimensions. Finite element analysis is done using ANSYS 10. 0 software tool to find natural frequency of HSS lathe tool. Modal analysis done to determine the vibration characteristics (natural frequencies and mode <b>shapes)</b> of a <b>lathe</b> tool. The Natural frequency found in Harmonic analysis is well agreed with the experimental values got from literature. The dynamic failure of lathe tool is predicted in terms of critical speed and surface roughness of work material to avoid critical frequency. Keywords...|$|R
40|$|The word tejas, from root tij ‘sharpen’ {{and hence}} {{originally}} meaning ‘sharpness’, came very soon {{to express the}} notion of a peculiar ‘substance-power’ with distinctive fiery connotations. Such notion of tejas is very prominent, especially in the epic and puranic literature, and has often attracted the attention of scholars, but its development has not yet been subjected to thorough investigation. This paper anticipates a few results of the author’s current research, offering some hints {{to bridge the gap between}} vedic and puranic usage. Although the word tejas occurs only sparingly in the Ṛg Veda, and regularly only in connection with the root meaning, as other tij-derivatives, the germs are already visible of a metaphorical extension of the basic meaning of ‘sharpness’ pointing to the later acception. The frequency increases considerably in the Atharva Veda, where tejas is usually found associated with other ‘Daseinsmächte’ such as varcas, ojas and the like. In the Brāhmaṇas tejas is consistently connected with fire as a specific ‘energy’. The upanisadic usage is heterogeneous, but a few passages can be singled out in which tejas comes decidedly to the foreground as one of the ultimate constituents of reality. Such doctrines as the well known teaching of Uddālaka Aruṇi to his son Śvetaketu in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad on the threefold propagation of being through the hierarchy of tejas, āpas and anna, and still more some later Maitrāyaṇī doctrines, may be regarded as the early antecedents of the distinctive epic-puranic development of the notion of tejas as a (kind of) energy wielded by the supreme Lord for the accomplishment of his cosmic tasks. Tejas plays a central role in some of the most characteristic mythical themes of each of the great gods of Hinduism, such as Viṣṇu’s avatāras, Śiva’s interrupted love-making to Pārvatī and Skanda’s unnatural birth from the spilt seed, the severing of Brahmā’s unauspicious fifth head, the origin of Devī, and Sūrya’s <b>shaping</b> on Viśvakarman’s <b>lathe,</b> to mention but a few. By analysing the vast corpus of tejas myths motive-wise it is possible to enucleate from the context its most significant traits, and thereby gain a deeper insight into its authentic meaning. Only a few can be mentioned here. In the Purāṇas tejas is a kind of energy with fiery connotations. In spite of its ancient association with procreation and seed, it is typically destructive — or if at all creative, it regularly carries destructive implications or undertones. Its dangerous potential can be traced back to the notion of excess which is already inherent in the rigvedic usage. Tejas may be congenital in some overpowerful beings, both animate — such as gods, demons, seers, kings — and inanimate — such as weapons and poison, but its ultimate source is the supreme Lord, who can infuse it either directly or indirectly. Hence tejas is not permanent, like a property: rather, as is appropriate to a substance-power, it is eminently liable to be lost or transferred or withdrawn in consequence of sin, impurity, defeat, death or simply purposelessness ensuing from final success. Although on the one hand the Bhagavad Gītā’s proclaim holds good that all tejas comes from the Lord, yet it also obeys its intrinsic laws, which the Lord himself cannot infringe — a paradoxical impotence on which is built the common pattern of so many avatāra myths. An explanation is to be sought in the enduring dialectic rooted deep in Indian culture and sprouting along the course of its development the conflicting branches of monism and theism, ritualism and devotion, belief in magic and surrender to grace...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} technique, â€œX-ray fluorescence spectrometry" (XRF) {{has been}} introduced in the first chapter as a precursor of its applications to soils, alloys of refractory nature, and nuclear waste. It covers the applications of the modern technique {{to the development of}} human resources. The history has been reviewed, literature surveyed, the references cited, principles described, characteristic features highlighted and the purpose of the studies defined. An XRF spectrum is a statistical phenomenon which has been reviewed theoretically in the second chapter. Primary X-rays generate the representative secondary radiation from the samples after photoelectric as well as scattering phenomena. Aggregate number of photons generated here are sensed by the detector to produce observable electrical pulses after interaction of the X-ray photons with its sensitive matter. These pulses are accumulated and processed by the processor to produce an energy spectrum in spectroscopy. The statistical functions describing the discrete as well as the continuous distributions have thus been reviewed. The shape of these distributions are affected by the transport of the photons in sample matrix. Qualitative, semi-quantitative and then quantitative elemental analyses require theoretical mechanism to convert the characteristic intensities observed from elements constituting a sample to the chemical concentrations. One amongst numerous such algorithms is called ZAF correction factor. The theoretically developed software is already available commercially. It has been used for its empirical applications during these studies. Studying a natural phenomena require representative sampling from the bulk matter and then its analysis at a laboratory scale. The available instruments have therefore been described in the third chapter. The generally available materials as well as the special ones required for use with XRF have been narrated here. The methods for applications to the liquid as well as solid samples for presentation to XRF techniques have been discussed. These contained thick samples in rugged polyethylene bottles as well as that in thin samples on a filter paper distributed homogeneously. Attenuation of the photons is reduced by presentation of the samples in sampling cups fixed with Mylar films. The thick liquid samples in polyethylene bottles were presented to the wavelength dispersive (WDXRF) spectrometer containing an X-ray tube capable of producing stable but strong primary X-ray beam. The solid samples of refractory nature, available {{in the form of a}} powder were filled in a cavity of a prepared pellet. The samples have also been mixed with in cellulose powder and subsequently pressed with a die to form a briquetted pellet. The methods have been described along with those to form a glass bead using different types of fluxes. The standard metal and alloy samples were presentable to the machine directly. They have already been <b>shaped</b> with <b>lathe</b> machines. The surfaces were washed and finished with metal free water, liquid detergents and emery papers of proper grit size. They were presented to the energy dispersive (EDXRF) system. A high voltage of 50 kV and 50 mA was applied to produce an intense primary X-ray beam in WDXRF tube where as in the EDXRF it was comparatively of low intensity and produced with a voltage of 20 kV and minimum current 0. 01 mA. The Standard (SRMs) and the certified (CRMs) reference materials used during the studies have also been described here. The experimental part of the studies has been narrated in the fourth chapter. It contains instrumental calibration method with an isotope 241 Am 95 used occasionally. However as a routine the calibration was monitored with FeK line from a standard pellet or a bead containing oxide of iron (Fe 2 O 3). The standard radioisotope has been studied and compared after presentation,as a point source as well as that on a steel planchet containing its thin film. The spectra of the isotope and that of a planchet has been compared with and without energizing the primary beam of the X-ray tube. The simultaneous nature of EDXRF system has been used for general-purpose studies of refractory materials. Efforts have been made to optimize the conditions for simultaneous studies of fissile and fission fragments of nuclear materials with WDXRF system. The basic parameters of the instrument as well as the environments of the sample have been studied. This contained studies of FeK lines using primary flux produced at different volts and current, secondary radiation from samples of different geometry in air and vacuum, pulse processorâ€™s sensitivity ranges arid pulse processing times, apertures defining the path and the size of the beam, and finally the effect of the concentrations of an element producing the analyte line. Data of the representative spectra of the elements of the periodic table and the intensities (gross, net, background, and profile) of the analyte line as a function of time of measurement has been saved in the computer memory as a base. The analyte lines are strongly effected by other elements in a sample of complex matrix. The profile intensities can be deconvoluted from the spectrum of simple matrix. Quantitative evaluations were carried out with ZAF correction factors technique. This required simple elemental profiles to be summed up to simulate a complex spectrum. This is then compared with that of an unknown by applying least square top hat fitting technique and standardization. The manufacturer of the XRF system has developed the theoretical software for this purpose. The technique has been applied during these studies to analyze natural and complex standard refractory materials of the primary rocks and soil origin. Known and determined results of a ceramic material of kaolinite origin and NIMROC standard set containing primary rock samples such as Granite, Syenite, Norite, Lujaverite, Pyroxenite, and Dunite have been compared here. Similarly, the metal alloys have also been analyzed. The alloys were iron and nickel base such as: corrosion resistant iron and iron base alloys classified as mild, low, high manganese, tool, high speed, austenitic, maraging steels; Nickel base alloys called inconel, waspealloy, monel, nimonic, incoloy, hastealloy. The sequential nature of the WDXRF using high voltage and high current has been studied and suggested for analysis of toxic radioactive materials like a nuclear waste solution in rugged polyethylene bottles. The gross and net intensities of the analyte lines as function of concentrations have also been regressed and the empirical coefficients evaluated during analyses with WDXRF studies. Fissile materials such as uranium from the actinides are burnt-up and the fission fragments like lanthanides are generated in nuclear reactors. Rationales of an analyte line ULÎ±. l have been studied by WDXRF spectroscopy whereas the mutual effects of uranium and cerium as a representative of lanthanides have been studied with EDXRF. Nuclear wastes are generated in nuclear fuel cycle. Toxicity of the materials therein demands strict monitoring of these before their disposal. Strontium as a burn-up monitor was suggested and studied in presence of other elements. This contained a nuclear waste simulated for a CANDU reactor fuel at a burn-up of 180 MWh/Kg after 0. 5 years cooling. It was diluted fifty times as pretention for reduction of activity to a permissible level (0. 5 mCi) for working in a glove box. The analyses of the experimental data led us to few observations. These have been mentioned and the results of the experiments discussed in the fifth chapter...|$|R
