50|$|Interestingly, {{there were}} {{significant}} differences in responses of participants who saw the white man portrayed as the <b>suspect</b> rather than the black man: Participants said the white <b>suspect</b> “probably hurt the victims”.

Gorham found that participants were more likely to describe the (negative) incident with adjectives, the most abstract description, if the <b>suspect</b> was presented as black and therefore outgroup, while using more concrete terms to describe the white (ingroup) <b>suspect.</b>|$|R

5|$|Some of {{the most}} well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed {{in a string of}} cases {{limiting}} the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's Mapp v. Ohio, the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home. The Gideon v. Wainwright decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents. In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in Escobedo v. Illinois, to permit <b>suspects</b> to have an attorney present during questioning. And, in 1966, Miranda v. Arizona federal decision required police to notify <b>suspects</b> of their constitutional rights, which was later extended to juveniles in the following year's in re Gault (1967) federal ruling. Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of <b>suspects,</b> police officers themselves took advantage of the ACLU. For example, when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers. In the late 1960s, civilian review boards in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU's objection.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} large cup-to-disc ratios (CDR) {{in children}} and to determine the relationship between parental CDR and clinical characteristics associated with glaucoma. Two hundred thirty six children aged 6 to 12 years with CDR ≥ 0. 6 were enrolled in this study. Subjects were classified into two groups based on parental CDR: disc <b>suspect</b> children with disc <b>suspect</b> (CDR ≥ 0. 6) parents and disc <b>suspect</b> children without disc <b>suspect</b> parents. Ocular variables were compared between the two groups. Of the 236 disc <b>suspect</b> children, 100 (42. 4 %) {{had at least one}} disc <b>suspect</b> parent. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was higher in disc <b>suspect</b> children with disc <b>suspect</b> parents (16. 52 ± 2. 66 mmHg) than in disc <b>suspect</b> children without disc <b>suspect</b> parents (14. 38 ± 2. 30 mmHg, p = 0. 023). In the group with disc <b>suspect</b> parents, vertical CDR significantly correlated with IOP (R = - 0. 325, p = 0. 001), average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (R = - 0. 319, p = 0. 001), rim area (R = - 0. 740, p = 0. 001), and cup volume (R = 0. 499, p = 0. 001). However, spherical equivalent (R = 0. 333, p = 0. 001), AL (R = - 0. 223, p = 0. 009), and disc area (R = 0. 325, p = 0. 001) significantly correlated with vertical CDR in disc <b>suspect</b> children without disc <b>suspect</b> parents, in contrast to those with disc <b>suspect</b> parents. Larger vertical CDR was associated with the presence of disc <b>suspect</b> parents (p = 0. 001), larger disc area (p = 0. 001), thinner rim area (p = 0. 001), larger average CDR (p = 0. 001), and larger cup volume (p = 0. 021). Family history of large CDR was a significant factor associated with large vertical CDR in children. In children with disc <b>suspect</b> parents, there were significant correlations between IOP and average RNFL thickness and vertical CDR...|$|R
50|$|A common {{error in}} police reports is a witness {{description}} of the <b>suspect</b> (as a witness generally describes a perpetrator, while a mug shot is of <b>suspect).</b> Frequently it is stated that police {{are looking for the}} <b>suspect,</b> when there is no suspect; the police could be looking for a <b>suspect,</b> but they are surely looking for the perpetrator, and very often it is impossible to tell from such a police report whether there is a <b>suspect</b> or not.|$|R
