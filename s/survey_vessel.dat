5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, Seeadler was recalled to Tsingtau to be prepared for any possible hostilities involving Germany. During this period, Cormoran was replaced by Condor; the two cruisers were joined by Seeadlers old consort from East Africa, the <b>survey</b> <b>vessel</b> Möwe. In early 1905, Seeadler conducted goodwill visits to the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), before returning to Tsingtau in April. On 28 June, with the Russo-Japanese War winding down following the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima, Seeadler was detached from the East Asia Squadron, permitting her return to the South Seas Station. While en route to her station area, Seeadler received an order to return to Africa during a stop at Ponape on 20 August. Her presence was necessary there to help put down a major uprising, the Maji Maji Rebellion, that had broken out in July. Seeadler ran aground twice, at Labuan and Singapore, on her way to East Africa, but neither incident resulted in damage to the ship. She arrived in Dar es Salaam on 1 October.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May 1872, Drache was recommissioned {{for service}} as a <b>survey</b> <b>vessel,</b> having had her 21cm gun removed and a deck house erected in its place. From May until 22 October, she {{surveyed}} the eastern coast of Holstein, operating from her base in Kiel. In November, Drache, Meteor, and the transport ship Rhein searched the eastern Baltic for any merchant ships {{that might have been}} damaged in a heavy storm. On 12 December, Drache returned to Wilhelmshaven, where she was again decommissioned. On 15 April 1874, the vessel was recommissioned for visits to British and Norwegian ports before being decommissioned again on 23 November in Wilhelmshaven. It was planned to send her to Spain in response to attacks on German nationals there, but the plan came to nothing. From 1875 to 1880, Drache made visits to Britain and Norway in the summer months. During this period, she underwent several additional modifications. In 1876, her masts were removed to improve her stability, and her remaining two guns were removed in 1878. Over the winter of 18791880, new boilers were installed, along with a barquentine sailing rig.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} stages of World War II, the tiny Royal Indian Navy {{consisted}} of five sloops, one <b>survey</b> <b>vessel,</b> one depot ship, one patrol vessel and numerous assorted small craft; personnel strength was at only 114 officers and 1,732 sailors. The onset of war led to an expansion in numbers of vessels and personnel. By June 1940, the navy had doubled its number in terms of both personnel and material, and expanded nearly six times of its pre-war strength by 1942. The navy was actively involved in operations during the war around the world and was heavily involved in operations around the Indian Ocean, including convoy escorts, mine-sweeping and supply, as well as supporting amphibious assaults.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December 1924, Komahashi {{was again}} {{classified}} once {{again as a}} submarine tender, however her primary task {{for the next several}} years was that of a <b>survey</b> <b>vessel,</b> charting the area around the Pescadores and the China coast. On 1 October 1931, Komahashi was assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District, and was refitted at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in early 1932 with more powerful diesel engines and survey ship facilities, a process that lasted until November 1932. Upon re-launching, she surveyed around the Luzon Strait, the South Pacific Mandate, the Kuril Islands and the Kamchatka Peninsula, collecting data on ocean currents, salinity, subsea topography and fisheries resources. One of her discoveries was the Komahashi Seamount, an underwater volcano at the northern end of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge in the Philippine Sea.|$|E

25|$|After the war, the Admiralty {{decided that}} with higher {{priorities}} in Europe, {{it would provide}} at most a single vessel for survey operations around Australia, and the Australian government was forced to create its own hydrographic surveying service. After deliberation on whether the new hydrographic service would be military or civilian operated, the government decided that surveying would be a naval responsibility, with the RAN Hydrographic Service established on 1 October 1920. A single sloop, , was commissioned into RAN service to supplement the Royal Navy <b>survey</b> <b>vessel,</b> and was later fitted with a Fairey IIID seaplane to assist with surveys of the Great Barrier Reef. Geranium was replaced by , but the new survey ship was placed in reserve once the Great Barrier Reef survey was completed in 1929. By this point, no other survey operations (military or civilian) were being performed in Australian waters.|$|E
25|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle and mutual destruction of Sydney and Kormoran during a conference in 1996, and started studying the battle in 2001. Mearns focused on primary source documents, which led him to believe that German accounts of the battle's location were truthful, {{and was able to}} convince the RAN that a search around that area was feasible. Mearns's organisation entered a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search Pty. Ltd., a not-for-profit company set up to support a search for Sydney, in late 2004. In mid-September 2004, the German government granted Mearns permission to film Kormoran if she were found. On 14 August 2005, the Australian government announced a A$1.3 million grant to the Finding Sydney Foundation (a charitable foundation set up by the directors of HMAS Sydney Search to manage funding), which was followed by A$500,000 from the Western Australian government and A$250,000 from the government of New South Wales. Several small donations were made by companies and the public, {{but it was not until}} the Australian government approved another A$2.9 million in October 2007 that the search could proceed. Even so, the money raised only permitted the chartering of the <b>survey</b> <b>vessel</b> SV Geosounder for 45 days.|$|E
