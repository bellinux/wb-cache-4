5|$|Ballpark is {{near the}} point where the Salt Lake and Utah {{interurban}} streetcar line crossed the first mainline built south from Salt Lake City (which has been known by many names, but is most associated with the Union Pacific Railroad). The TRAX tracks north of the station follow the old route of the Salt Lake and Utah, while the tracks south of the area follow those used by Union Pacific. The electrified <b>spur</b> <b>track</b> visible to the northwest of the current station is the northern continuation of the original Union Pacific mainline; only a few traces of the southern continuation of the Salt Lake and Utah line (which headed due southwest to the vicinity of UTA's Redwood Junction station before turning south) remain.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} 1860s to just before World War II {{passengers}} could ride to Kittanning Point station near the Curve. Two branch railroads {{connected to the}} main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a <b>spur</b> <b>track</b> on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built {{at the apex of}} the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.|$|E

By 1903 the trans-Altadena service was abandoned and the rails were pulled up. It took decades for the bordering properties to assume the abandoned right-of-way, and to this day slight traces of where the rail line passed through can be sleuthed out.|$|E
2500|$|The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C) built a <b>spur</b> <b>track</b> on the Peninsula Subdivision from a {{point about}} [...] east of Williamsburg (mp 33) to the York River site. The C depot was {{to be used for}} the DuPont station, which opened on June 1, 1916. In July 1916, the Williamsburg Chamber of Commerce {{requested}} the C establish passenger train service between the city and Penniman. By the fall of 1918, Penniman was a town of about 15,000 inhabitants; three passenger trains a day passed each way between Williamsburg and Penniman.|$|E
2500|$|A {{petition}} {{was received}} by the city Common Council on October 24, 1904, from the H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Company asking permission for the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Company to extend to the company's plant in South Geddes Street the <b>spur</b> <b>track</b> which was being extended to Kemp & Burpee Manufactuiong Company's plant. Following the petition, Alderman McGlade offered an ordinance granting the permission, which was unanimously adopted. The railroad started work at once and extended the track additionally to Straight Line Engine Works and the Kemp & Burpee Manufacturing Company at the same time. It was necessary to place [...] of track {{at a cost of}} no less than $25,000.|$|E

50|$|In {{less than}} a year after his arrival in Los Angeles, Perry opened the first {{furniture}} store in the city, selling some articles that he made himself and some that were shipped from San Francisco. He had no competition in the city for years, and partnered with James Brady, whom Wallace Woodworth bought out in 1858. In 1873 the firm opened a lumber yard and mill on Commercial Street. In its later expansion, the company purchased its own timberlands and organized lumber companies up and down the Pacific Coast and had logging camps, sawmills, vessels, wharves and <b>spur</b> <b>tracks</b> to railroads.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} the {{construction}} of the McGrath Highway in 1925 that full industrial development, albeit short-lived, took hold in Somerville. The Ford Motor Company built an assembly plant here in 1926, which would, over time, lend Assembly Square its name. Additionally, the Boston and Maine Railroad also owned large tracts of land in the district and the land was criss-crossed by <b>spur</b> <b>tracks.</b> With both road and rail connections, the strong transportation infrastructure was a major draw, and other industries soon followed, including First National Stores, a retail supermarket chain, which opened a grocery manufacturing and distribution center in the area.|$|R
50|$|Underneath {{the clay}} were thin veins of coal, dug from the {{beginning}} by the farmers and potters for local use. In {{the second half of}} the 1800s, regional coal mining increased to supply fuel to the growing city of Chicago. The main line of the Santa Fe Railroad was built adjacent to the prairie land, and the mines built <b>spur</b> <b>tracks</b> into the coal field to haul the coal to customers. Industrial strip mining, with motorized shovels, began in 1928. The miners left piles of tailings in the southern section of the remaining prairie, further altering the landscape.|$|R

50|$|This first tunnel {{served the}} {{railways}} for 53 years, until the track was re-laid in 1929 to diminish a curve to accommodate larger locomotives. In the process a new concrete lined curved tunnel was sunk alongside the original. Since another crossing place had also become necessary, a siding named Tunnel was fashioned {{just east of}} the tunnel by laying two level dead-end <b>spur</b> <b>tracks</b> that branched directly off {{on opposite sides of the}} main line. This allowed trains to wait in one or the other of these sidings to allow an opposing train to pass. This latter tunnel remained in use for sixty years, until the line across the pass was closed to rail traffic in 1989.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{known as}} Government Island, this {{artificial}} island {{was formed in}} 1913 by the dredging project that extended the Oakland Estuary to San Leandro Bay. The Coast Guard {{first came to the}} island in 1926 when it established [...] "Base 11" [...] under an Executive Order signed in September 1931 that gave title to a 15 acre tract for a permanent base. Improvements were started at that time and by 1933 included streets, utilities, <b>spur</b> <b>tracks,</b> a trestle bridge from Oakland, a transformer station, and rebuilding of the existing wharves. The cost was more than one and a half million dollars and provided facilities for Base 11 and the Coast Guard Store (warehouses).|$|R

Recognizing {{the importance of the}} three major railroads running through the area, he persuaded railroad executives to run <b>spur</b> <b>tracks</b> off the main lines and incorporated the adjacent three miles as the first [...] "exclusively industrial" [...] city in the Southwestern United States. He named the new city after a dirt road, Vernon Avenue, crossing its center.|$|R
