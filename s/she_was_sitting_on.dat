2500|$|On 28 September 2006, the Royal Hudson steamed {{into the}} WCRA Squamish station under her own {{power for the}} first time since October 1999. The {{restoration}} took just over one year with a cost of over $250,000. Money for the restoration was provided wholly by donations. The WCRA also had difficulty locating missing parts. Some of the major components, such as the trailing truck, were borrowed from sister engine 2850. The borrowed parts had to be returned when 2850 was put on public display. WCRA replaced the borrowed tailing truck with one that was being used at a mine, which had salvaged the truck from a Royal Hudson due for scrap.
