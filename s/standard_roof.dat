2500|$|The base 550 two-door sedan {{featured}} the identical [...] "semi-fastback" [...] roofline {{as the more}} expensive pillar-less hardtops, but had slim B-pillars that gave them a more [...] "sporty"coupe appearance. The convertible featured a new [...] "split stack" [...] folding mechanism design that allowed a full-width backseat with room for three passengers. The four-door sedans continued a traditional notchback form, albeit smoothed from the previously sharp angled roofline. The Cross Country station wagons featured a <b>standard</b> <b>roof</b> rack, all vinyl upholstery, and a drop down tailgate for carrying long loads. A third, rear-facing seat was optional with a side hinged tailgate for easier access. The Rebel 770 wagon was available after mid-year production with 3M's DI-NOC simulated wood-grain body side panels trimmed in a slim stainless steel frame.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigated regional climate {{differences and}} weather {{impacts on the}} effectiveness of cool roofs. In most US climate zones, cool roofs can reduce energy consumption because they reflect more sunlight and heat than <b>standard</b> <b>roofs.</b> Since temperatures are expected to increase in many regions, cool roofs may offer greater energy and cost savings than currently estimated. Energy consumption by Department of Energy (DOE) Research Laboratory buildings across the US with cool and <b>standard</b> <b>roofs</b> were assessed using metered energy datasets collected from 2003 - 2013. Statistical tests were conducted to compare differences in energy consumption of buildings between cool and <b>standard</b> <b>roofs</b> at sites in different climatic regions. In order to better understand the effectiveness of cool roof technologies in a future that is expected to become increasingly warmer, data collected from weather stations near each DOE site were used to interpret the potential influences of weather patterns on cool roof energy savings. This research confirmed that cool roofs do reduce energy consumption, especially at sites with warmer summers and milder winters. Regression analyses of energy consumption and temperature data were conducted to identify associations between air temperatures and heating and cooling degree-days with seasonal energy consumption. While the energy consumption of buildings with cool roofs was generally less than buildings with <b>standard</b> <b>roofs,</b> the differences in energy consumption varied depending on building use and building size...|$|R

2500|$|Green roofs require {{significantly}} more maintenance and maintenance energy {{compared to a}} <b>standard</b> <b>roof.</b> Standard maintenance include removing debris, controlling weeds, deadhead trimming, checking moisture levels, and fertilizing. The maintenance energy use for green roofs has many variables including: climate, intensity of rainfall, type of building, type of vegetation, and external coatings. The most significant effect comes from scarce rainfall which will increase the maintenance energy due to the watering required. During a 10-year roof maintenance cycle {{a house with a}} green roof requires more retrofit embodied energy than a house with a white roof. The individual components of a green roof have CO2 implications during the manufacturing process have additional implications compared to a conventional roof. The embodied energy for green roof components are [...] CO2 per square meter of green roof. This value is equivalent to 6448 g C m−2 which is significantly greater than 378 g C m−2.|$|E

40|$|A {{service life}} {{prediction}} approach for roofing membranes and systems is proposed {{based on a}} probabilistic modeling of the time-dependent performance. The membrane performance is modeled using a discrete Markov chain that evaluates the change of performance over time {{as a result of}} deterioration or repair. The transition probability matrix will be developed using in-field performance data collected during consecutive inspections for each roofing system, membrane type, age group, exposure conditions, and maintenance level. The use of in-field performance data captures the interaction and synergism of the various degradation factors, in addition to the impact of other roofing components, uncertainty and variability of material properties, environmental conditions, and quality of workmanship and maintenance. The service life is determined considering both the technical and economical performances, in addition to the risk of failure; this constitutes the first step towards the standardization of the service life prediction of roofing membranes and systems.

Rambler also {{introduced}} the industry's first four-door hardtop station wagon in 1956. The station wagons used the same rear doors as the sedans with the back roof dipped lower over the cargo area and featured a <b>standard</b> <b>roof</b> rack. The wagon models were called Cross Country. An innovation for station wagons was Rambler's roll-down tailgate window; competitors' models used upward-hinged windows.|$|E
