50|$|After Paul v. Virginia, state {{insurance}} commissioners formed the National Insurance Convention in 1871 to coordinate; this became the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners {{and then the}} National Association of Insurance Commissioners. During the first session, a uniform annual statement was adopted and life insurance companies but not fire insurance companies were required to make reserve deposits to protect their policyholders. In the second session a model law was passed; many states adopted a standard fire insurance policy known as the New York <b>Standard</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Policy</b> of 1886. It {{has been argued that}} the policy was designed to favor the industry, as it contains various conditions which, if not adhered to, render the policy void.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} the {{technical}} warranty in insurance law is instructive in showing how a rule, never very good or necessary, may, like more human creatures, so degenerate through later associations and changed conditions as to become positively bad, and so injurious to society that it must needs be brought to an end by legal process. In the United States, {{the reign of the}} technical warranty is almost over. For over a century it has been condemned by courts and text writers as an instrument of oppression and unfair dealing, and this sentence of condemnation is now being rapidly executed in the several states by the enactment of statutes wholly abolishing it as a rule of law. Even in those states, now relatively few, in which it has not been specifically abolished by statute, the warranty has been deserted even by its only friends, the underwriters. It is seldom that one now finds a trace of the warranty in the policies of reputable life insurance companies; and in the <b>standard</b> <b>fire</b> <b>policy,</b> now almost universally in use, warranties have been confined to a small and relatively un-objectionable field...|$|E

Using <b>standard</b> <b>fire</b> size classes for reporting units facilitates easy comprehension of results by fire managers already accustomed to these units. Three size classes were used: 40 ha to 121 ha (NWCG Class D), 121 ha to 405 ha (NWCG Class E), and > 405 ha (NWCG classes F and G, combined).

30|$|In Living with Fire, Sara Jensen and Guy McPherson {{explore the}} complex, and uncomfortable, {{intersection}} of today’s <b>fire</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>fire</b> science, and fire management. They consider the perceived wildland fire “crisis” to {{be a result}} of the media deluge presenting a bleak view of wildfires destroying the beloved American West. The public is confronted with the impression that there is a crisis and that must be solved to make our forests and people “fire-safe.” Living with Fire is a thought-provoking book that is not intended to solve the dilemma of our current wildland fire situation but to frame it in way that incorporates the complexities of <b>fire</b> science, <b>policy,</b> communication, information, and land management within our society’s view of <b>fire</b> <b>policy</b> and management.|$|R

Until new fire management plans were prepared, the Secretaries suspended all prescribed natural fire programs in parks and wilderness areas.|$|R
40|$|Just as {{wilderness}} ecosystems {{have been}} shaped by fire(and the condition of those ecosystems has shaped firebehavior), wilderness policy has been affected by <b>fire</b> <b>policy</b> (and vice versa). The Wilderness Act and sub-sequent wilderness bills have addressed <b>fire,</b> and <b>policy</b> has evolved to recognize the free play of fire as a natural pro-cess. Similarly, <b>fire</b> <b>policy</b> has evolved to accommodate the peculiar demands of wilderness.

40|$|The {{structural}} fire response of concrete elements is traditionally expressed {{in relation to}} <b>standard</b> <b>fires</b> as the ISO 834 and ASTM E 119 fire curves. However, the current trend towards performance-based fire design has introduced the need to evaluate the fire resistance of structural elements exposed to natural or parametric fires. In this paper the {{structural fire}} safety of concrete elements exposed to both natural <b>fires</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>fires</b> is assessed, and a reliability-based equivalent <b>standard</b> <b>fire</b> duration is determined. This equivalent fire duration is compared with other equivalency formulas, indicating that different equivalency formulas underestimate the fire severity.

40|$|For most of {{this century}} the goal of fire {{management}} in the Sierra was to control <b>fire.</b> The <b>policy</b> was aggressively and successfully applied, substantially reducing annual acres burned. This goal {{was based on a}} <b>fire</b> <b>policy</b> that emphasized keeping wildland fires as small and inexpensive as possible. As the role of fire in maintaining Sierran ecosystems has been recognized, fire has been reintroduced through the application of planned prescribed fire and prescribed natural fire. Despite changes in fire-management policy that have allowed expanded use of fire, relatively few acres have been managed using fire in the Sierra Nevada. This chapter explores options for expand-ing the role for fire in the Sierra through more liberal application of current <b>fire</b> <b>policy</b> and through changes in existing <b>fire</b> <b>policy.</b> These recommendations are tempered by the knowledge that the number of available fire-fighting resources has been steadily declining since the mid- 1970 s and that social, economic, and biological factors are making all aspects of fire management more costly and difficult...|$|R

This methodology compares the severities of real and <b>standard</b> <b>fires,</b> quantified as the areas under both fire curves. Other methods attempt to estimate “real” fire resistance rating based on the maximum temperatures that structural members develop. In general, these methodologies do not explicitly account for {{factors such as the}} type of combustible, geometry of the compartment, ventilation conditions, and heat release rate. Equations used to estimate the fire resistance rating are based on regression of limited experimental data related to tests with specific configurations and materials. Additionally, these methodologies do not consider the effect of loading conditions on the structural members, and the variation of temperature throughout the compartment.|$|R
