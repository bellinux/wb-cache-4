50|$|The {{most common}} <b>type</b> of <b>projector</b> used today {{is called a}} video projector.Video {{projectors}} are digital replacements for earlier <b>types</b> of <b>projectors</b> such as slide projectors and overhead <b>projectors.</b> These earlier <b>types</b> of <b>projectors</b> were mostly replaced with digital video projectors throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, but old analog projectors are still used at some places. The newest <b>types</b> of <b>projectors</b> are handheld projectors that use lasers or LEDs to project images. Their projections are hard {{to see if there}} is too much ambient light.|$|R
40|$|For motion imaging the {{perceived}} smoothness of a sequence highly depends on motion blur. The exposure for each frame is started {{and ended with}} a shutter mechanism. There are different implementations {{and some of them}} have non-ideal behavior which can introduce artifacts. In this paper an overview of real-world shutter implementations both for analog and digital camera systems is shown. We develop a general description that models all <b>types</b> of <b>shutters</b> and their imperfections. Specific models for common <b>shutter</b> <b>types</b> are presented. Measurements are used to estimate unknown parameters. The modeled shutters are finally used for a virtual camera simulation. Typical artifacts can be simulated and directly compared for different <b>shutter</b> <b>types</b> and parameters. This powerful tool is useful for the construction of camera systems and allows design decisions to be directly compared before building the camera system...|$|R

30|$|To achieve {{accurate}} camera pose estimation, it {{is important}} to consider a <b>shutter</b> <b>type.</b> Most vSLAM algorithms assume a global shutter, and these algorithms estimate one camera pose for each frame. However, most consumer cameras including RGB-D cameras employ rolling shutter due to its cost. In rolling shutter cameras, each row of a captured image is taken by different camera poses. It is obviously difficult to estimate camera poses of each row directly. In general, an interpolation-based approach is used to estimate rolling shutter camera pose estimation. In the literature [77 – 79], they use a spline function to interpolate a camera trajectory.|$|R
50|$|New {{compact and}} quieter Square designs, with simpler {{construction}} and greater reliability, {{were introduced in}} the 1970s. The most notable were the Copal Compact Shutter (CCS), introduced by the Konica Autoreflex TC (1976), and the Seiko Metal Focal-Plane Compact (MFC), first used in the Pentax ME (1977; all from Japan). The vertical blade type supplanted the horizontal cloth type as the dominant FP <b>shutter</b> <b>type</b> in the 1980s. Even Leica Camera (originally E. Leitz), long a champion of the horizontal cloth FP shutter for its quietness, switched to a vertical metal FP shutter in 2006 for its first digital rangefinder (RF) camera, the Leica M8 (Germany).|$|R

5000|$|... “Head Khanki Barrage” {{was built}} in 1892 on Chenab River by British to convert 3 million acres of barren land into cotton and wheat fields. The barrage was built 16-Km {{downstream}} of Alexandra Railway Bridge with stone and rubble masonry with a maximum capacity of 800,000 cusecs. The Lower Chenab Canal originates from the Barrage carrying about 11,600 cusecs of water. The weir originally was a <b>shuttered</b> <b>type</b> weir comprising 8 spans of 500 ft each and was first one in Punjab which was built upon alluvial soil. The weir got repeatedly damaged in portions {{and had to be}} remodeled extensively during 1919- 1920 and 1933- 1935. Over the time the structure showed some serious engineering defects so after detailed analysis and research it was decided to build the whole barrage a new and demolish the previous one.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the accomplishments {{and status of}} PS/EDD's (Pacific Scientific/Energy Dynamics Division) internal research and development effort to prototype and demonstrate a practical four channel laser firing unit (LFU) that uses laser diodes to initiate pyrotechnic events. The LFU individually initiates four ordnance devices using the energy from four diode lasers carried over the fiber optics. The LFU demonstrates end-to-end optical built in test (BIT) capabilities. Both Single Fiber Reflective BIT and Dual Fiber Reflective BIT approaches are discussed and reflection loss data is presented. This paper includes detailed discussions of {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of both BIT approaches, all-fire and no-fire levels, and BIT detection levels. The following topics are also addressed: electronic control and BIT circuits, fiber optic sizing and distribution, and an electromechanical <b>shutter</b> <b>type</b> safe/arm device. This paper shows the viability of laser diode initiation systems and single fiber BIT for typing military applications...|$|R

50|$|A {{projector}} or {{image projector}} is an optical device that projects an image (or moving images) onto a surface, commonly a projection screen. Most projectors create an image by shining a light {{through a small}} transparent lens, but some newer <b>types</b> of <b>projectors</b> can project the image directly, by using lasers. A virtual retinal display, or retinal projector, is a projector that projects an image directly on the retina instead of using an external projection screen.|$|R

The fine adjustment {{of the projected}} ion image is accomplished without moving mechanical parts. New methods of dry development of ion beam exposed resist materials use the selectivity of excimer laser photoablation and selective plasma resist etching. These technique are suited for in-situ processing in future production environments...|$|R
50|$|The EV Plug Alliance had {{proposed}} two connectors with <b>shutters.</b> The <b>Type</b> 3A {{is derived from}} the Scame charging connectors adding the IEC 62196 pins which is suited for single-phase charging - the connector builds on the experience with the Scame connector for charging of light vehicles (electric motorcycles and scooters). The additional Type 3C adds additional 2 pins for three-phase charging for usage at fast charge stations. Based on its origin the connector is sometimes referred to as the Scame Type 3 connector.|$|R
40|$|Polarised {{stereoscopic}} projection {{involves the}} polarisation {{of the two}} projected images in orthogonal directions - e. g. +/- 45 degrees for linear polarisation, or clockwise and counter-clockwise for circular polarisation. When LCD projectors are used for polarised stereoscopic projection {{it is important to}} take into consideration the fact that the output of these <b>types</b> of <b>projectors</b> is already polarised - but not necessarily in the directions required for stereoscopic projection. The paper considers the amount of light loss of various polarised stereoscopic projection configurations to recommend optimal configurations...|$|R
50|$|Another {{defining}} {{feature of}} the Shamal are its numerous headlamps in individual housings: outer round Carello low beams of the then-new <b>projector</b> <b>type,</b> inner rectangular high beams, combined turn signals and position lamps in the bumper, and two pairs of square lights in the lower grille—fog lamps and driving lamps.|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of sonar systems, the hydrophones, which are the basic {{acoustic}} pressure sensors for the receiving arrays, are generally fixed on a supporting structure. The vibrations of the support generate self noise on the hydrophones, that reduces the performances of the array. In fact, the output signal on a hydrophone due to the vibrations of the supporting structure comes from two contributions : - the signal related to the accelerometric sensitivity of the hydrophone, caused by the mechanical vibrations of the piezoelectric element; - the signal related to the acoustic pressure sensitivity of the hydrophone, caused by the radiation of the vibrating support in the nearfield. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to put forward these phenomena. After a brief presentation of the theory, some numerical examples of the output of hydrophones fixed on a vibrating support are first given. Then, a specific experiment is described : two experimental large area hydrophones (different with respect to their sensitivities) have been built. First, the pressure and accelerometric sensitivities are measured using conventional techniques. Then, a global experiment has been done in an acoustic facility, where the hydrophones were fixed on the head of a "Tonpilz" <b>type</b> <b>projector.</b> It is verified that the outputs of the hydrophones are formed by the two contributions mentionned above. This result may have consequences in {{the design of}} hydrophones for sonar arrays...|$|R

50|$|Incorporating a {{commercial}} made Compur <b>type</b> <b>shutter</b> required lens designers {{to accommodate the}} width of the shutter mechanism in the lens mount and provide for the means of triggering the shutter on the lens barrel or transferring this to the camera body by a series of levers as in the Minolta twin-lens cameras.|$|R
50|$|A simple leaf <b>shutter</b> is a <b>type</b> {{of camera}} <b>shutter</b> {{consisting}} of a mechanism {{with one or more}} pivoting metal leaves which normally does not allow light through the lens onto the film, but which when triggered opens the shutter by moving the leaves to uncover the lens for the required time to make an exposure, then shuts.|$|R
5|$|After {{two years}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bradbury became an {{assistant}} professor of physics at Stanford University in 1935, rising to become an associate professor in 1938, and a full professor in 1943. He became an expert on the electrical conductivity of gases, the properties of ions, and the behavior of atmospheric electricity, publishing in journals including the Physical Review, Journal of Applied Physics, Journal of Chemical Physics, and the Journal of Atmospheric Electricity and Terrestrial Magnetism. He invented the Bradbury-Nielsen <b>shutter,</b> a <b>type</b> of electrical ion gate, widely used in mass spectrometry in both time-of-flight mass spectrometers and ion mobility spectrometers.|$|R
50|$|Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a <b>type</b> of <b>projector</b> {{technology}} {{that uses a}} digital micromirror device. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997. Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for the DLP projector technology. DLP is used {{in a variety of}} display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses.|$|R

Various <b>types</b> of <b>projectors</b> are compared, and tables of video and graphic CIF formats, dimensions, weight, light output (up to 10000 lumens), and resolution classes (up to SXGA-HDTV) are presented. The paper refers {{to the problem of}} noise generated by the fans required for projector cooling. It also explains how white light is split into RGB using a prism or a filter wheel. The paper also refers to LCOS (liquid crystal on semiconductor) display panels. Problems of de-interlacing and synchronisation and of testing, are stated. It is concluded that fully electronic cinemas are now possible...|$|R
5000|$|There {{probably}} existed quite a {{few other}} <b>types</b> of <b>projectors</b> than the examples described below, but evidence is scarce and reports are often unclear about their nature. Spectators not always provided the details needed to differentiate between for instance a shadow play and a lantern projection. Many {{did not understand the}} nature of what they had seen and few had ever seen other comparable media. Projections were often presented or perceived as magic or even as religious experiences, with most projectionists unwilling to share their secrets. Joseph Needham sums up some possible projection examples from China in his 1962 book series Science and Civilization in China ...|$|R
50|$|In 1960 {{the types}} B, C and D got the rapid mirror and {{improved}} <b>shutter</b> mechanics. <b>Type</b> A {{was replaced by}} the type S which had a slower shutter. A special feature of this camera series was the exchangeable viewfinder unit. A simple top-viewfinder and a pentaprism finder were available. In 1960 the Model B had a name change and became the Edixa-Mat Flex Model B, the word Reflex being shortened to Flex, and it featured shutter speeds from 1/25 to 1/1000 of a second, the instant return mirror, automatic aperture actuation and interchangeable viewfinders. The waist-level finder was standard and the pentaprism was an optional extra. The retail price in the UK in 1960 was about £48.|$|R
5000|$|Gene Dolgoff began {{thinking}} about different <b>types</b> of <b>projectors</b> in college in 1968 {{as a way}} to produce a video projector that would be brighter than the then-available CRT projectors. The idea was to use elements referred to as [...] "light valves" [...] to regulate the amount of light that passes through it, such as in traditional slide projectors. This would allow the use of a very powerful external light source. After looking at many different materials, he thought that liquid crystals would allow to modulate the light as planned. However, direct-driven, matrix-addressed LCDs with sufficient resolution for video images were not available at the time, so that Dolgoff could not yet do experiments.|$|R
40|$|There {{are some}} {{disadvantages}} {{in the traditional}} segmental baffle heat exchanger for the transversal fluid flow in its shell side, such as the high flow resistance, large heat transfer dead region, and so on. For overcoming those above disadvantages, a kind of new efficient and energy saving shell-and-tube heat exchanger with sidelling flow in shell side is developed, the traditional segmental baffles are substituted by leading <b>type</b> <b>shutter</b> baffles, therefore, the fluid in some local regions flows over tubes inclinedly. The velocity distribution and velocity variation at the same position of main flow region in sidelling flow heat exchanger and segmental baffle heat exchanger is studied and compared. It is confirmed that, with the leading <b>type</b> <b>shutter</b> baffles in shell side, the vortex in shell side is weaken, flow field is greatly homogenized, and the velocity in shell side is increased. Shutter baffles are helpful to reduce the pressure drop in shell side and increase effective heat transfer area, which provides references for structure improving of shell-and-tube heat exchanger...|$|R
