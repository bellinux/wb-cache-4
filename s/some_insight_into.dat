5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public <b>some</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> his recent business activities.|$|E
5|$|In his Botanical Gardens and Botanical Literature in the Eighteenth Century (1961), Stearn {{provides}} <b>some</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> {{his interpretation}} of botanical history: The progress of botany, as of other sciences, comes from the interaction of so many factors that undue emphasis on any one can give a very distorted impression of the whole, but certainly {{among the most important}} of these for any given period are the prevailing ideas and intellectual attitudes, the assumptions and stimuli of the time, for often upon them depends the extent to which a particular study attracts an unbroken succession of men of industry and originality intent on building a system of knowledge and communicating it successfully to others of like mind.|$|E

While pregnant, she escapes to London and gives birth to a son, Linton.|$|E
25|$|Elijah is revered as {{the spiritual}} Father and {{traditional}} {{founder of the}} Catholic religious Order of Carmelites. In addition to taking their name from Mt. Carmel where the first hermits of the order established themselves, the Calced Carmelite and Discalced Carmelite traditions pertaining to Elijah focus upon the prophet’s withdrawal from public life.

25|$|Avellaneda's {{identity}} {{has been the}} subject of many theories, but there is no consensus as to who he was. In its prologue, the author gratuitously insulted Cervantes, who not surprisingly took offense and responded; the last half of Chapter LIX and most of the following chapters of Cervantes' Segunda Parte lend <b>some</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> the effects upon him; Cervantes manages to work in some subtle digs at Avellaneda's own work, and in his preface to Part II, comes very near to criticizing Avellaneda directly.|$|E
25|$|In 1346, {{when the}} Prince (aged 16) {{was about to}} leave with his father for his first {{campaign}} in France, which culminated in the battle of Crecy, a Council was set up to manage on his behalf his various manors and lordships throughout the country. The transactions of this Council were recorded and have been printed and published by the Public Record Office.

25|$|Before he {{directed}} the episode, director Chris Hardwell spent five {{weeks on the}} Numb3rs set watching {{the cast and crew}} film the series.

He also directed guest star Robin Weigert to act like the perfect housewife in order to disguise the plot twist. Several scenes were shot at Caltech, including one near the Beckham Auditorium and one at an outdoor restaurant. For the final scene, Hardwell used a crane shot on the Numb3rs sound stage.|$|E

25|$|Human Oa1 {{gene product}} was {{initially}} {{identified as a}} 60kDa protein formed from a 46-48kDa precursor. The OA1 disease is due to defect in the OA1 receptor. This receptor {{has been shown to}} be similar to class C G- protein coupled receptors (GPCR). OA1 receptor has a characteristic GPCR structure-7 transmembrane helices with 3 cytoplasmic loops and 3 extracellular loops and an extracellular N- terminus and cytoplasmic C-terminus. Recently the ligand activating this receptor was found. A recent computational work has provided <b>some</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> the three-dimensional structure of this protein and its dynamic interactions with its known ligands.|$|E
25|$|The venture was not successful. Already {{struggling}} {{after years}} of industrial disputes, Rover had a poor reputation but in trying to improve its image it would become a rival to the BMW market segment. BMW {{found it difficult to}} reposition the English automaker alongside its own products and the Rover division was faced with endless changes in its marketing strategy. In the six years under BMW, Rover was positioned as a premium automaker, a mass-market automaker, a division of BMW and an independent unit. A five-part BBC documentary, When Rover Met BMW (1996), gave <b>some</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> the difficulties faced by the two firms.|$|E
25|$|Geoffrey {{mentions}} {{a similar}} tale just before that episode, however, {{which may be}} an unintentional duplication. Just after the Romans leave, the archbishop of London is put forward by the representatives of Britain to organise the island's defences. To do so, he arranges for continental soldiers to come to Britain. The name of the bishop is Guitelin, a name similar to the Vitalinus mentioned in the ancestry of Vortigern and to the Vitalinus said to have fought with Ambrosius at the Battle of Guoloph. This Guithelin/Vitalinus disappears from the story as soon as Vortigern arrives. All these coincidences imply that Geoffrey duplicated {{the story of the}} invitation of the Saxons, and that the tale of Guithelinus the archbishop might possibly give <b>some</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> the background of Vortigern before his acquisition of power.|$|E

25|$|Born in Prague (then {{part of the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire), Werfel was {{the first}} of three {{children}} of a wealthy manufacturer of gloves and leather goods, Rudolf Werfel. His mother, Albine Kussi, was the daughter of a mill owner. His two sisters were Hanna (born 1896) and Marianne Amalie (born 1899). His family was Jewish. As a child, Werfel was raised by his Czech Catholic governess, Barbara Šimůnková, who often took him to mass in Prague’s main cathedral. Like the children of other progressive German-speaking Jews in Prague, Werfel was educated at a Catholic school run by the Piarists, a teaching order that allowed for a rabbi to instruct Jewish students for their Bar Mitzvahs. This, along with his governess’s influence, gave Werfel an early interest (and expertise) in Catholicism, which soon branched out to other faiths, including Theosophy and Islam, such that his fiction, as well as his nonfiction, provides <b>some</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> comparative religion.|$|E
25|$|Some {{distinguish}} delusional and non-delusional {{forms of}} ORS. In the delusional type, there is complete {{conviction that the}} odor is real. In the non-delusional type, the individual is capable of <b>some</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> the condition, and can recognize that the odor might not be real, and that their level of concern is excessive. Others argue that reported cases of ORS present a spectrum of different levels of insight. Since sometimes the core belief of ORS is not of delusional intensity, {{it is argued that}} considering the condition as a form of delusional disorder, as seems to occur in the DSM, is inappropriate. In one review, in 57% of cases the beliefs were fixed, held with complete conviction, and the individual could not be reassured that the odor was non existent. In 43% of cases the individual held the beliefs with less than complete conviction, and was able to varying degrees to consider the possibility that the odor was not existent.|$|E
25|$|Neoteny {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other species. It {{is important to note}} the difference between partial and full neoteny when looking at other species in order to distinguish between juvenile traits that are only advantageous in the short term and traits that provide a benefit throughout the organism’s life; this might then provide <b>some</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> the cause of neoteny in those species. Partial neoteny is the retention of the larval form beyond the usual age of maturation with the possibility of the development of sexual organs progenesis, but eventually the organism still matures into the adult form; this can be seen in Lithobates clamitans. Full neoteny is seen in Ambystoma mexicanum and some populations of Ambystoma tigrinum, which remain in their larval form for the duration of their life. Lithobates clamitans is partially neotenous: it delays its maturation through the winter season, because it is not advantageous for it to metamorphose into the adult form until there are more resources available: it can find those resources much more easily in the larval form. This would fall under both of the main causes of neoteny; the energy required to survive in the winter as a newly formed adult is too costly, so the organism exhibits neotenous characteristics until a time when it is capable of better survival as an adult. Ambystoma tigrinum retains its neotenous features for a similar reason, however the retention is permanent {{due to the lack of}} resources available throughout its lifetime. This is another example of an environmental cause of neoteny in that the species retains juvenile characteristics because the environment limits the ability of the organism to fully come into its adult form. A few species of birds show partial neoteny. A couple of examples of such species are the manakin birds Chiroxiphia linearis and Chiroxiphia caudata. The males of both species retain their juvenile plumage into adulthood, but they eventually lose it once they are fully mature. In certain species of birds the retention of juvenile plumage is often linked to the molting times within each species. In order to ensure there is no overlap between the molting and mating times, the birds may show partial neoteny in regards to their plumage so that the males do not attain their bright adult plumage before the females are prepared to mate. In this instance, neoteny is present because there is no need for the males to molt early and it would be a waste of energy for them to try to mate while the females are still immature.|$|E
