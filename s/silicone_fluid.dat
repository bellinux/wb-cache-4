40|$|The {{effects of}} the size of the {{particles}} of ATH filler on the life of room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone rubber coating was studied in a salt-fog chamber. The median particle sizes examined were 1. 0, 4. 5, 13, 17 and 75 μm. The optimum size giving the lowest leakage current and the longest time to failure of the coating was determined. The particle size affected the roughness of the coating. The roughness was enhanced after a prolonged test in salt-fog. The leakage current affected the amount of <b>silicone</b> <b>fluid</b> on the surface. The amount of <b>silicone</b> <b>fluid</b> present on the surface after exposure to dry-band arcing in salt-fog was a function of the particle size. Measurements of surface roughness, the amount of <b>silicone</b> <b>fluid</b> on the surface, and the leakage current combined with theoretical analysis of the heat of conduction, lead to identification of the mechanisms by which the size of the ATH particle impart resistance to tracking and erosion. The influences of the coating thickness, different substrates, addition of <b>silicone</b> <b>fluid</b> to the coating system and different carrier solvents on the leakage current, pulse current count rates and the life of the RTV coatings were investigated. It was found that all these parameters affected the electrical performance in salt-fog. The content of low molecular weight (LMW) <b>silicone</b> <b>fluid</b> and the diffusion of LMW from the bulk to the surface were determined.

40|$|Room {{temperature}} vulcanized (RTV) {{silicone rubber}} is extensively used in power system {{due to its}} hydrophobicity and hydrophobicity transfer ability. Temperature has been proven to markedly affect the performance of silicone rubbers. This research investigated the degradation of RTV silicone rubber under temperature cycling treatment. Hydrophobicity and its transfer ability, hardness, functional groups, microscopic appearance, and thermal stability were analyzed using the static contact angle method, a Shore A durometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetry (TG), respectively. Some significant conclusions were drawn.
