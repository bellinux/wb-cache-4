50|$|Air-operated pinch valves {{generally}} only {{consist of}} an extremely elasticised reinforced rubber hose, {{a type of}} housing, and two <b>socket</b> <b>end</b> covers or flanges. The rubber hoses of the air operated pinch valves are usually press-fitted and centred into the housing ends by the <b>socket</b> <b>end</b> covers or flange.Since they function without any additional actuators, all they need to close or operate is a pressurized air supply into the valve body. As soon as the air supply becomes interrupted and the volume of air exhausts, the elastic rubber hose starts to open due to {{the force of the}} process flow.|$|E
50|$|Extension cords come {{in various}} colors, lengths, {{thicknesses}} and service duties. In general, the more power {{needed by the}} appliance, the thicker the cord needs be (meaning larger wires inside). Cords which will be used outdoors, in wet areas, around oils, or exposed to sunlight {{for long periods of}} time should be selected for such specific conditions.An extension reel is an extension lead that rolls up, usually into the <b>socket</b> <b>end,</b> which in some cases has more than one socket on it (often 2 or 4). Another type of extension reel hangs near the plug end and permits the user to draw the cord out by grasping the <b>socket</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
40|$|The pile {{load testing}} methods could be broadly {{classified}} into three categories: static, rapid and dynamic {{depending on the}} rate of loading. In this paper, the rapid load testing method {{referred to as the}} Statnamic test is discussed. The commonly used analysis method of the statnamic testing referred to as the Unloading Point (UP) method is used successfully for the floating piles but validity of some of the assumptions of the unloading point method to end bearing bored piles is questionable. Due to this problem, other analytical methods such as: Modified Unloading Point (MUP) method, Segmental Unloading Point (SUP) method and other signal matching techniques are introduced by some researches. Therefore, the validity of the unloading point method to rock <b>socketed</b> <b>end</b> bearing bored piles in Sri Lanka is investigated in this paper. This investigation is carried out using the commonly used wave number. Furthermore, the wave equation method, commonly used numerical procedure to model dynamic behavior of piles, is used by the author to investigate the validity of the assumptions associated with the unloading point method to rock <b>socketed</b> <b>end</b> bearing bored piles...|$|R
5000|$|Wobble {{extensions}} {{have their}} <b>socket</b> attachment <b>ends</b> ground {{to allow the}} socket-extension interface to bend up to about 15 degrees. This additional flexibility often makes using a socket + extension in a cramped location easier. A 1" [...] to 1-1/2" [...] long wobble extension added {{to the end of}} any extension will convert it to a slightly longer [...] "wobble" [...] extension.|$|R
50|$|Powerpole {{connectors}} {{are physically}} and electrically hermaphroditic, thus avoiding {{the need to}} worry about which end is the plug and which the <b>socket,</b> or which <b>end</b> has the correct polarity. This is in contrast to the physically- but not electrically-hermaphroditic two-wire trailer plug.|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{overloading}} can be {{a problem}} with any sort of power distribution adapter. This is especially likely if multiple high-power appliances are used, such as those with heating elements, like room heaters or electric frying pans. Power strips may have a circuit breaker integrated to prevent overload. In the UK, power strips are required to be protected by the fuse in the BS 1363 plug. Some also feature a 13A BS1362 fuse in the <b>socket</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{countries}} where the sockets are polarised, polarity testing is a simple test that {{can be carried out}} using a polarity tester to determine whether the active and neutral of the plug end are correctly connected to the corresponding terminals at the <b>socket</b> <b>end.</b> Note: The earth is tested during the earth continuity test. In the UK, as per BS7671, the phase ('Live' or 'Hot') cable should connect with right hand side terminal of the socket (if we face the socket outlet).|$|E
50|$|Caps, usually liquid- or gas-tight, {{cover the}} {{otherwise}} open {{end of a}} pipe. A cap attaches to the exterior of a pipe, and may have a solvent-weld <b>socket</b> <b>end</b> or a female-threaded interior. The exterior of an industrial cap may be round, square, rectangular, U- or I-shaped, or may have a handgrip. If a solvent-weld cap is used to provide for a future connection point, several inches of pipe must be left before the cap; when the cap is cut off for the future connection, enough pipe must remain to allow a new fitting to be glued onto it.|$|E
50|$|Powerpole {{connectors}} {{are physically}} and electrically hermaphroditic, thus avoiding {{the need to}} worry about which end is the plug and which the <b>socket,</b> or which <b>end</b> has the correct polarity, {{as is the case with}} the physically but not electrically hermaphroditic 2-wire trailer plug.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{components}} subjected to contact stress as local compressive stress {{is important in}} engineering application especially in ball and socket Joining. Two kinds of contact stress are introduced in the ball and socket joint, the first is from normal contact while the other is from sliding contact. Although joining two long links (drive shaft in steering cars) will cause the effect of flexural and tensional buckling stress in hollow columns through the ball and <b>socket</b> <b>ends</b> on the failure condition of the joining mechanism. In this paper the consideration of the combined effect of buckling Load and contact stress on the ball and socket joints have been taken, epically on the stress distribution in the contact area. Different parameters have been taken {{in the design of}} joint. This is done by changing the angles for applied loads with the principle axis, the angle of contact between ball and socket and using different applied loads. The problem has been solved using analytical solution for computing the critical loads and using these loads for calculating the stress distribution with finite element method using ANSYS 10. The numerical results have been compared with the experimental method using photo elasticity pattern which shows good agreement between experimental and simulation results...|$|R
50|$|Locomotives {{equipped}} {{according to}} this standard will usually have two <b>sockets</b> at each <b>end</b> of the locomotive, and carriages will usually also {{have one or two}} sockets. Loose cables are then used to establish connection between the locomotive and the carriages, as well as from carriage to carriage.|$|R
50|$|Before 2007 it was {{questioned}} whether the Roman aqueduct at Lincoln had ever worked as {{there was no evidence}} of limescale in any of the lengths of pipe that had been uncovered. Construction on a housing estate close to the Nettleham showed that there was limescale , indicating that the aqueduct had been in use. This length of the aqueduct had ceramic pipes, joined with collared joints , but other lengths of the aqueduct had pipes which were about 7.5 inches in diameter, narrowing to 4 inches and when laid, the narrow or spigot end of the pipe fitted into the broad or <b>socket</b> <b>end</b> of the next pipe.|$|E
50|$|Several plesiomorphic (primitive) {{features}} characterize Andesaurus as {{the most}} basal known member of Titanosauria. In fact, this clade has been defined to contain Andesaurus, Saltasaurus, their most recent common ancestor, {{and all of its}} descendants. The most prominent plesiomorphy is the articulations between its tail vertebrae. In most derived titanosaurs, the tail vertebrae articulate with ball-and-socket joints, with the hollowed-out <b>socket</b> <b>end</b> on the front (procoelous caudal vertebrae), while in Andesaurus, both ends of the vertebrae are flat (amphiplatyan caudals), as seen in many non-titanosaurian sauropods. Andesaurus itself is only characterized by a single feature, the tall neural spines on top of its back vertebrae, and needs further study.|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} of a long-range guided wave inspection technique called “magnetostrictive sensor (MsS) ” for inspection of suspender ropes was field-evaluated on the George Washington Bridge (GWB) in New York City. From a test location above the sidewalk of the bridge, a pulse of 10 -kHz longitudinal guided waves was launched {{along the length}} of the suspender and the reflected signals from geometric features and defects in the suspender were detected without requiring any paint removal. The test results showed that, from a single test location and without scanning the sensor along the rope, the MsS technique could examine the entire length of the suspender rope (from the socket to the main cable including the region over the main cable band) that was up to more than 100 -meters (330 -feet) long. The field tests indicated therefore that the MsS technique has good potential for providing a very cost- and performance-effective method of inspecting suspender ropes including areas that are remote and difficult to access, such as the <b>socket</b> <b>end</b> of the rope below the sidewalk and the region over the main cable band...|$|E
50|$|A half-blind {{dovetail}} is {{used when}} the craftsman {{does not wish}} end grain to be visible {{from the front of}} the item. The tails are housed in <b>sockets</b> in the <b>ends</b> of the board that is to be the front of the item so that their ends cannot be seen.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty <b>sockets</b> at one <b>end,</b> which probably contained organic material such as bristle, to make a brush. The size of these would be appropriate for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.|$|R
50|$|An elbow is {{installed}} between two lengths of pipe (or tubing) {{to allow a}} change of direction, usually a 90° or 45° angle; 22.5° elbows are also available. The ends may be machined for butt welding, threaded (usually female), or <b>socketed.</b> When the <b>ends</b> differ in size, it {{is known as a}} reducing (or reducer) elbow.|$|R

5000|$|The main {{bridge is}} a {{stiffened}} suspension structure of an uncommon type, inasmuch {{as the main}} cables, after leaving the towers, are carried upwards to an anchorage in the sandstone cliffs above the bridge, instead of downwards, as is usually the case. The main span is of 226 ft feet centres, carried by suspension rods from the cables, {{of which there are}} fourteen {{on either side of the}} bridge. The cables have <b>socketed</b> <b>end</b> connections secured to steel girders in anchorages cut out of the solid rock and accessible for inspection. The stiffening trusses are of steel, hinged at the towers and also at the centre, to allow for the rise and fall of the cables due to temperature changes. The roadway is of timber planking, 15 ft feet wide between kerbs, carried on timber stringers and cross girders. In addition to the main span there are seven timber approach spans, built on a curve to meet the roadway on either side of the river. The approaches include a considerable retaining wall on the Maldon side. The materials required have been supplied under various contracts. The cables were imported, the steel and ironwork in stiffening trusses etc. manufactured by Clyde Engineering Company, and the timber supplied by various firms. The erection of the structure has been carried out by day labour, under Inspector James McCall, of the Public Works Department. The total cost, including contracts mentioned above and road work in approaches, was £8000." ...|$|R
5000|$|Port arrays {{in which}} the port {{orientation}} is perpendicular to the array orientation generally have fewer blockage problems. External [...] "Octopus" [...] or [...] "Squid" [...] hubs (with each <b>socket</b> at the <b>end</b> of a very short cable maybe 2 inches long), or [...] "star" [...] hubs (with each port facing in a different direction, as pictured) avoid this problem completely.|$|R
50|$|Exposed live grounds are dangerous. They are live, and can electrocute {{end users}} if touched. Headphone <b>sockets</b> fitted by <b>end</b> users to live chassis TVs are {{especially}} dangerous, {{as not only}} are they often live, but any electrical shock will pass through the user’s head. Sets that have both a headphone socket and a live chassis use an audio isolation transformer to make the arrangement safe.|$|R
50|$|Rotary {{broaching}} {{is another}} common operation. The broach holder is mounted stationary while its internal live spindle and end cutting broach tool {{are driven by}} the workpiece. As the broach is fed into or around the workpiece, the broach's contact points are constantly changing, easily creating the desired form. The most common form made this way is a hexagonal <b>socket</b> in the <b>end</b> of a cap screw.|$|R
50|$|The {{cable is}} {{available}} in both stranded and solid conductor forms. The stranded form is more flexible and withstands more bending without breaking. Permanent wiring (for example, the wiring inside the wall that connects a wall socket to a central patch panel) is solid-core, while patch cables (for example, the movable cable that plugs into the wall <b>socket</b> on one <b>end</b> and a computer on the other) are stranded.|$|R
5000|$|Extensions, {{sometimes}} called [...] "extender arms", attach to a <b>socket</b> on one <b>end</b> and a ratchet {{on the other}} end of the extension. These [...] "extend" [...] the length of the socket and allow access to nuts or bolts that are difficult to reach. Extensions are typically 1/2" [...] to 20" [...] in length in roughly 1" [...] to 3" [...] increments. They are sometimes attached together to get a needed length extension.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1949 (as {{unveiled}} {{and demonstrated}} in October at the Motor Cycle Show at Earls Court, London) an optional mechanical reversing device became available which comprised a long lever with a ratchet and a hexagonal <b>socket</b> on the <b>end</b> which fitted onto {{the centre of the}} driver's side rear wheel hub. This device could then be operated from the driving seat and allowed the car to be cranked backwards by hand to assist with maneuvering.|$|R
5000|$|Later, in 1987 a {{much cheaper}} [...] "baseband" [...] version, also running at 2 Mbit/s {{connected}} computers in daisy-chain style using twisted-pair cables with RJ11 connectors and CSMA/CD. [...] Interface cards had two RJ11 sockets for connecting to {{left and right}} neighbor nodes. The unused <b>sockets</b> at the <b>ends</b> of the network segment had to be fitted with a terminator {{on one end of}} the chain and a wrap plug on the other. A hybrid star topology was possible using a hub.|$|R
50|$|Chip's Challenge {{consists}} {{of a series of}} 148 two-dimensional levels (149 in Microsoft's version) which feature the player character, Nerdy Chip McCallahan, often called just Chip, and various game elements such as computer chips, buttons, locked doors, water and lethal monsters. Gameplay involves using arrow keys, directional pad or mouse to move Chip about each of the levels in turn, collecting enough chips to open the chip <b>socket</b> at the <b>end</b> of each level, get to the exit, and {{move on to the next}} level.|$|R
50|$|Crosses, {{also known}} as four-way {{fittings}} or cross branch lines, have one inlet and three outlets (or vice versa), and often have solvent-welded <b>socket</b> or female-threaded <b>ends.</b> Cross fittings may stress pipes as temperatures change, because {{they are at the}} center of four connection points. A tee is steadier than a cross; it behaves like a three-legged stool, and a cross behaves like a four-legged stool. Geometrically, any three non-collinear points can self-consistently define a plane; three legs are inherently stable, whereas four points overdetermine a plane, and can be inconsistent, resulting in physical stress on a fitting.|$|R
50|$|The scene {{switches}} to daytime, and the wealthy man {{returns to the}} site of the hostel with the police. Rather than the hostel, there is a cemetery with a funeral in progress. Laughing off the incident as confusion, the man and police leave. The coffin is the same from which the hostel proprietor rises at the beginning of the film. The movie itself ends with the proprietor walking in the graveyard. He ultimately turns to the camera as the image shifts quickly to a skull wearing the same hat as the proprietor. As blood flows from the empty eye <b>sockets,</b> the film <b>ends.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bar can be {{articulated}} at its extremities {{and work}} at its permissible stress, but this requires close <b>end</b> <b>sockets</b> or attachment mechanisms whose volume is far from negligible, especially if the bar is short or highly stressed. As L.H. Cox demonstrated, in this case, it is worth taking into account n bars each with a cross-section of Ω/n, strained by force F/n with 2n sockets, instead of one bar with a cross-section Ω strained by a force F with 2 sockets, since the total volume of 2n sockets {{in the first case}} is much less than that of 2 sockets in the second.|$|R
5000|$|A can wrench is {{a wrench}} made {{to open a}} {{telephone}} distribution terminal also called a telco can or demarcation point box. One end of the can wrench is a 7/16 inch hex socket used for recessed fasteners on closures, and the other end is a 3/8 inch hex socket for use on binding posts. The wrench is {{also referred to as}} a 216C tool which was the Bell System specification version. They are often insulated against electric shock. The hex <b>socket</b> on each <b>end</b> is a thin wall thickness to allow the outside diameter to be placed into the tight recessed access often found on telco cans and demarc boxes.|$|R
5000|$|Special twinkle bulbs {{often have}} special bases {{which they are}} {{permanently}} glued into, to keep the user from putting too many in a strand, or into strands not designed for them. General Electric produced sets in the late 1970s or early 1980s with special green-tipped clear [...] "fuse" [...] bulbs that had special bases {{at both ends of}} a set. Modern sets also often have larger <b>sockets</b> at each <b>end</b> of each circuit (i.e. two circuits of 50 in a typical 100 incandescent set) because of the third wire, and therefore a different wedge base with a wider separator that cannot be inserted into other regular sockets.|$|R
60|$|After going {{upward and}} onward for some time, they came at length to the {{entrance}} of one of the long galleries of sculpture. Here the torch bearers stopped and began to prepare their torches. They cut the long candles in two, so as to make pieces about eighteen inches long. Taking six or eight of these pieces, they placed them together like a bundle of sticks, and tied them, and then crowded the ends together into the <b>socket</b> upon the <b>end</b> of the pole. This socket was made large enough to receive them. They then lighted the wicks, and thus they had a large number of candles all burning together as one.|$|R

50|$|Special {{terminals}} are provided, {{which are}} inserted, using a special tool, into {{the holes in}} the prototyping board where components are to be fitted. Some boards are also available pre-populated with terminals. Each terminal is a metal tube with a component <b>socket</b> at one <b>end</b> and an insulation-displacement fork at the other. The component socket accepts a wire lead, such as the lead of a resistor or capacitor, or the leg of a 0.1-inch-pitch DIL package. The insulation-displacement fork accepts an insulated wire specially manufactured for the Speedwire system. The wire is pressed between the forks using a special tool. The forks cut through the insulation and grip the wire, making a gas-tight contact. The wire can then be cut off, or continued to another terminal. Wires can be pulled out of terminals and re-routed.|$|R
