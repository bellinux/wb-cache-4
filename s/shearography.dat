50|$|When {{a surface}} area is {{illuminated}} {{with a highly}} coherent laser light, a stochastical interference pattern is created. This interference pattern is called a speckle, and is projected on a rigid camera's CCD chip. Analogous with Electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI), to obtain results from the speckle we need to compare it with a known reference light. <b>Shearography</b> uses the test object itself as the known reference; it shears the image so a double image is created. The superposition of the two images, a shear image, represents {{the surface of the}} test object at this unloaded state. This makes the method much less sensitive to external vibrations and noise. By applying a small load, the material will deform. A nonuniform material quality will generate a nonuniform movement of the surface of the test object. A new shearing image is recorded at the loaded state and is compared with the sheared image before load. If a flaw is present, it will be seen.|$|E
5000|$|For aircraft, satellite, {{and other}} {{critical}} components, {{the requirements for}} quality may be very strict. Using a test method, such as manual tap testing, to produce audible sounds is not reliable. Small defects, or those several layers deep, may be very difficult, if not impossible, to detect. The change in pitch becomes slight enough that the human ear cannot resolve it. Using sound is also subjective and dependent on the inspector's quality of hearing as well as judgement. Any intentional variations in the part may also change the pitch of the produced sound, influencing the inspection. Some of these variations include ply overlaps, ply count change gores, core density change (if used), and geometry. While these features can all exist in the same part and sound different from each other, none are defects. Inspection methods such as ultrasound, infrared thermography, <b>shearography,</b> and radiography produce quantifiable results and all have much higher resolution capability than manual tap testing.|$|E

Despite being a relative young technique, {{it has already}} received considerable industrial acceptance, in particular, for nondestructive testing. One major difference of <b>shearography</b> from other NDT techniques is the mechanics of revealing flaws. <b>Shearography</b> reveals defects in an object by identifying defect-induced deformation anomalies which are more relevant to structural weakness. Other applications of <b>shearography</b> include strain measurement, material characterization, residual stress evaluation, leak detection, vibration studies and 3 -D shape measurement. Introduction: <b>Shearography</b> is an optical method for measuring surface deformation.

The calibration is based on the <b>shearography</b> measurement of known rigid-body rotations of a flat plate and accounts for the local variability of the shearing distance. The correction procedure further compensates for the variability of the sensitivity vector and separates the two out-of-plane deformation gradients when they are coupled in the measurement.

40|$|Abstract. Composite materials, such as FRP and {{honeycomb}} structures, {{are used}} for crucial structures in aircraft. Critical defects that weaken {{the strength of the}} composite structures are delamination and debonding. In order to assure the safety and reliability of a composite structure, these defects should be inspected using appropriate techniques that are nondestructive. Although various nondestructive evaluating techniques exist for inspecting composite structures, a novel technique is required in the industrial field for non-contacting and real time inspection. Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry(ESPI), {{which is one of the}} optical techniques that exist to precisely measure displacement, uses a CCD camera and a computer aided technique to show the resulting image in real time. <b>Shearography</b> is one of the robust ESPI techniques that allow non-contacting, full-field observation of surface displacement derivatives. In this study, a nondestructive <b>shearography</b> was applied to detect and characterize internal defects of composite materials for both CFRP laminates and honeycomb structure. For this purpose, CFRP laminated and honeycomb structured panels containing artificial delamination and debonding with different sizes and locations were used.

40|$|Image-shearing {{speckle pattern}} interferometry, more {{commonly}} referred to as ‘shearography’, is a full-field, laser-based interferometric technique first developed for applications in experimental mechanics [1, 2]. <b>Shearography</b> is sensitive to derivatives of the out-of-plane surface displacement of a body under load, as opposed to other full-field methods such as holographic interferometry and conventional speckle pattern interferometry, which typically contour the surface displacement directly [3]. The early <b>shearography</b> experiments used high-resolution photographic film to record images of the laser speckle patterns. In contrast to traditional film-based techniques, electronic <b>shearography</b> uses an electronic camera for image recording [4]. This technology, commercially available for the past several years, has received much interest within the NDE community because of its potential for rapid, non-contacting optical inspection of large areas. While there are advantages and disadvantages specific to either imaging medium, electronic <b>shearography</b> is the clear choice for industrial inspection because image acquisition and processing is accomplished at a video frame rate of 30 Hz to produce shearographic fringe patterns in real time.
