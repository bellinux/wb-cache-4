25|$|Centipedes live in many {{different}} habitat types—forest, savannah, prairie, and desert, to name a few. Some geophilomorphs are adapted to littoral habitats, where they feed on barnacles. Species of all orders excluding the Craterostigmomorpha have adapted to caves. Centipede densities have been recorded as high as 600/m2 and biomass as high as 500mg/m2 wet weight. Small geophilomorphs attain highest densities, followed by small lithobiomorphs. Large lithobiomorphs attain densities of 20/m2. One study of scolopendromorphs records <b>Scolopendra</b> morsitans in a Nigerian savannah at a density of 0.16/m2 and a biomass of 140mg/m2 wet weight.|$|E
25|$|The Lithobiomorpha and Scutigeromorpha {{lay their}} eggs singly in holes in the soil, and the female fills the holes with soil and leaves them. The number of eggs laid ranges from about 10 to 50. Time of {{development}} of the embryo to hatching is highly variable and may take from one to a few months. Time of development to reproductive period is highly variable within and among species. For example, it can take 3 years for S. coleoptrata to achieve adulthood, whereas under the right conditions, lithobiomorph species may reach a reproductive period in 1 year. In addition, centipedes are relatively long-lived when compared to insects. For example, the European Lithobius forficatus may live for 5 to 6 years, and the wide-ranging <b>Scolopendra</b> subspinipes can live for over 10 years. The combination of {{a small number of}} eggs laid, long gestation period, and long time of development to reproduction has led authors to label lithobiomorph centipedes as K-selected.|$|E

40|$|Objective : This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effect of bee venom and <b>Scolopendrae</b> Corpus herbal acupuncture on the feeling of cold on legs. Methods : The patient was managed by bee venom and <b>Scolopendrae</b> Corpus herbal acupuncture, body acupuncture and herbal medicine. The following points were selected : BL 40, BL 57, BL 60; SP 6. After bee venom and <b>Scolopendrae</b> Corpus herbal acupuncture treatment, body acupuncture was performed at the same points. We evaluated the patient through Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) and Digital Infrared Thermal Imaging(D. I. T. I). Results : After 12 times of treatment, the patient showed that clinical symptoms was decreased, VAS changed from 10 to 3 and there was also improvement change on D. I. T. I. Conclusions : According to the results, bee venom and <b>Scolopendrae</b> Corpus herbal acupuncture may have the effects on the feeling of cold on legs.

40|$|Objective : The {{purpose of}} this study is to report the patient with radial nerve palsy, who {{improved}} by <b>Scolopendrae</b> Corpus Herbal-Acupuncture and other Oriental medical treatments. Methods : The patient was managed by <b>Scolopendrae</b> Corpus Herbal-Acupuncture, body acupunture, physical theraphy and herbal medicine. We took picture of the patient's wrist and checked the power of muscles. Results : After 4 week treatment, the movement and power of wrist was restored to nearly normal range. Conclusion : The results suggest that combination of <b>Scolopendrae</b> Corpus Herbal-Acupuncture and other Oriental medical treatments is good method for treatment of radial nerve palsy. But further studies are required to concretely prove the effectiveness of this methods...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Scolopendra</b> gigantea, {{also known}} as the Amazonian giant centipede, is the largest {{existing}} species of centipede in the world, reaching over [...] in length. It is known to eat lizards, frogs, birds, mice, and even bats, catching them in midflight, as well as rodents and spiders.|$|E
2500|$|The Scolopendromorpha, {{also known}} as {{tropical}} centipedes, possess 21 or 23 body segments (apart from a single species, Scolopendropsis duplicata, which has 39 or 43 segments) with {{the same number of}} paired legs. Their antennae have 17 or more segments. The eyes have a fixed number of four ocelli on each side in the family Scolopendridae and one ocellus per side in the genus Mimops (family Mimopidae), but other families are blind. The order comprises the five families Cryptopidae, Scolopendridae, Mimopidae, Scolopocryptopidae, and Plutoniumidae. [...] The only known amphibious centipede, <b>Scolopendra</b> cataracta, belongs to this order.|$|E
2500|$|Worldwide, an {{estimated}} 8,000 species of centipedes {{are thought to}} exist, of which 3,000 have been described. Centipedes have a wide geographical range, where they even reach beyond the Arctic Circle. They are found {{in an array of}} terrestrial habitats from tropical rainforests to deserts. Within these habitats, centipedes require a moist microhabitat because they lack the waxy cuticle of insects and arachnids, therefore causing them to rapidly lose water. Accordingly, they are found in soil and leaf litter, under stones and dead wood, and inside logs. Centipedes are among the largest terrestrial invertebrate predators, and often contribute significantly to the invertebrate predatory biomass in terrestrial ecosystems. [...] Only one species, <b>Scolopendra</b> cataracta, is known to be amphibious and is believed to hunt aquatic or amphibious invertebrates.|$|E
