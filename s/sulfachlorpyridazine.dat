40|$|Forty-four sulfa {{drugs were}} {{screened}} against crude preparations of recombinant Pneumocystis carinii dihydropteroate synthetase. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) for p-aminobenzoic acid and 7, 8 -dihydro- 6 -hydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphate were 0. 34 +/- 0. 02 and 2. 50 +/- 0. 71 microM, respectively. Several sulfa drugs, including sulfathiazole, <b>sulfachlorpyridazine,</b> sulfamethoxypyridazine, and sulfathiourea, inhibited dihydropteroate synthetase approximately {{as well as}} sulfamethoxazole, {{as determined by the}} concentrations which cause 50 % inhibition and/or by Ki. For all sulfones and sulfonamides tested, unsubstituted p-amino groups were necessary for activity, and sulfonamides containing an N 1 -heterocyclic substituent were found to be the most effective inhibitors. Folate biosynthesis in isolated intact P. carinii was approximately equally sensitive to inhibition by sulfamethoxazole, <b>sulfachlorpyridazine,</b> sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfisoxazole, and sulfathiazole. Two of these drugs, sulfamethoxypyridazine and sulfisoxazole, are known to be less toxic than sulfamethoxazole and should be further evaluated for the treatment of P. carinii pneumonia...|$|E
40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a most common vector-borne disease in the US. Although the {{majority}} of Lyme patients can be cured with the standard two- to four-week antibiotic treatment, at least 10 %– 20 % of patients continue to suffer from prolonged post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). While the cause for this is unclear, {{one possibility is that}} persisting organisms are not killed by current Lyme antibiotics. In our previous studies, we screened an FDA drug library and an NCI compound library on B. burgdorferi and found some drug hits including sulfa drugs as having good activity against B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells. In this study, we evaluated the relative activity of three commonly used sulfa drugs, sulfamethoxazole (Smx), dapsone (Dps), <b>sulfachlorpyridazine</b> (Scp), and also trimethoprim (Tmp), and assessed their combinations with the commonly prescribed Lyme antibiotics for activities against B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells. Using the same molarity concentration, dapsone, <b>sulfachlorpyridazine</b> and trimethoprim showed very similar activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi enriched in persisters; however, sulfamethoxazole was the least active drug among the three sulfa drugs tested. Interestingly, contrary to other bacterial systems, Tmp did not show synergy in drug combinations with the three sulfa drugs at their clinically relevant serum concentrations against B. burgdorferi. We found that sulfa drugs combined with other antibiotics were more active than their respective single drugs and that four-drug combinations were more active than three-drug combinations. Four-drug combinations dapsone + minocycline + cefuroxime + azithromycin and dapsone + minocycline + cefuroxime + rifampin showed the best activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi in these sulfa drug combinations. However, these four-sulfa-drug–containing combinations still had considerably less activity against B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells than the Daptomycin + cefuroxime + doxycycline used as a positive control which completely eradicated B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells. Future studies are needed to evaluate and optimize the sulfa drug combinations in vitro and also in animal models...|$|E
40|$|A remarkably {{high rate}} of adverse events is {{associated}} with the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. We examined the efficacies of sulfonamides alone in the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis, with the assumption that at least some of the adverse events with the drug combination might be due to trimethoprim. With the immunosuppressed rat model, eight sulfonamides were studied at 100, 10, and 1. 0 mg/kg/day (10 rats per dosage and drug). P. carinii infection was prevented in all animals (100 %) receiving dosages of as little as 1. 0 mg of sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethoxypyridazine, and sulfadimethoxine per kg per day, as little as 10 mg of sulfameter, <b>sulfachlorpyridazine,</b> and sulfaquinoxaline per kg per day; and 100 mg of sulfaguanidine and sulfanilamide per kg per day. These studies suggest that a sulfonamide, such as sulfamethoxazole, might provide effective prophylaxis for P. carinii pneumonitis without trimethoprim...|$|E
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody (MAb) raised against sulfamethazine (21 C 7) was applied in an optical biosensor (Biacore Q) {{to develop a}} rapid biosensor immunoassay (BIA) {{for the detection of}} several sulfonamides in chicken serum. The performance of this MAb was compared with two polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) raised against sulfamethazine (Qflex sulfamethazine binding protein (SBP) and RIKILT 464 b). Using these PAbs, the limits of detection (LODs) in 10 times diluted chicken serum were approximately 30 ng ml- 1 and the two BIAs were found to be specific for sulfamethazine. Using MAb 21 C 7, the LOD for sulfamethazine in 10 times diluted chicken serum was lower (10 ng ml- 1), high cross-reactivities were measured for sulfisoxazole (149 ¿ <b>sulfachlorpyridazine</b> (112 ¿ sulfachlorpyrazine (94 ¿ sulfamerazine (87 ¿ sulfadiazine (56 ¿ sulfatroxazole (56 ¿and sulfathiazole (50 ¿and low cross-reactivities (11 ¿ 25 ¿were measured with six other sulfonamides. Compared with the polyclonal antibodies, the MAb-based BIA resulted in a better sensitivity and was found suitable for the detection of 8 sulfonamides in 10 times diluted chicken serum with LODs between 7 and 20 ng ml- 1. The total run time for each cycle was 7 min...|$|E
40|$|Application of {{capillary}} zone electrophoresis with large-volume sample stacking to {{the sensitive}} determination of sulfonamides in meat and ground water A CZE method with UV-Vis detection {{has been established}} and validated for the determination of nine sulfonamides: sulfapyridine, sulfamethazine, sulfamerazine, sulfamether, sulfadiazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, <b>sulfachlorpyridazine,</b> and sulfamethizole. Optimum separation was obtained on a 64. 5 cm 675 mm bubble cell capillary using a buffer containing 45 mM sodium phosphate and 10 % methanol at pH 7. 3, with temperature and voltage of 277 C and 25 kV, respectively. p-Aminobenzoic acid {{was used as an}} internal standard. Taking into account the lack of sensitivity of the UV-Vis detection, the application of an on-line preconcentration methodology, such as large-volume sample stacking with polarity switching has been proposed. This procedure combined with a solvent extraction/SPE method applied for off-line preconcentration and cleanup provides a significant improvement in the LODs, ranging from 2. 59 to 22. 95 mg/L for the studied compounds; the quantification of these residues being possible below the levels established by EU legislation in animal food products, such as meat. Satisfactory recoveries were also obtained in the analysis of these compounds in ground water...|$|E
