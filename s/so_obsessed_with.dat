5|$|Heated debate arose among Westmoreland, Commandant of the Marine Corps Leonard F. Chapman, Jr. and Army Chief of Staff Harold K. Johnson. Johnson {{backed the}} Marine {{position}} {{due to his}} concern over protecting the Army's air assets from Air Force co-option. Westmoreland was <b>so</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> the tactical situation that he threatened to resign if his wishes were not obeyed. As a result, on 7 March, {{for the first time}} during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed under the control of a single manager. Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was a diversion including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.|$|E

25|$|By contrast, the {{majority}} of the officers of the Task Force, both French and British, admired Beaufre as an elegant yet tough general with a sharp analytical mind who always kept his cool. Most of the officers of the Anglo-French Task Force expressed regret that it was Beaufre who was Stockwell's deputy rather the other way around. A major problem both politically and militarily with the planning for Musketeer was the one-week interval between sending troops to the eastern Mediterranean {{and the beginning of the}} invasion. Additionally, the coming of winter weather to the Mediterranean in late November would render the invasion impossible, which thus meant the invasion had to begin before then. An additional problem was Eden, who constantly interfered with the planning and was <b>so</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> secrecy that he refused to tell Keightley what his political objectives were in attacking Egypt, namely was he interested in retaking the Suez canal or toppling Nasser, or both. Eden's refusal to explain to Keightley just what exactly he was hoping to accomplish by attacking Egypt exasperated Keightley to no end, and greatly complicated the planning process.|$|E

He starts several businesses and buys a local café soon after graduating from catering college. Ian has several failed romances, including with his childhood friend, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), with whom Ian remains close, fellow student, Tina Hopkins (Eleanor Rhodes) and his cousin, Elizabeth Beale (Lucy Bayler).

500|$|The {{derivation}} of the Latin narcissus (...) is unknown, but may {{be connected}} with hell. It is frequently linked to the myth of Narcissus who became <b>so</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> his own reflection in water that he drowned and the narcissus plant sprang from where he died. There is no evidence for the flower being named for the youth. Narcissus poeticus which grows in Greece, has a fragrance that {{has been described as}} intoxicating. Pliny wrote that the plant was named for its fragrance (ναρκάω narkao, [...] "I grow numb" [...] ) not the youth. Furthermore, there were accounts of narcissi growing long before the story of Narcissus appeared (see Greek culture). It has also been suggested that daffodils bending over streams represent the youth admiring his reflection. Linnaeus used the Latin name [...] "narcissus" [...] for the plant but was preceded by others such as Matthias de l'Obel (1591) and Clusius (1576).

40|$|Languages differ {{considerably}} in {{the attention that}} they pay to manner as a dimension of motion events. One factor that seems to influence attention to manner is a language’s lexicalization pattern. Following Talmy’s well-known dichotomy of verb-framed and satellite-framed languages, the latter type provides more readily accessible constructions that include path and manner in compact form. In this chapter it is proposed that the dichotomy be expanded to included an “equipollent ” type, in which both path and manner receive equal weight. Furthermore, other factors {{also contribute to the}} degree of “manner salience ” of a particular language. In particular, language-specific morphosyntax, the availability of ideophones, and the availability of motion-related lexical categories (such as posture verbs) are three sorts of factors that interact with lexicalization patterns in influencing manner salience. It is proposed that linguistically-expressed manner salience can influence attention to details of experienced motion events as well as mental imagery formed on the basis of reception of motion event descriptions in speech or writing. For the past decade or <b>so,</b> I’ve been <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> linguistic descriptions of motion events and possible crosslinguistic differences in cognition (Berman & Slobin, 1994; Hoiting & Slobin...|$|R

This obsession with technology has created a unique opportunity for marketers {{to keep in touch with}} customers and to feed them promotions and offers continuously. Online marketing platforms are not only allowing marketers to implement and analyze marketing strategies but also helping them to research customer behavior, and to receive suggestions and feedback. The objective of this thesis is to select most appropriate marketing platforms for delivering value propositions to the different group of customers. The study introduces the concept of strategic benchmarking process for selecting the platform. Moreover, an additional step was included in the process which reflects the selection criteria and justifies the framework. Through the framework, marketers could identify their most suitable platform to reach to their customers. It allows businesses to optimize the marketing budget and helps to bring additional earnings for the company. The study claims that overall marketing costs of a small and medium sized enterprise could be curtailed and net earnings could be increased. One of the key findings of this study was to reduce the overall marketing expenses without impacting much on generated revenue. This finding could benefit small and medium sized enterprises, and for those who have limited marketing budget to reshuffle their marketing strategies. The result of the study shows that proposed framework was effective to determine most appropriate platform for the case company. The implemented strategy and online platform helped the company to reach to their target customer. Furthermore, the framework helped to bring additional savings from the monthly expenditure. Due to the limitation of marketing budget and lacking of strategy implementation know-how in other platforms, the study was limited to one platform...|$|R
