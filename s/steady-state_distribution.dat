40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{establish}} asymptotics {{for the basic}} <b>steady-state</b> <b>distributions</b> in a large class of single-server queues. We consider the waiting time, the workload (virtual waiting time) and the steady-state queue lengths at an arbitrary time, just before an arrival and just after a departure. We start by establishing asymptotics for <b>steady-state</b> <b>distributions</b> of Markov chains of M/GI/ 1 type. Then we treat <b>steady-state</b> <b>distributions</b> in the BMAP/GI/ 1 queue, which has a batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP).

The MAP includes the Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP), the phasetype renewal process (PH) and independent superpositions of these as special cases.

40|$|Stochastic {{comparison}} {{is a method}} to prove bounds on performance metrics of stochas-tic models. Here, coupling {{can be used to}} define two processes on a common probability space, which makes it possible to compare the <b>steady-state</b> <b>distributions</b> of the processes. Two processes are stochastically related if their <b>steady-state</b> <b>distributions</b> satisfy a certain comparison relation.

In this thesis, a thorough description of stochastic comparison using coupling for the probability kernels of Markov processes is presented. Necessary and sufficient con-ditions for the stochastic comparison of stochastically related Markov queueing networks are given, in particular for the coordinate-wise and the summation relation. Also, an ex-ample of a Jackson network with breakdowns is studied, and an explicit coupling which preserves a subrelation of the coordinate-wise order relation is constructed.

50|$|Consider a <b>steady-state</b> <b>distribution</b> of {{temperature}} {{in a body}} for given temperature values on the body surface. Then the resulting heat flux through the boundary (that is, the heat flux {{that would be required}} to maintain thegiven surface temperature) is determined uniquely. The mapping of the surface temperature to the surface heat flux is a Poincaré-Steklov operator. This particular Poincaré-Steklov operator is called the Dirichlet to Neumann (DtN) operator. The values of the temperature on the surface is the Dirichlet boundary condition of the Laplace equation, which describes the distribution of the temperature inside the body. The heat flux through the surface is the Neumann boundary condition (proportional to the normal derivative of the temperature).|$|E
50|$|Paltridge was {{involved}} in studies on stratospheric electricity, {{the effect of the}} atmosphere on plant growth and the radiation properties of clouds. Paltridge researched topics such as the optimum design of plants and the economics of climate forecasting, and worked on atmospheric radiation and the theoretical basis of climate. Paltridge introduced the subsequently disputed hypothesis that the earth/atmosphere climate system adopts a format that maximises its rate of thermodynamic dissipation, i.e., entropy production. This suggests a governing constraint by a principle of maximum rate of entropy production. According to this principle, prediction of the broad-scale <b>steady-state</b> <b>distribution</b> of cloud, temperature and energy flows in the ocean and atmosphere may be possible when one has sufficient data about the system for that purpose, but does not have fully detailed data about every variable of the system. As co-author with C.M.R. Platt, in 1976 Paltridge published a textbook entitled Radiative Processes in Meteorology and Climatology.|$|E

50|$|The thermophoretic {{movement}} of the fluorescently labelled molecule is measured by monitoring the fluorescence distribution F inside a capillary. The microscopic temperature gradient is generated by an IR-Laser, which is focused into the capillary and is strongly absorbed by water. The temperature of the aqueous solution in the laser spot is raised by up to ΔT=5 K. Before the IR-Laser is switched on a homogeneous fluorescence distribution Fcold is observed inside the capillary. When the IR-Laser is switched on, two effects, separated by their time-scales, contribute to the new fluorescence distribution Fhot. The thermal relaxation time is fast and induces a binding-dependent drop in the fluorescence of the dye due to its local environmental-dependent response to the temperature jump. On the slower diffusive time scale (10 s), the molecules move from the locally heated region to the outer cold regions. The local concentration of molecules decreases in the heated region until it reaches a <b>steady-state</b> <b>distribution.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{problems}} with the random number distributions used in discrete-event simulation is that the steady-state distributions of event times may not be known in advance. As a result, the initial set of events placed into the pending event set will not have arrival times representative of the <b>steady-state</b> <b>distribution.</b> This problem is typically solved by bootstrapping the simulation model. Only a limited effort is made to assign realistic times to the initial set of pending events. These events, however, schedule additional events, and with time, the distribution of event times approaches its steady state. This is called bootstrapping the simulation model. In gathering statistics from the running model, it is important to either disregard events that occur before the steady state is reached or to run the simulation for long enough that the bootstrapping behavior is overwhelmed by steady-state behavior. (This use of the term bootstrapping can be contrasted with its use in both statistics and computing.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Gelenbe's G-network {{model was}} the first to show {{that this is not the}} case. Motivated by the need to model {{biological}} neurons which have a point-process like spiking behaviour, he introduced the precursor of G-Networks, calling it the random neural network. By introducing [...] "negative customers" [...] which can destroy or eliminate other customers, he generalised the family of product form networks. Then this was further extended in several steps, first by Gelenbe's [...] "triggers" [...] which are customers which have the power of moving other customers from some queue to another. Another new form of customer that also led to product form was Gelenbe's [...] "batch removal". This was further extended by Erol Gelenbe and Jean-Michel Fourneau with customer types called [...] "resets" [...] which can model the repair of failures: when a queue hits the empty state, representing (for instance) a failure, the queue length can jump back or be [...] "reset" [...] to its <b>steady-state</b> <b>distribution</b> by an arriving reset customer, representing a repair. All these previous types of customers in G-Networks can exist in the same network, including with multiple classes, and they all together still result in the product form solution, taking us far beyond the reversible networks that had been considered before.|$|E
40|$|AbstractStochastic Automata Networks (SANs) {{are widely}} used in {{modeling}} practical systems such as queueing systems, communication systems, and manufacturing systems. For the performance analysis purposes, one needs to calculate the <b>steady-state</b> <b>distributions</b> of SANs. Usually, the <b>steady-state</b> <b>distributions</b> have no close form solutions and cannot be obtained efficiently by direct methods such as LU decomposition due to the huge size of the generator matrices. An efficient numerical method should {{make use of the}} tensor structure of SANs' generator matrices. The generalized Conjugate Gradient (CG) methods are possible choices though their convergence rates are slow in general. To speed up the convergence rate, preconditioned CG methods are considered in this paper. In particular, circulant based preconditioners for the SANs are constructed. The preconditioners presented in this paper are easy to construct and can be inverted efficiently. Numerical examples of practical SANs are also given to illustrate the fast convergence rate of the method...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a discrete-time Geo/G/ 1 retrial queue {{with the}} server subject to breakdowns and repairs. The customer just being served before server breakdown completes his remaining service when the server is fixed.
