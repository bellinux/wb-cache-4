40|$|Background: Identification of the {{residues}} in protein-protein interaction sites has {{a significant}} impact in problems such as drug discovery. Motivated by the observation that the set of interface residues of a protein tend to be conserved even among remote <b>structural</b> homologs, we introduce PrISE, a family of local <b>structural</b> similarity-based computational methods for predicting protein-protein interface residues. Results: We present a novel representation of the surface residues of a protein {{in the form of}} <b>structural</b> elements. Each <b>structural</b> element consists of a central residue and its surface neighbors. The PrISE family of interface prediction methods uses a representation of <b>structural</b> elements that captures the atomic composition and accessible surface area of the residues that make up each <b>structural</b> element. Each {{of the members of the}} PrISE methods identifies for each <b>structural</b> element in the query protein, a collection of similar <b>structural</b> elements in its repository of <b>structural</b> elements and weights them according to their similarity with the <b>structural</b> element of the query protein. PrISEL relies on the similarity between <b>structural</b> elements (i. e. local <b>structural</b> similarity). PrISEG relies on the similarity between protein surfaces (i. e. general <b>structural</b> similarity). PrISEC, combines local <b>structural</b> similarity and general <b>structural</b> similarity to predict interface residues. These predictors label the central residue of a <b>structural</b> element in a query protein as an interface residue if a weighted majority of the <b>structural</b> element...|$|R

Finally, groups of <b>structural</b> elements are examined, by voting the prediction results of the individual <b>structural</b> element classifiers together to determine if a candidate sequence is a <b>structural</b> RNA gene. The tests reveal that the external loop, structure, stemloop, hairpin loop, and tail <b>structural</b> elements produce significant signals for <b>structural</b> RNA genes.

40|$|For the {{development}} of a <b>structural</b> topology, <b>structural</b> grammars predefine locations of <b>structural</b> mass based on the building spatial design, whereas topology optimisation distributes <b>structural</b> mass freely and based on the loads.

Hereafter topology optimisation is applied to modify the <b>structural</b> topology elements for minimal compliance. Due to the several groups of <b>structural</b> topology elements involved, a separate volume fraction is maintained for each group.

40|$|<b>Structural</b> {{engineering}} education often focuses on an analytical understanding of <b>structural</b> behaviour in which engineering specific vocabulary, formulas and calculations are central elements. It {{requires students to}} go in depth first of a <b>structural</b> understanding before an overall comprehension of <b>structural</b> behaviour can be developed. This approach aims to teach students how to calculate structures. However, before a structure can be calculated, a conceptual design needs to be created first. This includes making design choices, for example which are the composing elements of the <b>structural</b> system and how are they configured, where are the supports, how is the <b>structural</b> system going to transfer loads to the supports and so on. Such a conceptual design requires a holistic approach where various options in design decisions can easily and quickly be explored before calculations in depth are performed. As part of my doctoral work that focused on a creative collaboration between architect and <b>structural</b> engineer, a holistic and designerly approach to <b>structural</b> understanding was developed. This {{has led to a}} proposal for a new language to express <b>structural</b> conceptual designs. This language contains four layers that provide knowledge on <b>structural</b> design: <b>structural</b> order, <b>structural</b> function, <b>structural</b> dimensions and possible <b>structural</b> solutions. This language has been successfully used for the <b>structural</b> education of architecture students during theory courses and design studio’s. It is based on a general understanding of <b>structural</b> behaviour to enable an exploration of various <b>structural</b> conceptual designs in relation to an architectural design process. It helps in overviewing three-dimensional <b>structural</b> design possibilities on a conceptual level without having to go into details of calculation and even <b>structural</b> typologies (e. g. beams, columns and trusses).

40|$|An {{approach}} {{to evaluate the}} confidence factor for structures {{at the end of}} an interval of time is proposed. The confidence factor indicates the adequacy of the performance level of a structure subjected to external loads. The factor considers the uncertainties implicit in the <b>structural</b> capacity and in the <b>structural</b> demand. The formulation is made in accordance with the Demand and Capacity Factor Design Format. Four scenarios are compared: a) <b>structural</b> capacity deteriorates over a time interval, while <b>structural</b> demand remains constant, b) only <b>structural</b> demand (for a given intensity) varies in time, c) both <b>structural</b> capacity and <b>structural</b> demand vary simultaneously in time, and d) the effect of <b>structural</b> deterioration is neglected. The approach is applied to an offshore jacket platform. Deterioration is taken into account by analyzing the growth of fatigue cracks in both ends of several critical <b>structural</b> elements. It is concluded that for the evaluation of the confidence factor over an interval of interest, for the case analyzed, it is more significant to consider the variation in time of the <b>structural</b> capacity rather than that of the <b>structural</b> demand; however, it is recommended to consider both (<b>structural</b> capacity and <b>structural</b> demand) in the analysis...|$|R
40|$|The <b>structural</b> holes {{have been}} a key issue in fuzzy social network analysis.

There has been a growing need to design <b>structural</b> holes measures for directed fuzzy social networks, because directed fuzzy social networks where edges are attached by directed fuzzy relation would contain rich information.
