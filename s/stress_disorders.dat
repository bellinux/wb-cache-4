Data were collected using Composite International Diagnostic Interview, Stroop Color-Word Test, Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory, and the Impact of Event Scale. Results:Results showed that individuals with acute <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> are less able to inhibit inappropriate responses and have more impaired cognitive appraisals compared to those with posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder.</b> Moreover, results showed that response inhibition and cognitive appraisal explain 75 % of the variance in posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms and 38 % of the variance in posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms. Conclusion:The findings suggest that response inhibition and cognitive appraisal are two variables that influence the severity of posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> and acute <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms.

40|$|Background: Impairments in {{explicit}} memory {{have been observed}} in Holocaust survivors with posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder.</b> Methods: To evaluate which memory components are preferentially affected, the California Verbal Learning Test was administered to Holocaust survivors with (n = 36) and without (n = 26) posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder,</b> and subjects not exposed to the Holocaust (n = 40). Results: Posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> subjects showed impairments in learning and short-term and delayed retention compared to nonexposed subjects; survivors without posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> did not.

40|$|ObjectiveThe goal of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of {{clinical}} depression, posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder,</b> and comorbid depression and posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> on in-hospital mortality after a coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. It is hypothesized that depression, posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder,</b> and comorbid depression and posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> will independently contribute to an increased risk for in-hospital mortality rates after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of the 2006 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database provides information on approximately 8 million US inpatient stays from about 1000 hospitals. We performed χ 2 and unpaired t tests to evaluate potential confounding group demographic and medical variables. Hierarchic logistic regression was used with forced order entry of depression, posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder,</b> and comorbid depression and posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder.</b> ResultsDeceased patients were more likely to have had depression (alive, 24. 8 %; deceased, 60. 3 %; P <. 001), posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> (alive, 13. 4 %; deceased, 56. 1 %; P <. 001), and cormorbid depression and posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> (alive, 7. 8 %; deceased, 48. 5 %; P <. 001). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, patients with depression (odds ratio, 1. 24; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 02 – 1. 50), posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> (odds ratio, 2. 09; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 65 – 2. 64), and comorbid depression and posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> (odds ratio, 4. 66; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 46 – 6. 26) had an increased likelihood of in-hospital mortality compared with that seen in patients who were alive. ConclusionsTwo findings were noteworthy. First, depression, posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder,</b> and comorbid depression and posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> are prevalent in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting procedures. Second, depression, posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder,</b> and comorbid depression and posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> increase the risk of death by magnitudes comparable with well-established physical health risk factors after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

[...] When the scandal broke, soldiers were pressured to keep quiet and punished with daily inspections for speaking to the press. [...] Significant public and media attention was generated, which in turn prompted a number of congressional and executive actions, including resignations of several high-ranking officers.

2500|$|All {{psychological}} traumas {{originate from}} stress, a physiological {{response to an}} unpleasant stimulus. Long term stress {{increases the risk of}} poor mental health and mental disorders, which can be attributed to secretion of glucocorticoids {{for a long period of}} time. Such prolonged exposure causes many physiological dysfunctions such as the suppression of the immune system and increase in blood pressure. Not only does it affect the body physiologically, but a morphological change in the hippocampus also takes place. Studies showed that extreme stress early in life can disrupt normal development of hippocampus and impact its functions in adulthood. Studies surely show a correlation between the size of hippocampus and one's susceptibility to <b>stress</b> <b>disorders.</b> In times of war, psychological trauma has been known as shell shock or combat stress reaction. Psychological trauma may cause an acute stress reaction which may lead to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). [...] PTSD emerged as the label for this condition after the Vietnam War in which many veterans returned to their respective countries demoralized, and sometimes, addicted to psychoactive substances. The symptoms of PTSD must persist for at least a month for diagnosis. The main symptoms of PTSD consist of four main categories: Trauma (i.e. intense fear), reliving (i.e. flashbacks), avoidance behavior (i.e. emotional numbing), and hypervigilance (i.e. irritability). Research shows that about 60% of the US population reported as having experienced at least one traumatic symptom in their lives but only a small proportion actually develops PTSD. There is a correlation between the risk of PTSD and whether or not the act was inflicted deliberately by the offender. Psychological trauma is treated with therapy and, if indicated, psychotropic medications.|$|E

Results: At initial interview, 18 (19. 4 %) of the 93 patients had acute <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> and 23 (24. 7 %) met all acute <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> criteria except dissociation.

This study examined the changes in posttraumatic <b>stress</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms and its relationship with coping skill and locus of control among adolescent earthquake survivors in China. Methodology/Findings: The study used an observational longitudinal design.
