5|$|Herrmann {{used the}} lowered music budget to his {{advantage}} by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock's request for a jazz score. He thought of the <b>single</b> <b>tone</b> color of the all-string soundtrack {{as a way of}} reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. The strings play con sordini (muted) for all the music other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis of the score to Psycho, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.|$|E

Most fire sirens are either {{mounted on the}} roof of a fire station or on a pole next to the fire station. Fire sirens can also be mounted on or near government buildings, on tall structures such as water towers, as well as in systems where several sirens are distributed around a town for better sound coverage. Most fire sirens are <b>single</b> <b>tone</b> and mechanically driven by electric motors with a rotor attached to the shaft. Some newer sirens are electronically driven speakers.|$|E
40|$|The {{perception}} of two simultaneous tones {{was investigated in}} goldfish using classical respiratory conditioning and a stimulus generalization paradigm. Pairs of tones were used {{to make up a}} mixture of 150 Hz and a higher harmonic or a mistuned harmonic. Fish were conditioned to the two-tone mixture and then tested for generalization to several pure tones. The simultaneous tones tended to be segregated in perception, with the generalization gradient for <b>single</b> <b>tones</b> having two peaks corresponding to the frequencies of the tone pairs. There were no consistent differences in the generalization gradients following conditioning to harmonic or inharmonic tone pairs. In addition, experiments were carried out in which the two tones of the pair were heard on alternate trials, always as <b>single</b> <b>tones,</b> followed by generalization tests to <b>single</b> <b>tones.</b> There was more generalization in this experiment, reflecting the fact that conditioning and generalization test stimuli were both <b>single</b> <b>tones.</b> However, the shapes of the generalization gradients were similar to those in which fish were conditioned to two simultaneous tones, indicating that the simultaneity of the tones did not make them harder to segregate. As the frequency separation between the two components narrowed, segregation tended to fail...|$|R

25|$|Hearing {{begins in}} utero, but the central {{auditory}} system continues to develop {{for at least}} the first decade. There is considerable interest in the idea that disruption to hearing during a sensitive period may have long-term consequences for auditory development. One study showed thalamocortical connectivity in vitro was associated with a time sensitive developmental window and required a specific cell adhesion molecule (lcam5) for proper brain plasticity to occur. This points to connectivity between the thalamus and cortex shortly after being able to hear (in vitro) as at least one critical period for auditory processing. Another study showed that rats reared in a <b>single</b> <b>tone</b> environment during critical periods of development had permanently impaired auditory processing. ‘Bad’ auditory experiences, such as temporary deafness by cochlear removal in rats leads to neuron shrinkage. In a study looking at attention in APD patients, children with one ear blocked developed a strong right-ear advantage but were not able to modulate that advantage during directed-attention tasks.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} extent of {{production}} and perception of dynamic differences on a French historical harpsichord, extensively revised in 1788 by Pascal Taskin. A historical review reports on the descriptions of {{two different types of}} touch found in treatises of the eighteenth century. These two touches (loud/struck and soft/pressed) were used to perform <b>single</b> <b>tones</b> on the lower, upper, peau de buffle registers (the last of which Taskin is credited with having invented) and the coupled 8 -foot registers to investigate differences in dynamics. Acoustic measurements show varied differences of up to 11 dB for the two types of touch over different pitches in each register. The strongest difference is measured in the first harmonic of note F 2 on the peau de buffle. A listening experiment was conducted to test whether these differences are perceivable. Participants performed a discrimination task using pairs of <b>single</b> <b>tones.</b> Participants were able to perform significantly better than chance in correctly identifying whether pairs of <b>single</b> <b>tones</b> were same or different with respect to loudness (t (24) = 12. 01, p <. 001). Accuracies were influenced by pitch and register, the peau de buffle providing the strongest accuracies over the four registers tested...|$|R

40|$|Past {{studies of}} object {{recognition}} in vision and language {{have shown that}} (1) identification of the larger structure of an object is possible even if its component units are ambiguous or missing, and (2) contexts often influence {{the perception of the}} component units. The present study asked whether a similar case could be found in audition, investigating (1) whether melody recognition would be possible with uncertain pitch cues, and (2) whether adding contextual information would enhance pitch perception. Sixteen musically trained listeners attempted to identify, on a piano keyboard, pitches of tones in three different context conditions: (1) <b>single</b> <b>tones,</b> (2) pairs of tones, and (3) familiar melodies. The pitch cues were weakened using bandpass filtered noises of varying bandwidths. With increasing bandwidth, listeners were less able to identify the pitches of the tones. However, they were able to name the melodies despite their inability to identify the individual notes. There was no effect of context; whether or not listeners heard <b>single</b> <b>tones,</b> pairs of tones, or melodies did not influence their pitch identification of the tones. Several possible explanations were discussed regarding types of information that listeners had access to, since they could not have relied on detailed features of the melodies...|$|R
