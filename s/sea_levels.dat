40|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>level</b> rise {{is both a}} {{powerful}} impact of and indicator for global warming and climate change. Observing <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> change, {{as well as its}} causes, is therefore a top priority for scientists and society at large. By measuring the ocean’s temperature, salinity, mass, and surface height, the relative sources of recent <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise can be discerned. With these observations, <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> change is determined in terms of total <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> and its two major components, ocean mass and steric (density-related) <b>sea</b> <b>level.</b> The <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> budget is closed when the sum of the independent components agrees with measurements of total <b>sea</b> <b>level,</b> indicating that the observations can be used to interpret the causes of <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> change. While nearly global monitoring of <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> from space-based radar altimeters has been available since the early 1990 s, satellite gravity missions capable of weighing changes in ocean mass have been available for less than 10 years.

40|$|Changes in <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> impacts {{the life}} on earth. According {{to the fifth}} {{assesment}} report, published by the International Panel on Climate Change, the global <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> is rising and the <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> is an important indicator of climate change. Recent studies states an increase of about 20 cm in global mean <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> for the past century, and an acceleration of sea-level rise in the last decades. On order to predict future <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> changes, analysis of past <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> is needed. This master thesis is a study of regional <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> changes in Norway. Time series analysis is used on tide gauge data to find both the total <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> changes and linear <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> trends in Norway. The study discovered an increasing <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> for the included tide gauge stations in Norway. For example, has Oslo experienced a <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> increase of 1. 17 +/- 0. 39 mm per year, with a total <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise of 0. 12 [0. 08 : 0. 15] meters from 1914 to 2012. Bergen has experienced a <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> increase of 1. 40 +/- 0. 33 mm per year, with a total <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise of 0. 14 [0. 10 : 0. 17] meters from 1915 to 2012. The linear trend in Norwegian <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> is partly increasing, depending on the station. In nine of thirteen stations, the linear slope from the time interval 1980 - 2012 is significantly larger than the linear slope for the time interval 1950 - 1980. It was detected a significant structural change in the linear slope in Bergen, Oslo and Stavanger before and after 1980, which indicates a change in <b>sea</b> <b>level.</b> Comparisons with global studies indicates partly correspondents with Norwegian and global results.

5|$|During {{the last}} glacial period, and up until about 12,000 years ago, most of Ireland was {{periodically}} covered in ice. <b>Sea</b> <b>levels</b> were lower and Ireland, like Great Britain, formed part of continental Europe. By 16,000 BC, rising <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> due to ice melting caused Ireland to become separated from Great Britain. Later, around 6000 BC, Great Britain itself became separated from continental Europe. The earliest evidence of human presence in Ireland is dated at 10,500 BC, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone {{found in a}} cave in County Clare. It is not until about 8000 BC, however, that more sustained occupation of the island has been shown, with evidence for Mesolithic communities around the island. These Mesolithic communities lived as hunter-gatherers across the island until about 4000 BC.|$|E

40|$|We present {{estimates}} for late Holocene relative <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> change along the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy based on morphological characteristics of eight submerged Roman ﬁsh tanks (piscinae) constructed between the 1 st century B.

We conclude that local <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> during the Roman period did not exceed 58 ± 5 cm below the present <b>sea</b> <b>level.</b> These results broadly agree with previous observations {{in the region}} but contrast with recent analysis that suggests a signiﬁcantly larger <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise during the last 2000 years.

5|$|Ornithologist Richard Schodde has {{proposed}} {{the ancestors of}} the two subspecies were separated during the last glacial period in the Pleistocene around 12,000years ago. Aridity had pushed the grasslands preferred by the wren to the north, and with subsequent wetter warmer conditions it once again spread southwards and met the eastern form in northern Queensland and intermediate forms arose. The distribution of the three bi-coloured fairywren species indicates their ancestors lived across New Guinea and northern Australia in a period when <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> were lower and the two regions were joined by a land bridge. Populations became separated as <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> rose, and New Guinea birds evolved into the white-shouldered fairywren, and Australian forms into the red-backed fairywren and the arid-adapted white-winged fairywren. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the red-backed and white-shouldered fairywrens diverged from each other around 3 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 5 million years ago from a lineage {{that gave rise to}} the white-winged fairywren.|$|E

In this study, we calculate regional projections of 21 st century <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise in northern Europe, focusing on the British Isles, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea. The input to the regional <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> projection is a probabilistic projection of the major components of the global <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> budget. Local <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise is partly compensated by vertical land movement from glacial isostatic adjustment. We explore the uncertainties beyond the likely range provided by the IPCC, including the risk and potential rate of marine ice sheet collapse. Our median 21 st century relative <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise projection is 0. 8 m near London and Hamburg, with a relative <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> drop of 0. 1 m in the Bay of Bothnia (near Oulu, Finland). Considerable uncertainties remain in both the <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> budget and in the regional expression of <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise.
