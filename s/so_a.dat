5|$|A Dutch {{proposal}} {{to build new}} battleships was originally tendered in 1912, after years of concern over {{the expansion of the}} Imperial Japanese Navy and the withdrawal of allied British warships from the China Station. Only four coastal defense ships were planned, but naval experts and the Tweede Kamer (lower house of the parliament) believed that acquiring dreadnoughts would provide a stronger defense for the Nederlands-Indië (Netherlands East Indies, abbr. NEI), <b>so</b> <b>a</b> Royal Commission was formed in June 1912.|$|E
5|$|A basic Powerball ticket costs $2. The Power Play option adds $1 to {{the price}} of each ticket in a given playslip, <b>so</b> <b>a</b> Powerball ticket with Power Play costs $3 (up from $2). The odds of {{matching}} all six numbers to win the Powerball jackpot are 1 in 292,201,338. The odds of winning any prize are 1 in 25. One Powerball jackpot has been won in Virginia since the game first became available in the Commonwealth in 2010.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} {{division of}} the poem occurs, Tolkien writes, at line 1887, after which all the earlier story is summarized, <b>so</b> <b>a</b> complete account of Beowulf's tragedy is given between 1888 and the end, but without {{the account of the}} gloomy court of Heorot, or of the contrast between the young Beowulf and the old Hrothgar.|$|E
5|$|After {{the change}} in organisation, Chetham's {{could no longer afford}} to provide {{education}} based on scholarships and other allowances, and began charging fees. In 1952, the school buildings were considered insufficient <b>so</b> <b>a</b> new block was built, opening in 1955. By 1960 the numbers of boys admitted had increased significantly, particularly among day pupils; 230 non-boarding students attended that year, alongside 64 boarders.|$|E
5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce {{the sound of the}} original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, <b>so</b> <b>a</b> note sounds slightly different each time it is played.

5|$|Banking also {{developed}} in this period. The Bank of Scotland was suspected of Jacobite sympathies and <b>so</b> <b>a</b> rival Royal Bank of Scotland {{was founded in}} 1727. Local banks began to be established in burghs like Glasgow and Ayr. These would make capital available for business and the improvement of roads and trade, which would help create the conditions for the Industrial Revolution that accelerated {{in the second half}} of the century.|$|E

5|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced {{compared to that}} of open circuit, <b>so</b> <b>a</b> smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.|$|E
5|$|Common {{chemical}} theory {{at that time}} held that an acid {{is a compound that}} contains oxygen (remnants of this survive in the German and Dutch names of oxygen: sauerstoff or zuurstof, both translating into English as acid substance), <b>so</b> <b>a</b> number of chemists, including Claude Berthollet, suggested that Scheele's dephlogisticated muriatic acid air must be a combination of oxygen and the yet undiscovered element, muriaticum.|$|E

In 1936 Berkeley promoted him to full professor at a salary of $3300 per annum.

5|$|In 1900 a spur {{connecting}} the branch to the up slow {{line of the}} West Coast Main Line was constructed. The water supply for locomotives at Wolverton was insufficient, <b>so</b> <b>a</b> water column was built at the intermediate station in Bradwell. Water came from the town's own source, with many houses losing their supply. On Mondays, housewives were known to shake their fists at engine drivers when their weekly wash was interrupted. Eventually drivers were forbidden from taking water from Bradwell on Mondays.|$|E

The old I Corps headquarters was largely absorbed into Lavarack's new First Army headquarters, <b>so</b> <b>a</b> new one was formed from Headquarters, Southern Command.
