50|$|In {{contemporary}} use, the Beier variator is {{most widely}} used {{as part of an}} industrial motor drive. An electric induction motor is driven at its ideal speed, derived from the electrical line frequency, and the variator drive is used to manually adjust its output speed. These are often coupled with a cycloidal drive to provide an extra-low <b>speed</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{family of}} {{microcontrollers}} are 16-bit, however {{they do have}} some 32-bit operations. The processors operate at 16, 20, 25, and 50 MHz, and is separated into 3 smaller families.

40|$|Many Virtual Environments require walking {{interfaces}} {{to explore}} virtual worlds {{much larger than}} available real-world tracked space. We present a model for generating virtual locomotion speeds from Walking-In-Place (WIP) inputs based on walking biomechanics. By employing gait principles, our model – called Gait-Understanding-Driven Walking-In-Place (GUD WIP) – creates <b>output</b> <b>speeds</b> which better match those evident in Real Walking, and which better respond to variations in step frequency, including realistic starting and stopping. The <b>speeds</b> <b>output</b> by our implementation demonstrate considerably less within-step fluctuation than a good current WIP system – Low-Latency, Continuous-Motion (LLCM) WIP – while still remaining responsive to changes in user input. We compared resulting speeds from Real Walking, GUD WIP, and LLCM-WIP via user study: The average <b>output</b> <b>speeds</b> for Real Walking and GUD WIP respond consistently with changing step frequency – LLCM-WIP is far less consistent. GUD WIP produces <b>output</b> <b>speeds</b> that are more locally consistent (smooth) and stepfrequency-to-walk-speed consistent than LLCM-WIP...|$|R
50|$|Eddy current drives are slip-controlled systems {{the slip}} energy {{of which is}} {{necessarily}} all dissipated as heat. Such drives are therefore generally less efficient than AC/DC-AC conversion based drives. The motor develops the torque required by the load and operates at full <b>speed.</b> The <b>output</b> shaft transmits the same torque to the load, but turns at a slower speed. Since power is proportional to torque multiplied by speed, the input power is proportional to motor speed times operating torque while the output power is <b>output</b> <b>speed</b> times operating torque. The difference between the motor <b>speed</b> and the <b>output</b> <b>speed</b> is called the slip speed. Power proportional to the slip speed times operating torque is dissipated as heat in the clutch.|$|R

Donny Walsh and Jim Summers soon followed with 6-second quarter mile passes in the same year, with all 3 using a ProCharger supercharger and also exceeding 200 mph. The supercharger design used by these 3 racers includes a patented “bearing within a bearing” design for the high <b>speed</b> <b>output</b> shaft.|$|E
50|$|CSDs {{are mainly}} used on {{airliner}} and military aircraft jet engines {{to drive the}} alternating current (AC) electrical generator. In order to produce the proper voltage at a constant AC frequency, usually three-phase 115 VAC at 400 Hz, a generator needs to spin at a constant specific speed (typically 6,000 RPM for air-cooled generators). Since the jet engine gearbox speed varies from idle to full power, this creates {{the need for a}} constant speed drive (CSD). The CSD takes the variable <b>speed</b> <b>output</b> of the accessory drive gearbox and hydro-mechanically produces a constant output RPM.|$|E
50|$|The CRT display used by {{the normal}} H2S was fitted with a film system with a {{motorized}} takeup reel. The motor {{was connected to the}} ground <b>speed</b> <b>output</b> of the Green Satin, so it drew the film across the front of the display at a set speed independent of the airspeed. With the scanning motor turned off, the display on the CRT was a single line, modulated in brightness by the returns at various distances from the aircraft. This exposed the film, producing a 2D image of the land {{to one side of the}} aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The {{solution}} was the Dreyer table , which used a large ball-and-disk integrator {{as a way}} to compare the motion of the target relative to the ship, and thereby calculate its range and <b>speed.</b> <b>Output</b> was to a roll of paper. The first systems were introduced around 1912 and installed in 1914. Over time, the Dreyer system added more and more calculators, solving for the effects of wind, corrections between apparent and real wind speed and direction based on the ships motion, and similar calculations. By the time the Mark V systems were installed on later ships after 1918, the system might have as many as 50 people operating it in concert.|$|E
50|$|The {{first two}} new {{turntable}} models Numark introduced, the TT-100 and the Pro TT-1, are similar, but the TT-100 was only {{available in a}} gloss black finish, has no LCD display, tonearm height adjustment, and has less starting torque than the Pro TT-1. Both have a single range variable pitch control and weigh 24 pounds. Numark next released the Pro TT-1+ which added dual range variable pitch, +/−10% and +/-20%, and a platter <b>speed</b> <b>output</b> connector. The Pro TT-2 soon followed with a slightly different tonearm. The Pro TT-1+ and Pro TT-2 each weigh 27 pounds. All models have a remote start/stop connector. All are dual-voltage units {{and for the most}} part all contain the same internal parts.|$|E
50|$|The sport {{differential}} operates {{by using}} two superposition ("step up") gears at the differential, which are operated via multi-plate clutches {{each side of}} the differential crown wheel. When required by the software (using lateral and longitudinal yaw sensors, the ABS wheel sensors, and a steering wheel sensor), the control software (located in a control unit close to the rear differential), actuates the relevant clutch pack. This has the effect of taking the output shaft drive through the step-up gear to the attached wheel, while the other shaft continues to drive its wheel directly (i.e., the clutch pack not actuated). The higher <b>speed</b> <b>output</b> shaft produces increased torque to the wheel, producing a yaw (turning) moment. In normal operation increased torque is delivered to the wheel {{on the outside of the}} turn thereby increasing the vehicles turning moment, in other words, its willingness to turn in the direction pointed by the steering wheel.|$|E

Because the number of teeth on the ring gear is different from that on the fixed ground gear, the ring gear rotates at a fraction of a revolution and simultaneously rotates the output gear in one eccentric cycle in the opposite direction.

Here two fuzzy logic controllers are employed. One of the Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) {{is used to}} adjust the bandwidth of the torque hysteresis controller {{in order to reduce}} the torque and flux ripples and, hence, to improve motor dynamic response. The second fuzzy logic controller is employed in place of PI controller which regulates the <b>speed.</b> <b>Output</b> of this controller is the reference torque, and the inputs are error and change in error produced by comparing command speed with reference speed...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{torque control}} with Current Source Inverter (CSI) instead of voltage source {{inverter}} is so appropriate because of determining the torque of induction motor with machine current and air gap flux. In addition, Space-Vector Modulation (SVM) is a more proper method for CSI because of low order harmonics reduction, lower switching frequency and easier implementation. This paper introduces the SVM method for CSI and uses the proposed inverter for vector control of an induction motor. The simulation results illustrate fast dynamic response and desirable torque and <b>speed</b> <b>output.</b> Fast and accurate response to changes of speed and load torque reference completely proves the prominence of this method...|$|E
