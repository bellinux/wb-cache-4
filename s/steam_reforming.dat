5|$|Industrial {{production}} is mainly from <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive {{methods such as}} the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used {{near the site of}} its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen is industrially {{produced}} from <b>steam</b> <b>reforming,</b> which uses fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, or coal. The energy {{content of the}} produced hydrogen {{is less than the}} energy content of the original fuel, some of it being lost as excessive heat during production. <b>Steam</b> <b>reforming</b> leads to carbon dioxide emissions, {{in the same way as}} a car engine would do.|$|E

40|$|Dissociated and <b>steam</b> <b>reformed</b> {{methanol}} {{were evaluated}} as automotive engine fuels. Advantages and disadvantages in using methanol in the reformed rather than liquid state were discussed. Engine dynamometer {{tests were conducted}} with a four cylinder, 2. 3 liter, spark ignition automotive engine to determine performance and emission characteristics operating on simulated dissociated and <b>steam</b> <b>reformed</b> methanol (2 H 2 + CO and 3 H 2 + CO 2 respectively), and liquid methanol. Results are presented for engine performance and emissions as functions of equivalence ratio, at various throttle settings and engine speeds. Operation on dissociated and <b>steam</b> <b>reformed</b> methanol was characterized by flashback (violent propagation of a flame into the intake manifold) which limited operation to lower power output than was obtainable using liquid methanol. It was concluded that: an automobile could not be operated solely on dissociated or <b>steam</b> <b>reformed</b> methanol over the entire required power range - a supplementary fuel system or power source {{would be necessary to}} attain higher powers; the use of reformed mechanol, compared to liquid methanol, may result in a small improvement in thermal efficiency in the low power range; dissociated methanol is a better fuel than <b>steam</b> <b>reformed</b> methanol for use in a spark ignition engine; and use of dissociated or <b>steam</b> <b>reformed</b> methanol may result in lower exhaust emissions compared to liquid methanol...|$|R
50|$|Methanol {{is used as}} a fuel {{because it}} is {{naturally}} hydrogen dense (a hydrogen carrier) and can be <b>steam</b> <b>reformed</b> into hydrogen at low temperatures compared to other hydrocarbon fuels. Additionally, methanol is naturally occurring, biodegradable, and energy dense.|$|R
25|$|The <b>steam</b> <b>reforming,</b> shift conversion, {{carbon dioxide}} removal, and {{methanation}} steps each operate at pressures of about , and the ammonia synthesis loop operates at pressures ranging from , depending upon which proprietary process is used.|$|E
25|$|The {{major source}} of {{hydrogen}} is methane from natural gas. The conversion, <b>steam</b> <b>reforming,</b> is conducted with steam in a high temperature and pressure tube inside a reformer with a nickel catalyst, separating the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the natural gas.|$|E
25|$|The sulfur-iodine cycle {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a way to}} supply hydrogen for a hydrogen-based economy. It does not require hydrocarbons like current methods of <b>steam</b> <b>reforming.</b> But note that all of the available energy in the hydrogen so produced is supplied by the heat used to make it.|$|E

30|$|Historically, many US {{refineries}} {{built before}} 1975 had their reformers {{designed to be}} in hydrogen balance with the hydrotreaters. Today, hydrogen requirements at US plants not satisfied by reforming are produced primarily by <b>steam</b> methane <b>reforming.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{price of}} Hydrogen has since {{come down to}} $4–6/kg (without carbon sequestering) due to {{reduction}} {{in the price of}} Natural Gas as a feedstock for <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> owing to the proliferation of hydraulic fracturing of shales. A kilo of Hydrogen has the same energy yield as a gallon of gasoline although production currently creates 12.5kg CO2, 39% more than the 8.91kg CO2 from a gasoline gallon.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{chemical}} reactions of methane are combustion, <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> to syngas, and halogenation. In general, methane reactions {{are difficult to}} control. Partial oxidation to methanol, for example, is challenging because the reaction typically progresses {{all the way to}} carbon dioxide and water even with an insufficient supply of oxygen. The enzyme methane monooxygenase produces methanol from methane, but cannot be used for industrial-scale reactions.|$|E
25|$|Supercritical {{water can}} be used to {{decompose}} biomass via supercritical water gasification of biomass. This type of biomass gasification {{can be used to}} produce hydrocarbon fuels for use in an efficient combustion device or to produce hydrogen for use in a fuel cell. In the latter case, hydrogen yield can be much higher than the hydrogen content of the biomass due to <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> where water is a hydrogen-providing participant in the overall reaction.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this thesis}} is wisdom {{accumulation}} from current area of energetic use of hydrogen and future systems. In overview is presented possible processes where dominate <b>steam</b> methane <b>reforming.</b> In {{main part of}} thesis, <b>steam</b> methane <b>reforming</b> will be analyzed and electrolysis also.

40|$|A three {{dimensional}} Eulerian two-fluid {{model with}} an in-house code {{was developed to}} simulate the gas-particle two phase flow in the fluidized bed reactors. The CO 2 capture with Ca-based sorbents in the <b>steam</b> methane <b>reforming</b> process was studied with such model incorporating the reaction kinetics. The sorption enhanced <b>steam</b> methane <b>reforming</b> (SE-SMR) process (i. e. SMR and adsorption of CO 2) and the regeneration process of sorbents were carried out in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor and a circulating fluidized bed reactor separately. The effects of pressure, temperature and inlet gas flow rate on the reactions were studied. The very high production of hydrogen in SE-SMR was obtained compared with the standard SMR process. It needs a rather long time to accomplish the sorbent regeneration. 1...|$|R
25|$|The {{other popular}} {{approach}} to improving catalyst performance {{is to reduce}} its sensitivity to impurities in the fuel source, especially carbon monoxide (CO). Presently, pure hydrogen gas is becoming economical to mass-produce by electrolysis. However, at the moment hydrogen gas is produced by <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> light hydrocarbons, a process which produces a mixture of gases that also contains CO (1–3%), CO2 (19–25%), and N2 (25%). Even tens of parts per million of CO can poison a pure platinum catalyst, so increasing platinum’s resistance to CO is an active area of research.|$|E
25|$|An {{accounting}} of the energy utilized during a thermodynamic process, known as an energy balance, {{can be applied to}} automotive fuels. With today's technology, the manufacture of hydrogen via <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> can be accomplished with a thermal efficiency of 75 to 80percent. Additional energy will be required to liquefy or compress the hydrogen, and to transport it to the filling station via truck or pipeline. The energy that must be utilized per kilogram to produce, transport and deliver hydrogen (i.e., its well-to-tank energy use) is approximately 50MJ using technology available in 2004. Subtracting this energy from the enthalpy of one kilogram of hydrogen, which is 141MJ, and dividing by the enthalpy, yields a thermal energy efficiency of roughly 60%. Gasoline, by comparison, requires less energy input, per gallon, at the refinery, and comparatively little energy is required to transport it and store it owing to its high energy density per gallon at ambient temperatures. Well-to-tank, the supply chain for gasoline is roughly 80% efficient (Wang, 2002). Another grid-based method of supplying hydrogen would be to use electrical to run electrolysers. Roughly 6% of electricity is lost during transmission along power lines, and the process of converting the fossil fuel to electricity in the first place is roughly 33 percent efficient. Thus if efficiency is the key determinant it would be unlikely hydrogen vehicles would be fueled by such a method, and indeed viewed this way, electric vehicles would appear to be a better choice. However, as noted above, hydrogen can be produced from a number of feedstocks, in centralized or distributed fashion, and these afford more efficient pathways to produce and distribute the fuel.|$|E
500|$|Hydrogen can be {{prepared}} in several different ways, but economically the most important processes involve removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons, as about 95% of hydrogen production came from <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> around year 2000. Commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> of natural gas.

40|$|Natural gas {{will be the}} {{dominant}} primary energy source during the next 50 years and consequently {{the main source of}} CO 2 emissions. A procedure is proposed where natural gas is <b>steam</b> <b>reformed</b> to CO 2 and H 2, using nuclear heat from HTR nuclear reactors. CO 2 is permanently stored underground, e. g. by reinjection in the original gas field. Hydrogen is piped to the final consumer neat, or mixed with natural gas. A joint venture is proposed between Western Europe and the Soviet Union, where a set of HTR reactors would reform increasing shares of the natural gas piped to Western Europe. The location of the plants in Western Ukrainia would permit using CO 2 for tertiary recovery in old oil fields there. Some economics are given...|$|R

40|$|Methane hydrate, {{formed by}} injecting methane into 100 g of shaved ice at a {{pressure}} of 7 MPa and reactor temperature of 0 ??C, was decomposed by applying 27. 12 MHz radio frequency plasma {{in order to}} produce hydrogen. The process involved the stimulation of plasma in the methane hydrate with a variable input power at atmospheric pressure. It was observed that production of CH 4 is optimal at a slow rate of CH 4 release from the methane hydrate, as analyzed by in light of the <b>steam</b> methane <b>reforming</b> (SMR) and the methane cracking reaction (MCR) processes in accordance with the content of gas production. In comparison with the <b>steam</b> methane <b>reforming</b> (SMR), it was found that methane-cracking reaction (MCR) was dominant in conversion of CH 4 into hydrogen. An H 2 content of 55...|$|R

2500|$|While nuclear-generated {{electricity}} {{could be}} used for electrolysis, nuclear heat can be directly applied to split hydrogen from water. [...] High temperature (950–1000°C) gas cooled nuclear reactors have the potential to split hydrogen from water by thermochemical means using nuclear heat. Research into high-temperature nuclear reactors may eventually lead to a hydrogen supply that is cost-competitive with natural gas <b>steam</b> <b>reforming.</b> General Atomics predicts that hydrogen produced in a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor (HTGR) would cost $1.53/kg.

40|$|At present {{three key}} energy {{carriers}} {{have the potential}} to allow a transition towards a sustainable energy system: electricity, biofuels and hydrogen. All three offer great opportunity, but equally true is that each is limited in different ways. In this article we focus on the latter and develop learning curves using cost data observed during the period 1940 – 2007 for two essential constituents of a possible ‘hydrogen economy’: the construction of hydrogen production facilities and the production process of hydrogen with these facilities. Three hydrogen production methods are examined, in decreasing order of importance with regards to their current market share: <b>steam</b> methane <b>reforming,</b> coal gasification and electrolysis of water. The fact that we have to include data in our analysis that go far back in time, as well as the uncertainties that especially the older data are characterized by, render the development of reliable learning curves challenging. We find only limited learning at best in a couple of cases, and no cost reductions can be detected for the overall hydrogen production process. Of the six activities investigated, statistically meaningful learning curves can only be determined for the investment costs required for the construction of <b>steam</b> methane <b>reforming</b> facilities, with a learning rate of 11 ± 6 %, and water electrolysis equipment, with a learning rate of 18 ± 13 %. For past coal gasification facility construction costs no learning rate can be discerned.
