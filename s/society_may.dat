Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence in the media and in <b>society</b> <b>may</b> have influenced his actions. Following a shooting at Dawson College on September 13, 2006, Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong controversially suggested that Marc Lépine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.|$|E

25|$|Related to {{cultural}} issues, diversity of preferences within a <b>society</b> <b>may</b> contribute to economic inequality.

25|$|According to the Ethnographic Atlas, of 1,231 {{societies}} {{from around}} the world noted, 186 were monogamous; 453 had occasional polygyny; 588 had more frequent polygyny; and 4 had polyandry. However, this {{does not take into account}} the relative population of each of the societies studied, and the actual practice of polygamy in a tolerant <b>society</b> <b>may</b> actually be low, with the majority of aspirant polygamists practicing monogamous marriage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ This study aims to {{investigate}} the role of diversity (ethnic, linguistic and religious) and social inequality in determining social cohesion. By using cross-country data, {{we have found that}} social inequality may be more important factor than diversity in determining cohesiveness of a society. Our analysis suggests that inclusive <b>societies</b> <b>may</b> be in better position to cope with the possible threat of diversity for social cohesion. By reducing social inequality, <b>societies</b> <b>may</b> mitigate the negative effects of diversity for social cohesion...|$|R

25|$|The Norse {{never learned}} the Inuit {{techniques}} of kayak navigation or ring seal hunting. Archaeological evidence plainly establishes that by 1300 {{or so the}} Inuit had successfully expanded their winter settlements {{as close to the}} Europeans as the outer fjords of the Western Settlement. By 1350, the Norse had completely deserted their Western Settlement. The Inuit, being a hunting <b>society,</b> <b>may</b> have hunted the Norse livestock, forcing the Norse into conflict or abandonment of their settlements.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{prides itself}} on being a society that {{supports}} gender equality. While, in reality, much gender inequality persists, there are indeed laws in place to protect the equal rights of everyone, regardless of gender. Depending on the home country, U.S. <b>society</b> <b>may</b> contain a much higher level of gender equality than immigrants are accustomed to, particularly if immigrants come from a traditionally patriarchal society. The disparity in gender norms between different cultures may cause gender roles in the family to shift.|$|E

25|$|Inequality {{may exist}} {{between members of}} {{different}} generations within a family. Assimilation into American <b>society</b> <b>may</b> create changes in the traditional family structure, particularly among immigrants who come from cultures in which age is a strong determinant of status and power. American culture places {{a high value on}} individuality. The high importance placed on self-determination in American culture may go against the traditional values of cultures in which children are expected to obey and respect the wishes of their parents in all facets of their lives. The migration process is often stressful and can lead to conflicts between family members, particularly those of different generations.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{being able}} to {{function}} within a Discourse may carry advantages in different situations. For example, {{if a person is}} raised in a family of lawyers, the Discourses of politics or business may come very easily to that person. In the United States, those are all Discourses of power and they are closely related. Another person raised in a very different Discourse community might find himself or herself at a disadvantage when trying to move within the Discourse of business, trying to get a loan, for instance. One Discourse community is not inherently better than another; however, power within a <b>society</b> <b>may</b> be unequally represented within different Discourses.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{recycling}} is {{performed by the}} entrepreneurial poor such as the karung guni, zabbaleen, the rag-and-bone man, waste picker, and junk man. With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable, either by law or economies of scale, the poor {{are more likely to}} be driven out of the recycling and the remanufacturing market. To compensate for this loss of income, a <b>society</b> <b>may</b> need to create additional forms of societal programs to help support the poor. Like the parable of the broken window, there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable e.g. through the law. However, in Brazil and Argentina, waste pickers/informal recyclers work alongside the authorities, in fully or semi-funded cooperatives, allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job.|$|E

25|$|Social views also better {{explain the}} {{ambiguity}} of racial definitions. An individual may self-identify as one race based on one set of determinants (for example, phenotype, culture, ancestry) while <b>society</b> <b>may</b> ascribe the person otherwise based on external forces and discrete racial standards. Dominant racial conceptions influence how individuals label both themselves and others within society. Modern human populations are becoming more difficult to define within traditional racial boundaries due to racial admixture. Most scientific studies, applications, and government documents ask individuals to self-identify race from a limited assortment of common racial categories. The conflict between self-identification and societal ascription further complicates biomedical research and public health policies. However complex its sociological roots, race has real biological ramifications; the intersection of race, science, and society permeates everyday life and influences human health via genetics, access to medical care, diagnosis, and treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} puberty can have {{important}} {{psychological and social}} consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often {{tend to have a}} good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; <b>society</b> <b>may</b> view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys {{are more likely to be}} sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Other {{historians have}} {{accepted}} that Caesar's account {{might be more}} accurate. Norman J. DeWitt surmised that Caesar's description {{of the role of}} druids in Gaulish <b>society</b> <b>may</b> report an idealized tradition, based on the society of the 2nd century BCE, before the pan-Gallic confederation led by the Arverni was smashed in 121 BCE, followed by the invasions of Teutones and Cimbri, rather than on the demoralized and disunited Gaul of his own time. John Creighton has speculated that in Britain, the druidic social influence was already in decline by the mid-1st century BCE, in conflict with emergent new power structures embodied in paramount chieftains. Other scholars see the Roman conquest itself as the main reason for the decline of the druid orders. Archaeologist Miranda Aldhouse-Green (2010) asserted that Caesar offered both “our richest textual source” regarding the druids, and “one of the most reliable.” She defended the accuracy of his accounts by highlighting that while he may have embellished some of his accounts to justify Roman imperial conquest, it was “inherently unlikely” that he constructed a fictional class system for Gaul and Britain, particularly considering that he was accompanied by a number of other Roman senators who would have also been sending reports on the conquest to Rome, and who would have challenged his inclusion of serious falsifications.|$|E

50|$|Talking {{about death}} and {{witnessing}} it {{is a difficult}} issue with most cultures.

500|$|On December 12, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly further {{empowered}} the Romney Literary Society: [...] "To establish at or {{near the}} town of Romney a Seminary of Learning for the instruction of youth in various branches of science and literature; and the <b>Society</b> <b>may</b> appropriate to the same such portion of the property which it now has or may acquire, as it may deem expedient". Following the passage of this act, the Romney Classical Institute was formally established. That same year, the new two-story brick educational building was completed and the society's library and classes were relocated there. The completed building measured , with an additional wing which served as the residence of the institute's principal. The society utilized the second story of the building, which was divided into two rooms: a hall for society meetings and a hall for its library. Only society members, Romney clergymen, and the institute's principal were given library privileges, and were each furnished with keys to visit the library at any time.|$|E
500|$|The two men {{discussed}} [...] "natural aristocracy." [...] Jefferson said, [...] "The natural aristocracy I {{consider as}} the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed {{it would have been}} inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of <b>society.</b> <b>May</b> we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [...] into the offices of government?" [...] Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were, [...] "Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence." [...] It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than true wisdom and virtue. That being the way of nature, he thought such [...] "talents" [...] were natural. A good government, therefore, had to account for that reality.|$|E
500|$|By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its facilities, and the Romney Literary Society {{commenced}} {{its campaign}} {{to raise funds}} for a new academic building. On January6, 1832, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the society to raise $20,000 by lottery for educational purposes. Following a ten-year lapse after this authorization, the society made arrangements with James Gregory of Jersey City, New Jersey, and Daniel McIntyre of Philadelphia to finance the lottery, [...] "for raising a sum of money not exceeding Twenty Thousand dollars, for the purpose of erecting a suitable building for their accommodation, the purchase of a library and Philosophical apparatus". The lottery was to be conducted for a period lasting 10years, and the sums of $750, $1,000, and $1,500 were to be raised in semi-annual installments. The society successfully raised the funds, and in 1845 bids were called {{for the construction of a}} new school building. On December12, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly empowered the Romney Literary Society [...] "to establish at or near the town of Romney a Seminary of Learning for the instruction of youth in various branches of science and literature; and the <b>Society</b> <b>may</b> appropriate to the same such portion of the property which it now has or may acquire, as it may deem expedient". That same year, a new brick building was constructed for the academy and for the library of the society, which now serves as the central unit of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. Following the school's move to the building, it was reorganized as the Romney Classical Institute with Foote as its principal.|$|E
