Modeling techniques and boundary conditions of the design program are discussed.

40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{modelling}} {{and experimental}} measurements {{led to the}} assessment of stress of structural nodes of <b>scissor</b> <b>lifting</b> platform, which is used for relocation of cars from a production line. It also led to the optimization of producing process. Immediate load of <b>scissor</b> <b>lifting</b> platform by a car on stand causes additional bending moment that must be captured in a scissor mechanism. At the beginning the experimental measurements on the real lifting platform were made for obtaining of dependence of displacement, velocity and acceleration on time, which was almost 1. 5 ± 0. 1 g. Then a dynamical analysis of lifting platform was performed using the numerical method Runge Kutta 4 th order. Model analysis showed that the initial immediate acceleration of lifting platform at start and immediate deceleration at stop lead to dynamic shocks. These dynamic shocks are dangerous due to a long term operation because they permanently load not only pivots but also other parts – bearings and joining parts. A resonance may occur as well. In particular, dynamic shocks caused damage of structural nodes. Immediate load of <b>scissor</b> <b>lifting</b> platform by a car on stand causes additional bending moment. It is not appropriate {{in terms of a}} long-term operation. The recommended load lifting platform should be symmetrical...|$|R
50|$|A <b>lift</b> <b>table</b> bellows (also {{known as}} <b>lift</b> <b>table</b> skirting) is a safety device that forms a {{protective}} barrier between the <b>lift</b> <b>table</b> operator and the equipment's moving parts.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the shape}} of the {{original}} device, a pantograph also refers to a kind of structure that can compress or extend like an accordion, forming a characteristic rhomboidal pattern. This can be found in extension arms for wall-mounted mirrors, temporary fences, <b>scissor</b> <b>lifts,</b> and other <b>scissor</b> mechanisms such as the pantograph used on electric locomotives and trams.|$|R
50|$|To {{incorporate}} the device into a lift system, multiple helical band actuators are arranged below the lift platform {{where they are}} powered by an electric motor(s) and synchronized transmission. Helical band actuators require a separate lateral support mechanism, usually provided {{in the form of}} guide rails or self-guiding frame, such as a pantograph (e.g. a <b>scissor</b> <b>lift).</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>scissor</b> <b>lift</b> is {{yet another}} type of lift. These are usually mobile work {{platforms}} {{that can be easily}} moved to where they are needed, but can also be installed where space for counter-weights, machine room and so forth is limited. The mechanism that makes them go up and down is like that of a scissor jack.|$|R
40|$|The tip-over of <b>scissor</b> <b>lifts</b> in {{operation}} has frequently {{resulted in the}} death and/or severe injuries of workers. The objective {{of this study is}} to enhance the understanding of its major mechanisms and factors influencing <b>scissor</b> <b>lift</b> stability. Both experimental and modeling approaches were used in this study. Two series of experiments were performed under possible tip-over scenarios: curb impact and pothole depression. Based on the dynamic characteristics identified from the experimental results, a lumped-parameter model of the <b>scissor</b> <b>lift</b> was developed. It was applied to investigate the effect of scissor structure flexibility on the tip-over potential of the lift, to understand tip-over mechanisms, and to ex-plore preventive strategies. This study found that the fundamental natural frequencies of the lift were generally in a range of 0. 30 - 2. 08 Hz, which are likely related to the tip-over. Increasing flexibility of the lift structure generally increased the tip-over potential. The tip-over threshold was also a function of both ground slope and tilt speed of the lift. The results suggest that the lift should not be elevated on largely deformable and/or uneven surfaces such as bridged wood board or a soft soil base. The worker on the lift platform should avoid any large continuous periodic movement or forceful action in the horizontal plane, especially when the lift is fully elevated. Besides the tilt angle of the lift, the tilt speed should be monitored to help prevent the tip-over...|$|R
5000|$|Riders {{first step}} onto a <b>scissor</b> <b>lift,</b> {{where they are}} raised into the loading position. Operators then hook the riders onto a cable that brings the riders {{to the top of}} the tower and a cable that holds the riders during the free-fall. Once the riders are {{securely}} attached to the cable and the operators say it is safe to operate, the <b>scissor</b> <b>lift</b> is brought down and the riders are pulled {{to the top of the}} tower. Once the riders reach the top, they must wait until the operator at the bottom says to [...] "pull the cord". The operator will usually say [...] "tower one / two: 3, 2, 1, fly." [...] At this point, the rider at the far right (unless there is a single rider) must pull the cord releasing them from the lift cable. During the first drop, riders experience about 3 to 4 seconds of free-falling. After about 10 swings, an operator will lift a hydraulic cable with a loop at the top which then a rider will have to grab and hold on to. After grabbing the cable, the riders will come to a stop just above the <b>scissor</b> <b>lift.</b> The next riders will step onto the lift where the previous riders will be unloaded and they will be attached to the lift cable where the cycle begins again. One cycle can last anywhere between 3 and 5 minutes.|$|R

40|$|In today's life, {{there is}} a wide variety of forklifts, from the large heavy loading truck to the one that works among narrow aisles. Forklifts have become one of the basic {{transportation}} tools we use in our lives. With all the forklifts in existance, we find that there are some improvements that can be made to bring the forklift to a better performance. Existing forklift design has its limitation in rotation and the structure has potential safety risk. Our new design has 180 degrees rotating forks attached to truck body on both ends. Also, it has a <b>scissor</b> <b>lift</b> under the operator’s cabin which improves the stability. There are two subassemblies: <b>scissor</b> <b>lift</b> and lifting fork; {{there is a}} total of 37 parts in the new design. Once the design is conceived, we calculate the mass properties of parts and subassemblies to ensure the stability of the forklift. Results show that the truck is safe to use: its center of gravity remains in the safety triangle and we use this to get the maximum loading capacity. Then we run stress analysis on important parts and subassemblies using finite element method (FEM). Results show that the new design is safe to use under working conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{project was}} {{motivated}} by a {{need to create a}} device that would cause a small truck or trailer bed to lift up quickly and dump its contents. This would eliminate the need to use manual physical labor, which is both slow and exhausting. Additional design constraints require the stroke and diameter of the cylinder to be 6 ” x 2 ”. A design was conceived with the intent to incorporate a less costly device onto an existing trailer frame that would lift the bed and dump the load. With this in mind, a <b>scissor</b> <b>lift</b> device would have two basic requirements, first to lift 500 pounds and second to achieve a 40 degree angle of lift. The intended design is called a <b>scissor</b> <b>lift.</b> Lifting mechanisms for dump trucks are too large and expensive for use on a small six foot trailer. Designing a lift to use a smaller cylinder to accomplish the same task as a larger lift, was accomplished with engineering design. This smaller cylinder presents a geometric challenge so there is enough lift to tilt and dump the load. To accomplish this, the lift will have to accommodate the cylinder to transfer its force through the arms. The calculations predicted that a. 5 gpm hydraulic pump would take 62 seconds to lift 500 pounds, dump and lower the load. Initial tests indicated a tilt goes to 39 degrees. [URL]...|$|R
