5|$|Schenectady, Schoharie, Montgomery, Washington, Essex, Warren and Clinton {{counties}} in New York state, which {{were affected by}} extensive snowfall from the <b>storm,</b> <b>had</b> {{declared a state of}} emergency while several other counties and towns declared snow emergencies.|$|E
5|$|The <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> minimal {{effects on}} land, limited to {{moderately}} strong winds and heavy rainfall over Newfoundland. Kate threatened Atlantic Canada {{just one week}} after Hurricane Juan caused severe damage in Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{powerful}} cyclone over water, the <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> relatively little impact over land. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells {{produced by the}} storm. However, the losses were more extensive offshore. Between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during the storm.|$|E
50|$|Within {{two more}} weeks, 13 {{tropical}} <b>storms</b> or hurricanes <b>had</b> formed, including 4 major hurricanes. By August 23, 2 more <b>storms</b> <b>had</b> been named. By early September, {{a total of}} 17 named <b>storms</b> <b>had</b> developed, 6 of which became hurricanes. Roughly two weeks later, two additional named storms were classified. After a lull in late September and early October, a total of 22 <b>storms</b> <b>had</b> formed by mid-October 21 of which developed in the EPHC's area of responsibility and the list of names was exhausted, forcing the agency to request emergency names.|$|R

5|$|Even {{though the}} <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> {{weakened}} drastically by this time, Tess killed 37people in Vietnam, destroyed thousands of homes, and inflicted $11million in damage. Following Tess, Philippine President Corazon Aquino visited {{the provinces of}} Pangasinan and Pampanga, both situated {{to the north of}} Manila to tour damaged areas, distribute relief, aid and inaugurate an infrastructure project. A mere few days after Tess, Typhoon Skip became the third cyclone to hit the archipelago in two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Further {{strengthening}} {{was expected}} by forecasters, {{but did not}} come. The storm's motion slowed, and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast. The storm made landfall around 11:00UTC on July20 near San Fernando in Tamaulipas. The <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> sustained winds of 125mph (200km/h), Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After heading inland over northeast Mexico, it dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental on July21.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Danielle did {{not have}} any impact on land and no damage or {{fatalities}} were reported. No ships were reported to have come into contact with Danielle.

5|$|On Monday morning, the <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> moved {{northeast}} of London, Ontario, dragging lake effect blizzards in its wake. An additional 17inches (43cm) of snow were dumped on Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling {{the streets with}} snowdrifts 6feet (2m) high. Streetcar operators stayed with their stranded, powerless vehicles for two nights, eating whatever food was provided by local residents. Travelers were forced to take shelter and wait for things to clear.|$|E

5|$|The storm made {{landfall}} at Western Australia's Eighty Mile Beach at 1400 UTC on 28 February, {{and began}} to weaken. The <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> dissipated on 1 March; the BoM issued their last advisory on the cyclone at 0400 UTC that day, while similarly, the JTWC issued their last advisory just two hours later. The storm's remnants died out in the country's desert.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of weather}} charts {{in a modern}} sense began in the middle portion of the 19th century in order to devise a theory on storm systems. During the Crimean War a storm devastated the French fleet at Balaklava, and the French {{scientist}} Urbain Le Verrier was {{able to show that}} if a chronological map of the <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> been issued, the path it would take could have been predicted and avoided by the fleet.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression was first observed 300mi (485km) southeast of Socorro Island on September29. The depression rapidly intensified, {{and was a}} Category1 hurricane only twelve hours after being first observed. Peaking as an 85mph (140km/h) Category1 hurricane, Hurricane Six tied Hurricane Four as the strongest tropical cyclone of the season. After reaching its peak intensity, Hurricane Six rapidly weakened, and passed 70mi (125km) southeast of Socorro Island with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Further weakening occurred, and the <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> dissipated on September 30.|$|E

5|$|After {{affecting}} Yap, Mitag {{turned to}} the northwest and later to the north due to an approaching trough. It passed {{to the north of}} Palau, contributing to one death there. Despite predictions of weakening, the typhoon continued to intensify, reaching peak winds of 175km/h (110mph 10minute sustained) on March5. The combination of cooler air and interaction with the westerlies caused Mitag to weaken significantly. Only four days after reaching peak winds, the <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> dissipated well to the east of the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|After no {{tropical}} cyclone activity in July and August, the third tropical storm formed offshore of southwestern Mexico on September3. Like {{the previous two}} {{tropical cyclone}}, this <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> a peak of 50mph (80km/h), and did not intensify further. Tropical Storm Three headed northwestward, and began paralleling the coast of Baja California. On September8, Tropical Storm Three turned abruptly south-southwestward, and dissipated by the next day. The outer rainbands of this system were expected to bring squally weather over the Baja California Peninsula; instead, this storm turned away without causing any impact.|$|E
5|$|As Isaac tracked northwestward, it re-strengthened {{into a major}} {{hurricane}} on September28. Later that day, Isaac peaked as a moderate-Category4 hurricane. However, Isaac {{began to}} track northward over an area of colder sea surface temperatures (SSTs), which gradually weakened the storm {{over the next three}} days. Eventually, the storm curved northeastward, and weakened to a tropical storm early on October1. Later that day, Isaac transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. While extratropical, it brushed the British Isles, producing below gale-force winds. The <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> no interaction with land while tropical; however, one fatality occurred on Long Island when large swells generated by Isaac overturned a boat. In addition, rough seas also affected the coastlines of Bermuda and The Carolinas.|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} of June22, {{satellite}} imagery indicated {{the formation of an}} eyewall; by this time Andres was near hurricane-status. Early the next day, the center of circulation became embedded within a central dense overcast and Andres intensified into a hurricane, the first of the season, around 0600UTC. At this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984mbar (hPa; 29.06inHg); the storm was located roughly 80mi (130km) southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas upon attaining this intensity. Twelve hours after becoming a hurricane, most of the deep convection associated with the <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> weakened; however, Hurricane Hunters still recorded 75mph (120km/h) winds despite the ragged appearance of Andres.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> begun to abate over Hainan, it was already nearly dissipated, {{and as a result}} {{produced}} few, if any, noticeable effects in mainland China. Across the Gulf of Tonkin, Vietnam had experienced deadly flooding in the week before Nepartak's approach, and the typhoon initially raised concerns about worsening the situation. Officials made preparations to minimize potentially exacerbating factors, and the cyclone remained far enough east to avoid seriously impacting the country.|$|E
5|$|Cold {{air from}} the {{remnants}} of a cold front became entrained within the circulation; however, the cold air gradually warmed. On October9, winds increased to gale-force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm, at which time it was given the name Bravo. By October10, Bravo had intensified substantially, as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane-force winds roughly 15mi (25km) {{from the center of the}} storm. Following this finding, the National Hurricane Center reclassified the system as a tropical system and renamed it Fran, dropping its previous designation of Bravo. Upon becoming tropical, Fran developed a strong outflow and several convective feeder bands. Additionally, the <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> developed a 35mi (55km) wide eye.|$|E
