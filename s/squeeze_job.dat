40|$|The Valhall {{field is}} the largest field that BP {{operates}} on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, {{and is one of}} the most well known high porosity chalk fields in the Southern part of the North Sea. During many years of oil production, there has been compaction of the reservoir. The current casing design at Valhall has developed with time as the field has matured, and is affected by several considerations like casing shear in the overburden due to subsidence, non-uniform loading in the reservoir due to chalk production and compaction. The main objective of this thesis was to develop options that could be included in the current casing design, to guarantee a higher injection pressure than is available today at the Valhall field. The current design is limiting the maximum injection pressure in the water injectors, and the main factor is the use of 95 / 8 ” drilling liner combined with a cement <b>squeeze</b> <b>job</b> through a C-Flex port collar. This cement job is not approved as a barrier element as required by NORSOK. The injection pressure is today limited by the strength of the 133 / 8 ” casing shoe, which is lower than desired. The study involves reviewing BP’s casing design manual, the current casing design on Valhall, the special requirements for Valhall, and investigating several technologies that could provide potential solutions to the barrier challenges on Valhall. The recommended option is to include the External Sleeve Inflatable Packer Collar (ESIPC), Cement Assurance Tool and the C-Flex in the 95 / 8 ” drilling liner. The ESIPC would provide a good cement job in the liner annulus, as it would enable returns to be observed during the cement job, providing evidence that there is a cement column behind the drilling liner by a cement bond log. The C-Flex is included to make it possible to perform a cement <b>squeeze</b> <b>job</b> through the C-Flex additionally to the ESIPC or in worst case alone if the ESIPC fails. The Cement Assurance Tool is just an extra safety in case the cement around the liner would contract and make a micro-annulus, which could create a possible leak. This option would most likely provide a barrier element according to NORSOK. This barrier element is very important to be able to increase the injection pressure at a wanted level, which is approximately 6, 300 psi. At present time, the ESIPC is not strong enough to be included in a drilling liner. It has to be reinforced and tested before it could be included in the drilling liner to be able to withstand the large forces acting on the tool. The corresponding dual bottom-top wiper plug set has to be reinforced as well, because the plug set would be exposed to large forces during the losses, and when it is set inside the ESIPC...|$|E
40|$|A scale {{inhibitor}} ‘squeeze’ treatment {{is used in}} {{the oil and gas industry}} as a control measure to reduce the risk of mineral scale precipitation and deposition in the near-wellbore rock formation and associated installations. One of the determining factors in a successful <b>squeeze</b> <b>job</b> is the potential of formation rock to adsorb {{scale inhibitor}} (SI); the higher the adsorption, the better the treatment. This paper investigates the potential of employing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to increase the adsorption of a common SI (polyphosphinocarboxylic acid, PPCA) on formation rock as part of a new methodology forming a ‘Nanotechnology-Assisted Squeeze Treatment’ (NAST). The focus here is assessing the adsorption potential of PPCA on CNTs for the purpose of creating a longer-lasting squeeze treatment. Analyses using various techniques including Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Raman Spectroscopy are presented, and results indicate that up to 180 mg/g of PPCA adsorbed on CNTs, with strong bonding, which is significantly higher than the 1 mg/g adsorption of PPCA on crushed formation rock. Adsorption of PPCA decreases with increasing temperature of the solution, indicating an exothermic reaction. The impact of water salinity on adsorption is also considered, with calcium producing a positive effect on adsorption and sodium the opposite. It is also illustrated that a good dispersion of CNTs in the solution can dramatically increase the adsorption due to the exposure of higher surface area to PPCA in the solution. The influence of using CNTs on adsorption of SI onto internal surface of sandstone rock were evaluated using coreflood tests with simplified brines. The results demonstrate the potential of employing CNTs to increase adsorption of SI in squeeze treatments and possibly to improve the squeeze treatment lifetime...|$|E
40|$|An OA down squeeze is done {{to inhibit}} the flow of {{formation}} fluids into the annular space of a well. They are done in various different methods and have varying results. This project aims to assess the different aspects of a down squeeze {{to determine if there}} is an overriding factor that will lead to success or failure. Looking at available data from BP an assessment of the results can be done to determine if there were any trends that lead to success or any factors that lead to failure. The different types of fluids used will be measured along with their placement in the well. The procedures done before the down squeeze will be analyzed to determine if it was known where the leak was coming from before the job design was decided upon. Once all of this is done a recommendation will be made for future down <b>squeeze</b> <b>jobs</b> to help complete the jobs successfully. Overall the scope of this project will be limited to about 60 wells in the Prudhoe Bay field on the North Slope of Alaska, however the procedures analyzed will be the same ones used in any onshore field in the world and can easily be adjusted for use anywhere in the world...|$|R
40|$|When {{oil and gas}} wells {{reach the}} end of their {{production}} life, they need to be permanently plugged and abandoned. The requirements for a permanent barrier state that it must cover the entire cross-section of the wellbore, including all annuli. This thesis evaluates a new method of establishing a cross-sectional barrier in areas with poor, non-sealing annular cement. The traditional method is to mill away the section with poor cement and set an open hole cement plug, but due to the ECD effect of milling fluids, this is not always desirable. In some formations on the Gullfaks field, the operational pressure window is too small for section milling. An alternative solution was therefore tried out on a well that needed plugging. This method, referred to as punch and squeeze, consisted of perforating the section of poorly cemented casing and squeezing cement into the annulus. In this thesis, the equipment and techniques used are presented and evaluated, along with general theory relevant to plugging and abandonment. On Gullfaks, two punch and squeeze techniques were used. In the first, cement was pumped through a packer plug and squeezed into the perforations. The second technique involved setting a balanced cement plug over the perforations, and squeezing this plug into the perforations. The main conclusions are that the technique using a packer plug is safer with regards to well control, involves less waiting on cement and gives a better annular seal than the balanced plug alternative. Also, a cement evaluation log should be run before the <b>squeeze</b> <b>jobs</b> are performed, and the log results should be used when determining where to perforate. All things considered, {{it was found that the}} punch and squeeze method can succeed in creating a length of cross-sectional cement, but still involves some uncertainty and the technique can be further optimized...|$|R
40|$|Production of {{oil on the}} Norwegian {{continental}} shelf started in the early 70 ’s. Many of these fields are now reaching {{the end of their}} production time. The industry is now awaiting a “plug wave” in the not too distant future. Decommission is a time-consuming procedure, and the cost of P&A can end up being 25 % of the total cost of the well. The task given from Wintershall was to plan P&A operation by setting a dual barrier plug against the creeping clay in the Hordaland formation. The Hordaland green clay will creep in and seal around the casing and create a bonding with the casing. This method has saved operators on the Norwegian {{continental shelf}} for millions of NOK, by avoiding milling or <b>squeeze</b> cement <b>job.</b> All the wells at Brage require permanent P&A in order to control subsurface pressure and prevent the free flow of pore fluids to the seabed. The wells at Brage was categorized depending on the different casing design. The objective was to determine the time for P&A for every category. There were three different casing designs that stood out: pre-drilled wells, production liner with tie-back casing and simplified casing design. The most likely time for plugging the 40 wells at Brage is estimated to be around 3 years. The time estimate is done with the technology available today. In the future there might be new technology that will enable the operator to P&A the field in a more cost-effective way. Many service companies are working on developing tomorrows P&A solution. Some of the new technologies will be presented and discussed in this thesis, together with the use of formation as a barrier...|$|R
30|$|Having {{established}} {{herself as}} the second largest economy in the world, behaving responsibly during the Asian Financial Crisis by not devaluing the Renminbi, and taking a reconciliatory stance in the bombing of its Belgrade embassy towards NATO and the US, China could have accumulated enough goodwill to substantiate her claim of peaceful rise and secure her position to lead the global South towards a development path that is not orbiting around the West. However, China has been let down by its lack of disciplines when investing abroad, often being accused of corruption, and <b>squeezing</b> out local <b>job</b> market and production. Her increasingly assertiveness in territorial issues coupled {{with a lack of}} transparency in military expansion have alerted her Asian neighbours to guard against a rising dragon. Therefore, far from drawing the global South together, China has casted herself away from them, Myanmar’s sudden leaning towards the US is a case in point. Unless China reposition herself in the global South, she may one day rue about the missed chances and feel increasingly contained by the West (Wong & Yue, 2014).|$|R
