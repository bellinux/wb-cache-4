50|$|Kaiser Aluminum an American {{aluminum}} producer is a spinoff from Kaiser Aluminum and Chemicals Corporation {{which came}} to be when common stock was offered in Permanente Metals Corporation and Permanente Metals Corporation's name was changed to Kaiser Aluminum and Chemicals Corporation. Henry J. Kaiser's corporation entered the aluminum business by leasing, then purchasing three government-owned aluminum facilities in Washington state. These were the primary reduction plants at Mead and Tacoma, and the rolling mill at Trentwood. The company grew to be a vertically integrated aluminum producer. Kaiser currently owns 12 fabricating plants that can produce more than 400000000 lbs LT of aluminum annually. The company also owns a 49 percent interest in an aluminum smelter in Wales. The North American plants produce approximately 500000000 lbs LT per year of value-added <b>sheet,</b> <b>plate,</b> extrusions, forgings, rod, bar, and tube. Kaiser previously owned a subsidiary that developed real estate, including Rancho California, California.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War {{there was}} an {{increase}} in demand for steel products such as <b>sheet,</b> <b>plate</b> and strip due to improved living standards. As products became relatively cheap the demand grew for such items as refrigerators, canned foods and cars. SPT had a Strip Mill, which could satisfy some of this demand. It had been producing strip to a maximum width of 230mm since 1921, however the limitation in the maximum width and site restrictions prevented extension, enlargement or modernisation of the plant. A new mill was required which would cater for the increased demand, and to this end market research was carried out to determine the size and potential of the market. When the technical and commercial research was concluded, it was decided to build a continuous Hot Strip Mill rolling mild, carbon and special steels up to 457mm. This new mill filled the gap between the narrow and wide strip mills operating at that time.So in July 1955 it was announced that Brinsworth Hot Strip Mill would be built on Sheffield Road opposite Templeborough Melting Shop at a cost of £3.6 m. In less than two years it was built and the first slabs rolled on 10 June 1957, quite an achievement. Full capacity was expected to be 8000 tonnes per week and in 1956 there were new orders for two to three years. These orders were mainly for the motorcar, bicycle, tube and stamping industries and nearly all of them for the home market.|$|E
