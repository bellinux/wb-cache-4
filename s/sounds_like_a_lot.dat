5000|$|On 22 January 1989, {{a review}} of the album was {{published}} in the daily issue of the Daily Union. The review, under the headline [...] "When in Rome mostly empty-headed pop drivel", stated: [...] "This self-titled debut record from a trio of Englishmen <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of today's pop music: synthesizer-based, danceable and rather empty-headed. When in Rome is the nom de guerre of vocalist Andrew Mann, bassist-vocalist Clive Farrington and keyboardist Michael Floreale. On their album, the three are joined by a host of session musicians who chime in on percussion, guitars, keyboards and horns. The songs center around Floreale's multi-faceted keyboards and the dual vocals of Farrington and Mann. The two singers harmonize perfectly, singing lead vocals together on nearly every tune. The music is generally bright and perky, sort of what the Pet Shop Boys probably sound like when they've had too much coffee. In fact, the bubbly, bongo-based percussion often reminds the listener of one of those percolating coffee pots. 'The Promise', a hit in the United Kingdom, is typical. Starting with a piano that picks out the melody, the song throbs along electronically with clear harmonies of Mann and Farrington piercing through the catchy melody. Most of the record thumps along in this vein, although on Side 2 there is a greater reliance on real instruments (as opposed to their synthesizer-produced imitations) that makes things more interesting." ...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of its}} {{national}} security mission, Lawrence Livermore develops technologies to help government agencies prevent terrorists from smuggling nuclear materials into the country. One ongoing effort is to design radiation detectors that can distinguish threat sources from legitimate sources, such as medical isotopes, and naturally occurring radiation. (See S&TR, September 2004, pp. 4 - 11; May 2006, pp. 4 - 10.) Detectors intended for use by nonspecialists must be easy to operate and require minimal maintenance. To be most effective, they also must detect both gamma and neutron energies. That may <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to ask of one instrument, but the Ultrahigh-Resolution Gamma and Neutron Spectrometer (UltraSpec) delivers all of these features. UltraSpec is so sensitive that even the minute thermal energy deposited by a single gamma ray or neutron can be detected with high precision. With this capability, the detector can identify differences in composition that help reveal a material's origin, processing history, and likely intended use. In addition to its application as a counterterrorism technology, UltraSpec {{can be used to}} protect nuclear material stored at nuclear power plants, to evaluate weapon stockpiles, and to verify material composition. UltraSpec was developed by a team of scientists and engineers from Livermore's Physics and Advanced Technologies and Engineering directorates working with VeriCold Technologies of Ismaning, Germany.

50|$|That’s the one {{perpetual}} thing. I’ve {{heard a lot}} {{of songs}} with harmonizer, right? One of my favorite things that I see on the Internet is people commenting on the album, whenever people talk about this vocal sound that he’s created, they call it Auto-Tune, or they say this <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like Bon Iver - Justin, who Francis worked with and showed a lot of this musical styling to, uses a very similar harmonizer effect - but there’s this very special thing that Francis does that he calls Prismizer. I love it, and it’s going to be Kanye’s album, and it’s on Frank’s album, but, this Prismizer thing that he does, he sings or he’ll take a vocal and then, very similar to a vocoder, instead of it being singular keys though, he builds chordal sound around it, so it sounds like a choir, so, when you first hear Ye’s vocal come in, it sounds like 15 cyborgs, all singing in Auto-Tune, but really it’s one vocal with Francis saying, ‘OK, this is the 3rd and the 5th and the 7th,’ and he just builds a full choir around it. This whole sound is my favorite thing because it resembles the choir sound that I’ve been trying to get forever, the choral sound, but it also kind of makes it futurist at the same time. That’s like, I think, one of the all-encompassing ideas of the whole project. Francis is credited on “Summer Friends” but he also did all of the Kanye vocals on it. He also does it at the end of “Same Drugs,” and, even though it’s not him playing on “How Great,” My Cousin Nicole came in and sang this lead vocal for “How Great Is Our God,” and my homie Peter came in and did Francis’s Prismizer with his same harmonizer and preset that we learned from him and really makes it sound like a whole new thing.|$|E
40|$|This report {{argues that}} Australia {{has a long}} way to go before {{consumers}} pay fair prices for pharmaceuticals. OverviewGrattan Institute’s March 2013 report, Australia’s bad drug deal, showed that Australians paid more than $ 1 billion a year too much for prescription drugs. The problem is how the government sets prices. Vested interests are involved in price negotiations, there is no cap on expenditure, and the price cuts when a drug goes off patent are far smaller than in many other countries. The problem hasn’t gone away. Current policies aren’t doing nearly enough to bring prices down. In December, the Commonwealth Government’s “price disclosure” policy led to price cuts for seven generic drugs. Price disclosure tracks discounts that manufacturers and wholesalers give to pharmacies. Then the government cuts prices to reflect what pharmacies actually pay. The price cuts in December averaged 34 per cent. In three cases the cuts were big enough to reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients. As a result patients without a concession now save around $ 5 for each box of pills. That <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> But this report compares prices after these cuts with prices in the UK, New Zealand and the Canadian province of Ontario. On average, Australian prices remain almost 16 times higher than the best price in these three places. Our prices are more than 14 times higher than those in the UK. High prices are very costly for taxpayers and for consumers. Many Australians pay both through their taxes and then at the pharmacy. Once again, benchmarking against prices in other countries would get a much better deal. Of the seven drugs that had their prices reduced in December, patients would pay less for all of them, instead of just three. The out-of-pocket saving would also be much higher, averaging more than $ 21 per drug. The money we spend on high drug prices could be much better spent. But this isn’t just about saving money. Almost one in 10 Australians don’t take their prescribed medicine because of the cost. Better prices would help more people to buy the medicine they need. The Government should take three steps to cut the extremely high prices we pay for generic drugs. First, it should ask the Department of Health to release annual international comparisons of Australia’s drug prices. Everyone would then be able to see whether we are getting value for money. Second, when the current pricing agreement expires in July next year, there should be one-off benchmarking to get fair market prices. Finally, an independent drug pricing body should be established to make sure prices stay low in the future...|$|E
