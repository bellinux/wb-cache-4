40|$|It {{is widely}} {{known that the}} seismic {{response}} characteristics of a <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> depends heavily on several key dynamic properties of the soil stratum, such as predominant frequency and damping ratio. A widely used method for estimating the predominant frequency of a <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> by using microtremor records, proposed by Nakamura, is investigated to determine its effectiveness in estimating the damping ratio. The authors conducted some microtremor measurements of <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> in Hong Kong and found that Nakamura's method might {{also be used to}} estimate the damping ratio of a <b>soil</b> <b>site.</b> Damping ratio data from several typical <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> were obtained from both Nakamura's ratio curves using the half power point method and resonant column tests. Regression analysis indicates that there is a strong correlation between the damping ratios derived from these two different approaches. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{limitations}} of traditional inelastic response spectra are discussed. Considering a one-storey asymmetric plan system subjected to perpendicular bi-directional earthquake motions, the inelastic multi-dimensional strength reduction factor spectra is presented. The yield {{rule of the}} asymmetric plan system is determined by two-dimensional yield-surface plasticity function. The spectral equation is simplified by the relationship of strength reduction factors between x-direction and y-direction. The multi-dimensional spectra are analyzed based on 30 pair strong earthquake motion records for hard <b>soil</b> <b>site,</b> intermediate <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> and soft <b>soil</b> <b>site.</b> Analytic results shows that the strength reduction factor mean spectra for each <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> has its own characteristics, and the strength reduction factor spectra is affected strongly by ductility, normalized stiffness eccentricity, period and rotation frequency ratio...|$|R

40|$|We present {{numerical}} modelling results for three typical <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> in Hong Kong {{subjected to a}} large number of rock site ground motions. The sites selected are naturally deposited colluvium and alluvium sites (Group I and II <b>Sites),</b> and reclaimed <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> with layers of soft marine deposit (Group III Sites). The rock site motions selected are from both intra- and interplate earthquakes with PGAs from 0. 005 g to 0. 25 g. Our results show that variation of normalized spectra is not always consistent with increasing rock site shaking levels, and exhibits a very large scatter at most spectral periods. Variation of peak ground accelerations (PGA) shows that soil nonlinearity is unlikely to cause PGA deamplification in most <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> in Hong Kong for a rock site excitation with a PGA of 0. 1 g or less. For a <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> without soft marine deposit layers, mean spectral ratios are likely to be significantly large than 1. 0 for all periods and can be as high as about 3. 0 at first modal period of a site. For a site on reclaimed land with soft marine deposit layers, deamplification can possibly occur in a period range of 0. 2 - 1. 0 s but significant amplification at periods beyond 1. 0 s is observed from our numerical results. Mean amplification ratios of <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> with soft marine deposit layers can be in a range of 1. 5 – 2. 5 at the first modal period of the site. This level of amplification would lead seismic load as the control design load for many buildings in soft <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> in Hong Kong...|$|R

Two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of jatropha seed cake on maize dry matter and grain yield and its effect on weed density and biomass. Experiment 1 explored the use of jatropha seed cake rates ranging from 767 kg/ha to 3835 kg/ha in maize production. Included in the experiment were three other treatments viz extension recommendation for inorganic fertilizer, farmerÂ¡Â¦s practice of applying cattle manure and a control. A Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) was used and a total of 8 treatments were assessed.

40|$|Microtremor {{records have}} been used to assess seismic {{amplification}} of <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> in Hong Kong. The method is based on ratios of horizontal and vertical components of microtremor (ambient noise) records, and the ratios are often referred to as Nakamura's ratios. The peak frequency of the Nakamura's ratio correlates well with the fundamental modal frequency estimated from the site shear wave velocities which were derived by a vertical seismic profiling method or were converted from SPT data. The amplitudes of the ratios are very stable and the standard deviation of the ratios derived from a series of measurements is reasonably small. Results from rock sites show that the ratios take a value of unity at a wide frequency range when the site has no large topographical effect. The ratios are generally larger than unity if the site has topographical effect but no dominant peak appears in the ratios. Results from <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> show that a dominant peak appears at the fundamental frequency of the site and the amplitudes of the dominant peak are between 6 and 12 for mean ratios. It is plausible to take the maximum value of the ratios as the peak amplification of the soil layers (Fourier spectral ratio) at small strain motions. Results from <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> also show that many sites on reclaimed land and land fills are likely to be susceptible to seismic amplification. The seismic amplification has possible implications for those buildings with about 20 storeys or less founded on <b>soil</b> <b>sites.</b> Site fundamental modal frequencies estimated by microtremor records have been obtained from extremely small strain motions and they are likely to change during a moderate or strong earthquake shaking.

40|$|Abstract On average, <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> behaved nonlinearly {{during the}} M 6. 7 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake. This {{conclusion}} follows from an analysis that combines elements of two independent lines of investigation. First, we apply the stochastic finite-fault simulation method, calibrated with 28 rock-site {{recordings of the}} Northridge mainshock, to the simulation of the input motions to the <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> that recorded this event. The calibrated model has a near-zero average bias in reproducing ground motions at rock sites in the frequency range from 0. 1 to 12. 5 Hz. The <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> selected are those where there is colocation of strong-motion accelerographs and temporary instruments from the Northridge aftershock observation network. At these sites, weak-motion amplification functions based on numerous aftershock records have been empirically determined, in three separate investigations reported in the literature. These empirical weak-motion amplification factors {{can be applied to}} the simulated input rock motions, at each <b>soil</b> <b>site,</b> to determine the expected motions during the mainshock (i. e., neglecting nonlinearity). These expected motions can then be compared to the actual recordings during the mainshock. This analysis shows that the recorded strong-motion spectra are significantly overestimated if weak-motion amplifications are used. The null hypothesis, stating that the inferred differences between weak- and strong-motion amplifications are statistically insignificant, is rejected with 95 % confidence in the frequency range from approximately 2. 2 to 10 Hz. On average, the difference between weak- and strongmotion amplifications is a factor of 2. Nonlinear response at those soil stations for which the input peak acceleration exceeded 150 to 200 cm/sec 2 contributes most to this observed average difference. These findings suggest a significant nonlinear response at soil stations in the Los Angeles urban area during the Northridge mainshock. The effect is consistent with the increase in damping of shear waves at high levels of strain, which is well known from geotechnical studies of soil properties...|$|R
30|$|Based on past earthquakes, {{the ground}} motions on soft <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> {{were found to}} be {{generally}} larger than those of nearby rock outcrops (Idriss and Seed 1968). These amplifications of <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> responses were simulated using several computer programs such as SHAKE (Schnabel et al. 1972). The SHAKE program computes the site response of horizontally layered soil-rock profile subjected to transient and vertical travelling shear waves based on the wave propagation solutions of Kanai (1951), Roesset and Whitman (1969), and Tsai and Housner (1970). Cyclic soil behavior is simulated using an equivalent linear model, which is commonly adopted in geotechnical earthquake engineering applications (Idriss and Seed 1968; Kramer 1996). One of the latest versions of SHAKE, which considers frequency-dependent equivalent strain, is SHAKE 91 (Idriss and Sun 1992; Sugito 1995). In my study, a similar site response algorithm proposed by Bardet et al. (2000) is used.|$|R

For the purpose of obtaining the mean spectra, earthquake input energy is normalized as the ratio of earthquake input energy to square of peak ground acceleration. The energy balance equation is established based on the SDOF system, and the improved earthquake input energy spectral model is presented. The earthquake motion records of three kinds of <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> are selected as the earthquake excitations of the SDOF system, and the mean spectra is established by nonlinear time history analysis.

40|$|Noting that {{contemporary}} seismic design codes {{have become more}} and more demanding in terms of requirements related to design forces and deformations for buildings, this paper attempts to demonstrate that it could be prudent to consider the introduction of soil-structure interaction (SSI) provisions into local codes in order to potentially offset the costs incurred by the high demand for base shear attributed to site amplifications by soft <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> as per current code requirements.

40|$|The tree {{community}} of both canopy gaps and mature forest was surveyed in a 5 ha plot of cloud {{forest in the}} Ibitipoca Range, south-eastern Brazil, aiming at: (a) comparing the tree community structure of canopy gaps with that of three strata of the mature forest, and (b) relating the tree community structure of canopy gaps with environmental and biotic variables. All saplings of canopy trees with 1 – 5 m of height established in 31 canopy gaps found within the plot were identified and measured. Mature forest trees with dbh 3 cm were sampled in four 40 40 quadrats laid on the four <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> recognised in the local soil catena. All surveyed trees were identified, measured and distributed into three forest strata: understorey (< 5 m of height), sub-canopy (5. 1 – 15 m) and canopy (15. 1 – 30 m). The following variables were obtained for each gap: mode of formation, age, <b>soil</b> <b>site,</b> slope grade, size, canopy openness and abundance of bamboos and lianas. A detrended correspondence analysis indicated that the tree community structure of gaps in all <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> was more {{similar to that of}} the mature forest understorey, suggesting that the bank of immatures plays an important role in rebuilding the forest canopy and that gap phases may be important for understorey shade-tolerant species. There was evidence of gap-dependence for establishment for only one canopy tree species. Both canonical correspondence analysis and correlation analysis demonstrated for a number of tree species that the distribution of their saplings in canopy gaps was significantly correlated wit...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of ERS- 2 SAR {{to changes in}} soil and forest canopy moisture is investigated at a boreal forest test region in Finland. An inversion approach to estimate moisture characteristics from SAR data is applied. The method requires that a priori information on forest biomass (stem volume) and soil type distribution is available. The inversion technique provides estimates that are here, in addition to backscattering signatures, directly compared with daily in situ moisture values. The results indicate that timeseries of C-band radar observations {{can be used for}} the monitoring of boreal forest moisture variations. Especially, the detection of the driest and the wettest conditions on mineral <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> appears to be a feasible application even for single channel radar. The obtained SAR-based soil moisture estimates showed an RMSE level of 6 %-units against the in situ data for pinedominated mineral <b>soil</b> <b>sites.</b> time-series of 18 ERS- 2 SAR observations from the Hyytiälä forest research station, Finland. These data are also used for the estimation of (a) regional soil moisture at pine or spruce dominated mineral <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> and (b) regional volumetric water content of forest canopy at the same sites. This is carried out by inverting a semi-empirical boreal forest backscattering model [3]. 2. TEST SITE AND MATERIAL The test site of this investigation, the Hyytiälä forest research station, represents southern boreal forest zone. Scots pine and Norway spruce forests dominate the region. Mineral soil is the most usual land type. However, mires are also typical. Typical pine forest of the region are depicted in Fig. 1. 1...|$|R

40|$|Seismic site classifications {{are used}} to {{represent}} site effects for estimating hazard parameters (response spectral ordinates) at the <b>soil</b> surface. Seismic <b>site</b> classifications have generally been carried out using average shear wave velocity and/or standard penetration test n-values of top 30 -m soil layers, according to {{the recommendations of the}} National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) or the International Building Code (IBC). The site classification system in the NEHRP and the IBC is based on the studies carried out in the United States where soil layers extend up to several hundred meters before reaching any distinct soil-bedrock interface and may not be directly applicable to other regions, especially in regions having shallow geological deposits. This paper investigates the influence of rock depth on site classes based on the recommendations of the NEHRP and the IBC. For this study, <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> having a wide range of average shear wave velocities (or standard penetration test n-values) have been collected from different parts of Australia, China, and India. Shear wave velocities of rock layers underneath soil layers have also been collected at depths from a few meters to 180 m. It is shown that a site classification system based on the top 30 -m soil layers often represents stiffer <b>site</b> classes for <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> having shallow rock depths (rock depths less than 25 m from the soil surface). A new site classification system based on average soil thickness up to engineering bedrock has been proposed herein, which is considered more representative for <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> in shallow bedrock regions. It has been observed that response spectral ordinates, amplification factors, and site periods estimated using one-dimensional shear wave analysis considering the depth of engineering bedrock are different from those obtained considering top 30 -m soil layers.
