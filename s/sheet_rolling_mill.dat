40|$|The {{following}} {{main objectives}} were put and realize in the article: {{to confirm the}} peculiarities {{of the process of}} loads generating inside the machine’s elastic system with regard to both the level of external action and own elastic characteristics of the machine; determine the load’s spectrum for iron and steel machines of <b>sheet</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mills,</b> including useful and harmful loads, acting jointly and determining its strength and durability and also to work out the methods of reducing and limiting the loads, generated in iron and steel machines. In his previous publications the author mentioned many times that iron and steel machines possessed low «quality» (i. e. technological load in relation to general load), so for these machines the share of useful loads could evaluate but {{a small portion of the}} general load. For the field lines of these machines the «quality» can vary within 0  ≤ K ≤  1. 0. At K =  0 the entire load remains parasitic. At K =  1. 0 the entire load is useful (technological). For <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> their «quality» for the entire operating time in the bulk of field lines is quite high and stable. The exception is the time of transition process (metal gripping with rolls, acceleration, slowing down etc.). For <b>sheet</b> and plates <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> the «quality» value at gripping is 0. 2  ≤ K ≤  0. 5, the time of gripping being tenth fractions of a second. The «quality» can be raised by changing working characteristics of the corresponding field lines. The most promising variant of alternating the working characteristics is developing and implementing of special active appliances. The essence of the method of reduction of the rate at metal gripping, proposed by the author is in mounting of an elastic energy accumulator in the drive of the roughing stand of 1, 700 wide-strip <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> of «Ilyich iron and steel works» PSC, which can be rotated by 120 … 180 ° at nominal loads of the drive. It allows to reduce by two times the gripping rate 9 and accelerate), the number of mill’s engine revolutions, remaining the same. In this case the energy accumulating shaft, equipped with an elastic element, made of up-to-date polyurethane elastomers is an active part. i. e. the part, that has a sufficient influence upon the value of generated loads. In the given example the quality was raised from 0. 25 to 0. ...|$|R

To maintain a constant thickness in aluminium foil production, beta radiation is passed through the foil to a sensor on the other side. If the intensity becomes too high, then the rollers adjust, increasing the thickness. If the intensities become too low and the foil has become too thick, the rollers apply more pressure, causing the foil to be made thinner.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a possible slip line field (slf) for theoretical calculations of the deforming pressure (load) in a second pass of a lubricated cold rolling sheet mill and validation using values from an aluminium <b>sheet</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> was done in this work. This will be relevant in the manufacturing industries providing an easy method for determining necessary applied rolling load. Experimental rolling was carried out to observe the shear lines in the deformation field. Construction of possible slip line field model was developed adhering strictly to assumptions of rigid plastic model. Calculation of the deforming force/load was achieved using Hencky’s equation. Results showed that the load calculations for constructed slip line field using aluminium sheet rolling as an example tallied with values obtained from Tower Aluminium rolling mill. Slip line fields constructed for the second pass described adequately the rolling pressure in the cold rolling process, giving a valid solution of the exact load estimates on comparison with the industrial load values. Roll pressure along the arc of contact rose fairly linearly from {{the entrance to a}} maximum at the exit point. This work showed that slf for the first pass in a cold rolling mill cannot be used for subsequent passes; it requires construction of slfs for each pass in the cold rolling process...|$|E

40|$|During {{the cold}} {{reduction}} of steel <b>sheet</b> in a <b>rolling</b> <b>mill,</b> <b>rolling</b> oils {{are used for}} lubrication to provide the desired steel surface. Rolling oil formulations consist largely of mineral oils, glycerides and/or synthetic esters, fatty acids, emulsifiers and additives. These oils are generally used as 2 - 5 % emulsions and will be subjected to high temperature and pressure during use. This results in chemical changes within the oil that can affect steel surface cleanliness after annealing. It is advantageous to have rolling oils that are stable but easily removed during annealing and leaving a minimal amount of residues. Thus {{in the field of}} <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> technology the surface quality of rolled product and stability of rolling oils are critical in the selection of lubricants. Additionally, production cost and environmental impact are also critical in the selection of lubricants. In this study, the performance of vegetable-based rolling oils was investigated by recording the FTIR spectra of the oils using Horizontal Attenuated Total Reflectance, an internal reflection accessory, before and after systematic heat treatment. Evidence was found that the vegetable-based oils degraded on heating and the spectroscopic analysis indicated that this was due to rearrangement of unsaturated components from a cis to a trans configuration.

In conjunction with a plausible failure criterion the Gologanu-Leblond model, which is based on non-spherical ductile void growth, is able to predict edge cracking and the characteristic zigzag damage pattern {{on the edge of the}} rolled sheet. The experimental determination of the model parameters remains a challenging task, since the stress and strain history at the edge of a rolled sheet is substantially different from the situation in a tensile test, and also from that in other conventional laboratory tests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: All {{over the}} India, {{most of the}} {{processing}} industries are involved with rolling operations for steel and alloyed materials. To perform these operations, <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> are used. But maintenance of such <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> is a tedious job, because these <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> work under certain critical conditions such as frequent load variations, higher temperatures etc. Hence, every component bears load variations, which results in wear and tear of components.

40|$|Abstract — {{the process}} of plastic {{deformation}} of metal by passing it through the rolls called as the metal rolling. Rolling is widely used forming process, which can have high production figures and precise control of final product. Rolling is classified in two major parts the cold rolling and hot rolling. Every part has its own theory, development of rolling process and subsequently the designing of the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> components, like rolls and <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing. The aim of the present paper is to understand the various methodologies which are used to design the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> We {{have focused on the}} history of the rolling process; it is understand that the rolling process was adopted since year 1590. Although it was raw method but it initiated the slitting <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> and the actual experimentation were started from year 1670. In those days rolling was concerned with rolling of bars only after few years the rolling of bars were started. We also tried to discuss the earlier patents which were granted in 18 th century and was related to the tandem mill which were using copper and brass as the rolling materials. In year 1783, after the entry of grooved rolls the rolling production increased up to 15 times and that was the start of modern <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> While reviewing the design of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> components our area of interest is to visit design of rollers and <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing. We have discussed the different parameters and factors that affect the roll design. The calculations for the power required for rolling operation and the roll dimensions are also discussed. In reviewing the design of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing, we try to explain the load that comes on the rolls during the rolling operations and how it affects the bearing life.
