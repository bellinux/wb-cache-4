A consultant (Larry Wilmore) arrives to teach the staff about tolerance and diversity, but Michael insists on imparting his own knowledge—aggravating both the consultant and the entire office staff—and creates his own diversity seminar. He eventually assigns each staff member an index card with a different race on it, causing tempers to slowly <b>simmer</b> <b>until</b> they finally snap.

2500|$|As observant Jews do not cook on Shabbat, various {{techniques}} {{were developed to}} provide for a hot meal on Shabbat day. One such dish is [...] "cholent" [...] or [...] "chamin," [...] a slow-cooked stew of meat, potatoes, beans and barley (although {{there are many other}} variations). The ingredients are placed in a pot and put up to boil before lighting the candles on Friday night. Then the pot is placed on a hotplate, traditional [...] "blech" [...] (thin tin sheet used to cover the flames, and on which the pot is placed), or in a slow oven and left to <b>simmer</b> <b>until</b> the following day.|$|E
2500|$|The cuisine of the Jews of {{the city}} was a variant of the Judeo-Spanish cuisine, which is itself {{influenced}} by the large ensemble of Mediterranean cuisine. It was influenced by the Jewish dietary rules of kashrut, which include prohibitions on the consumption of pork and mixtures of dairy and meat products, and religious holidays that require the preparation of special dishes. However, its key feature was its Iberian influence. Fish, abundant in this port city, was consumed in large quantities and in all forms: fried, baked ("al orno"), marinated or braised ("abafado"), and was often accompanied by complex sauces. Seen as a symbol of fertility, fish was used in a marriage rite called dia del peche ("day of fish") {{on the last day of}} wedding ceremonies, in which the bride stepped over a large dish of fish that was then consumed by the guests. Vegetables accompanied all the dishes, especially onions; garlic was on hand but was not used, since the Ashkenazic synagogues were major consumers of garlic and had been given the nickname [...] "El kal del ajo," [...] "the garlic synagogue." [...] Greek yogurt, widely consumed in the Balkans and Anatolia, was also highly appreciated, as well as cream. In anticipation of Shabbat, hamin was prepared. A Judeo-Spanish variant of the Ashkenazi cholent and the North African dafina, chamin was a meat stew with vegetables (wheat, chickpeas, white beans) that were let <b>simmer</b> <b>until</b> the Saturday midday meal. In preparation for Passover, housewives filled locked chests with sweets, figs and dates stuffed with almonds, marzipan and the popular chape blanche (white jam), which consisted of sugar water and lemon. Wine was reserved for religious rituals, but Sephardim, like their Greek and Muslim neighbors, were major consumers of raki. They also favored sugary drinks made of prune, cherry and apricot syrup, which they drank at the end of the large festive meal.|$|E

Then I will wake her, if she has gone to sleep, and make her drink the broth. It will do her ever so much more good than wine, and she {{will be all right}} in the morning, though no doubt she will be desperately stiff again. Still, it has not been a longer ride than she had yesterday. I expect it is the excitement, more than the fatigue, that has upset her. Tomorrow she must ride in front of me, again." ...|$|E
50|$|A dark broth {{is made by}} cooking {{black beans}} with onion and butter in {{sufficient}} water. Rice is fried with garlic, then the bean broth without the beans is added, as well as epazote, serrano pepper, and salt. The rice is <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> tender.|$|R
50|$|Rice-A-Roni is {{a product}} of PepsiCo's {{subsidiary}} the Quaker Oats Company. It is a pilaf-like boxed food mix that consists of rice, vermicelli pasta, and seasonings.

Potatoes on the side.|$|R
50|$|The peace {{established}} by the Pact was short-lived and {{proved to be more}} of a truce than a treaty. The rebellion was renewed briefly in August 1879, the Spanish abandoned most of their commitments, and a guerilla war <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> the outbreak of the Cuban War of Independence in 1895.|$|R

2500|$|Sentiment for {{separation}} of East Falls Church was first raised in 1921, and <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> separation occurred in 1936—a result of its disgruntled citizens, who cited [...] "intolerable confusion of overlapping governmental agencies." [...] East Falls Church ceased to exist, {{and much of it}} today lies under the route of Interstate Highway 66.|$|R
50|$|Rice or {{foxtail millet}} is soaked {{for at least}} 2 hours before being drained and boiled, usually {{at a ratio of}} 1 part grain to 10 parts water (1:10). It is <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> sodden and mushy, then {{strained}} through a double sieve. The Sieved gruel is then warmed again and served with two small dishes of salt and cheongjang (clear soup soy sauce).|$|R
50|$|A typical {{recipe for}} tapioca jelly {{can be made}} by washing 2 tablespoonfuls of tapioca, pouring a pint of water over it, and soaking for three hours.

50|$|Hospitality Suite is {{an award-winning}} stage play written by Roger Rueff that centers on {{conflicting}} notions of character, salesmanship, honesty, religion, and love that <b>simmer</b> <b>until</b> they boil over as two experienced salesmen {{and a young}} research engineer await a CEO whose visit to their modest hospitality suite could save their company from ruin.|$|E
50|$|Seswaa, or chotlho or leswao is a {{very popular}} {{traditional}} meat dish made for most special occasions. Usually prepared by men, it is cooked in a three-legged iron pot, <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> soft, with only salt and water. Another popular dish is serobe, in which the intestines and some inside parts of goat, sheep or cow are cooked until soft. If the animal is sheep or goat, the trotters are included.|$|R
5000|$|Curry sauce (karē sōsu) {{is served}} {{on top of}} cooked rice to make curry rice. Curry sauce is made by frying {{together}} curry powder, flour, and oil, along with other ingredients, to make roux; the roux is then added to stewed meat and vegetables, and then <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> thickened. Adding potatoes to curry sauce was introduced by William S. Clark of the Sapporo Agricultural College, due to rice shortages at the time.|$|R
50|$|Tomatoes have a rich flavor, high liquid content, {{very soft}} flesh which breaks down easily, {{and the right}} {{composition}} to thicken into a sauce when they are cooked (without the need of thickeners such as roux). All of these qualities make them ideal for simple and appealing sauces. The simplest tomato sauces consist just of chopped tomato flesh cooked in {{a little olive oil}} and <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> it loses its raw flavor, and seasoned with salt.|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} cooking {{is done by}} braising the sauce (offal, beef, ground peanuts or beans) which is brought {{to a boil and}} later simmered until it is ready. The sauce is then poured over the peeled matoke and left to <b>simmer</b> <b>until</b> the matooke is ready. [...] Katogo takes a {{relatively}} short time to prepare and today most people use wood or charcoal as a cooking fuel.|$|E
50|$|It {{contains}} corn, {{green bell}} pepper, onion, and sometimes garlic, celery, and tomato. The ingredients are braised in a pot. Historically bacon grease {{was used for}} the braising stage, although various combinations of oil, butter, or cream may be substituted. The vegetables are then left to <b>simmer</b> <b>until</b> they reach a tender consistency, with chicken stock or water added as necessary. The dish is finished with salt and a combination of red and black pepper. Some cooks include hot sauce and a bit of sugar for greater complexity.|$|E
50|$|In this episode, Michael's (Steve Carell) {{controversial}} {{imitation of}} a Chris Rock routine forces the staff to undergo a racial diversity seminar. A consultant (Larry Wilmore) arrives to teach the staff about tolerance and diversity, but Michael insists on imparting his own knowledge—aggravating both the consultant and the entire office staff—and creates his own diversity seminar. He eventually assigns each staff member an index card with a different race on it, causing tempers to slowly <b>simmer</b> <b>until</b> they finally snap. Meanwhile, Jim struggles to keep hold of a lucrative contract extension, but Dwight makes the sale for himself.|$|E
5000|$|Rendang - Perak {{has its own}} {{variants}} of rendang, the most well known being rendang tok. Rendang tok uses a liberal amount of dried milled spices and unlike many other rendang varieties found in Malaysia, it is much drier in comparison, with the gravy being greatly reduced from prolonged <b>simmering</b> <b>until</b> all that’s left is merely a thick layer that coats and adheres onto each piece of meat. Rendang tok {{can be found in}} some eateries and restaurants in Ipoh, and is usually cooked with beef.|$|R
50|$|After the Restoration, {{there was}} a Fifth Monarchist {{uprising}} in London led by New Englander Thomas Venner. This was used in Royalist propaganda to unfairly blame all the upheaval {{of the last two}} decades on New England. It was not helped {{by the fact that the}} New Haven Colony sheltered several regicides. New Haven was merged with the Connecticut Colony as punishment. New England as a whole remained the hotbed of Puritanism where sentiments for the 'Good Old Cause' against the 'Norman yoke' <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> the Glorious Revolution.|$|R
50|$|The hair {{is removed}} from the trotters and they are {{thoroughly}} washed. Scallions, garlic, ginger, cheongju (rice wine) and water are brought to a boil. The trotters are added, brought back to a boil and then <b>simmered</b> <b>until</b> tender. After this, additional measures of water, sugar and soy sauce are poured into the pot, and the contents are slowly stirred. Once the trotters are fully cooked, they are de-boned and cut into thick slices. They are then served with a fermented shrimp sauce called saeujeot, cloves of raw peeled garlic, and spicy peppers.|$|R
