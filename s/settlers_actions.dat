50|$|When the {{expedition}} {{returned to the}} Plateau, their grievances {{were sent to the}} HBC by the Nez Perce Ellis. He met with John McLoughlin and James Douglas, with both men offering their condolences and sympathy. The company men did not offer any material support however. Next Ellis visited Elijah White then the U.S. Indian Sub-agent. White had previously made the Cayuse and Nez Perce adopt a system of laws that outlawed natives from killing whites and vice versa. Ellis demanded that Cook be brought to White to be punished as according to the laws. His powers were limited and restricted only to act as an American representative in the Pacific Northwest in dealings with indigenous. Even then the region was formally jointly occupied between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States of America as the Oregon boundary dispute had yet to be settled. As New Helvetia was located within Mexican Alta California, White held no authority there and was unable to compel any resolution to the conflict. Ellis told White that there were three groups divided on how the Plateau natives should act. One faction felt it best to punish the Willamette Valley settlers as they were Americans, like Toayahnu’s killers. Another faction preferred to establish what the reactions of the HBC and Willamette Valley <b>settlers</b> to <b>action</b> against the California colonists. A final block preferred military action against the California settlements as White recounted: He assured me that the Cayuse, Walla Wallas, Pend d'Oreilles, Flatheads, Nez Perces and Snakes, were all in terms of amity, and all that portion of the aggrieved party were for raising about two thousand warriors of these formidable tribes and march to California at once, and nobly revenge themselves on the inhabitants and then by plunder enrich themselves on the spoils.|$|R
40|$|During the {{allotment}} era, {{the federal}} government took land from tribes and parceled some of it out to individual tribal members, while, in most cases, selling off the remainder to non-Indian <b>settlers.</b> Those <b>actions,</b> which are properly understood as unconstitutional takings, have been reinforced through decades of Supreme Court precedent. Specifically, the Court has used the now repudiated federal allotment policy, which contemplated eventual abolition of tribal governments, to justify contemporary incursions on tribal jurisdictional authority {{as well as other}} limitations on tribal sovereign rights. In this way, the Court builds new injustices upon old ones. This Article responds to this Supreme Court precedent with two main points. First, it shows that non-Indians at the time had notice that the allotment policy was unfair to tribes (and that they sometimes directly advocated for its injustices). From this information, I argue that non-Indian purchasers of tribal lands—and subsequent purchasers from them—should not be understood to have had justifiable expectations that the reservations would disappear and that they therefore could not be subject to tribal jurisdiction in the future. Second, I argue that the Supreme Court should stop using the troubled history of allotment, which it construes based on incomplete information and without taking account of tribal interests and perspectives, to justify further restrictions on tribal sovereignty. My purpose in this Article is to question both the substance of these presumed expectations and their justifiability. I begin this questioning with a thorough analysis of previously unexamined historical newspaper articles concerning non-Indian settlement of Indian reservations during the allotment era. I then argue that, as reflected by the above quote from Superintendent King, most non-Indians during the allotment period cared little about whether Indians were treated justly. Furthermore, I argue that many non-Indians had notice that tribes were being unjustly deprived of their lands through the allotment process, and that some non-Indians even advocated for this very injustice to occur. Both notice of injustice and complicity in the government’s unjust actions precluded non-Indian purchasers from forming justifiable expectations. This rigorous, context- specific look at non-Indian expectations suggests that, in sharp contrast to current Supreme Court practice, tribal jurisdiction over nonmembers should generally be upheld and Indian reservations should not generally be held to have been diminished or disestablished as a result of allotment...|$|R
50|$|In the 1840s European {{settlers}} {{began to}} intrude upon the Nisqually territory in search new territory to establish new reign over. The numbers of settlers gradually snowballed and the Nisqually people were originally peaceful with the <b>settlers</b> until the <b>actions</b> of territorial governor Isaac Stevens in 1853. Stevens terminated Indian land rights and took {{millions of acres}} from native peoples and attempted to establish the Treaty of Medicine Creek with Chief Leschi of the Nisqually people. The treaty proposed was declined by Leschi due to the small amounts of land they would receive from {{it as well as}} the treaty requiring the Nisqually people to move away from Medicine creek to less livable and isolated shrubland. It is firmly believed by many that Stevens’ laws and actions in the war heavily influenced the retaliation of the Nisqually natives in the Puget Sound Indian war due to his mistreatment of the Native Nisqually and the middling and unsurvivable land he assigned them. After the Puget Sound Indian War had ceased, the native Nisqually tribesmen were assigned a new reservation back alongside the river but survival was still difficult due to the restricted sizes of their reservations as well as the U.S. military’s confiscation of 3,000 acres of their land for the creation of the Fort Lewis Military Reserve. Many Natives began to leave the reserves in search of better opportunities and homes elsewhere and {{from the beginning of the}} 20th century until the 1940s the US government controlled the education of Nisqually youth in attempts to assimilate them into white American culture.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses {{theories of}} ethno-racial competition, boundary work, and collective action {{to explain the}} variable mobilization of collective ethnic violence against indigenous peoples in early American California, ca. 1850 - 1865. To do so, the dissertation proceeds through three chapters. The first chapter, “American Settler Colonialism, Racial Formation, and Competition Theory,” provides a theoretical framework that supports the empirical inquiries in the subsequent two chapters. To develop this framework, I draw from the American <b>settler</b> colonialism, collective <b>action,</b> ethnic competition, and mass violence and atrocities literatures to suggest new directions {{for the study of}} settler-colonial (i. e. inter-polity) intergroup competition and conflict. The second chapter provides a regional analysis of the dynamics of collective ethnic violence against indigenous peoples in central and northern California, ca. 1850 - 1865. This chapter focuses on the role of frame disputes as a mediating mechanism in intergroup conflicts. The central theoretical claim, which finds strong support, is that frame disputes among settlers in different California regions influenced the dynamics of collective violence by attributing different levels of collective out-group “threats” to proximate indigenous groups. As in contemporary cases, this ethno-racial polarization and subsequent violence was produced by the explicit attempts of local political actors to durably politicize ethno-racial group membership. The third empirical chapter looks more closely at the mechanisms supporting varying annual levels of collective ethnic violence against indigenous peoples in the Humboldt Bay region of California, ca. 1853 - 1865. This chapter continues my emphasis on framing and boundary work mechanisms as mediators of collective conflicts, while focusing my theoretical attention more squarely on issues of threat assessment, or the ways in which group-based threats are collectively appraised by nominal power-holding group members. Drawing from theories of mediated competition, I demonstrate the specific necessity of organizational resources for extremist mobilization, and that elite framing and boundary work were required to link aggrieved individuals with these mobilizing resources. These findings confirm the role of framing and associated boundary work mechanisms in the politics of collective threat assessment. To conclude, I discuss the implications of these threat assessment issues for future historical and contemporary study of reactive mobilization...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho investiga a presença da Igreja Católica no oeste do Estado do Paraná no período de 1930 a 1990. O período é relativo ao momento em que a Igreja marca presença através de sua institucionalização na região. A atuação da Igreja junto aos fiéis possibilitou a construção de um imaginário religioso através do qual, ao mesmo tempo em que a Igreja valorizou a presença dos colonos, estes tiveram a possibilidade de se instalarem na região, e estabeleceram uma relação de valorização ao papel desempenhado pela Igreja. A Igreja Católica utilizou-se de práticas e discursos que possibilitaram marcar presença na região, desenvolvendo uma estratégia que a caracterizou como uma instituição de necessidade ímpar junto aos colonos, a fim de provê-los dos "bens espirituais". Ao mesmo tempo, construiu a imagem do colono enquanto um homem abnegado ao trabalho e voltado aos interesses da coletividade. A recepção do discurso católico e as ações pastorais para que os discursos encontrassem receptividade por parte dos fiéis também foi uma questão analisada. Ao apontar para a construção do imaginário religioso, procurou-se {{investigar}} a partir das práticas e discursos feitos pelo clero católico junto aos colonos e a maneira como estes foram recebidos pelos colonos. Inúmeras ações foram desenvolvidas pelo clero católico e ainda hoje continuam, visando a melhor forma de atingir os fiéis, nos mais diversos níveis sociais. A realização do Concílio Ecumênico Vaticano II foi um momento de redefinição da Igreja Católica. O trabalho mostra a Igreja e sua atuação no espaço regional e as interferências que ela começou a sofrer a partir do pensamento conciliar que a perpassou em âmbito mundial, reelaborando um novo conceito de igreja e a repercussão destas mudanças na região. Por fim, os processos de tecnificação do campo e de urbanização que se intensificaram a partir da década de 1970, provocaram uma situação de redefinição da ação da Igreja a qual passou a remodelar seus discursos e reconstruir outras representações frente às mudanças ora registradas. Somado a isso, se percebe que a recepção dos discursos por parte dos fiéis também passou a exigir, dos emissores, estratégias mais elaboradas e convincentes. A abordagem conclusiva do trabalho consiste na demonstração das representações construídas pelos agentes da Igreja que atuaram durante os processos de colonização e de modernização. This work {{investigates the}} presence of the Catholic Church in west of Paraná State in the period of 1930 a 1990. The period is relative to the moment that the Church is made institutional in the region. The role of the Church with the settlers presents a wealth of elements that built a body of representations, which contributed in a two-way process. At the same time the Church valorized {{the presence of}} the settlers, these had the possibility of settling in the region, and they established a relation of valorization and of importance in the role played by the Church. The Catholic Church, in settling its presence in the region, developed an own strategy of performance with the settlers, using the discourses that made possible to build itself as an institution of single necessity to the settlers, to provide them with “spirituals blessings”. At the same time, it searched to build the settler’s image as an unselfish man to the work and turned to the interests of the group as well. The reception of the catholic discourse and the pastoral actions to make the discourse find receptiveness by the churchgoers it was also an analyzed issue. In pointing out to the construction of the imaginary religious, it searched to investigate from the practices and discourses done by the catholic cleric with the settlers and the way as these were received for the <b>settlers.</b> Many <b>actions</b> were developed by the catholic cleric and continue until today, aiming {{the best way to get}} to the churchgoers in the several social levels. The realization of the Vatican Ecumenical Council II was a moment of redefinition of the Catholic Church. The work shows the Catholic Church and its performance in the region and the interferences that it started to suffer from the conciliatory thought that passed it by in a world scope, elaborating again a new concept of Church and the repercussion of this changes in the region. At last, the process of mechanization and urbanization of the field, which was intensified from the decade of 1970, provoked a situation of redefinition of the Church role, which began to remodel its discourses and rebuild other representations before the changes registered at this period. Adding to this, it is realized, that the reception of the discourses by the churchgoers also began to demand, from the speakers, more elaborated and convincing strategies. The conclusive approach of the work consists in the demonstration of the representations built or by the agents of the Church that worked during the process of colonization, or by the agents of the Church that worked during the process of modernization...|$|R
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) No {{complete}} {{history of}} Fiji {{has yet been}} written, although several studies on specific topics have been attempted. Until a history does appear, the files of the Fiji Times {{will serve as a}} continuous record of events in the more than one hundred years since it was first published in September 1869. If one accepts Asa Briggs' statement that: "Newspapers are among the most important sources of evidence for the modern historian", then it follows that a study of the Fiji Times, should provide valuable information because its files express contemporary views and reflect the attitudes of the time. This study will be concerned with the period from 1869 to 1875 - from the inception of the paper, until the future of Fiji became tied to that of Great Britain. The period represents a time of great political, economic and social significance to Fiji. On the political side, the settlers had to make a choice between seeking annexation, or attempting to rule themselves. This period was also one of extreme economic upheaval when the plants were finding that cotton was no longer a commercial proposition and were searching desperately for a substitute, eventually selecting sugar. At this time also, the relationship between the European settlers and the Fijians was entering a critical stage where the Fijians, although numerically far stronger, were being increasingly controlled by the European minority. This thesis will analyse the leading articles and correspondence columns of the Fiji Times to see how the <b>settlers</b> interpreted their <b>actions</b> in this political, economic and social context. Reference will be made to other newspapers and similar contemporary sources such as letters, diaries, pamphlets and published reminiscences. Although at one stage the Cakobau Government purchased a newspapers which presented {{the point of view of}} that Government, the emphasis in this study will be placed upon the Fiji Times, which was the only independent newspaper available to the settlers. The years prior to the cession of the islands to Great Britain have received close attention from two groups of historians. The first group, consisting of Ward, Morrell and Legge, have tended to concentrate on official documents for their source material. The second group, which comprises Derrick, Scarr, Routledge and Young, have used Fijian resources much more. Even so, a situation has been created where the opinions and attitudes of the ordinary settlers have virtually disappeared from view, in favour of those of the 'personalities' like Thurston, March, Goodenough and Laynard. All of the second group of historians have used the Fiji Times as an important source. Derrick and Routledge have tended to use the paper for information on specific events, while Young was more interested in using it to look at Fijian society. Only Scarr has commented upon some of the ideas expressed by the Fiji Times. It thus seemed desirable that a study of the paper should be made, where the reactions of the settlers to the problems of the time could be examined. Another important function of this thesis will be an assessment of the role of the Fiji Times, which caused a controversy among its contemporaries. Richard Philp, a barrister from Victoria who went to Fiji in 1872, hoping to be appointed Attorney-General, commented that the papers was "a little affair". Others saw it in grander terms, and A. B. Brewster, a resident in the islands for some forty years, said that: "The Fiji Times was our local thunderer and helped also in the maintenance of peace [...] . it was always champion of the faithful commons of our little community against the arbitrary powers which were assumed by King Cakobau's ministers". These conflicting opinions have found reflection in modern studies. Legge has accepted, without question, the Fiji Times as a source of information, while Routledge has described the editorials as "blindly vituperative", and Scarr has roundly condemned the paper for being "the supreme exponent of the racist ethic". This thesis will attempt a re-assessment of the opinions and role of the Fiji Times. Of the problems encountered during the gathering of material for this study, several are sufficiently important to be mentioned here. Unfortunately, no records remain of the day-to-day operations of the Fiji Times as a business organisation, and this has meant that little technical information concerning the paper is available. The information given in Chapter 2 concerning editorials, printing, distribution and circulation has been extracted from the paper itself, either from direct statements or from implications. As with most newspaper studies, it has also proved difficult to determine the effectiveness of the paper's policies, since few people in diaries or reminiscences have referred to the paper. For example, G. H. W. Markham, a planter, kept a diary in which he referred to receiving copies of the paper, but he did not attempt at any time to comment on an editorial or article, or to express a reaction to the paper. Thus, assessments of the validity of the paper's policies have had to rely on the less direct method of comparing policies with events and attitudes. The thesis does not pretend to present an all-embracing review of the years 1869 to 1875. Rather, it intends to use the Fiji Times as a device for: looking at a key period of Fijian history in a new way; examining the settlers' reactions to some of the political, economic and social problems of the time; and finally, assessing the role and attitudes of the Fiji Times...|$|R
