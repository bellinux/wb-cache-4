40|$|The pulsed {{electrodeposition}} {{of copper}} on stainless steel {{has been studied}} in copper sulphate bath {{and the effect of}} duty cycle and frequency on the thickness and current efficiencies were compared at 50 uC and at room temperature with average current density of 4 A dm 22. A new <b>strike</b> <b>bath</b> based on cupric chloride and hydrochloric acid was developed for the first time. The Cu coatings were characterised by SEM, AFM and XRD. Crystallite sizes of Cu coatings were calculated for various duty cycles from the Schererâ€™s equation. The deposits were smaller nodules and fine grained...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{a method for}} {{continuously}} coating copper on steel wire is heing developed. The pre-treated steels have made to run horizontally through various cells containing cleaning solution, pickling solution, <b>strike</b> <b>bath</b> and plating hath. After a thin coat of nickel, the steel wil-e was plated using an acid copper bath. A single strand horizontal wire plating unit was fabricated for the purpose. Hull Cell was used to optimise the operating conditions of the selected bath. The current efliciency {{of the process and}} the electrical resistivity of the coated wires were also measured. The copper coated steel wires may substitute copper cables in tele-communication and other applications...|$|E
40|$|Copper <b>strike</b> <b>baths</b> are {{extensively}} used {{in metal}} plating industry as they present {{the ability to}} plate adherent copper layers on less-noble metal substrates such as steel and zinc die castings. However, {{in the last few}} years, due to environmental controls and safety policies for operators, the plating industry has been interested in replacing the toxic cyanide copper <b>strike</b> <b>baths</b> with environmentally friendly baths. A broad bibliographic review showed that the published papers, referring to the new nontoxic copper <b>strike</b> <b>baths,</b> are patents, having little or no emphasis focused on electrodeposition mechanisms. Therefore, it was decided to study the copper electrodeposition mechanism from a <b>strike</b> alkaline <b>bath</b> prepared {{with one of the most}} nontoxic chelating agents cited in many patents which is the 1 -hydroxyethane- 1, 1 -diphosphonic acid, known as HEDP. This acid forms very stable water soluble complexes with Cu(2 +) ions, thus cupric sulfate was used for preparing the plating bath. The results obtained through a cyclic voltammetry technique showed that Cu(2 +) ion reduction to Cu from an HEDP electrodeposition bath occurs via a direct reduction reaction without a formation of Cu(+) intermediates.

When a jet of canola oil is {{incident}} on a bath {{of the same}} oil at an appropriate range of angles and speeds, {{it is possible to}} form antibubbles {{below the surface of the}} bath. An antibubble is formed when a liquid jet <b>strikes</b> the <b>bath</b> at the correct speeds and angles. This study examines the dynamics of antibubble formation.

40|$|Color poster with text, images, and graphs. Antibubbles are {{structures}} {{in which a}} core of liquid surrounded by an air film is suspended in a bath of that same liquid. These structures can affect mixing of liquids when poured. Antibubble formation has been well studied in soapy water systems, but not in single component systems such as oil. In either type of system, a jet of liquid <b>strikes</b> a <b>bath</b> of the same liquid. The {{purpose of this study}} was to look at the disturbances in the jet necessary for antibubble formation in the oil system.

40|$|Color poster with text, images, and graphs. When a jet of {{canola oil}} <b>strikes</b> a <b>bath</b> {{of the same}} oil within the correct range of speeds and angles, the jet will rebound off the bath back into the air. This project studied the air film which {{separates}} the jet from the bath making this phenomenon possible. Using high-speed video, lasers, and flow-tracing with dyes and smoke, visual evidence {{of the existence of}} the air film is presented. The processes by which the air film and bounce are maintained are also discussed.
