50|$|Logging {{roads are}} {{constructed}} {{to provide access}} to the forest for logging and other forest management operations. They are commonly narrow, winding, and unpaved, but main haul roads can be widened, <b>straightened</b> <b>or</b> paved if traffic volume warrants it.|$|R
25|$|Because of the then-prevalent {{notion that}} {{straight}} hair was more acceptable than kinky hair, many black people began exploring solutions for <b>straightening,</b> <b>or</b> relaxing, their tresses. One post-slavery solution was {{a mixture of}} lye, egg and potato, which burned the scalp upon contact.|$|R

50|$|Curling and {{straightening}} hair {{requires the}} stylist {{to use a}} curling rod or a flat iron to get a desired look. These irons use heat to manipulate the hair {{into a variety of}} waves, curls and reversing natural curls and temporarily straightening the hair. <b>Straightening</b> <b>or</b> even curling hair can damage it due to direct heat from the iron and applying chemicals afterwards to keep its shape.There are irons that have a function to <b>straighten</b> <b>or</b> curl hair even when its damp (from showering or wetting the hair), but this requires more heat than the average iron(temperatures can range from 300-450 degrees). Heat protection sprays, and hair repairing shampoos and conditioners can protect the hair from damage caused by the direct heat from the irons.|$|R
50|$|Because microalloyed steels are not {{quenched}} and tempered, {{they are}} not susceptible to quench cracking, nor do {{they need to be}} <b>straightened</b> <b>or</b> stress relieved. However, because of this, they are through-hardened and do not have a softer and tougher core like quench and tempered steels.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{the process}} is often used for the {{chemical}} hair <b>straightening,</b> <b>or</b> relaxing (a process first developed by Renaud Whittington). This process makes use of the same chemical reactions {{as that of the}} permanent wave, but the hair is combed straight rather than wrapped around forms.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{construction}} of the new dock there was extensive development around Marfleet, including extensive railway sidings for the dock; there was also new housing around Frodsham Street and Ceylon Street, west and south of the village; additionally Back Lane had been <b>straightened</b> <b>or</b> widened, and renamed Marfleet Avenue; other developments included a brickworks, church institute, school, and other factory works.|$|R
50|$|Futura {{is a type}} of {{synthetic}} fiber that can withstand heat up to 400 °F (200 °C), and can actually outlast human hair. It is very similar to human hair given it is tangle-free and has a natural sheen. It can be <b>straightened</b> <b>or</b> curled, however, it takes longer to set and futura cannot be colored. It is sometimes sold as a human hair blend.|$|R
5000|$|A rattail is a hair {{style that}} is {{characterized}} by a long [...] "tail"-like element of hair growing downward {{from the back of the}} head. The rattail usually hangs naturally; however, it can be braided, treated as a dread, permed, <b>straightened,</b> <b>or</b> poofed, curled with an iron. In some instances, an individual might choose to grow several tails as opposed to a single very long tail.|$|R
25|$|For larger specimens, or {{species with}} stiffer wood, bonsai artists also use {{mechanical}} devices for shaping trunks and branches. The most common are screw-based clamps, which can <b>straighten</b> <b>or</b> bend {{a part of}} the bonsai using much greater force than wiring can supply. To prevent damage to the tree, the clamps are tightened {{a little at a time}} and make their changes over a period of months or years.|$|R
50|$|Trigger finger is {{a common}} {{disorder}} which occurs when the sheath through which tendons pass, become swollen or irritated. Initially, the finger may catch during movement but symptoms like pain, swelling and a snap may occur with time. The finger often gets locked in one position {{and it may be}} difficult to <b>straighten</b> <b>or</b> bend the finger. Trigger finger has been found to be associated with diabetes, gout and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|R
50|$|The {{river is}} subject to the Wild Ennerdale Project which aims to {{introduce}} more wildlife to the Ennerdale Valley. The Wild Ennerdale Project uses a policy similar to managed retreat which means the river {{is subject to}} no human interference or maintenance such as dredging, <b>straightening</b> <b>or</b> even flood defences. This means the river is free to flood as the effects would be felt by very few people as the Ennerdale Valley is sparsely inhabited.|$|R
40|$|An {{implicit}} {{numerical procedure}} is developed {{to solve the}} full three-dimensional laminar, boundary layer equations over realistic aircraft and spacecraft configurations. This procedure utilizes splined functions in the direction normal {{to the surface and}} finite differences in the cross flow direction. Calculation of off-pitch <b>plane</b> <b>attachment</b> and detachment lines can be calculated. The solution procedure permits the incorporation {{of a wide variety of}} turbulent models and boundary conditions including; entropy layer procedures, specified surface temperatures or heat flux distributions, surface catalysis, mass addition, and the coupling to both three-dimensional inviscid codes and surface ablation codes. In addition, reasonable computing times are obtained...|$|R
50|$|While the old Canal ran {{next to the}} Mohawk {{all the way to}} Rome, the new canal {{ran through}} the river, which was <b>straightened</b> <b>or</b> widened where necessary. At Ilion, the new canal left the river for good, but {{continued}} to run on a new alignment parallel to both the river and the old canal to Rome. From Rome, the new route continued almost due west, merging with Fish Creek just east of its entry into Oneida Lake.|$|R
5000|$|The Modern English word right {{derives from}} Old English riht or reht, in turn from Proto-Germanic *riχtaz meaning [...] "right" [...] or [...] "direct", and {{ultimately}} from Proto-Indo-European *reg-to- meaning [...] "having {{moved in a}} straight line", in turn from *(o)reg'(a)- meaning [...] "to <b>straighten</b> <b>or</b> direct". In several different Indo-European languages, a single word derived from the same root means both [...] "right" [...] and [...] "law", such as French droit, Spanish derecho, German Recht, and Italian diritto.|$|R
5000|$|Stropping a knife is a {{finishing}} step. This {{is often}} {{done with a}} leather strap, either clean or impregnated with abrasive compounds (e.g. chromium(III) oxide or diamond), but can be done on paper, cardstock, cloth, or even bare skin in a pinch. It removes little or no metal material, but produces a very sharp edge by either <b>straightening</b> <b>or</b> very slightly reshaping the edge. Stropping may bring a somewhat sharp blade to [...] "like new" [...] condition.|$|R

50|$|Hair {{straightening}} is a hair styling {{technique used}} since the 1890s involving the flattening and straightening of hair {{in order to}} give it a smooth, streamlined, and sleek appearance. It became very popular during the 1950s among black males and females of all races. It is accomplished using a hair iron or hot comb, chemical relaxers, Japanese hair straightening, Brazilian hair <b>straightening,</b> <b>or</b> roller set/blowdryer styling. In addition, some shampoos, conditioners, and hair gels can help to make hair temporarily straight.|$|R
40|$|During walking {{there is}} a period when weight is {{transferred}} onto one leg and the knee bends to absorb the shock. A common problem following stroke is excessive <b>straightening</b> <b>or</b> hyperextension of the knee at this time. Possible causes of knee hyperextension have been suggested including lower limb muscle weakness. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if a relationship exists between knee hyperextension and lower limb muscle strength in order to guide the rehabilitation of walking following stroke...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the major}} {{findings}} of a study into the performance of certain types of beam-to-column connections are presented. 17 full-scale specimens used common beam and column sizes as well as welded flanges and cover plates and bolted webs; they were designed {{in accordance with the}} AISC Seismic Specification. Some connections had rotary straightened columns, others used gag <b>straightened</b> <b>or</b> unstraightened members. Loading was applied quasi-statically or dynamically. The results show that the form of column straightening has no effect on connection performance...|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{temporary}} straightening method that originated in the Dominican Republic. The technique spread to the United States where it was popularized by Dominican stylists. The Dominican Blowout allows highly-textured and tightly-curled hair types to be straightened {{without the use of}} chemicals, and creates more movement and sleekness on tightly-curled hair types than conventional temporary straightening methods. It has become popular, particularly among African Americans as an alternative to permanent hair <b>straightening</b> <b>or</b> as a method of straightening the hair between relaxers- ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the {{original}} Dremel Moto-Tool was to rotate a bit at high speed; the bit being held in a collet. Variable-speed versions may cover a range of 3,000-37,000 RPM. The Dremel concept relies on high speed as opposed to torque unlike a conventional power drill, for example. By inserting an appropriate bit (or burr) the tool can perform drilling, grinding, sharpening, cutting, cleaning, polishing, sanding, routing, carving, and engraving. Both battery-powered and corded models are available. (Early cordless models were marketed as the Dremel Freewheeler.) Dremel options include a miniature <b>planer</b> <b>attachment</b> and a saber saw attachment that lets the tool act much like a small reciprocating saw.|$|R

5000|$|The {{appearance}} of the affected arm (or arms) depends on the individual case. In some cases the arm may lack the ability to <b>straighten</b> <b>or</b> rotate but otherwise function normally giving the overall {{appearance of}} the arm to be stiff and crooked. Whereas in other circumstances the arm has little to no control and has a [...] "loose" [...] appearance. Treatment such as physiotherapy, massage and electrical stimulation can help to prevent this early on (or throughout) the patient's life by strengthening the arm.|$|R
5000|$|Tenodesis {{grasp and}} release is an {{orthopedic}} observation of a passive hand grasp and release mechanism, effected by wrist extension or flexion, respectively. It {{is caused by}} the manner of attachment of the finger tendons to the bones and the passive tension created by two-joint muscles used to produce a functional movement or task (tenodesis). [...] Moving the wrist in extension or flexion will cause the fingers to curl or grip when the wrist is extended, and to <b>straighten</b> <b>or</b> release when the wrist is flexed.|$|R
