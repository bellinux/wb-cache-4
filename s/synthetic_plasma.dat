40|$|Several {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) methods have been described for the determination of caffeine in human plasma. However, none have been cross validated using <b>synthetic</b> <b>plasma.</b> The present study describes a simple and reliable HPLC method for {{the determination of the}} caffeine level in human plasma. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>plasma</b> was used to construct calibration curves and quality control samples to avoid interference by caffeine commonly present in donor’s human plasma. After deproteination of plasma samples with perchloric acid, caffeine and antipyrine (internal standard, IS) were separated on a Waters Atlantis C 18 column using a mobile phase of 15 mM potassium phosphate (pH 3. 5) and acetonitrile (83 : 17, v/v), and monitored by photodiode array detector, with the wavelength set at 274 nm. The relationship between caffeine concentrations and peak area ratio (caffeine–IS) was linear over the range of 0. 05 – 20 µg/mL. Inter-run coefficient of variation was ≤ 5. 4 % and ≤ 6. 0 % and bias was ≤ 3 % and ≤ 7 % using human and <b>synthetic</b> <b>plasma,</b> respectively. Mean extraction recovery from human plasma of caffeine and the IS was 91 % and 86 %, respectively. Caffeine in human plasma was stable for at least 24 h at room temperature or 12 weeks at – 20 °C, and after three freeze-thaw cycles. The method was successfully applied to monitor caffeine levels in healthy volunteers with correction of caffeine levels using the mean ratio of the slopes of the calibration’s curves constructed using human and <b>synthetic</b> <b>plasma...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>plasma</b> <b>synthetic</b> jet {{is a novel}} {{flow control}} {{approach}} which is currently being studied. In this paper its characteristic and control effect on supersonic flow is investigated both experimentally and numerically. In the experiment, the formation of <b>plasma</b> <b>synthetic</b> jet and its propagation velocity in quiescent air are recorded and calculated with time resolved schlieren method. The jet velocity is up to 100 m/s and no remarkable difference has been found after changing discharge parameters. When applied in Mach 2 supersonic flow, an obvious shockwave can be observed. In the modeling of electrical heating, the arc domain is not defined as an initial condition with fixed temperature or pressure, but a source term with time-varying input power density, {{which is expected to}} better describe the influence of heating process. Velocity variation with different heating efficiencies is presented and discussed and a peak velocity of 850 m/s is achieved in still air with heating power density of 5. 0 × 1012 W/m 3.

The endothelial cells treated with CK 2 inhibitor decreased the ACE phosphorylation and increased its shedding. Seminal plasma peptide (pGlu-Val-Ala-Asp-Ser-Asp-Gln-Asn), synthesized following data obtained from biochemical and mass spectrometry analysis of highly purified fraction from bovine seminal plasma, was demonstrated to be a substrate of CK 2.

40|$|A {{mechanistic}} model including {{the role of}} platelets is proposed for clot formation and growth in plasma in vitro. Initiation of clot formation is {{by the addition of}} tissue factor, and initiation via the intrinsic pathway is neglected. Activation of zymogens follows the extrinsic pathway cascade and reactions on platelet membranes are included. Platelet activation occurs due to thrombin and also due to other activated platelets. Inhibition of the active clotting factors is by ATIII and TFPI, whereas inhibition due to APC is not relevant in the conditions modeled. The model predictions matched existing data for thrombin production in <b>synthetic</b> <b>plasma.</b> The model predicts that inhibition of platelet-driven activation of platelets has a major effect on concentration of activated platelets in PRP, normal plasma and PPP. Inhibition of platelet activation by (other activated) platelets significantly delays thrombin production in PRP and normal plasma as compared to that by thrombin.

This study aims at synthesizing a new bioactive bone cement with different amounts of ibuprofen (5, 10 and 20 wt%) using a low toxicity activator, and investigating its in vitro release profile. The effect of ibuprofen (IB) on the setting parameters, residual monomer and bioactivity in <b>synthetic</b> <b>plasma</b> was also evaluated. It was verified that the different IB contents do not prevent the growth of calcium phosphate aggregates on composite surfaces, confirming that the cements are potentially bioactive. A relevant advantage of these formulations was a significant improvement in their curing parameters with increasing IB amount, associated to a reduction of the peak temperature and an extension of the setting time. The investigated cements released an average of about 20 % of the total incorporated ibuprofen during 30 days test, with IB 20 liberating the highest percentage of drug 20. 6 %, and IB 10 and IB 5, respectively 19. 1 and 17. 6 %. This behavior was attributed to the low solubility of this drug in aqueous media and was also related with the hydrophobic character of the polymer.

The basal testosterone production (without LH stimulation) was not influenced by <b>synthetic</b> seminal <b>plasma</b> peptide. In Rana esculenta, spermatogenesis is well characterized at morphological, endocrine and paracrine levels. Spermatogonial multiplication occurs in late winter-early spring, while spermatocytes (I and II) and spermatids are rare or totally absent.

40|$|Three model {{systems have}} been used to study the {{dynamics}} of the blood clotting process initiated by tissue factor (TF) : <b>synthetic</b> <b>plasma</b> mixtures prepared with purified coagulation proteins and inhibitors; mathematical models based on the reaction constants, stoichiometries and thermodynamics of individual catalyst and inhibitor reactions; and contact suppressed whole blood induced to clot in vitro by the addition of exogenous TF. In the three models, the generation of thrombin can be described in terms of an initiation phase in which pmol/l concentrations of the coagulation serine proteases are generated and the cofactor proteins factor V (FV) and FVIII are activated. Subsequently, explosive thrombin generation occurs during a propagation phase. The complementary inhibitory pathways extinguish the generation of thrombin. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), present in low concentrations, primarily influences the duration of the initiation phase and has little influence on the propagation phase. Antithrombin III (ATIII), present in higher concentrations, has little influence during the initiation phase, but decreases the rate of thrombin generation during the propagation phase. The protein C pathway cannot act in the absence of thrombin and therefore only influences the duration of the propagation phase by inactivating activated FV. Thus combinations of TFPI plus ATIII and TFPI plus protein C pathway components contribute to the synergistic inhibitory processes. As a consequence of the roles of pro, and anti-coagulants, the generation of thrombin by the TF pathway becomes a threshold limited proces...|$|E
40|$|Background—Reliable {{markers and}} methods to predict risk for {{thrombosis}} {{are essential to}} clinical management. Objective—Using an integrated approach that defines an individual’s comprehensive coagulation phenotype might prove valuable in identifying individuals at risk for experiencing a thrombotic event. Methods—Using a numerical simulation model, we generated tissue factor (TF) initiated thrombin curves using coagulation factor levels from the Leiden Thrombophilia Study population and evaluated thrombotic risk, by sex, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI) and oral contraceptive (OC) use. We quantitated the initiation, propagation and termination phases of each individuals ’ comprehensive TF-initiated thrombin generation curve by the parameters: time to 10 nM thrombin, maximum time, level and rate (MaxR) of thrombin generated and total thrombin. Results—The greatest risk association was obtained using MaxR; with a 2. 6 fold increased risk at MaxR exceeding the 90 th percentile. The odds ratio (OR) for MaxR was 3. 9 in men, 2. 1 in women, and 2. 9 in women on OCs. The association of risk with thrombin generation did not differ by age (OR: 2. 8 ≤ 45 years>OR: 2. 5), BMI (OR: 2. 9 ≤ 26 kg/m 2 >OR: 2. 3) or alcohol use. In both numerical simulations and empirical <b>synthetic</b> <b>plasma,</b> OC use created extreme shifts in thrombin generation in both control women and women with a prior thrombosis, with a larger shift in thrombin generation in control women. This suggests an interaction of OC use with underlying prothrombotic abnormalities.

We demonstrate how patient blood management strategies lead to excellent surgical outcomes. Methods: From 2003 to 2008, 16 JW underwent cardiac surgery at our institution. Only senior surgeons performed coronary revascularization (n= 6), valve (n= 6), combined (n= 1) and aortic surgery (n= 3) of which two patients presented with acute type-A dissection. Off-pump surgery remained {{the method of}} choice for patients requiring a bypass procedure (n= 5). Preoperative hematocrit (Hk) and hemoglobin (Hb) were 42. 8 ± 4. 7 % and 14. 5 ± 2 g/dl. In three patients with an Hb< 12 g/dl, preoperative hematological stimulating treatment was implemented. Results: All patients survived, no major complications occurred and no blood transfusion was administered. The Cell Saver® system (transfused volume: 474 ± 101 ml) and <b>synthetic</b> <b>plasma</b> substitutes [Ringer's Lactate: 873 ± 367 ml and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 6 %: 700 ± 388 ml] were used routinely as well as hemostaticas, such as bone wax, and fibrin glue. The decrease of Hk and Hb {{appeared to be the}} lowest after off-pump surgery when compared to all other procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (25 ± 9 % vs. 33 ± 6 %; P= 0. 01 and 22 ± 9 % vs. 31 ± 6 %; P= 0. 04). Similarly, the decrease of platelets was significantly lower (20 ± 12 % vs. 43 ± 14 %; P= 0. 01). In the follow-up period (52 ± 34 months), one patient died due to a non-cardiac reason, whereas all others were alive, in good clinical condition and did not have major adverse cardiac events (MACE) or recurrent symptoms requiring re-intervention.

J), is being studied by the DMAE department of the ONERA, and the Laplace laboratory of the CNRS, in France. This actuator was inspired by the " Sparkjet " device developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The PSJ, which produces a synthetic jet with high exhaust velocities, no active mechanical components and no mass flow admission, holds the promise of enabling high-speed flows to be manipulated. With this high velocity jet it is possible to reduce fluid phenomena such as transition and turbulence, thus making it possible to increase an aircraft's performance whilst at the same time reducing its environmental impact. A thermal plasma discharge was created in a micro cavity, causing the gas to be expelled. It is relevant that the velocity and momentum depend on the energy dispersed by the electric discharge. To control the frequency and energy dispersed in the plasma, the Laplace laboratory has developed two high voltage power supply systems. These allow two different types of discharge to be produced, with energy being supplied to the discharge in two different manners. In this paper, we focus on the impact of the power supply on the <b>Plasma</b> <b>Synthetic</b> Jet, and in particular {{on the role of the}} rate of energy dissipation in the discharge. In order to estimate the influence of the power supply on the machinery of the actuator, specific experimental techniques were used to investigate the electrical (voltage, current), thermal (Infra-red camera) and aerodynamic (jet duration, isentropic pressure, jet velocity) characteristics. These data sets were used to determine which of the two power supplies was more effective, thus allowing us to reach several conclusions concerning the importance of the energy dissipation rate on the PSJ actuator...|$|R
40|$|Among active {{flow control}} techniques, <b>plasma</b> <b>synthetic</b> jet (PSJ) {{actuators}} {{seem to be}} a promising technology to improve aircraft performances due to their short response time, high jet velocities and absence of moving parts. An electrical discharge is produced within a cavity, increasing pressure and temperature, causing the exhaust of the gas through the orifice. After few cycles a periodic behaviour is reached generating a <b>plasma</b> <b>synthetic</b> jet. A numerical and experimental investigation was conducted to characterize the performance of the actuator and its potential as an active flow control method. An original lumped-element physical model (LEM) able to predict the temporal evolution of the major thermo-fluid-dynamic quantities of the device was developed. The governing equations are fully gasdynamics based and include viscous losses; the air is modelled as a real gas and both radiative and convective heat transfer mechanisms are considered at walls. The correct simulation of the refill regime is guaranteed by the inertial term included in the unsteady Bernoulli's equation. Axisymmetric numerical computations, carried out with OpenFOAM computer code, has allowed one to calibrate the lumped model through the determination of some fitting parameters. Finally, experimental measurements have allowed the completion of device investigation, producing valuable information about pressure, jet velocity and duration of the discharge. Results for both single pulse mode and repetitive working regimes are obtained, providing insights on major actuation characteristics.

These states may be adapted and specifically tuned by cells during active cellular processes, as we show for stimulated insulin secretion. Most importantly, these states regulate both the partitioning of molecules between coexisting domains and the bioactivity of their constituent molecules, which we demonstrate for the ligand binding activity of the glycosphingolipid receptor GM 1. These results confirm the complexity and flexibility of lipid-mediated membrane organization and reveal mechanisms by which this flexibility could be functionalized by cells...|$|R
40|$|Neural Cadherin (NCAD) is one {{of three}} Type 1 {{vertebral}} “classical” cadherins that function as the primary transmembrane component in cell-to-cell interactions at adherens junctions. Adhesive interactions mediated by this protein are calcium dependent with three calcium-binding sites between each of its five extracellular domains. NCAD is very important in many cell-to-cell interactions because of its function in development and in immune and neurological synapses. Generally, in vitro studies of calcium dependent dimerization of NCAD are conducted in a nonphysiological buffer (NaCl + HEPES: SEC buffer). In order to study dimerization in more physiologically relevant conditions, I created a <b>synthetic</b> blood <b>plasma</b> (SBP) that more closely mimics the conditions in the extracellular space in the human body. Spectroscopic and chromatographic {{studies have shown that the}} stability, calcium binding affinity and dimerization properties depend upon the buffer conditions. Thermal denaturation studies show that stability of NCAD 12 in SBP buffer is similar to that in SEC buffer. Calcium binding studies show precipitation in SBP buffer, most likely due to the precipitation of calcium phosphate. The data also appear to show competition between Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + in SBP buffer. Analytical SEC studies indicate that there is a lower affinity of dimerization in SBP buffer compared to that in SEC buffer. Further studies titrating NCAD 12 with magnesium to determine its effects on dimerization without the presence of calcium are necessary to understand the effect that magnesium has on dimerization. In summary, the more complex environment in which dimerization occurs in vivo impacts the apparent properties of NCAD...|$|R
40|$|Apolipoprotein J (apoJ, clusterin) is a {{multifunctional}} protein normally {{associated with}} lipids in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, and secreted as lipoparticles by hepatocytes and astrocytes. To investigate whether the structural and functional properties of apoJ are modulated upon binding to lipids, we prepared apoJ high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -like particles employing either <b>synthetic</b> or <b>plasma</b> HDL-derived lipids. The {{majority of the}} resulting lipoparticles contained one molecule of apoJ per particle and exhibited the same alpha 2 electrophoretic mobility characteristic of apoJ-containing plasma HDL. Particle size seemed {{to be dependent on}} the presence of cholesterol in the lipid mixture and ranged from diameters of 10 nm in the presence of cholesterol to 20 nm in the absence of cholesterol. CD analysis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed similar changes in the apoJ secondary structure induced by its incorporation into lipoparticles, namely a decrease in alpha-helix content and an increase in beta-turn structures. Two functional assays, the binding interaction with Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptides and the inhibitory activity of the complement membrane-attack complex, did not detect any changes in apoJ activity following its lipidation (P> 0. 05). On the contrary, the binding affinity to the cellular receptor megalin was enhanced significantly (P< 0. 01) after the association with lipids; the K(d) value decreased from 78. 8 +/- 10. 7 nM for the delipidated form to 37. 0 +/- 7. 3 nM for apoJ-HDL. Although it is not known whether the structural changes observed are directly responsible for the higher receptor-binding affinity, the data suggest that the complement inhibition and amyloid beta-binding motifs are located in areas of the molecule different from those involved in the apoJ-megalin interaction...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} novel actuator called Spark-Plug <b>Plasma</b> <b>Synthetic</b> Jet (SPSJ) {{has been}} developed in Atmospheric Plasma Research Laboratory at Niğde University. It generates electrothermally high synthetic jet velocity by using high voltage. SPSJ actuator can be utilized to be an active flow control device having some advantages such as no moving parts, low energy consumption and easy to integrate the system. This actuator consists of two main components: semi-surface spark plug (NGK BUHW) as an anode electrode and a cap having an orifice as a cathode electrode. The cap, having a jet exit orifice diameter of 2 mm, has diameter of 4. 4 mm and height of 4. 65 mm. This study presents the characteristics of SPSJ actuator by using the hot wire anemometer in order to approximately determine jet velocity in quiescent air. Peak velocity as high as 180 m/s was obtained for fe= 100 and duty cycle 50 %. The flow visualization indicated that the actuator’s jet velocity is enough to penetrate the developed boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePractical {{application}} of active flow control {{is dependent upon}} the development of robust actuators that are reliable, small, easy to integrate and have no or very small delay. Onera is developing <b>Plasma</b> <b>Synthetic</b> Jet actuators, PSJ, {{in order to show}} the potential of such electrical devices to act on aerodynamic phenomena like separated flows. The characterization of the pulsed jet produced by a PSJ actuator is investigated with experimental techniques, helping the validation of theoretical and numerical studies carried out in parallel. This article mainly describes the physics of PSJ actuators with numerical and experimental studies on the characterization of the PSJ device with and without flow and on the ability of PSJ actuators to reduce the separated flow region on a decelerating ramp and on an NACA- 0015 airfoil. PSJ actuator efficiency has been quantified using the PIV technique, in order to estimate the decrease of the separated flow region induced by the actuation and consequently the drag reduction. The results show very promising effect with a separation almost completely cancelled...|$|R
40|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>synthetic</b> jet (PSJ), or Sparkjet, {{actuators}} {{seem to be}} {{a promising}} technology to improve the aircraft performances due to their short response time, high jet velocities and absence of moving parts. This paper aims at presenting a combined numerical and experimental investigation, to obtain information about the frequency response of the device. From the numerical point of view, an innovative lumped-element model (LEM), able to predict the temporal evolution of the main fluid-dynamic variables of the device, is presented. It is fully based on the gasdynamics equations, it includes viscous losses as well as radiative and convective heat transfer mechanisms at walls, and it considers the air as a real gas. OpenFOAM numerical computations have been carried out to perform a first calibration of the lumped model through the determination of key fitting parameters. Results for both single pulse mode and repetitive working regimes are reported, providing insights on the major actuation characteristics. To validate the model, a home-designed actuator has been manufactured, together with the control electric circuit. Experimental measurements of the jet velocity complete the actuator characterization and the model validation...|$|R
40|$|Using {{bioinformatics}} analysis, we previously identified salusin-β, an endogenous bioactive peptide {{with diverse}} physiological activities. Salusin-β is abundantly {{expressed in the}} neuroendocrine system and in systemic endocrine cells/macrophages. Salusin-β acutely regulates hemodynamics and chronically induces atherosclerosis, but its unique physicochemical characteristics to tightly adhere to all types of plastic and glassware have prevented elucidation of its precise pathophysiological role. To quantitate plasma total salusin-β concentrations, we produced rabbit and chicken polyclonal antibodies against the C- and N-terminal end sequences, circumvented its sticky nature, and successfully established a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Salusin-β was abundantly present in the plasma of healthy volunteers, ranging from 1. 9 to 6. 6 nmol/L. Reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that a single immunoreactive salusin-β peak coincided with <b>synthetic</b> authentic salusin-β. <b>Plasma</b> salusin-β concentrations were unaffected by postural changes and by potent vasopressin release stimuli, such as hypertonic saline infusion or smoking. However, salusin-β concentrations showed significant circadian variation; concentrations were high during the daytime and reached the lowest concentrations in the early morning. Plasma salusin-β levels in subjects with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease showed distinctly higher levels than healthy controls. Patients wit...|$|R
