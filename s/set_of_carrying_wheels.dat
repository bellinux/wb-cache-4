50|$|In 1851 the {{carriage}} portion was removed {{and the power}} unit rebuilt, presumably with a new pair <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> making it an 0-2-2. Its use {{for the next few}} years is unclear, although it might have been moved to Taunton to pump water.|$|R
50|$|The 40 Tonners {{were found}} to be {{satisfactory}} in service, but the absence <b>of</b> leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> resulted in a rough ride.|$|R
50|$|The {{power unit}} {{had a single}} pair of driving wheels driven through a {{jackshaft}} by small 8 x 12 in cylinders, the steam produced in a vertical boiler. The boiler was not covered by a cab or other bodywork; the two pairs <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were beneath the carriage portion. It had seats for 16 first class and 32 second class passengers. It was once timed as running at 52 mph.|$|R
50|$|There were {{scarcely}} {{any differences}} between the various build series. Not until 1896 were minor changes made to the heating areas, the weights and the coal and water capacities. The rigid mounting of the driving and <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> {{and the location of}} the cylinder just in front <b>of</b> the <b>carrying</b> <b>wheel</b> did not prove a success. The D IX locomotives could haul 170 t on the flat at a speed of 65 km/h, on routes with a 2% incline they could manage 95 tons at 20 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Technical {{progress}} in railways had developed edge rails, which were capable <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> heavier <b>wheel</b> loads, {{and it is}} likely that an edge railway had been built alongside {{the lower part of the}} Carmarthenshire alignment before 1832, by which time the now-outmoded Carmarthenshire Tramroad had fallen into disuse north of Felin Foel.|$|R
50|$|During the trials, the {{locomotive}} gave some trouble due to broken plate frames {{on the engine}} units {{and it was also}} found that the absence <b>of</b> trailing <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> on the engine units was a disadvantage since it led to excessive flange wear on the coupled wheels. As a result, no. 2140 remained the only representative of its Class. All subsequent Garratt models of the SAR were equipped with trailing Bissel trucks.|$|R

5000|$|Just before James's death, Barbara Windsor is seen {{walking off}} the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>Carry</b> On Emmannuelle in disgust at the poor script when, in fact, she never went near the studios.

50|$|Cor, Blimey! {{starts with}} the arrival of Sid James's new {{wardrobe}} assistant at the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>Carry</b> On Cleo at Pinewood Studios. The audience is introduced to Sid James, portrayed as a gambling womaniser, and Kenneth Williams (played by Adam Godley). The two men are depicted as bitter rivals with a genuine antipathy for each other.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} was superheated, with a Belpaire firebox, a plate {{frame and}} Walschaerts valve gear. It was erected in the Durban shops {{and placed in}} trial service on the Natal mainline. During the trials {{it was found that}} the absence <b>of</b> trailing <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> on the engine units was a disadvantage, since it led to excessive flange wear on the driving wheels. As a result, the locomotive remained the only representative of its Class and all subsequent Garratt models of the SAR were equipped with trailing Bissel trucks on their engine units. The locomotive was withdrawn from service in 1938 because of a cracked frame and scrapped.|$|R

25|$|As designed, the R.II {{was a large}} three-bay biplane with unstaggered {{wings of}} unequal span and a fully {{enclosed}} cabin. Power was to be supplied by three 180-kW (240-hp) Maybach HS engines mounted internally in the fuselage, which transmitted their power via driveshafts to two propellers mounted tractor-fashion on the interplane struts nearest the fuselage. The main undercarriage consisted of divided units, each <b>of</b> which <b>carried</b> dual <b>wheels,</b> and the tail {{was supported by a}} pair of tailwheels.

30|$|Later on, leaf-sprung bogies are {{introduced}} in the tank suspension design [3, 4]. The system is made of a pair <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>carried</b> on leaf sprigs or leaf-sprung arms. When one wheel is raised like by contacting terrain, the other is lowered to keep uniform track pressure, which is rather light, maintenance-friendly, has decent travel length and keeps the tracks from slipping. Since the friction of the leaves sliding over each other dampens oscillation, no shock absorbers are needed. This cheap and effective system was quickly adopted widely and modified into various forms [3, 4].|$|R
