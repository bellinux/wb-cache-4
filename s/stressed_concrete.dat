Using the feasible direction method, {{a set of}} optimal geometrical dimensions, girders spacing, amount of prestressing steel, prestressing loses and tendon profile are obtained. The constraints {{that have been used}} are based upon flexural stress at initial and final stages, crack width, initial camber, deflection due to both dead and live loads, total loses, ultimate moment capacity with respect to the factored loads and cracking moment and the ultimate shear strength. This aims at finding the optimum design of pre <b>stressed</b> <b>concrete</b> girder bridge system and finding the most economical tendon profile out of three profiles, namely parabolic, L/ 3 harped, and triangular tendon profiles. The problem is formulated in general form so that introduction of specific regulations following from national codes is possible.

Numerical examples of pre <b>stressed</b> <b>concrete</b> girder bridges with standard and general sections are solved to show the efficiency of the above formulation. The results indicate that the parabolic tendon is the optimum one, especially for long spans. Also, the cost is slightly nonlinear function of span length. Therefore it can be reasonably approximated as a liner relationship. There are more savings on the cost when the section is allowed to crack.

40|$|In {{flexural}} strength design of normal-strength reinforced concrete (RC) members, the maximum <b>concrete</b> <b>stress</b> adopted by various design codes is originated from the scaled down uni-axial concrete stress-strain curve, {{in that the}} behaviour of concrete under flexure is wrongly considered to be more inferior than that under uni-axial compression.

After cracking, the tensile <b>stress</b> in the <b>concrete</b> adjacent to the crack is relieved because of the slip that takes place between the concrete and reinforcement at this location. Away from the crack, tensile <b>stress</b> in the <b>concrete</b> between cracks is present because of the bond between the reinforcement and concrete.

The coefficient of concrete permeability can be significantly affected by pore structure developed due to concrete composition. It is also influenced by the interconnectivity of those pores and micro cracks. Even though an extensive research work has been performed in the aspects of porosity and cracking effect, the investigations based on how the concrete microstructure, as a 3 -phase material (i. e. aggregate-cement paste-Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ)), could affect the permeability when subjected to loading is at scarce.

40|$|For {{small and}} medium span steel-concrete {{composite}} structures, composite dowels are used {{more than ever}} due to their positive bearing properties. While the load bearing capacity of composite dowels under static loading has been investigated extensively, open questions regarding the behavior under fatigue loading in concrete slabs made of normal strength and ultra-high-performance-concrete (UHPC) are subject of the present thesis. In common composite structures with headed studs and normal strength concrete cracking of the stud is already initiated after a few thousand load cycles. In contrast, the behavior of composite dowels under fatigue loading is characterized by compression of the multiaxial <b>stressed</b> <b>concrete</b> {{in the area of}} load introduction. This concrete damage leads to an inelastic slip in the composite joint, which increases with increasing number of load cycles and causes stress redistributions between the composite partners. The usual assumption of a rigid connection between steel and concrete becomes more and more inapplicable, which may lead to a security deficit in the fatigue design. To investigate the influence of the load-dependent parameters on the inelastic slip, cyclic shear tests were performed in the present thesis. The main influencing parameters for the description of the inelastic slip are the upper load level, the number of load cycles and the connector stiffness. A distinction is made between the hysteresis stiffness and the static stiffness. The hysteresis stiffness can be described {{as a function of the}} static stiffness and the load range. To determine the static stiffness, a spring model with the parameters dowel geometry, connectors’ thickness and main material properties is derived. The inelastic slip and the connectors’ stiffness are the primary input variables for a representative cyclic dowel curve, which can be implemented as a nonlinear spring law in FE models of composite beams to simulate concrete damage under fatigue loading. The developments of slip, deflection and steel stresses due to fatigue loading can be calcu-lated appropriately. The models are verified by a validation of composite beam tests. Due to high strength of UHPC, the influence of concrete damage is not as distinctive as in normal- and high-strength concrete. The small dowel height in combination with small fillet radius, arising from the possible slim UHPC concrete chords, result in high stress concentration factors under local shear and global loading. In consequence, in the performed shear tests steel failure is decisive. Accompanying theoretical investigations confirm this behavior. The geometric basic conditions in filigree UHPC-slabs also require considerations under cyclic tensile loading, because the embedment depths of the steel tooth are extremely small. Based on experimental and numerical investigations a deformation-based engineering model is proposed, which can be used to calculate the number of load cycles until cyclic break out failure in UHPC...|$|E
