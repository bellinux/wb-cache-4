2500|$|Two ideas {{altered the}} design of the {{printing}} press radically: First, the use of steam power for running the machinery, and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer Friedrich Koenig in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818. Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig soon met Thomas Bensley and secured financial support for his project in 1807. Patented in 1810, Koenig had designed a <b>steam</b> <b>press</b> [...] "much like a hand press connected to a steam engine." [...] The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811. He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer Andreas Friedrich Bauer.|$|E

2500|$|The Gutenberg {{press was}} much more {{efficient}} than manual copying. It remained largely unchanged in the eras of John Baskerville and Giambattista Bodoni, over 300 years later. By 1800, Lord Stanhope had constructed a press completely from cast iron, reducing the force required by 90% while doubling {{the size of the}} printed area. While Stanhope's [...] "mechanical theory" [...] had improved the efficiency of the press, it was only capable of 250 sheets per hour. German printer Friedrich Koenig was the first to design a non-manpowered machine—using steam. He moved to London in 1804, and met Thomas Bensley; he secured financial support for his project in 1807.

It was not until the late nineteenth century that the concept of the [...] "press" [...] metamorphized into a description of individuals and companies engaged in an often-competitive commercial media enterprise.|$|R
