5|$|Windows 10 {{incorporates}} Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant, Cortana, {{which was}} first introduced with Windows Phone 8.1 in 2014. Cortana replaced Windows' embedded search feature, supporting both text and voice input. Many of its features are a direct carryover from Windows Phone, including integration with Bing, setting reminders, a Notebook feature for managing personal information, as well as searching for files, playing music, launching applications and setting reminders or sending emails. Cortana is implemented as a universal <b>search</b> <b>box</b> located alongside the Start and Task View buttons, which can be hidden or condensed to a single button.|$|E

The RPN network can get {{approximate}} 20, 000 <b>search</b> <b>boxes</b> from an original input image. In practical applications, some <b>search</b> <b>boxes</b> beyond {{the border of the}} image are removed. Meanwhile, NMS (non-maximal suppression) [26] method is used to handle the overlapping of <b>search</b> <b>boxes</b> on the same target. The above strategies can significantly improve the search efficiency of candidate target boxes.|$|R

25|$|Version 7 is {{intended}} to defend users from phishing as well as deceptive or malicious software, and it also features full user control of ActiveX and better security framework, including not being integrated as much with Windows as previous versions, thereby increasing security. Unlike previous versions, the Internet Explorer ActiveX control is not hosted in the Windows Explorer process, but rather it runs in its own process. It also includes bug fixes, enhancements to its support for web standards, tabbed browsing with tab preview and management, a multiple-engine <b>search</b> <b>box,</b> a web feeds reader, Internationalized Domain Name support (IDN), and antiphishing filter. On October 5, 2007, Microsoft removed the 'genuine software' validation before install, which means that all versions of Windows, whether able to pass validation or not, are able to install the browser. The integrated <b>search</b> <b>box</b> supports OpenSearch.|$|E

Internet Explorer 8 highlights all instances of found words while allowing the user to continue the navigation normally.|$|E
25|$|Asynchronous JavaScript and JSON (or AJAJ) {{refers to}} the same dynamic web page {{methodology}} as Ajax, but instead of XML, JSON is the data format. AJAJ is a web development technique that provides for {{the ability of a}} webpage to request new data after it has loaded into the web browser. Typically it renders new data from the server in response to user actions on that webpage. For example, what the user types into a <b>search</b> <b>box,</b> client-side code then sends to the server, which immediately responds with a drop-down list of matching database items.|$|E

Tab groups {{make it possible to}} open a folder of Favorites in tabs with a single click. Importing bookmarks and cookies from other web browsers is also supported. Additionally, there is now proper support for PNG images with transparency as well as improvements and fixes to CSS and HTML rendering. The Windows RSS Platform offers native RSS support, with developer APIs.|$|E
25|$|The Omnibox is a URL {{box that}} {{combines}} {{the functions of}} both the address bar and <b>search</b> <b>box.</b> If a user enters the URL of a site previously searched from, Chrome allows pressing Tab to search the site again directly from the Omnibox. When a user starts typing in the Omnibox, Chrome provides suggestions for previously visited sites (based on the URL or in-page text), popular websites (not necessarily visited before powered by Google Instant), and popular searches. Although Instant can be turned off, suggestions based on previously visited sites cannot be turned off. Chrome will also autocomplete the URLs of sites visited often. If a user types keywords into the Omnibox that don't match any previously visited websites and presses enter, Chrome will conduct the search using the default search engine.|$|E

This paper proposes the usage of educational material "mashup", created in SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) format. A multi-user Web application for indexing and sharing SMIL presentations is described. Presentations, located on remote servers, are fetched using different protocols, analyzed and indexed using a full-text search method. Each result gives not only "the place" but also "the time" of spoken word or phrase in the course. Afterwards, the lectures can be grouped based on their content, shared and combined together into personalized <b>Search</b> <b>boxes</b> for specific courses. The placement of <b>Search</b> <b>boxes</b> on any course Web page or LMS is done by client-side technologies, which eliminates tweaking of learning systems and usage of server-side programming.

500|$|A public beta was {{released}} July 14. A reduction in memory consumption was made, {{prompted by the}} fact 40 percent of people contacting Symantec support had 512 MB of RAM. The beta uses about 6 MB of memory, compared to 11 MB by the prior version. To reduce scan times, Norton Insight uses data from Norton Community participants to avoid scanning files that are found on a statistically significant number of computers. Citing a NPD Group study finding that 39 percent of consumers switching antiviruses blamed performance, a [...] CPU usage meter will be available within the final product to allow users to find the cause of high CPU usage, whether it be Norton or another program. This version features more frequent updates, a change called Norton Pulse Updates. Rather than deliver an update every eight hours, as the 2008 version does, Pulse Updates are delivered five to fifteen minutes. [...] The Silent Mode automatically suspends alerts and updates when a program enters [...] mode and can be manually enabled. The suite's activities take place while the computer is idle, and terminate once user activity is registered. The final release (16.5) bundles spam filtering, {{which used to be}} a free download from Symantec. This release also bundles Norton Safe Web, which identifies malicious websites, compatible with Internet Explorer and Firefox. Norton Safe Web color codes search results from famous search engine such from Google and Yahoo for safety. The Norton Safe Web toolbar also includes an Ask.com <b>search</b> <b>box.</b> The <b>search</b> <b>box</b> does not share code with the Ask toolbar; instead the box redirects queries to the Ask search engine.

2500|$|Windows Vista and its successors added {{minor changes}} to the menu. Prior to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the Start menu {{consisted}} of a group of menus and sub-menus that cascaded and expanded, obscuring the initially visible portions of the screen beneath them. In Windows Vista, however, cascading menus were replaced by a sliding window in the left pane of the Start menu. Whenever All Programs item is clicked, the contents of the left pane slide off the left edge of the Start menu and the All Programs menu slides in from the right edge of the left column. This menu presents a tree view of it hierarchy that expands towards the bottom, with a vertical scrollbar whenever needed. Also added in Windows Vista is a <b>Search</b> <b>box</b> that allows users to search for the Start menu shortcuts or other files and folders. The <b>search</b> <b>box</b> features incremental search: If indexing is not turned off, the <b>search</b> <b>box</b> returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. Since the found items can be immediately opened, the Start menu <b>search</b> <b>box</b> replaces the function of Run command from previous versions of Windows. The Run command can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu. In Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the search results pane covers both columns of the Start menu. The <b>search</b> <b>box</b> is extended to support searching Control Panel items. The right column in Windows 7 links to Libraries instead of ordinary folders. Most importantly, however, items on the Start menu support Jump lists through cascade buttons on their right.
