25|$|Australia {{managed to}} reach the final, where they met Sri Lanka. Taylor scored 74, a record score by an Australian captain in the World Cup, but Sri Lanka comfortably triumphed on this {{occasion}} by seven wickets to claim the trophy. In another spiteful encounter, some players refused to shake hands after the match. Ranatunga, having declared before the match that Australian leg spinner Shane Warne was overrated, struck a six from a misexecuted flipper which turned into a full toss and promptly <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> tongue at the spinner.|$|E
500|$|On September 23, in a MSNBC {{interview}} with Kasie Hunt, Gary Johnson noted {{the benefits of}} being invited to the 2016 Presidential Debates. While discussing this topic, Johnson <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> tongue through his teeth at the reporter while explaining that he could win a three-way debate, and ultimately the Presidency, versus Clinton and Trump while speaking in that manner. Johnson's spokesperson, John LaBeaume, later stated, [...] "He was just having fun" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "lighthearted".|$|E
500|$|Alf made no real {{attempt to}} contact John {{again until the}} height of Beatlemania (claiming {{he did not know}} who the Beatles were). He was working as a kitchen porter at the Greyhound Hotel at Hampton Court, in Middlesex, when someone pointed out a {{photograph}} of John Lennon in a newspaper and asked whether he was related to him. Alfred and Charlie visited one of the Beatles' Christmas shows at the Finsbury Park Empire in London. When the Beatles were filming a scene for A Hard Day's Night in the Scala Theatre in Soho in April 1964, Alf walked into Brian Epstein's NEMS office in Argyle Street with a journalist. [...] "I'm John Lennon's father", he explained to the receptionist. When Epstein was informed, he [...] "went into a panic", and immediately sent a car to bring John to NEMS office. Alf was shabbily dressed, with his unkempt, thinning grey hair greased back. He <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand, but John did not take it, saying [...] "What do you want?". Alf placated John somewhat by saying, [...] "You can't turn your back on your family, no matter what they've done." [...] Their conversation did not last long, as John soon ordered Alf and the journalist out of the NEMS office. The Beatles' personal stories were kept out of the newspapers—by agreement with journalists who were offered exclusive stories in return—but one day John opened a copy of the Daily Express and saw a photo of his father.|$|E
5000|$|Edward Francis Murray (May 8, 1895 - November 8, 1970) was an American Major League Baseball shortstop {{who played}} in one game for the St. Louis Browns on June 24, [...] He <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> in <b>his</b> only at bat.|$|R
6000|$|They {{found an}} old man running there, [...] He had ragged long grass-yellow hair; [...] He had knees that <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> hose; [...] He had puddle water in his shoes; [...] He had half a cloak to keep him dry; [...] Although he had a squirrel's eye.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper body}} of Joannes Baptista (named after John the Baptist) and <b>his</b> left leg <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> mobile brother. He {{did not speak}} and kept his eyes closed and mouth open {{all the time and}} was thus a {{parasitic}} twin. According to a later account by Copenhagen anatomist Thomas Bartholinus, if someone pushed the breast of Joannes Baptista, he moved his hands, ears and lips.|$|R
2500|$|Wilder went to {{the awards}} {{ceremony}} expecting to win even though the studio had been backing their other big hit of the year, Leo McCarey's Going My Way, and studio employees were expected {{to vote for the}} studio favorite. As the awards show wore on and Double Indemnity lost in category after category, it became evident {{that there would be a}} Going My Way sweep. McCarey beamed as his picture won award after award and when he was named Best Director, Wilder could no longer take it. When McCarey got up to make his way to the stage to accept the award for best picture, Wilder, sitting on the aisle, <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> foot and tripped him. [...] "Mr. McCarey...stumbled perceptibly," [...] he gleefully recalled. After the ceremony while he and his wife Judith were waiting for his limousine to arrive, he yelled out so loudly that everybody could hear him, [...] "What the hell does the Academy Award mean, for God's sake? After all – Luise Rainer won it two times. Luise Rainer!" ...|$|E
60|$|Naylor <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> heavy under-lip {{and glanced}} sidelong at his friend.|$|E
60|$|Tom <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> great chin, {{and looked}} at him with one of his quaint sidelong moues.|$|E
5000|$|He {{also let}} his beard grow, which {{was against the}} {{contemporary}} fashion. Eventually it was so thick that it <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> under <b>his</b> arms and could be seen from behind. In {{a couple of years}} he decided to build a swimming pool in his mansion - it was built under glass and was heated by sun. There he spent hours at the time, preferably alone. He refused to have a fire in his house even in the coldest weather.|$|R
60|$|In {{the spring}} of his {{freshman}} year Carl gave up waiting on table and drove a motor-car for a town banker. He learned every screw and spring in the car. He also made Genie {{go out with him}} for track athletics. Carl won his place on the college team as a half-miler, and viciously assaulted two freshmen and a junior for laughing at Genie's legs, which <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> large running-pants like straws out of a lemonade-glass.|$|R
50|$|Liberty {{was founded}} in 1919 when W. Frank Hipp, a former top agent at Spartanburg-based Southeastern Life Insurance Company, <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> on <b>his</b> own. Within a decade, Liberty had grown large enough to buy his former employer. It entered {{broadcasting}} in 1930, when it bought WIS in Columbia—the start of {{what would become the}} Broadcasting Company of the South, renamed Cosmos Broadcasting in 1965. Under Francis Hipp, who succeeded his father in 1943, Liberty reorganized as a holding company, The Liberty Corporation, in 1967.|$|R
6000|$|They circled. Pete <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> foot gently. Morton sprang in, bawling furiously, [...] "None o' them rough-and-tumble tricks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All these things"--Coote <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{lips and}} nodded rapidly {{to show he}} understood--"Trust me for that," [...] he said, [...] "trust me." ...|$|E
60|$|Little Wisk <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{head from}} {{underneath}} the seat and found Santa Claus gone and no one to direct the flight of the reindeer.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A white bonnet and a silver-{{coloured}} gownd. It whewed and whistled so loud when it rubbed {{against the}} pews that the lady coloured {{up more than}} ever for very shame at the noise, and pulled it in {{to keep it from}} touching; but when she pushed into her seat, it whewed more than ever. Mr. Lodge, he seemed pleased, and <b>his</b> waistcoat <b>stuck</b> <b>out,</b> and <b>his</b> great golden seals hung like a lord's; but she seemed to wish her noisy gownd anywhere but on her.' ...|$|R
60|$|By and by {{he thought}} he would speak to the purser, whom he knew, and went down the {{alleyway}} that led to his office. The door was hooked back, but the passage was narrow and a fat Spanish lady blocked the entrance. She was talking to the purser and Dick saw that he must wait until she had finished. A man stood a few yards behind her, unscrewing a flute, and as a folded paper that looked like music <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> pocket he appeared to belong to the band.|$|R
60|$|When Nod {{opened his}} eyes beneath the vast blue arch of the cavern, {{not a sign of}} the Men of the Mountains was to be seen. He sat for awhile {{watching}} his brothers humped up in sleep on the floor, and wondering rather dismally when they should have done with their troubles and come to the palace of their Uncle Assasimmon. He was blained and footsore; <b>his</b> small bones <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> beneath <b>his</b> furry skin, his hands were cracked and scorched. And the keen high air of Arakkaboa made him gasp at every breath.|$|R
6000|$|Again Rod <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> jaws sidewise, {{and went}} on slowly, {{as though he were}} {{slugging}} on a plain bit {{at the end of a}} thirty-mile drive: ...|$|E
60|$|The two men dashed up {{onto the}} veranda of the ranchhouse and pounded at the door until a Chinaman opened it and <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> head, inquiringly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure pop! nary one! The {{postmaster}} <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand to grab it, but I {{just let}} on that I didn't see him, and shoved it in myself." ...|$|E
50|$|Originally, Bungle's face <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> more, and <b>his</b> belly was white. He {{also looked}} more like a bear, but from the second season onwards the crew made him look more cartoon-like because some of the younger viewers were frightened by his {{realistic}} appearance. They made his fur more of an orange-brown colour, and his head was enlarged with his face squashed in.|$|R
60|$|The Bat's hut {{was larger}} than the rest and a rude veranda {{occupied}} the front. There was no furniture except some mats and stools, and a badly-cleaned paraffin lamp gave a dim light. The Bat sat on a carved stool and wore a striped tennis jacket over his dirty white clothes. His legs and feet were bare; <b>his</b> lips <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> and <b>his</b> nostrils were wide, and Marston felt that to fear and shrink from him was ridiculous. Yet he did shrink. Then he noted with some surprise that Father Sebastian occupied a mat in the corner. Next moment the Bat looked up with a mocking grin.|$|R
60|$|But let any {{delicate}} mind in Baker Street fancy my horror when, {{on looking}} {{up out of}} this reverie, I saw a great brown wretch extended before me, only half dressed, standing on pattens, and exaggerated by them and the steam until he looked like an ogre, grinning in the most horrible way, and waving his arm, on which was a horsehair glove. He spoke, in his unknown nasal jargon, words which echoed through the arched room; his eyes seemed astonishingly large and bright, <b>his</b> ears <b>stuck</b> <b>out,</b> and <b>his</b> head was all shaved, except a bristling top-knot, which gave it a demoniac fierceness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. It would." [...] Sterne <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> chin cheerily {{and blinked}} at close {{quarters}} with that unconscious impudence {{which had the}} power to enrage Massy beyond anything.|$|E
60|$|He tucked up {{his front}} legs; he hopped on his hind legs; he <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> tail for a balance-weight behind him; and he hopped through the Darling Downs.|$|E
6000|$|... "They say Jem Blythe <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> tongue at {{her once}} {{and she would}} never have his father again, even when her husband was dying," [...] said Jerry. [...] "I wonder what the Blythe gang will be like." ...|$|E
60|$|The poachers {{arranged}} a raid upon the Selby woods, in which Joe Todd, Dan Hewlett, and Billy Barton all took part. The {{first of these}} was too sharp to be caught by the keepers. He had all the litheness and cunning of his gipsy blood, and was actually safe in {{the branches of a}} tree overhead, while Dan, having put his foot into a rabbit-hole, was seized by one keeper, with his gun and a bag of spoil, and Billy Barton, in his bewilderment, ran straight into the arms of another, with a pheasant's tail poking up his short smock-frock as it <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> pocket.|$|R
60|$|Two {{men were}} sitting in a cabaret near the Halles. One was dressed in the uniform of a {{sergeant}} of the National Guard. He was a powerfully-built man, with a black beard and a mustache, and a rough crop of hair that <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> aggressively beneath <b>his</b> kepi. The other was some fifteen years younger; beyond the cap he wore no military uniform. He had a mustache only, and was a good-looking young fellow of the Ouvrier class.|$|R
5000|$|In 1969 {{perhaps the}} most iconic piece of Angela Park was introduced, Porky The Paper Eater. Designed as a high tech trash receptacle, Porky's [...] "head" [...] <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> from <b>his</b> [...] "house". His mouth was an opening that {{vacuumed}} in paper and other small trash items into a large garbage container within the house. A taped voice message had Porky encouraging kids to not litter. The novel idea worked better than anticipated with youngsters so mesmerized by the talking Porky they often collected stray trash from the ground so they could feed it to Porky. Later a second version of Porky was introduced, Leo The Paper Eating Lion however it never came close to the popularity of Porky.|$|R
60|$|The tough {{grabbed at}} Bill's shirt-collar across the mattress. Bill ducked, <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> arm wildly, and struck Pete, half by accident. Roaring, Pete bunted him, {{and he went}} down, with Pete {{kneeling}} on his stomach and pounding him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Porter, I don't {{want any}} such talk from you!" [...] and now Ward Porton doubled up his fists and <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> chin. [...] "I've stood all I {{am going to}} stand from you. I want you to leave me alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, thunder!" [...] muttered Tom. And having {{split the}} detested gloves in {{dragging}} them on, he nerved {{himself for the}} effort, walked up to Polly, made a stiff bow, <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> elbow, and said, solemnly, [...] "May I have the pleasure, Miss Milton?" ...|$|E
60|$|Upon this, I {{stared at}} him till I thought his eyes were really of an {{uncommon}} size, and <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> from <b>his</b> head {{like those of a}} lobster. I am sure my own eyes must have magnified as I stared. When church was out, I wanted my aunt to take me along and follow the traveler home. But she said the constables would take us up, if we did; and so I never saw this wonderful Arabian traveler again. But he long haunted me; and several times I dreamt of him, and thought his great eyes were grown still larger and rounder; and once I had a vision of the date tree.|$|R
60|$|Uncle Jim was {{certainly}} not a handsome person. He was short, shorter than Mr. Polly, with long arms and lean big hands, a thin and wiry neck <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> grey flannel shirt and supported a big head that had something of the snake in the convergent lines of its broad knotty brow, meanly proportioned face and pointed chin. His almost toothless mouth seemed a cavern in the twilight. Some accident had left him with one small and active and one large and expressionless reddish eye, and wisps of straight hair strayed from under the blue cricket cap he wore pulled down obliquely over the latter. He spat between his teeth and wiped his mouth untidily with the soft side of his fist.|$|R
60|$|There was, I seem to remember, {{a secular}} {{intensification}} of his features; his nose developed character, became aggressive, <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> {{at the world}} more and more; the obliquity of his mouth, I think, increased. From the face that returns to my memory projects a long cigar that is sometimes cocked jauntily up from the higher corner, that sometimes droops from the lower;--it was as eloquent as a dog's tail, and he removed it only for the more emphatic modes of speech. He assumed a broad black ribbon for his glasses, and wore them more and more askew as time went on. His hair seemed to stiffen with success, but towards the climax it thinned greatly over the crown, and he brushed it hard back over his ears where, however, it <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> fiercely. It always <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> fiercely over <b>his</b> forehead, up and forward.|$|R
