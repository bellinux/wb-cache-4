25|$|Flight {{feathers}} are stiffened {{so as to}} {{work against}} {{the air in the}} downstroke but yield in other directions. It has been observed that the orientation pattern of β-keratin fibers in the feathers of flying birds differs from that in flightless birds: the fibers are better aligned along the <b>shaft</b> <b>axis</b> direction towards the tip, and the lateral walls of rachis region show structure of crossed fibers.|$|E
25|$|Derived ichthyosaurs in {{the narrow}} sense, as defined by Motani in 1999, differ from their closest basal ichthypterygian {{relatives}} in certain traits. Motani listed a number of these. The external nostril {{is located on the}} side of the skull, and is hardly visible from above. The upper rim of the eye socket consists of a bone bar formed by the prefrontal and the postfrontal bones. The postorbital in side view is excluded from the supratemporal fenestra. The opening for the parietal eye is located on the border of the parietal and the frontal bone. The lateral wing of the pterygoid is incompletely and variably ossified. The ulna lacks the part behind the original <b>shaft</b> <b>axis.</b> The rear dorsal vertebrae are disc-shaped.|$|E
25|$|Multi-cylinder {{hydraulic}} {{cone crusher}} is mainly composed of main frame, eccentric shaft, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, dust ring, transmission device, bowl-shaped bearing, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, etc. The electric motor of the cone crusher drives the eccentric shaft to make periodic swing movement under the <b>shaft</b> <b>axis,</b> and consequently surface of mantle approaches {{and leaves the}} surface of bowl liner now and then, so that the material is crushed due to squeezing and grinding inside the crushing chamber. The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|E
50|$|A Cobra probe is {{a device}} to measure the {{pressure}} and velocity components of a moving fluid. It is a multi-holed pressure probe with rotational axis of the probe shaft coplanar with the measurement plane of the instrument. Because of this geometry, when the instrument is rotated around the <b>shaft's</b> <b>axis,</b> the measurement elements of the probe remain in the same location. The name cobra probe comes from {{the shape of the}} probe head which gives it this property.|$|R
30|$|During laparoscopic surgery, {{instrument}} triangulation allows proper tissue retraction {{which is}} essential for proper dissection along anatomical tissue planes and helps to avoid crossing between the instruments and the camera. The use {{of at least one}} flexible or curved instrument moves the <b>shaft’s</b> <b>axis</b> out of the center sufficiently, thus allowing the surgeon to operate with some degree of triangulation. The use of curved instruments (single or double curve) consents the mobilization and traction of the organs using rotating, forward, and backward movements.|$|R
50|$|The Hewland AE75 {{was never}} fitted to any {{aircraft}} {{apart from the}} ARV Super2, and when ARV production ceased, Hewland stopped AE75 production also. The rights to the AE75 were bought by MidWest, who were developing their AE100 twin-rotor Wankel aero-engine. MidWest had intended to restart production of the AE75 near Stroud, Gloucestershire, but this never materialised. MidWest based the AE100’s gearbox on the AE75’s PSRU, amending {{it so that the}} propeller axis was above the eccentric <b>shaft's</b> <b>axis.</b> This increased propeller clearance, but also raised the ARV's thrust line.|$|R

50|$|In {{rotation}} an unbalance {{when the}} mass/inertia axis does not intersect with <b>shaft</b> <b>axis</b> {{then it is}} called dynamic unbalance. Combination of static and couple unbalance is dynamic unbalance. It occurs virtually in all rotors.|$|E
40|$|Very {{often the}} track pins of {{heavy-loaded}} track-type machines have insufficient fatigue safety margin, which causes their frequent breakage. One {{of the most}} rational solutions {{of the problem is}} the use of the high-temperature thermomechanical treatment of hot-rolled tubular billets for track pins. The analysis of the investigation results and engineering developments shows the possibility of improving the performance characteristic of hollow items (<b>shafts,</b> <b>axis</b> pins, track pins for a caterpillar mover, torsion suspensions of an undercarriage, etc.) by combining the thermomechanical treatment strengthening, various methods for improving the quality of the surface of tubular billets and the application of developed technological schemes in the factories producing tubular billets and items with diameter of Ø 10 ÷ 60 mm and the parameters of safety margin, precision and roughness required for the durability of the items...|$|R
40|$|The {{blade root}} flow control is of {{particular}} importance to the aerodynamic characteristic of large wind turbines. The paper studies the feasibility of improving blade pneumatic power by applying vortex generators (VGs) to large variable propeller <b>shaft</b> horizontal <b>axis</b> wind turbines, with 2 [*]MW variable propeller <b>shaft</b> horizontal <b>axis</b> wind turbine blades as research object. In the paper, three cases of VGs installation are designed; they are scattered in different chordwise position at the blade root, and then they are calculated, respectively, with CFD method. The results show that VGs installed in the separation line upstream, with the separation line of the blade root as a benchmark, show a better effect. Pneumatic power of blades increases by 0. 6 % by installing VGs. Although the effect on large wind turbines is not obvious, there is a space for optimization...|$|R
30|$|Apple and pear (Malus domestica and Pyrus communis) are anatomically hard to distinguish, {{therefore}} they are discussed together. The wood {{of those two}} species is still appreciated for furniture making and veneer production. Nevertheless, the wood could be challenged much more. In former times apple and pear were often utilized because of their combination of high resistance against abrasion, hardness, strength and comparable low sliding friction (Fig.  5). It was used for planes, spindles, cogwheels, <b>shafts,</b> <b>axis</b> and rolls. There are also other parameters like lubricity, {{which is one of}} the properties difficult to measure. They can be evaluated by analyzing historical objects representing the result of a long-term empirical process. Pear and apple were conspicuously often used for friction bearing where the named property is of great importance. Folkloristic literature mentions rolls for prayers beads [19], pounders [20], plows [21], oil presses [22] and windmills [21].|$|R
50|$|In {{relation}} to the piston, the trajectory of the power <b>shaft</b> <b>axis</b> has corner points, which correspond to extreme positions of the piston as related to the working chamber. Those corners, which represent singular points of the power shaft's trajectory, cannot be avoided or rounded {{to provide for the}} kinematically closed functioning of the gear.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of hypoid gear {{is that the}} ring gear of the differential and the input pinion gear are both hypoid. In most passenger cars this allows the pinion to be offset {{to the bottom of}} the crown wheel. This provides for longer tooth contact and allows the shaft that drives the pinion to be lowered, reducing the [...] "hump" [...] intrusion in the passenger compartment floor. However, the greater the displacement of the input <b>shaft</b> <b>axis</b> from the crown wheel axis, the lower the mechanical efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The axial design uses {{axial forces}} {{to achieve the}} {{movement}} of the air or gas, spinning a central hub with blades extending radially from its outer diameter. The fluid is moved parallel to the fan wheel's <b>shaft,</b> or <b>axis</b> of rotation. The axial fan wheel is often contained within a short section of cylindrical ductwork, to which inlet and outlet ducting can be connected.|$|R
40|$|Hole {{machining}} {{is quite}} common in engineering technology.

This paper illustrates methodology and experiments for determination of optimal cutting conditions and appropriate cutting tools based on an example of drilling. The choice of drilling technology is based on the design requirements for the shape and dimensions, namely the nature of semi-finished product, with regards to the requirements of quality, reliability and economic efficiency...|$|R

50|$|Unlike the Volkswagen {{alloy case}} used by Hewland, the Traction Avant case {{could not be}} used up side down, as the input shaft height was much higher in {{relation}} to the output <b>shaft</b> <b>axis</b> so that the oil level needed to lubricate the gears would exceed the then-unreliable input shaft oil seal height if used upside down. So the engine needed to sit high above the ground with the oil sump space below, which was not needed by dry-sump racing engines. But the French transaxle was used by several racing car constructors in the late 1950s to 60s with various levels of success.|$|E

Whether the sharp difference between taxa is due to evolution or sexual dimorphism in poorly sampled populations of both species, has not been determined (the latter seems unlikely). A proximal caudal has a very tall neural spine (about twice the height of its centrum, judging by the figure).
