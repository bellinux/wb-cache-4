5|$|At {{the age of}} 83 Nagle {{was still}} {{pursuing}} gender equality, accusing the Kennel Club of <b>sexual</b> <b>discrimination</b> in their insistence on male-only membership and taking them to court over the matter. After the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was enacted, Nagle was proposed {{as a member of}} the Kennel Club at the end of September 1977; the nomination was refused in January 1978 because the Kennel Club's constitution restricted membership to men only. Nagle referred the matter to an Industrial Tribunal five months later. She was Chairwoman of the Ladies Joint Committee, a group set up in 1975 as a part of the Kennel Club hierarchy, but the committee was not allowed any input into general club decisions. Her actions against the club were fully supported by the other members of the Ladies Committee. Legal technicalities caused the tribunal to reject the case, but it recommended that the Equal Opportunities Commission should be approached as discrimination was clearly demonstrated. Nagle was determined and stated her intention to appeal the decision. Leonard Pagliero was Chairman of the Kennel Club at the time, and before Nagle was able to complete the appeal he contacted the canine press, Dog World and Our Dogs, on 8 September 1978 announcing that the Club's General Committee was recommending that the club's constitution be changed to allow women members. The proposal was carried unanimously at a meeting held on 23 November 1978. The result was that Nagle and many other ladies were accepted as members of the Kennel Club at a formal meeting held on 10 April 1979. The total number of women approved for membership at the landmark meeting was 80; the costs of the campaign were funded by Nagle.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between sex <b>discrimination</b> and <b>sexual</b> orientation <b>discrimination</b> {{has always been}} somewhat of a contested issue.

UCLA responded by shifting to a holistic admissions process starting Fall 2007. The holistic admissions process evaluates applicants based on their opportunities in high school, their personal hardships and unusual circumstances at home.|$|E

40|$|Title VII {{does not}} {{explicitly}} protect homosexual employees from <b>sexual</b> orientation <b>discrimination</b> {{and the courts}} have generally refused to bootstrap <b>sexual</b> orientation <b>discrimination</b> into Title VII {{as a form of}} gender discrimination. Therefore, homosexual employees have had to depend on their constitutional rights to protect them from their public employers’ <b>sexual</b> orientation <b>discrimination.</b> Traditionally, the courts have allowed public employers to discriminate against homosexual employees so long as the employers’ reasons were rationally related to legitimate business purposes. I argue that the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Lawrence v. Texas forces future courts to question the reasonableness of employers’ rational bases. Moreover, the Court’s reasoning opens the door for a future Court to declare homosexuals to be a suspect class and private, homosexual conduct to be a fundamental right. The courts would then apply strict scrutiny rather than a rational basis test to homosexual employees’ First Amendment, Equal Protection, and Substantive Due Process claims. Finally, I argue that the Court’s reasoning supports the enactment of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act...|$|R

As a result of personnel shortages in the late 1980s the restriction against women in combat-related positions was dropped in 1990, and women were for the first time allowed to serve in warships, RAAF combat squadrons and many positions in the Army. Women were banned from positions involving physical combat, however, and were unable to serve in infantry, armoured, artillery and engineering units in the Army and clearance diving and ground defence positions in the RAN and RAAF respectively.|$|E
25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century women became {{involved}} in organizations dedicated to social reform. In 1903 The National Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) is established to advocate for improved wages and working conditions for women.

It is an organization established {{by a group of}} Wall Street women. The goal was: to advance professionalism in finance and in the financial services industry with special emphasis on the role and development of women, to attain greater recognition for women’s achievements in business, and to encourage women to seek career opportunities in finance and business. In 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded by a group of feminists including Betty Friedan. The largest women's rights group in the U.S., NOW seeks to end <b>sexual</b> <b>discrimination,</b> especially in the workplace, by means of legislative lobbying, litigation, and public demonstrations. NOW has 500,000 contributing members and 550 chapters in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Founded in 1972, the National Association of Female Executives (NAFE) provides education, networking and public advocacy to empower its members to achieve career success and financial security. Members are women executives, business owners, entrepreneurs and others who are committed to NAFE’s mission: the advancement of women in the workplace. Many of these organizations led to legal action and protecting women's rights as workers and empowered women in the workplace.|$|E
