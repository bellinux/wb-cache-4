5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> {{the easy way out}} and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E
500|$|Other {{accomplished}} {{early works}} include the two string quartets, composed between 1928 and 1930, in which Tippett sought {{to combine the}} styles of Beethoven and Haydn respectively with folk-song, as Beethoven had in his Rasumovsky quartets of 1806. Tippett explains the withdrawal of these and the other early works: [...] "I realised very clearly {{that they were not}} totally consonant with myself. I didn't think they had the stamp of artistic durability. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the whole lot along to R.O. Morris who agreed that they didn't show enough technical mastery." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The song is sort {{of about}} transformation, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> that in a nature kind of way, the way nature deals with transformation. It's {{basically}} about coming from a very poisoned place to an empowerment, a place of strength. I've always had this fear of moths, and I subconsciously wrote this thing with these moths in it, so I guess I {{have to deal with}} it. They're furry and they carry dust. I found out in old mythology they are supposed to represent the soul. I think that's very appropriate".|$|E

500|$|In the {{documentary}} film Not Bad for a Girl, Love, {{who had been}} in the erotic dancing industry for years prior, said that she worked as a stripper to help support the band in its early incarnation. She also cited her work as a dancer as being one of many inspirations for the songs on Pretty on the Inside: [...] "I was blonde, wore makeup, had to support my band by dancing, and had to play this ridiculous archetype at work... <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took,</b> you know, high heels and white pumps, and I had a wiglet—I just took that and messed with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Vargas Llosa {{also built}} {{an image of}} the regime with the troubled {{historical}} events. With regard to the historical accuracy of the book, Vargas Llosa has said [...] "It's a novel, not a history book, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> many, many liberties. The only limitation I imposed on myself was that I was not going to invent anything that couldn't have happened within the framework of life in the Dominican Republic. I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things {{in order to make the}} story more persuasiveand I have not exaggerated." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] "symbol of courage, strength, and wisdom", Link was {{designed}} by Miyamoto as a coming of age motif for players to identify with: he begins the game an ordinary boy but strengthens to triumph over the ultimate evil. The name of the princess was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald: [...] "Zelda {{was the name of}} the wife of the famous novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. She was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts, and I liked the sound of her name. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the liberty of using her name for the very first Zelda title," [...] Miyamoto explained.|$|E

500|$|Buddha was {{financed by}} Pat Secor, Hoppus' boss at Wherehouse Music in San Diego. Secor {{wanted to start}} his own record label and offered to help pay for costs. [...] "He was like, hey, I'll front you the money, and we'll split the profits until you pay me back," [...] {{recalled}} Hoppus in 2001. The two had met when Secor transferred from a north San Diego location. The two became friends quickly, despite Secor's seniority of post. [...] "At that point they'd played around enough to get their chops up <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> all the money I had in savings and we went into the studio for two days," [...] said Secor.|$|E
500|$|Vargas Llosa interlaces fictional {{elements}} and historical events: {{the book is}} not a documentary and the Cabral family, for instance, is completely fictional. [...] On the other han, the characters of Trujillo and Trujillo's assassins are drawn from the historical record; Vargas Llosa weaves real historical incidents of brutality and oppression into these people's stories, to further illuminate {{the nature of the}} regime and the responses it provoked. [...] In Vargas Llosa's words, [...] "It's a novel, not a history book, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> many, many liberties. [...] I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things {{in order to make the}} story more persuasiveand I have not exaggerated." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing the {{selection}} process, early contributor Chris Vrenna told Gannett News [...] "coming {{from the same}} emotional background, I feel, {{is more important than}} how well you can play your instrument. That's one reason that makes our shows more intense when we're up there ... We found people that understood that. It makes us stronger". [...] Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying [...] "I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> some young guys who were malleable, who would basically do what I want them to do but expand on it. [...] The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' [...] " ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Zito {{struggled}} {{and posted}} the worst numbers {{of his career}} at the time. Zito went 2–3 with a 6.83 ERA {{in the month of}} April. On May 28, facing Cliff Lee, he threw eight shutout innings but received a no-decision in a 1–0 loss to the Cleveland Indians. He threw eight shutout innings of four-hit ball in a 5–0 victory over the Devil Rays on August 21. Oakland manager Ken Macha would have let him throw a complete game, but Zito said, [...] "I was worrying about being fresh for the next game. I didn't want to end up [...] 115–120 , <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> advantage of the situation and shut it down." [...] On September 12, he threw seven shutout innings and had 10 strikeouts, earning the win in a 1–0 victory over the Indians. For the season, he went 11–11 with a 4.48 ERA. That was his only year with the Athletics that his ERA was more than 4.00. He still finished 10th in the league in strikeouts with 163.|$|E
500|$|In {{designing}} the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer Daniel Kleinman {{was inspired by}} the cover of the 1953 British first edition of Casino Royale, which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood. Kleinman said, [...] "The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles," [...] like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts. In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitised the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at Framestore CFC in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns. Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film's spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1992, MC Serch, whose group 3rd Bass had dissolved, {{began working}} on a solo project and {{approached}} Nas. At the suggestion of producer T-Ray, Serch collaborated with Nas for [...] "Back to the Grill", the lead single for Serch's 1992 solo debut album Return of the Product. At the recording session for the song, Serch discovered that Nas {{did not have a}} recording contract and subsequently contacted Faith Newman, an A executive at Sony Music Entertainment. As Serch recounted, [...] "Nas was in a position where his demo had been sittin' around, 'Live at the Barbeque' was already a classic, and he was just tryin' to find a decent deal ... So when he gave me his demo, I shopped it around. I took it to Russell first, Russell said it sounded like G Rap, he wasn't wit' it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> it to Faith.

500|$|Vegetarian meals were {{eaten in}} a [...] "communal" [...] dining area, where food was {{vulnerable}} to aggressive monkeys and crows. Accounts {{of the food}} vary, some calling it spicy while others said it was bland. Lennon described the food as [...] "lousy", while Pattie Boyd says it was delicious. Menu items included chickpeas mixed with cumin seeds, whole wheat dough baked over a fire, spiced eggplant, potatoes that had been picked locally, and, for breakfast, cornflakes, toast and coffee. [...] Starr had problems with the diet because of his past illnesses: [...] "The food was impossible for me, because I'm allergic to so many different things, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> two suitcases with me: one of clothes and one of Heinz beans" [...] and eggs. After dinner, the musicians gathered {{on the roof of}} Harrison's bungalow to talk and listen to the Ganges river. [...] Sometimes they listened to records and played guitar or sitar [...] while their wives gathered in one of their rooms and discussed life as the partner of a Beatle.|$|E
500|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's earlier novels {{were set}} in Peru, while in more recent work he has {{expanded}} to other regions of Latin America, such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic. His responsibilities {{as a writer and}} lecturer have allowed him to travel frequently and led to settings for his novels in regions outside of Peru. The War of the End of the World was his first major work set outside Peru. Though the plot deals with historical events of the Canudos revolt against the Brazilian government, the novel is not based directly on historical fact; rather, its main inspiration is the non-fiction account of those events published by Brazilian writer Euclides da Cunha in 1902. The Feast of the Goat, based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, takes place in the Dominican Republic; in preparation for this novel, Vargas Llosa undertook a comprehensive study of Dominican history. The novel was characteristically realist, and Vargas Llosa underscores that he [...] "respected the basic facts,... I have not exaggerated", {{but at the same time}} he points out [...] "It's a novel, not a history book, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> many, many liberties." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Zombie's contribution, Werewolf Women of the SS, starred Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu; Udo Kier as Franz Hess, {{the commandant}} of Death Camp 13; Zombie's wife, Sheri; and Sybil Danning as SS officers/sisters Eva and Gretchen Krupp (The She-Devils of Belzac). Professional wrestlers Andrew [...] "Test" [...] Martin and Oleg [...] "Vladimir Kozlov" [...] Prudius also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, [...] "Basically, I had two ideas. It was {{either going to}} be a Nazi movie or a women-in-prison film, and I went with the Nazis. There're all those movies like Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS; Fräulein Devil; and Love Camp 7—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre." [...] Zombie is also quoted as saying [...] "I was getting very {{conceptual}} in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!' They start jamming things in there, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> that approach." ...|$|E

500|$|Zelda's name {{served as}} {{inspiration}} for Princess Zelda, the eponymous character of The Legend of Zelda series of video games. Series co-creator Shigeru Miyamoto explained, [...] " [...] {{was a famous}} and beautiful woman from all accounts, and I liked {{the sound of her}} name. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the liberty of using her name for the very first Zelda title." [...] New York City's borough of Manhattan's Battery Park's resident wild turkey Zelda (d. 2014) was also named after her, because according to legend during one of Fitzgerald's nervous breakdowns, she went missing and was found in Battery Park, apparently having walked several miles downtown. Of Zelda's legacy in popular culture, biographer Cline wrote, [...] "Recently myth has likened Zelda to those other twentieth-century icons, Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana. With each she shares a defiance of convention, intense vulnerability, doomed beauty, unceasing struggle for a serious identity, short tragic life and quite impossible nature." [...] In 1989, the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald museum opened in Montgomery, Alabama. The museum is in a house they briefly rented in 1931 and 1932. It {{is one of the few}} places where some of Zelda's paintings are kept on display.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it hits you feel no pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E
