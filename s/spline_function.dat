40|$|The paper aims to {{approach}} innovative financial instruments {{for the management}} of public resources. In the category of these innovative tools have been included polynomial <b>spline</b> <b>functions</b> used for budgetary sizing in the substantiating of fiscal and budgetary policies. In order to use polynomial <b>spline</b> <b>functions</b> there have been made a number of steps consisted in the establishment of nodes, the calculation of specific coefficients corresponding to the <b>spline</b> <b>functions,</b> development and determination of errors of approximation. Also in this paper was done extrapolation of series of property tax data using polynomial <b>spline</b> <b>functions</b> of order I. For spline impelementation were taken two series of data, one reffering to property tax as a resultative variable and the second one reffering to building tax, resulting a correlation indicator R= 0, 95. Moreover the calculation of <b>spline</b> <b>functions</b> are easy to solve and due to small errors of approximation have a great power of predictibility, much better than using ordinary least squares method. In order to realise the research there have been used as methods of research several steps, namely observation, series of data construction and processing the data with <b>spline</b> <b>functions.</b> The data construction is a daily series gathered from the budget account, reffering to building tax and property tax. The added value of this paper is given by the possibility of avoiding deficits by using <b>spline</b> <b>functions</b> as innovative instruments in the publlic finance, the original contribution is made by the average of splines resulted from the series of data. The research results lead to conclusion that the polynomial <b>spline</b> <b>functions</b> are recommended to form the elaboration of fiscal and budgetary policies, due to relatively small errors obtained in the extrapolation of economic processes and phenomena.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops and {{explores the}} methodology {{for the use}} of cubic <b>spline</b> <b>functions</b> in assessing time-by-covariate interactions in Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Cubic <b>spline</b> <b>functions</b> yield both a graphical method and a formal test for the proportional hazards assumption as well as a test of the nonlinearity of the time-by-covariate interaction. Five existing methods for assessing violations of the proportional hazards assumption are reviewed and applied along with cubic splines to three well known two-sample datasets. An additional dataset with three covariates is used to explore the use of cubic <b>spline</b> <b>functions</b> in a more general setting. ...|$|R
