40|$|This paper pursues {{the goal}} of further {{developing}} a testing procedure which precisely and reliably records the knowledge in the inductive conclusion allowing for a differentiated statement about the individual extent of knowledge {{as well as a}} prognosis about the future success of training. The START-W knowledge test is a component of the comprehensive <b>START</b> <b>battery</b> of tests which reproduces the individual basic competences at the commencement of work and is oriented on DIN Norm 33430. The importance of knowledge in the occupational context results from the key competence research and the insight that knowledge is seen as a basic prerequisite for the “conscious processing, conversion, assessment and linking of information to something new, to ideas, actions, to products and services” (Blümelhuber, 2005, pg. 145, Übers. durch den Autor). On the basis of the economic, technological and social changes the importance of development and diagnostic recording of key competences are emphasized by various national and international institutions. Here, intelligence and knowledge are considered to be relevant skills for handling the new type of (professional) problems, thinking in an interdisciplinary manner, acting in a targeted manner and determining connections (e. g. Schuler & Höft, 2006). A systematization of the connection between intelligence and knowledge or more fluid and crystallized intelligence is represented by the investment theory from Cattell (1971 a, 1987). The structural theory forms the basis for the following research approaches. The basis for the intended validation study is formed by a random sample of 753 volunteers in the age of 16 - 46 (average age 20. 74), who had a clear relationship to the target population for potential entry level employees. The items and scales are exploratory analyzed. This results in satisfactory values which correspond to the criteria of the test construction. Subsequent reliability estimates support the findings that the knowledge can be reliably measured. The examination of the convergent validity with the “Bochum Knowledge Test” (Hossiep & Schulte, 2008) shows that both procedures present convergent constructs and record the acquired knowledge or the crystallized intelligence. In the framework of the construct validity and on the basis of confirmatory factor analyses it was also possible to make a differentiated reproduction of the intended structure. The structure equation model clearly demonstrates that both the intended subject areas, the verbal, numerical and figural coded scales of content and the factor “crystallized intelligence” (gc) can be extracted. The concordance validity (school grades of the final report card) and the prognostic validity (average grade of the first –probationary- semester in schools for health professionals) as partial aspects of the criterion validity can be described as satisfactory. With regard to the practical applicability of the testing procedure, the prognostic validity is especially relevant, because the findings allow an inference to be made about the success of training at schools for health professionals. At a higher level the question about the interaction facets of fluid and crystallized intelligence is investigated. In general terms, the influence of the aptitude and the environment on the accumulation of knowledge is analyzed as in the investment theory (Cattell, 1971 a, 1987), possible explanatory methods discussed and therefore application-based, diagnostic implications proposed. In this context the differences in knowledge depending on age, native tongue, gender and the level of education are observed. With regard to the connection between fluid intelligence (gf) and crystallized intelligence (gc), {{it can be seen that}} gc` (nested factor) at a lower level of generality (the knowledge-topical variances are more relevant) correlates to a lesser extent with fluid intelligence (gf). By contrast the more readily generalized, content-related knowledge variances (gc) correlate to a greater extent with the fluid intelligence (gc). With regard to the practically oriented application, it can be seen that the simulated recording of fluid and crystallized intelligence plays an important role in occupational profiles which require a broad-based knowledge. By means of uni- and multivariate analytic methods it was also possible to investigate environmentally-related factors on the development of knowledge. It can be seen that, above all, the level of education represents an important determinant for the differences in knowledge. The START-W therefore represents an indicator for the general education and it offers a suitable differentiation for purposes of diagnostic decisions regarding aptitude. At the same time, an additional indicator of the validity of the testing procedure is provided. In view of the differences in knowledge determined between volunteers with German as their native language and volunteers whose native tongue was foreign, there are, above all, opportunities for application in the field of pedagogy. The separately determined findings that in both cases slight differences are shown in the fluid intelligence indicate that differential psychological aspects are very important in practice. This leads to the conclusion that the performance of entry-level employees is determined on the basis of a multitude of factors. Aptitude-diagnostic interpretations and decisions must therefore be made in the context of the varying influencing factors. The results allow for at least three fields of application for the START-W and the I-S-T 2000 R (Liepmann et al., 2007). These are the (a) business-psychological (e. g. vocational guidance, applicant selection), (b) pedagogical (e. g. test for school or university qualification, evaluation of teaching concepts, recording of sub-group specific differences in abilities, initiation of supporting development) and (c) clinical field. The findings underline the assumption that an integration of knowledge tests and intelligence structure tests represent a new insight for the determination of occupational competence. The sue of psychological testing procedures is relatively low for schools in the health industry, although a great need for qualified caregivers is to be expected in view of the demographic change. The START-W differentiates between various educational groups, allows an estimation of the future success of schooling or training and guarantees, in combination with the START test battery detailed statements about the profile. In the final analysis the focus is on the development of the capability profile, which records both the status as well as the potential knowledge of entry-level employees so as to bring the individual abilities into harmony with the educational and occupational requirements...|$|E

50|$|The {{first car}} {{to use an}} {{alternator}} was an unusual system fitted to early Model T Fords. This entirely AC system was first used solely to power the trembler coil ignition system when the engine was running. When <b>starting,</b> a <b>battery</b> was used instead - cranking the engine was entirely manual. This system was sometimes used to also provide electric lighting. Being an AC system, there was no battery in this circuit. The <b>starting</b> <b>battery</b> {{was removed from the}} car for charging, a rare event as it was only needed when starting. The generator was usually described as a magneto, although this was not an ignition magneto (even though it was used to power the ignition) as it did not provide sparks itself.|$|R
50|$|The {{starter motor}} is a series, compound, or {{permanent}} magnet type electric motor with a solenoid and solenoid operated switch mounted on it. When low-current {{power from the}} <b>starting</b> <b>battery</b> {{is applied to the}} starter solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch, the solenoid closes high-current contacts for the starter motor and it starts to run. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened and the solenoid opens the contacts to the starter motor.|$|R
5000|$|A deep-cycle {{battery is}} a {{lead-acid}} battery {{designed to be}} regularly deeply discharged using most of its capacity. In contrast, starter batteries (e.g. most automotive batteries) are designed to deliver short, high-current bursts for cranking the engine, thus frequently discharging {{only a small part}} of their capacity.

50|$|<b>Starting</b> <b>{{batteries}}</b> are lighter {{weight than}} deep cycle batteries {{of the same}} battery dimensions, because the cell plates do not extend {{all the way to}} the bottom of the battery case. This allows loose disintegrated lead to fall off the plates and collect under the cells, to prolong the service life of the battery. If this loose debris rises high enough it can touch the plates and lead to failure of a cell, resulting in loss of battery voltage and capacity.|$|R

50|$|A jump start, {{also called}} a boost, {{is a method}} of {{starting}} a vehicle with a discharged <b>starting</b> <b>battery.</b> A temporary connection is made to the battery of another vehicle, or to some other external power source. The external supply of electricity recharges the disabled vehicle's battery and {{provides some of the}} power needed to crank the engine. Once the vehicle has been started, its normal charging system will recharge, so the auxiliary source can be removed. If the vehicle charging system is functional, normal operation of the vehicle will restore the charge of the battery.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electric}} starter motor or cranking motor {{is the most}} common type used on gasoline engines and small diesel engines.

When DC power from the <b>starting</b> <b>battery</b> is applied to the solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch (the [...] "ignition switch"), the solenoid engages a lever that pushes out the drive pinion on the starter driveshaft and meshes the pinion with the starter ring gear on the flywheel of the engine.|$|R

In others European countries during WWI, plants were completely plundered, like in Belgium and in Luxembourg. These events will not hinder the company to have, between the two world wars nearly 25,000 employees at the Florival plant.

50|$|Battery {{isolators}} {{are commonly}} used on recreational vehicles, boats, utility vehicles, airplanes, and large trucks where one battery is dedicated to starting and running the engine and another battery or batteries run accessory loads (e.g., winches, radar, instruments, etc.). A battery isolator helps {{to ensure that the}} <b>starting</b> <b>battery</b> has sufficient power to start the engine and recharge the batteries if, for example, loads on the auxiliary battery (e.g., refrigerator or navigation lights) cause it to be drained, or if an auxiliary battery fails.

50|$|Marine alternators used in yachts {{are similar}} to {{automotive}} alternators, with appropriate adaptations to the salt-water environment.

On single alternator circuits, the power may be split between the engine <b>starting</b> <b>battery</b> and the domestic or house battery (or batteries) by use of a split-charge diode (battery isolator) or a voltage-sensitive relay.|$|R
50|$|The {{ignition}} system {{used in the}} Model T was an unusual trembler coil system to drive the spark plugs, as used for stationary gas engines, rather than the expensive magnetos that were used on other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The need for a <b>starting</b> <b>battery</b> and also Ford's use of an unusual AC alternator located inside the flywheel housing encouraged the adoption of electric lighting (standard fitment as of 1915), rather than oil or acetylene lamps, but it also delayed the adoption of electric starting, which was not offered until 1919.|$|R
