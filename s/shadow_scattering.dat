40|$|A general {{method to}} study {{classical}} scattering in n-dimension is developed. Through classical trajectory calculations, the three-body recombination is computed {{as a function}} of the collision energy for helium atoms, as an example. Quantum calculations are also performed for the J^Π = 0 ^+ symmetry of the three-body recombination rate in order to compare with the classical results, yielding good agreement for E≳ 1 K. The classical threshold law is derived and numerically confirmed for the Newtonian three-body recombination rate. Finally, a relationship is found between the quantum and classical three-body hard hypersphere elastic cross sections which is analogous to the well-known <b>shadow</b> <b>scattering</b> in two-body collisions.

40|$|We {{present a}} new rough-surface thermophysical model (Advanced Thermophysical Model or ATPM) that {{describes}} the observed directional thermal emission from any atmosphereless planetary surface. It explicitly incorporates partial <b>shadowing,</b> <b>scattering</b> of sunlight, selfheating and thermal-infrared beaming (re-radiation of absorbed sunlight back towards the Sun {{as a result of}} surface roughness). The model is verified by accurately reproducing ground-based directional thermal emission measurements of the lunar surface using surface properties that are consistent with the findings of the Apollo missions and roughness characterised by an RMS slope of ~ 32 degrees. By considering the wide range of potential asteroid surface properties, the model implies a beaming effect that cannot be described by a simple parameter or function. It is highly dependent on the illumination and viewing angles as well as surface thermal properties and is predominantly caused by macroscopic rather than microscopic roughness. Roughness alters the effective Bond albedo and thermal inertia of the surface as well as moving the mean emission away from the surface normal. For accurate determination of surface properties from thermal-infrared observations of unresolved bodies or resolved surface elements, roughness must be explicitly modelled, preferably aided with thermal measurements at different emission angles and wavelengths.

With a short link hop, the path loss is greatly reduced, and obstacles can be avoided so that the SINR is increased and random signal fluctuations due to both <b>shadowing</b> and <b>scattering</b> are reduced.

40|$|We {{compress}} {{storage and}} accelerate performance of precomputed radiance transfer (PRT), which captures {{the way an}} object <b>shadows,</b> <b>scatters,</b> and reflects light. PRT records over many surface points a transfer matrix. At run-time, this matrix transforms a vector of spherical harmonic coefficients representing distant, low-frequency source lighting into exiting radiance. Per-point transfer matrices form a high-dimensional surface signal that we compress using clustered principal component analysis (CPCA), which partitions many samples into fewer clusters each approximating the signal as an affine subspace. CPCA thus reduces the high-dimensional transfer signal to a low-dimensional set of perpoint weights on a per-cluster set of representative matrices. Rather than computing a weighted sum of representatives and applying this result to the lighting, we apply the representatives to the lighting per-cluster (on the CPU) and weight these results perpoint (on the GPU). Since {{the output of the}} matrix is lowerdimensional than the matrix itself, this reduces computation. We also increase the accuracy of encoded radiance functions with a new least-squares optimal projection of spherical harmonics onto the hemisphere. We describe an implementation on graphics hardware that performs real-time rendering of glossy objects with dynamic self-shadowing and interreflection without fixing the view or light as in previous work. Our approach also allows significantly increased lighting frequency when rendering diffuse objects and includes subsurface scattering...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A photo-realistic {{representation}} of material ap-pearance {{can be achieved}} by means of bidirectional texture function (BTF) capturing a material’s appearance for varying illumination, viewing directions, and spatial pixel coordinates. BTF captures many non-local effects in material structure such as inter-reflections, occlusions, <b>shadowing,</b> or <b>scattering.</b> The acquisition of BTF data is usually time and resource-intensive due to the high dimensionality of BTF data. This results in expensive, complex measurement setups and/or excessively long measurement times. We propose an approximate BTF acquisition setup based on a simple, affordable mechanical gantry containing a consumer camera and two LED lights. It captures a very limited subset of material surface images by shooting several video sequences. A psychophysical study comparing captured and reconstructed data with the reference BTFs of seven tested materials revealed that results of our method show a promising visual quality. As it allows for fast, inexpensive, acquisition of approximate BTFs, this method can be beneficial to visualization applications demanding less accuracy, where BTF utilization has previously been limited.
