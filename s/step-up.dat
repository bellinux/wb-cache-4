40|$|Background: A {{possible}} familial {{component to}} fracture risk may be mediated through a genetic liability to fall recurrently. Methods: Our analysis sample included 186 female sibling-ships (n = 401) of mean age 71. 9 yr (SD = 5. 0). Using variance component models, we estimated residual upper-limit heritabilities in fall-risk mobility phenotypes (e. g., chair-stand time, rapid <b>step-ups,</b> and usual-paced walking speed) and in recurrent falls. We also estimated familial and environmental (unmeasured) correlations between pairs of fall-risk mobility phenotypes. All models were adjusted for age, height, body mass index, and medical and environmental factors. Results: Residual upper-limit heritabilities were all moderate (P 0. 05). Environmental correlations ranged from 0. 35 to 0. 58 (absolute values), P < 0. 05 for all. Conclusions: There exists moderate familial resemblance in fall-risk mobility phenotypes and recurrent falls among older female siblings, which we expect is primarily genetic given that adult siblings live separate lives. All fall-risk mobility phenotypes may be coinfluenced {{at least to}} a small degree by shared latent familial or environmental factors; however, up to approximately one-half of the covariation between usual-paced walking speed and rapid <b>step-ups</b> {{may be due to}} a common set of genes...|$|R

The clinical diagnosis of intermittent claudication and localisation of the atherosclerotic occlusions were confirmed {{in all but}} one case by pulse volume recordings and segmental Doppler systolic pressure measurements. Two patients whose symptoms worsened underwent arterial reconstruction. Post-training assessment at six months showed that the remaining 18 patients walked 80 % further and performed 75 % more <b>step-ups.</b> They also felt much healthier, having unduly restricted their activities before because they had feared the onset of ischaemic leg pain.

However, the CSI has the problem that during an AC grid fault, it cannot operate properly. In this paper, a single-stage power conversion approach based on a CSI inverter with series capacitors is proposed, proven to provide improved efficiency and smaller DC inductor size and the capability to ride through AC grid faults with full reactive power injection support when compared to a standard CSI...|$|R
25|$|The {{ignition}} coil {{consists of two}} transformer windings — the primary and secondary. These windings share a common magnetic core. An alternating current in the primary induces an alternating magnetic field in the core and hence an alternating current in the secondary.

Twenty female track and field athletes performed single-leg squats and <b>step-ups,</b> and the quadratus lumborum, gluteus medius and maximus muscles activations were measured with surface electromyography. This study tested the hypothesis that mechanically restricted exercises would decrease quadratus lumborum and increase gluteal muscle activation. Mechanically restricted single-leg squats performed on the left side significantly decreased ipsilateral quadratus lumborum muscle activation. Athletes should focus on maintaining lower extremity alignment in the frontal plane to decrease quadratus lumborum activation. There was some evidence that these athletes have asymmetrical muscle activation patterns...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Detrimental {{impacts of}} estate taxes on {{management}} of private nonindustrial forests can be mitigated by estate planning which considers organizational forms of forest businesses and methods for funding estate settlement costs. This study's {{objective was to}} determine effects of business form and estate funding method on income and estate tax liabilities of nonindustrial owners. A deterministic, legal-economic forest estate management model was used to simulate estate and income tax consequences of alternative business form and funding method combinations for typical Oregon nonindustrial forest owners. Business forms analyzed were sole proprietorships, partnerships, close corporations, Subchapter S corporations and testamentary trusts. The three estate funding techniques were immediate timber capital liquidation, deferrals through Internal Revenue Code section 6166 and loans, and life insurance. Subchapter S corporations and partnerships, coupled with deferrals, were expected to have the least income and estate tax-induced reductions in present value of gross cash value. Sensitivity of results was tested by changing seven parameters: alternate rate of return, life expectancies, real land and timber price trends, total forest acreage, initial forest age class distribution, management regime, and rotation age. Simulation results were consistent across base and sensitivity runs. Testamentary trusts were least costly due to estate tax savings obtained by excluding {{part of the business}} from the widow's estate and income tax savings caused by post-mortem <b>step-ups</b> in timber cost basis. Partnerships and Subchapter S corporations were almost as cost effective because spreading business interests among family members reduced effective estate and income tax rates. Because its costs are postponed farthest, immediate liquidation was the preferred funding option. Deferrals frequently created negative after-tax cash flows during loan repayment periods. Forest owners should select business forms which allow reductions in the business interest includable in the widow's estate, preserve timber income's treatment as long-term capital gains, and provide income tax savings by spreading income among family members and utilizing post-mortem <b>step-ups</b> in cost basis. Trusts, partnerships, and Subchapter S corporations have these attributes. Despite changes enacted in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, land owners, dependent on forest income, may still encounter estate tax-induced cash flow problems...|$|R

Experimental group participants were requested to write about their rehabilitation experience and the status of their knee. Control group participants were requested to write about their dietary intake during the previous 3 days. Writing samples were then collected over a 2 month period at four stages during the rehabilitation process. Questionnaires included the Profile of Mood States and assessments of rehabilitation self- efficacy, barriers self-efficacy, and rumination. Analyses revealed that experimental group subjects were performing significantly more <b>step-ups</b> and had significantly higher rehabilitation efficacy compared to controls. The higher experimental subjects were subjectively rating their knee, the fewer negative phrases were exhibited in their writing. Finally, the proposed mediator relationships were not confirmed and a cathartic effect of disclosive writing was not supported. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{simplest}} ballast for {{alternating current}} (AC) use is an inductor placed in series, consisting of a winding on a laminated magnetic core. The inductance of this winding limits the flow of AC current. This type is still used, for example, in 120 volt operated desk lamps using relatively short lamps. Ballasts are rated for the size of lamp and power frequency. Where the AC voltage is insufficient to start long fluorescent lamps, the ballast is often a <b>step-up</b> autotransformer with substantial leakage inductance (so as to limit the current flow). Either form of inductive ballast may also include a capacitor for power factor correction.|$|E

40|$|A novel, soft {{microbial}} {{fuel cell}} (MFC) has been constructed using the finger-piece of a standard laboratory natural rubber latex glove. The natural rubber serves as structural and proton exchange material whilst untreated carbon veil {{is used for the}} anode. A soft, conductive, synthetic latex cathode is developed that coats the outside of the glove. This inexpensive, lightweight reactor can without any external power supply, start up and energise a power management system (PMS), which <b>steps-up</b> the MFC output (0. 06 e 0. 17 V) to practical levels for operating electronic devices (> 3 V). The MFC is able to operate for up to 4 days on just 2 mL of feedstock (synthetic tryptone yeast extract) without any cathode hydration. The MFC responds immediately to changes in fuel-type when the introduction of urine accelerates the cycling times (35 vs. 50 min for charge/discharge) of the MFC and PMS. Following starvation periods of up to 60 h at 0 mV the MFC is able to cold start the PMS simply with the addition of 2 mL fresh feedstock. These findings demonstrate that cheap MFCs can be developed as sole power sources and in conjunction with advancements in ultra-low power electronics, can practically operate small electrical devices...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the influences of load {{carriage and}} muscular fatigue on ground reaction forces and ground reaction loading rates during walking. Eighteen healthy males performed the following tasks in order: unloaded and unfatigued walking, loaded and unfatigued walking, fatiguing exercise, loaded and fatigued walking, and unloaded and fatigued walking. The fatiguing exercise consisted of a series of metered <b>step-ups</b> and heel raises with a 16 -kg rucksack. Loaded walking tasks were performed with a 32 -kg rucksack. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variances were used to determine the effects of fatigue and load carriage on ground reaction forces and loading rates. Muscular fatigue has a significant influence on peak vertical ground reaction force and loading rate (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). Load carriage has a significant influence on peak ground reaction forces and loading rates (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). As both muscular fatigue and load carriage lead to large increases of ground reaction forces and loading rates, the high incidence of lower extremity overuse injuries in the military may be associated with muscular fatigue and load carriage...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{additional}} solute magnesium (Mg) on mechanical and high-cycle-fatigue properties of 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloy is investigated in detail. By adding 0. 5 % and 0. 8 % Mg to the 6061 -T 6 alloy {{with a normal}} stoichiometric Mg 2 Si composition (base alloy), the alloy exhibits eminent strain-aging characteristics demonstrated {{by the emergence of}} serrated flow, the negative strain-rate-sensitivity and relatively weakened temperature dependency of flow stress. The Mg-added new alloy also shows higher work-hardening rate than the base alloy particularly at initial flow regime and at lower strain rate. The S-N curve of the new alloy shows a clear fatigue limit which is absent in the base alloy. The fatigue limit of the new alloy is shown to be controlled by the threshold against small crack growth. Moreover, the new alloy clearly exhibits a coaxing phenomenon (time-dependent strengthening) which is absent in the base alloy. The coaxing effect is attributed to the existence of a small quasi-non-propagating crack whose growth resistance gradually increases during stress amplitude <b>step-ups.</b> This study was financially supported in part by the Kansai University Grant-in-Aid for progress of research in graduate course (2012) and also by the Kansai University Expenditures for Support of Training Young Scholars (2013) ...|$|R
25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. <b>Step-up</b> ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{top rated}} {{universities}} which provide highly competitive world class education to their pupils, India {{is also home}} to many universities which have been founded with the sole objective of making easy money. Regulatory authorities like UGC and AICTE have been trying very hard to extirpate the menace of private universities which are running courses without any affiliation or recognition. Indian Government has failed to check on these education shops, which are run by big businessmen & politicians. Many private colleges and universities do not fulfil the required criterion by the Government and central bodies (UGC, AICTE, MCI, BCI etc.) and take students for a ride. For example, many institutions in India continue to run unaccredited courses as there is no legislation strong enough to ensure legal action against them. Quality assurance mechanisms have failed to stop misrepresentations and malpractices in higher education. At the same time regulatory bodies have been accused of corruption, specifically in the case of deemed-universities.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: The current {{treatment}} of chronic hepatitis B infection (CHBV) has achieved several <b>step-ups</b> {{thanks to the}} introduction of the new-generation nucleos(t) ide analogs. Entecavir and tenofovir have shown a high genetic resistance barrier and a low rate of side effects. In literature, there are a few studies comparing entecavir and tenofovir in the {{treatment of}} CHBV. Thus, we describe the results of our experience in managing CHBV patients with tenofovir vs. entecavir. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have retrospectively evaluated, from 2007 to date, 20 CHBV patients treated with entecavir and tenofovir. All the patients underwent basal and periodical clinical follow-up, blood tests, virological tests, Fibroscan® test or liver biopsy and also upper abdominal ultrasound examination. Study endpoints were: viral replication inhibition, viral antigens seroconversion and transaminases normalization. Drug-associated side effects were also registered. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of therapy, entecavir and tenofovir lead to HBV-DNA negativization in 44 % and 62 % of patients, respectively. A case of viral seroconversion for HBeAg and HBsAg was evident in entecavir group, while no cases were registered in tenofovir group. After 12 weeks, 11 % of entecavir treated patients and 37 % of tenofovir treated patients showed normalization of transaminases. DISCUSSION: Tenofovir seems to exert a better viral replication inhibition (though not statistically significant) and to show transaminases improvement in comparison with entecavir, which, in turn, results more effective in HBeAg/HBsAg seroconversion. Both drugs have a high safety profile in terms of side effects. [Article in Italian...|$|R
