The latter half of 1967 saw the beginnings of a slight recovery, with unemployment dipping and industrial capacity <b>steadying.</b> The 1967–68 budget ran into deficit, allocating funds to energise the economic engine whilst Dunstan lambasted the Federal Government for neglecting the South Australian economy, demanding it take a degree of responsibility for its ills.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, McCool gained {{selection}} {{as part of}} Australian team to tour England in 1948 under Donald Bradman. Australia had traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the opening match of the tour, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Although he was only selected sporadically during the preceding Test series against India, McCool was chosen alongside off spinner Ian Johnson {{and appeared to be}} part of Bradman's Test plans. The home side batted first and McCool took his maiden wicket on English soil, having former England captain Bob Wyatt stumped by fellow Queenslander Don Tallon. He removed Wyatt's replacement for a duck without further addition to the score and ended with 2/38 as the home side were dismissed for 233. McCool returned the favour during Australia's innings. Coming in at No. 5, he made a fifth ball duck and was part of a middle-order collapse that saw Australia lose 4/38 before <b>steadying</b> to declare at 8/462. In the second innings, McCool did the bulk of the damage, taking four of the five first wicketstwo of whom were stumped by Tallonto leave the hosts at 5/122 before Australia completed an innings victory. McCool had been the most successful bowler in the opening match.|$|E

5000|$|Four {{models of}} this signal exist. The one with 4 lamps {{is the most}} common. It has a <b>steady</b> red arrow, a <b>steady</b> yellow arrow, a {{flashing}} yellow arrow, and a <b>steady</b> green arrow. One rare version has five lenses, with a <b>steady</b> red arrow, two <b>steady</b> yellow arrows, a flashing yellow arrow, and a <b>steady</b> green arrow, and is only used sometimes, {{when there is a}} leading protected left turn. There are also two with 3 lamps. One signal has a <b>steady</b> red arrow, a <b>steady</b> yellow arrow, and a [...] "dual indication" [...] third lamp which can display either a <b>steady</b> green arrow or a flashing yellow arrow. The other 3-lamp signal has a <b>steady</b> red arrow, a <b>steady</b> yellow arrow and a flashing yellow arrow, with no green arrow; this can be used for either left or right turns, and is used to prevent yellow trap where no green arrow left turn phase exists on the approach. This cannot be done with the circular green without causing yellow trap, because a circular green releases other movements. The <b>steady</b> arrows all have their usual meanings. A flashing yellow arrow indicates a [...] "permitted" [...] left turn, where drivers may turn left without stopping (same as a Yield Sign), but opposing traffic has the right-of-way. The flashing yellow arrow must always be followed by either a <b>steady</b> yellow arrow or a <b>steady</b> green arrow.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for stabilizing intermediate <b>steady</b> state of CSTR is proposed {{by using a}} special type of periodic forced operation, socalled mediating operation.

It is reported that Ramakrishna himself indicated Saradamani as the bride. In May 1859, Sarada was betrothed to Ramakrishna.

England were reduced further when Gower was caught at cover for 17 by Waugh off Lawson, and at 67 for 4, things seemed dire. Robin Smith {{came to the}} rescue, <b>steadying</b> the innings, and a very defensive 17 from Capel bought the hosts enough time to avoid defeat.

More citizens rushed out to defend the city against the new group of marauders. Schenck's force, divided and beset at all sides, was pushed back to the river. Several of the soldiers managed to push the barges into the river, and pull some of their comrades to safety, but it was difficult work: the darkness and the swiftness of the current made <b>steadying</b> the barges difficult, and the angry citizens of Nijmegen were firing arrows and small arms at the marauders. Eventually the soldiers forwent the ropes and scaling hooks, and simply jumped into the river, hoping to swim to the barges.|$|E

30|$|The most {{important}} {{effect of the}} stocking is that system (2.4) can have three interior <b>steady</b> states. Without stocking, system (2.3) has at most two interior <b>steady</b> states where the smaller one is a saddle point and the other <b>steady</b> state is asymptotically stable. One region of the solutions converges to the <b>steady</b> state on the positive y-axis so that the x population is driven to extinction when the population is subject to Allee effects {{but there is no}} stocking. When system (2.4) has three interior <b>steady</b> states, then the middle interior <b>steady</b> state is a saddle point while the other two interior <b>steady</b> states are asymptotically stable. See Theorem  3.3 (a)(ii). The stable manifold of the saddle point separates R_+^ 2 into two positively invariant regions such that solutions in each of these regions converge to the corresponding interior <b>steady</b> state. Therefore, for this parameter regime, given in Theorem  3.3 (a)(ii), both competing populations can coexist as an interior <b>steady</b> state, where the magnitude of the population sizes depends on the initial populations.|$|R

25|$|Rumors {{spread to}} Kamarpukur that Ramakrishna had become {{unstable}} {{as a result}} of his spiritual practices at Dakshineswar. Ramakrishna's mother and his elder brother Rameswar decided to get Ramakrishna married, thinking that marriage would be a good <b>steadying</b> influence upon him—by forcing him to accept responsibility and to keep his attention on normal affairs rather than his spiritual practices and visions. Ramakrishna himself mentioned that they could find the bride at the house of Ramchandra Mukherjee in Jayrambati, three miles to the north-west of Kamarpukur. The five-year-old bride, Saradamani Mukhopadhyaya (later known as Sarada Devi) was found and the marriage was duly solemnised in 1859. Ramakrishna was 23 at this point, but the age difference was typical for 19th century rural Bengal.They later spent three months together in Kamarpukur. Sarada Devi was fourteen while Ramakrishna was thirty-two. Ramakrishna became a very influential figure in Sarada's life, and she became a strong follower of his teachings. After the marriage, Sarada stayed at Jayrambati and joined Ramakrishna in Dakshineswar at the age of 18.|$|E

In the battle of Fallen Timbers, he drove through the Union skirmish line. Not realizing {{that the rest of}} his men had halted their charge when reaching the full Union brigade, Forrest charged the brigade single-handedly, and soon found himself surrounded. He emptied his Colt Army revolvers into the swirling mass of Union soldiers and pulled out his saber, hacking and slashing. A Union infantryman on the ground beside him fired a musket ball into Forrest's spine with a point-blank musket shot, nearly knocking him out of the saddle. The ball went through his pelvis and lodged near his spine. <b>Steadying</b> himself and his mount, he used one arm to lift the Union soldier by the shirt collar and then wielded him as a human shield before casting his body aside after he had found his way to safety. Forrest is acknowledged to have been the last man wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. Forrest galloped back to his incredulous troopers. A surgeon removed the musket ball a week later, without anesthesia, which was unavailable. Forrest would likely have been given a generous dose of alcohol to muffle the pain of the surgery.|$|E
