5|$|Divorcing a <b>spouse</b> was {{permissible}} {{if there}} was mutual consent, while remarriage {{after the death of}} a <b>spouse</b> was common during the Song period. However, widows under post-Song dynasties did not often remarry, following the ethic of the Confucian philosopher Cheng Yi (1033–1107), who stated that it was better for a widow to die than lose her virtue by remarrying. Widows remarrying another after the death of a first <b>spouse</b> did not become common again until the late Qing dynasty (1644–1912), yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior.|$|E

I have chosen this particular topic because I {{am interested in}} this area and in civil law in general and also I find it very important. Community {{property of}} <b>spouses</b> is a specific type of property partnership, which can exist only between <b>spouses.</b> The community property of <b>spouses</b> origins and terminates together with the marriage. Upon the termination of marriage, community property of <b>spouses</b> also terminates and needs to be settled. The thesis is composed of six chapters which further include under-chapters and sections. At the beginning there is an introduction into the history and development of the legal regulations of community property of <b>spouses.</b> Attention is given to the great amendment of the Civil Code carried into affect by Act No. 91 / 1998 Coll., which has brought many changes into the legal regulations of community property of <b>spouses.</b> Chapter two defines the basic terms connected with the issue of the community property of <b>spouses,</b> namely concept, establishment, subject of community property of <b>spouses,</b> property assets and debits of the <b>spouses,</b> exclusive property of each of them and also community property in connection with [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage.

Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the <b>spouse</b> of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their <b>spouse</b> in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a civil partnership or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex civil partnership aspect of the Act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain insight into the quality of life (QoL) and stress {{response}} of female <b>spouses</b> of men cured of testicular cancer in the long-term. Time since treatment completion varied from 0. 5 to 23. 8 years. Two hundred and fifty nine testicular cancer survivors and their <b>spouses</b> completed the Dutch version of the MOS Short Form (SF) - 36 and the Impact of Event Scale. QoL data from a reference group of women were used for comparison. <b>Spouses</b> who had relationship with the testicular cancer survivor before the diagnosis (<b>spouses</b> during testicular cancer) had better functioning scores than the reference group, especially with respect to the physical QoL domains. <b>Spouses</b> who had started a relationship after treatment (<b>spouses</b> after testicular cancer) experienced more problems with psychological QoL domains than <b>spouses</b> during testicular cancer and than the reference group. The stress response of <b>spouses</b> during testicular cancer was related to that of the testicular cancer survivors and to the extent of treatment they had received. Although stress response levels were low, <b>spouses</b> during testicular cancer reported more stress response than the testicular cancer survivors. Time since completion of treatment did not affect QoL or stress response. This study showed that <b>spouses</b> during testicular cancer had a good QoL and little stress response. Functioning of <b>spouses</b> after testicular cancer was poorer with respect to various QoL domains, particularly the psychological measures. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{life satisfaction}} in <b>spouses</b> of middle-aged stroke 			survivors from the long-term perspective {{and to identify}} factors that 			explain their life satisfaction. 			Design: Cross-sectional, case-control study. 			Subjects: Cohabitant <b>spouses</b> of survivors of ischaemic stroke aged < 70 years 			at stroke onset (n = 248) and <b>spouses</b> of controls (n = 246). 			Methods: Assessments were made 7 years after inclusion to the study. Spouses’ 			life satisfaction was assessed with the Fugl-Meyer’s Life 			Satisfaction Check-List (LiSAT 11). Stroke-related factors were 			examined with the National Institutes of Health stroke scale, 			Mini-Mental State Examination, Barthel Index and modified Rankin 			Scale. 			Results: <b>Spouses</b> of stroke survivors had significantly lower satisfaction 			with general life, leisure, sexual life, partner relationship, family 			life, and poorer somatic and psychological health than <b>spouses</b> of 			controls. Caregiving <b>spouses</b> had significantly lower scores on all 			life domains except vocation and own {{activities of daily living}} than 			non-caregiving <b>spouses.</b> Spouses’ satisfaction on different life 			domains was explained mainly by their age, sex, support given to the 			partner, and the survivor’s level of global disability, to which both 			physical and cognitive impairments contributed. 			Conclusion: Seven years after stroke, <b>spouses</b> of stroke survivors reported lower 			life satisfaction compared with <b>spouses</b> of controls. Life 			satisfaction in stroke survivors’ <b>spouses</b> was associated with 			spouses’ age, sex, giving support, and the stroke survivors’ level of 			global disability...|$|R
