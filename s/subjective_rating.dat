Previous research found that quality of this relationship could interfere in the results of the <b>subjective</b> <b>rating</b> of {{job performance}} evaluation. Emotional intelligent employees devote more of their working time on managing their relationship with supervisors. Hence, the likelihood of [...] obtaining better results on performance evaluation is greater for employees high in EI than for employees with low EI. [...] Based on theoretical and methodological approaches, EI measures are categorized in three main streams: (1) stream 1: ability-based measures (e.g. MSCEIT), (2) stream 2: self-reports of abilities measures (e.g. SREIT, SUEIT and WLEIS) and (3) stream 3: mixed-models (e.g. AES, ECI, EI questionnaire, EIS, EQ-I and GENOS), which include measures of EI and traditional social skills. O’Boyle Jr. and his colleagues (2011) found that the three EI streams together had a positive correlation of 0.28 with job performance. Similarly, each of EI streams independently obtained a positive correlation of 0.24, 0.30 and 0.28, respectively. Stream 2 and 3 showed an incremental validity for predicting job performance over and above personality (Five Factor model) and general cognitive ability. Both, stream 2 and 3 were the second most important predictor of job performance below general cognitive ability. Stream 2 explained 13.6% of the total variance; whereas stream 3, explained 13.2%. In order to examine the reliability of these findings, a publication bias analysis was developed. Results indicated that studies on EI-job performance correlation prior to 2010 do not present substantial evidences to suggest the presence of publication bias.|$|E

It is shown that in the process of arguing out the third reason Wicksell came remarkably close to Frank Ramsey's view of the determinants of saving in economies with a positive <b>subjective</b> <b>rate</b> of discount. The similarities between Wicksell and Ramsey result from the fact that - in contrast with Fisher and Bohm-Bewerk - they assumed reinvestment, with the corollary that maximum permanent consumption will be reached at zero interest if the <b>subjective</b> <b>rate</b> discount of future utility is zero. Wicksell used his Ramsey-like saving rule to explain the interaction betwen Bohm-Bawerk's three reasons in either dynamic or stationary conditions, which enabled him to reformulate the third reason as the 'marginal productivity of waiting'. Finally, the relevance of Wicksell's savings rule for the perennial debate on 'Wicksell's missing equation' is considered in the last section of the article. rate of interest, saving, technical progress, time preference, capital,...|$|R
