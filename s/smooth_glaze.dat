60|$|Laura Wing {{hastened to}} her room to prepare herself for her walk; but when she reached it she simply fell on her knees, shuddering, beside her bed. She {{buried her face in}} the soft counterpane of wadded silk; she {{remained}} there a long time, with a kind of aversion to lifting it again to the day. It burned with horror and there was coolness in the <b>smooth</b> <b>glaze</b> of the silk. It seemed to her that she had been concerned in a hideous transaction, and her uppermost feeling was, strangely enough, that she was ashamed--not of her sister but of herself. She did not believe her--that was at the bottom of everything, and she had made her lie, she had brought out her perjury, she had associated it with the sacred images of the dead. She took no walk, she remained in her room, and quite late, towards six o'clock, she heard on the gravel, outside of her windows, the wheels of the carriage bringing back Mrs. Berrington. She had evidently been elsewhere as well as to Plash; no doubt she had been to the vicarage--she was capable even of that. She could pay 'duty-visits,' like that (she called at the vicarage about three times a year), and she could go and be nice to her mother-in-law with her fresh lips still fresher for the lie she had just told. For it was as definite as an aching nerve to Laura that she did not believe her, and if she did not believe her the words she had spoken were a lie. It was the lie, the lie to her and which she had dragged out of her that seemed to the girl the ugliest thing. If she had admitted her folly, if she had explained, attenuated, sophisticated, {{there would have been a}} difference in her favour; but now she was bad because she was hard. She had a surface of polished metal. And she could make plans and calculate, she could act and do things for a particular effect. She could go straight to old Mrs. Berrington and to the parson's wife and his many daughters (just as she had kept the children after luncheon, on purpose, so long) because that looked innocent and domestic and denoted a mind without a feather's weight upon it.|$|E
5000|$|Insulators {{used for}} {{high-voltage}} power transmission {{are made from}} glass, porcelain or composite polymer materials. Porcelain insulators are made from clay, quartz or alumina and feldspar, and are covered with a <b>smooth</b> <b>glaze</b> to shed water. Insulators made from porcelain rich in alumina are used where high mechanical strength is a criterion. Porcelain has a dielectric strength of about 4-10 kV/mm. [...] Glass has a higher dielectric strength, but it attracts condensation and the thick irregular shapes needed for insulators are difficult to cast without internal strains. [...] Some insulator manufacturers stopped making glass insulators in the late 1960s, switching to ceramic materials.|$|E

50|$|The {{freezing}} rain from an ice storm covers everything with heavy, <b>smooth</b> <b>glaze</b> ice. In addition to hazardous driving or walking conditions, branches or even whole trees may {{break from the}} weight of ice. Falling branches can block roads, tear down power and telephone lines, and cause other damage. Even without falling trees and tree branches, {{the weight of the}} ice itself can easily snap power lines and also break and bring down power/utility poles; even electricity pylons with steel frames. This can leave people without power for anywhere from several days to a month. According to most meteorologists, just one quarter of an inch of ice accumulation can add about 500 lb of weight per line span. Damage from ice storms is easily capable of shutting down entire metropolitan areas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quality of}} the {{porcelain}} used to form Kraak ware is much disputed among scholars; some claim that it is surprisingly good, in certain cases indistinguishable from that produced on the domestic market; others imply that it's a dismal shadow of the truly fine ceramics China was capable of producing. [...] Rinaldi comes to a more even-handed conclusion, noting that it [...] "forms a middle category between much heavier wares, often coarse, and definitely finer wares with well levigated clay and <b>smooth</b> <b>glaze</b> that does not shrink on the rim... Thus looking at ceramic production in China at the time from a larger prospective, Kraak ware falls between the best examples and a typical provincial output, such as the contemporary Swatow ware, also made for export, but to South-East Asia.|$|E
50|$|Comfy Cakes is a hand-eye {{coordination}} game. The {{object is to}} fill orders in a bakery by assembling a layer cake to match a given specification, by controlling a conveyor belt that brings the cake to various stations. Elements of the cake include shapes (square, circular or heart-shaped), flavor of batter (strawberry, chocolate or vanilla), filling (either pink, yellow, or brown), optional icing (flavors as used in the batter) and other decorations (e.g. sugar may be sprinkled {{on top of the}} cake, and in rarer cases, flames are applied to iced cakes to create a <b>smooth</b> <b>glaze).</b> If the cake does not match the specification, the player is penalized and the cake gets thrown in the trash. If the player sends three incorrect orders, the game is over. After a certain number of correct orders are shipped, the player wins the game, and the score is tabulated. The final score depends upon the number of cakes baked, the number of incorrect orders sent and the efficiency of the player in baking. At higher levels the specifications become more complex and multiple cakes must be manufactured in parallel on a single conveyor belt. The player makes about 5 or 6 cakes in one of the difficulty levels.Purble Shop is a code-breaker game. The computer decides the color of up to five features (hat, eyes, nose, mouth and clothes) that are concealed from the player. Any color may be used for any feature, and a color can be used once, several times or not used at all. The player then attempts to deduce or guess the correct feature colors in a limited number of moves. There are three difficulty levels: Beginner with three features in three possible colors for 33 = 27 different possible solutions, Intermediate with 44 = 256 solutions, and Advanced with 55 = 3125 solutions. The beginner and intermediate levels are guessing games where after each move the computer tells the player which items were correct, so there is little scope for deduction. At the advanced level the computer doesn't tell the player which specific items were correct, reporting only the count of picks in the correct color and position, and the count of picks in the correct color but the wrong position. This level is similar to the colored peg game Mastermind where success requires logical reasoning (although, there is a small chance of succeeding through lucky guesses).|$|E

It consists of four barely convex whorls, increasingrapidly in size under an apical angle of 160 ° on average. They are separated by linear, clearly visible sutures. The body whorl forms almost the entire shell. It is round at the periphery which is not angular, even if both faces of the shell are rather depressed. The base of the shell is moderately convex, topped in the center with a more whitish coating that thickens toward the aperture to form a flattened and callous auricle {{at the end of}} the columellar edge and above a relatively narrow umbilical opening.

30|$|With the {{increase}} in the international trade of ceramics, improvement in the physical and chemical properties of ceramics has become a market demand in recent years. The addition of nanomaterials in glaze can simultaneously improve the mechanical and corrosion resistance properties of ceramics. In this study, the effect of nano-sized Ag/ZnO in glazed ceramic was investigated considering the hardness, whiteness, and microscopic structures of the products. Results showed that the Ag/ZnO nanocomposite powder significantly affects the performance of glaze. Glaze hardness reached the highest value (96.6 HV) at the low sintering temperature of 1130 °C with the addition of 10 % Ag/ZnO nanocomposite powder. Furthermore, the Ag/ZnO nanocomposite powder improved crack resistance and whiteness. Ag as AgO and Ag 2 O in the glaze was effective for antibacterial activity of ceramic. In addition, the Ag/ZnO nanocomposite powder could also promote the shrinkage of bubbles in the <b>glaze</b> layer and <b>smooth</b> the <b>glaze.</b> These results indicated that the nanoparticles could act as an active center for melting raw materials, which is crucial for ceramic properties.|$|R

The {{groups of}} contending and devouring animals are always much ruder in cutting, and take {{somewhat}} {{the place in}} Byzantine sculpture which the lower grotesques do in the Gothic; true, though clumsy, grotesques being sometimes mingled among them, as four bodies joined to one head in the centre;[51] but never showing any attempt at variety of invention, except only in the effective disposition of the light and shade, and in the vigor and thoughtfulness of the touches which indicate the plumes of the birds or foldings of the leaves. Care, however, is always taken to secure variety {{enough to keep the}} eye entertained, no two sides of these Byzantine ornaments being in all respects the same: for instance, in the chainwork round the first figure in Plate XI. there are two circles enclosing squares on the left-hand side of the arch at the top, but two smaller circles and a diamond on the other, enclosing one square, and two small circular spots or bosses; and in the line of chain at the bottom there is a circle on the right, and a diamond on the left, and so down to the working of the smallest details. I have represented this upper sculpture as dark, in order to give some idea of the general effect of these ornaments when seen in shadow against light; an effect much calculated upon by the designer, and obtained by the use of a golden ground formed of glass mosaic inserted in the hollows of the marble. Each square of glass has the leaf gold upon its surface protected by another thin film of glass above it, so that no time or weather can affect its lustre, until the pieces of glass are bodily torn from their setting. The <b>smooth</b> <b>glazed</b> surface of the golden ground is washed by every shower of rain, but the marble usually darkens into an amber color in process of time; and when the whole ornament is cast into shadow, the golden surface, being perfectly reflective, refuses the darkness, and shows itself in bright and burnished light behind the dark traceries of the ornament. Where the marble has retained its perfect whiteness, on the other hand, and is seen in sunshine, it is shown as a snowy tracery on a golden ground; and the alternations and intermingling of these two effects form one of the chief enchantments of Byzantine ornamentation.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to characterise the {{mechanical}} properties of zinc and manganese phosphate coatings before and after running in. The characterization is done with nano-indentation to determine the individual crystal hardness and single asperity scratch tests to investigate the deformation behaviour at the single asperity level. The nano-indentation and scratch tests reveal brittle deformation behaviour for the as received coatings. Under uni-directional sliding both layers reduce to a powder which is subsequently compacted to a so called <b>glaze</b> layer.

50|$|Fluid paints {{can be used}} like watercolors, or for glazing and washes. To {{create a}} more fluid , water {{is added to the}} paint. The ratio of paint to water depends on how thick the glaze is {{expected}} to be. An opaque glaze or paint consists of more paint than water, and will give a more solid color. A translucent glaze or paint will be the opposite, consisting of slightly more water than the opaque version, and will have a <b>smoother</b> texture. Translucent <b>glazes</b> show more of the colors underneath the paint compared to opaque glazes. Artist Keri Ippolito advises that the paint should be watered no more than 50 percent or the paint will not stick to the canvas. After mixing the paints, allow time for the air bubbles to rise to the surface. This will be crucial in many techniques, especially in pouring paints.|$|R

Lactulose syrup was added to milk during the different stages of the technological process during which the syrup was added: prior to pasteurisation, prior to inoculation and after fermentation before cooling. Different impact on the viscosity of the product and its synergetic qualities was established depending on the stage of the technological process. The addition of lactulose syrup to milk prior to pasteurisation and inoculation increased the duration of fermentation. Samples of yoghurt containing lactulose had more pronounced sensory characteristics (richer flavour, <b>smoother</b> consistency, surface <b>glaze,</b> etc.) than those without lactulose.
