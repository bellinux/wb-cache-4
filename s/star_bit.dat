50|$|In 1974, the {{defendant}}, Johhny Paul Witt, {{was tried}} and convicted of {{first degree murder}} {{in the state of}} Florida. It was proven that the murder had taken place while the defendant and his accomplice Gary Tillman were bow and arrow hunting in the woods. The two friends admitted to talking about killing people frequently. They even occasionally stalked humans as prey in the woods for fun. While on their bow and arrow hunting trip, the two males eventually ended up stalking an 11-year-old boy named Johnathan Kushner riding his bike down a popular trail in the woods. From there, the accomplice hit the boy with a <b>star</b> <b>bit</b> from a drill stunning the child. Witt and his accomplice gagged the child and threw him {{in the back of his}} trunk where the child died from suffocation as a result of the gagging. After driving to a deserted grove, Witt and his accomplice removed the lifeless child in the trunk and slit his stomach to prevent bloating. After, Witt and Tillman performed violent acts on the body, and then buried it in a grave.|$|E

This is sometimes abbreviated in databases and catalogs as 6lobe (starting with numeral, 6, not a capital letter, G). Torx Plus is an improved head profile.|$|R
50|$|Multiplayer {{gameplay}} {{has also}} been expanded upon over the original. In Super Mario Galaxy, another player could use a second Wii Remote to control a second Star Pointer and assist Mario by grabbing onto enemies or collecting and shooting <b>Star</b> <b>Bits.</b> In Super Mario Galaxy 2, the second player now controls an orange Luma who retains all the original abilities, but can also physically attack enemies and collect items, power-ups and 1-ups, making the players involvement more useful. The Luma is named Co-Star Luma.|$|R

5000|$|The {{gameplay}} of Super Mario Galaxy 2 {{is similar}} to Super Mario Galaxy, {{with a focus on}} platforming based on and around 3D planets, referred to in-game as galaxies, with varying themes, sizes, landscapes, and climates. The player controls Mario (or later in the game, his brother Luigi, though using him is optional), who has special abilities such as the [...] "Spin" [...] attack, long jump, wall jumps, and a variety of somersaults. As in the original, the objective of the game is to travel to the various galaxies and collect Power Stars, which are awarded by completing levels and accomplishing tasks and are used to gain access to later levels. The game retains some gameplay mechanics introduced in the original, such as the blue Star Pointer that allows the player to pick up <b>Star</b> <b>Bits</b> and shoot them at enemies, levels that restrict movement to a 2D plane, balance ball levels, and gravity-reversing background arrows.|$|R
5|$|Mario's health {{consists}} of a three-piece health meter, which is depleted through contact with enemies and hazards. When swimming underwater, Mario has an air supply meter, which quickly depletes his main health meter if it runs out. Mario's health and air supply can be restored by collecting coins, or through touching bubbles if underwater. When the health meter becomes empty, the player loses a life and must {{go back to a}} predetermined checkpoint. The health meter can be temporarily expanded to six units {{through the use of a}} Life Mushroom, with the maximum health returning to three units if the overall health falls to three units from enemy or hazard contact, or if Mario suffers instant death. Instant death can occur by being swallowed by quicksand or dark matter; falling into bottomless pits, which either consist of black holes or by leaving a planet's gravitational pull and falling into space. The player can obtain extra lives by collecting 1-Up Mushrooms, 50 coins without losing a life, or 50 <b>Star</b> <b>Bits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Princess Peach invites Mario {{to share}} some cake at the Star Festival, a time when <b>Star</b> <b>Bits</b> rain down from the skies over the Mushroom Kingdom. On his way, Mario finds a Luma, who {{immediately}} befriends him and grants him the ability to spin. Shortly thereafter, Mario's nemesis Bowser, who has grown to an immense size (after swallowing Grand Stars, unbeknownst to Mario at this point), appears and attacks Princess Peach's Castle. Kidnapping the princess, Bowser escapes into outer space to recreate his empire {{at the center of}} the universe. After launching into outer space, Mario is given control of Starship Mario, a mobile planetoid in the shape of his head, made by a crafty Luma mechanic called Lubba, powered by Power Stars, and piloted by other Lumas; his mission is to fly across the universe in pursuit of Bowser and the Princess and to help Lubba find the lost Lumas that were part of Bowser's plot. Along the way Mario meets new Lumas and joins up with his companion Yoshi, the Toad Brigade from the original Super Mario Galaxy, and his brother Luigi.|$|R

40|$|Unilateral visuo-spatial neglect is a neuropsychological {{syndrome}} commonly {{resulting from}} right hemisphere stroke at the temporo-parietal junction of the infero-posterior parietal cortex. Neglect {{is characterized by}} reduced awareness of stimuli presented on patients' contralesional side of space. Inspired by evidence of increased spatial exploration of patients' left side achieved during keyboard scale-playing, the current study employed a music intervention that involved making sequential goal-directed actions in the neglected part of space, {{in order to determine}} whether this would bring about clinically significant improvement in chronic neglect. Two left neglect patients completed an intervention comprising four weekly 30 -min music intervention sessions involving playing scales and familiar melodies on chime bars from right to left.

50|$|The New Janitor was the 27th comedy from Keystone Studios {{to feature}} Charlie Chaplin. The film is arguably {{one of his}} best for the studio, and a {{precursor}} to a key Essanay Studios short, The Bank. The film also demonstrates the differences that Chaplin had with Keystone comedy in that it is a coherent whole in which the stock characters actually fill some emotional center. Chaplin brings a certain complexity to his janitor, unusual to the comedy factory of Mack Sennett. The film, which <b>stars</b> among Sennett's <b>bit</b> players Jess Dandy, Al St. John, John T.

40|$|Three {{independent}} {{lines of}} evidence {{imply that the}} young star PV Ceph is moving at roughly 20 km s‚àí 1 through the interstellar medium. The first, and strongest, suggestion of motion comes from the geometry of the HH knots in the ‚Äúgiant ‚Äù Herbig-Haro (HH) flow associated with PV Ceph. Bisectors of lines drawn between pairs of knots at nearly equal distances from PV Ceph imply an E-W motion of the source, and a plasmon model fit to the knot positions gives a good fit of 22 km s‚àí 1 motion for the <b>star.</b> The second <b>bit</b> of damning evidence comes from a redshifted ‚Äútrail ‚Äù of molecular gas, pointing in the same E-W direction implied by the HH knot geometry.
