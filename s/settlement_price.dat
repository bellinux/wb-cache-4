25|$|Forwards do {{not have}} a standard. They may transact only on the {{settlement}} date. More typical would be for the parties to agree to true up, for example, every quarter. The fact that forwards are not margined daily means that, due to movements in the price of the underlying asset, a large differential can build up between the forward's delivery price and the <b>settlement</b> <b>price,</b> and in any event, an unrealized gain (loss) can build up.|$|E
25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final <b>settlement</b> <b>price</b> for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E

Tests of cointegration and vector autoregressive relationships among the variables are conducted. The stationarity property of each series is tested using the augmented Dickey-Fuller test, from which it is found that each of the series is non-stationary. A cointegrating relationship among <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> is examined for the underlying long-run economic relationships. Cointegration tests and vector autoregressive models of the rates of return were unable to establish any long-run relationships among the variables. Thus, there is no empirical evidence, in general, indicating that long-run relationships exist among the <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> for individual currency futures in Singapore...|$|R

500|$|Frobisher's {{attorney}} Ray Fiske visits David's sister Katie (Anastasia Griffith), who {{is opening}} {{a restaurant in}} which Frobisher is investing, and asks her to sign a confidentiality agreement. Frobisher meets with his former custodian Larry Popler (Victor Arnold), who names a <b>settlement</b> <b>price</b> of $100 million, which Ray returns to Patty. Patty persuades her clients to decline the offer, but Larry mentions a previous agreement to accept any offer of $100 million. Patty suspects that her advisor Tom (Tate Donovan) had known about the agreement and fires him. Katie, meanwhile, thinks that she is being watched, and tells Ellen and David that she had catered a function for Frobisher in Florida and that afterwards he had offered to help her open a restaurant. Ellen realizes that Patty hired her to get to Katie, a potential witness. Though Katie is initially hesitant to testify, she finds her dog Saffron dead in her apartment with a note reading [...] "Quiet" [...] pinned to a wall. Assuming that Frobisher is responsible, she agrees to meet with Patty to help bring Frobisher down. Tom meets with Patty, who had only pretended to fire him, and gives her Saffron's collar, which she throws into the ocean.|$|E

50|$|J.W Wilson {{who took}} part in the {{settlement}} agreement for BC Hydro noticed that while they looked at the physical value of the resident's houses they were unable to include the losses that went along with living self-sufficiently, which was a lifestyle that would not be possible in a city or urban area. The kind of wealth that went unnoticed consisted of agriculture, livestock, tourism and lumber. Paying minimal taxes also enabled a self-sufficient lifestyle with little cost. In addition, from an outsiders perspective it seemed as though BC Hydro was being fair with the resident's <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> for their land and homes. However many people thought that the <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> from BC Hydro were unfair, but were intimidated and felt powerless to challenge them in court, so they accepted the prices begrudgingly. The residents questioned what benefits the dam would have for them if they were just going to be relocated, and lose money in the long run. However, BC Hydro built new communities for those living from Nakusp to Edgewood, as part of the compensation process. These communities came with BC Hydro electricity, running water, telephone services, a school, a church, a park and stores. Finally, building the dam did provide work for many families, and supplied electricity to remote communities that were once out of reach of BC's transmission grid, and dependent on gas and diesel generators.|$|R
