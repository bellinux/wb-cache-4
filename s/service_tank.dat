40|$|Waste tank W- 12 is a tank in the ORNL Low-Level Liquid Waste (LLLW) {{system that}} {{collected}} waste from Building 3525. Because of a leaking flange in the discharge line from W- 12 to the evaporator <b>service</b> <b>tank</b> (W- 22) and continual inleakage {{into the tank}} from an unknown source, W- 12 was removed from service {{to comply with the}} Federal Facilities Agreement requirement. The initial response was to decontaminate the valve pit between tank W- 12 and the evaporator <b>service</b> <b>tank</b> (W- 22) to determine if personnel could enter the pit to attempt repair of the leaking flange. Preventing the spread of radioactive contamination from the pit to the environment and to other waste systems was of concern during the decontamination. The drain in the pit goes to the process waste system; therefore, if high-level liquid waste were generated during decontamination activities, {{it would have to be}} removed from the pit by means other than the available liquid waste connection. Remote decontamination of W- 12 was conducted using the General Mills manipulator bridge and telescoping trolley and REMOTEC RM- 10 manipulator. The initial objective of repairing the leaking flange was not conducted because of the repair uncertainty and the unknown tank inleakage. Rather, new piping was installed to empty the W- 12 tank that would bypass the valve pit and eliminate the need to repair the flange. The radiological surveys indicated that a substantial decontamination factor was achieved...|$|E

40|$|Tank 48 H {{return to}} service is {{critical}} to the processing of high level waste (HLW) at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Tank 48 H currently holds legacy material containing organic tetraphenylborate (TPB) compounds from the operation of the In-Tank Precipitation process. The TPB was added during an in-tank precipitation process to removed soluble cesium, but excessive benzene generation curtailed this treatment method. This material is not compatible with the waste treatment facilities at SRS and must be removed or undergo treatment to destroy the organic compounds before the tank can be returned to routine Tank Farm <b>service.</b> <b>Tank</b> 48 H currently contains approximately 240, 000 gallons of alkaline slurry with approximately 19, 000 kg (42, 000 lb) of potassium and cesium tetraphenylborate (KTPB and CsTPB). Out of Tank processing of the Tank 48 H has some distinct advantages as aggressive processing conditions (e. g., high temperature, low pH) are required for fast destruction of the tetraphenylborate. Also, a new facility can be designed with the optimum materials of construction and other design features to allow the safe processing of the Tank 48 H waste. However, it is very expensive to build a new facility. As a result, an in-tank process primarily using existing equipment and facilities is desirable. Development of an in-tank process would be economically attractive. Based on success with Fentons Chemistry (i. e., hydrogen peroxide with an iron or copper catalyst to produce hydroxyl radicals, strong oxidation agents), testing was initiated to develop a higher pH oxidation process that could be completed in-tank...|$|E

40|$|The Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVSTs) and the {{evaporator}} <b>service</b> <b>tanks</b> at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{are used}} for the collection and storage of liquid low-level waste (LLLW). Wastes collected in these tanks are typically acidic when generated and are neutralized with sodium hydroxide to protect the tanks from corrosion; however, the high pH of the solution causes the formation of insoluble compounds that precipitate. These precipitates formed a sludge layer approximately 0. 6 to 1. 2 m (2 to 4 ft) deep {{in the bottom of}} the tanks. The sludge in the MVSTs and the evaporator <b>service</b> <b>tanks</b> will eventually need to be removed from the tanks and treated for final disposal or transferred to another storage facility. The primary options for removing the sludge include single-point sluicing, use of a floating pump, robotic sluicing, and submerged-nozzle sluicing.

40|$|Waste {{retrieval}} {{and transfer}} {{operations at the}} Gunite{trademark} and Associated Tanks (GAATs) Remediation Project have been successfully accomplished using the Tank Waste Retrieval System. This system is composed of the Modified Light-Duty Utility Arm, Houdini Vehicle, Waste Dislodging and Conveyance System, Hose Management Arm, and Sludge Conditioning System. GAAT W- 9 {{has been used as}} a waste-consolidation and batch-transfer tank during the retrieval of sludges and supernatants from the seven Gunite tanks in the North and South tank farms at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Tank W- 9 was used as a staging tank for the transfers to the Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVSTs). A total of 18 waste transfers from W- 9 occurred between May 25, 1999, and March 30, 2000. Most of these transfers were accomplished using the PulsAir Mixer to mobilize and mix the slurry and a submersible retrieval-transfer pump to transfer the slurry through the Sludge Conditioning System and the {approx} 1 -mile long, 2 -in. -diam waste-transfer line to the MVSTs. The transfers from W- 9 have consisted of low-solids-content slurries with solids contents ranging from {approx} 2. 8 to 6. 8 mg/L. Of the initial {approx} 88, 000 gal of wet sludge estimated in the GAATs, a total of {approx} 60, 451 gal have been transferred to the MVSTs via tank W- 9 as of March 30, 2000. Once the waste-consolidation operations and transfers from W- 9 to the MVSTs are completed, the remaining material in W- 9 will be mobilized and transferred to the active waste system, Bethel Valley Evaporator <b>Service</b> <b>Tank</b> W- 23. Tank W- 23 will serve as a batch tank for the final waste transfers from tank W- 9 to the MVSTs. This report provides a summary of the requirements and recommendations for the final waste retrieval system for tank W- 9, a compilation of the sample analysis data for the sludge in W- 9, and brief descriptions of the various waste-retrieval system concepts that were considered for this task. The recommended residual waste retrieval system for cleanout of tank W- 9 consists primarily of the existing Tank Waste Retrieval System, which, is used in conjunction with a small surge vessel placed in one of the tank risers and a positive displacement pump installed inside the Primary Conditioning System containment box. Final cleanout of tank W- 9 was initiated in July and successfully completed in September 2000. The performance of the selected residual waste retrieval system will be described in a follow-on report...|$|E
40|$|Tank 48 H {{return to}} service is {{critical}} to the processing of high level waste (HLW) at Savannah River Site (SRS). Liquid Waste Disposition (LWD) management has the goal of returning Tank 48 H to routine service by January 2010 or as soon as practical. Tank 48 H currently holds legacy material containing organic tetraphenylborate (TPB) compounds from the operation of the In-Tank Precipitation process. This material is not compatible with the waste treatment facilities at SRS and must be removed or undergo treatment to destroy the organic compounds before the tank can be returned to Tank Farm <b>service.</b> <b>Tank</b> 48 H currently contains {approx} 240, 000 gallons of alkaline slurry with about 2 wt % potassium and cesium tetraphenylborate (KTPB and CsTPB). The main radioactive component in Tank 48 H is {sup 137 }Cs. The waste also contains {approx} 0. 15 wt % Monosodium Titanate (MST) which has adsorbed {sup 90 }Sr, U, and Pu isotopes. A System Engineering Evaluation of technologies/ideas for the treatment of TPB identified Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) as a leading alternative technology to the baseline aggregation approach. Over 75 technologies/ideas were evaluated overall. Forty-one technologies/ideas passed the initial screening evaluation. The 41 technologies/ideas were then combined to 16 complete solutions for the disposition of TPB and evaluated in detail. Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) is an aqueous phase process in which soluble or suspended waste components are oxidized using molecular oxygen contained in air. The process operates at elevated temperatures and pressures ranging from 150 to 320 C and 7 to 210 atmospheres, respectively. The products of the reaction are CO{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }O, and low molecular weight oxygenated organics (e. g. acetate, oxalate). The basic flow scheme for a typical WAO system is as follows. The waste solution or slurry is pumped through a high-pressure feed pump. An air stream containing sufficient oxygen to meet the oxygen requirements of the waste stream is injected into the pressurized waste stream, and the air/liquid mixture is preheated to the required reactor inlet temperature. The reactor provides sufficient retention time to allow the oxidation to approach the desired level of organic decomposition. Typical reaction time is about 30 - 120 minutes. Heat exchangers are routinely employed to recover energy contained in the reactor effluent to preheat the waste feed/air entering the reactor. Auxiliary energy, usually steam, is necessary for startup and can provide trim heat if required. Since the oxidation reactions are exothermic, sufficient energy may be released in the reactor to allow the WAO system to operate without any additional heat input. After cooling, the oxidized reactor effluent passes through a pressure control valve where the pressure is reduced. A separator downstream of the pressure control valve allows the depressurized and cooled vapor to separate from the liquid. Typical industrial WAO applications have a feed flow rate of 1 to 220 gallons per minute (gpm) per train, with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) from 10, 000 to 150, 000 mg/L (higher CODs with dilution). Note that catalysts, such as homogeneous copper and iron, their heterogeneous counterparts, or precious metals can be used to enhance the effectiveness (i. e., to lower temperature, pressure, and residence time as well as increase oxidation efficiencies) of the WAO reaction if deemed necessary...|$|E
