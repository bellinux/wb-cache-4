5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest <b>seem</b> to have diverged {{from the main}} lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated.

5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel.

During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together. Mothers <b>seem</b> to comfort the young by softly vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|E
