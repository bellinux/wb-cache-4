25|$|Another {{common use}} of a ballast {{resistor}} in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the fan <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.|$|E

50|$|This {{resulted}} in a transmission with a typical 4 speed 'H' pattern shift mechanism, plus an additional 2 speed 'high-low' selector which effectively split each of the 4 speed gears in two. This meant 8 forward gears in total. It was also possible to use the 2 <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> in reverse, meaning that two reverse gears also existed. In the majority of cars, the 2 <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> was labelled as 'Power' for the lower range, and 'Economy' for the higher range. In some cars the 2 <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> was labelled with a star icon for the lower range and 'E' (economy) for the higher range. A dashboard light system was used to indicate which mode was selected.|$|E
40|$|A {{detector}} {{of heavy}} nonrelativistic sea level particles is described. Selection of events {{is based on}} the dependence of the particle path on particle mass at a given speed. Cerenkov counters with beta sub tr = 0. 59 are used as <b>speed</b> <b>selectors.</b> Mounted above the detector is a scintillation counter for measuring the ionization caused by a particle. The particle track is recorded by spark chambers...|$|R
50|$|Selector {{channels}} enabled I/O to {{high speed}} devices. These storage devices {{were attached to}} a control unit {{and then to the}} channel. The control unit let clusters of devices be attached to the channels. On higher <b>speed</b> models, multiple <b>selector</b> channels, which could operate simultaneously or in parallel, improved overall performance.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a modern {{realization}} of the classic helical velocity selector for gas phase particle beams. The device operates stably under high vacuum conditions at rotational frequencies limited only by commercial dc motor capabilities. Tuning the rotational frequency allows selective scanning over a broad velocity band. The width of the selected velocity distributions at full-width-half-maximum is as narrow as a few percent of the selected mean velocity and independent of the rotational <b>speed</b> of the <b>selector.</b> The selector generates low vibrational noise amplitudes comparable to mechanically damped state-of-the-art turbo-molecular pumps and is therefore compatible with vibration sensitive experiments like molecule interferometr...|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} Soviet-era rangefinders, the shutter <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> rotates when the shutter is released, {{and should not}} be changed until after the shutter has been cocked. If the shutter speed is changed without cocking the shutter first, the setting pin can be broken when the film is advanced.|$|E
50|$|The CCWs were {{initially}} were executed by {{two types of}} SCU attached to the system's high <b>speed</b> <b>Selector</b> Channels. The 2820 SCU controlled the 2301 Drum while the 2841 SCU controlled combinations of the 2302 Disk Storage, 2311 Disk Drive, 2321 Data Cell and/or 7320 Drum Storage. IBM quickly replaced the 7320 with the faster and larger 2303.|$|E
50|$|The Zele {{employed}} a 4 position <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> and a 2 position foot pedal providing six forward speeds, two reverse speeds {{and a range}} of approximately 50 mi. The Zele 2000 also featured a boost switch which, once at top speed, weakens the motor's magnetic fields in the field coils to produce less torque but a greater top speed.|$|E
5000|$|White Flying V copy - This guitar {{is not a}} Gibson Flying V, but a Japanese copy made by Electra which Hetfield {{purchased}} for $200. It was retired after the neck broke twice and the guitar started {{to go out of}} tune easily. The stock bridge pickup was later replaced with Seymour Duncan Invader. Recently Hetfield had ESP make an exact copy of it even down to the bolt on neck. The pickups were swapped for EMG 81/60, knobs were replaced with Gibson style black <b>speed</b> knobs, pickup <b>selector</b> has been moved up and stock machineheads were replaced with Shaller machineheads. This guitar has been seen during the making of [...] "Death Magnetic during the making of [...] "The Judas Kiss".|$|R
5000|$|Speed {{control of}} the fan motors within a fan coil unit is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some {{manufacturers}} accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the fan coil unit design. A simple <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat. Building Energy Management Systems {{can be used for}} automatic fan speed and temperature control. Fan motors are typically AC Shaded Pole or Permanent Split Capacitor. More recent developments include brushless DC designs with electronic commutation. Compared to units with asynchronous 3-speed motors, the fan coil units with brushless motors will reduce the power consumption up to 70%.http://heinenhopman.com/en/merchant/fan-coil-unit/ ...|$|E
50|$|This {{arrangement}} is also sometimes {{known as a}} direct shift gearbox or powershift gearbox. It seeks to combine the advantages of a conventional manual shift with the qualities of a modern automatic transmission by providing different clutches for odd and even <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> gears. When changing gear, the engine torque is transferred from one gear to the other continuously, so providing gentle, smooth gear changes without either losing power or jerking the vehicle. Gear selection may be manual, automatic (depending on throttle/speed sensors), or a 'sports' version combining both options.|$|E
50|$|The cloth {{focal-plane shutter}} {{provides}} speeds from 1/30 to 1/1000 sec. and B. The {{shutter release button}} is situated on the right-hand camera front externally threaded for Leica cable release. The shutter control is the small milled knob on the top with numerals from 30 to 1000 and B engraved around it. It serves dual purposes, for winding the shutter in a single anti-clockwise motion until a catch arrests it, and thence as a lift and turn type shutter <b>speed</b> <b>selector.</b> A standard coaxial flash synchronising socket is situated {{at the front of}} the camera, below the shutter release button.|$|E
50|$|The series {{began in}} 1938 with the Argus C, {{equipped}} with a rangefinder which was not coupled to the lens. Focusing a C is a two step process, first finding the distance using the built-in rangefinder, then focusing the lens by rotating it until a scale on the side matches the distance given by the rangefinder. Very early production C cameras had high and low range shutter speeds marked on the speed dial, with a separate switch to select the desired speed range. The high/low <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> was soon deleted from production, and speeds controlled by the rotary dial with 10 marked speeds.|$|E

5000|$|SQ-Ai: Introduced December 1990, {{production}} discontinued December 2003. Added the following functionality to the SQ-A. Ability {{to add the}} motor drive SQ-i and off the film (TTL-OTF) metering with select flash guns. These changes required {{the addition of a}} circuit board which also required the battery compartment to be [...] "flattened." [...] The single 6v cell was replaced with four 1.5 volt [...] "button" [...] cells. A bulb 'B' setting was added to the shutter <b>speed</b> <b>selector.</b> The film-back was also modified again with the introduction of the SQ-Ai, relocating the ISO dial {{to the rear of the}} film-back (rather than on top) to allow the speed setting to be seen better with a prism attached. Exposure compensation control was also added to the new SQ-Ai film-back, with the ISO range extended to 6400.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} designs of the seventies for the 35mm SLR camera industry was the introduction of the Olympus OM-1 in 1973. After experiencing success with their small Olympus Pen half-frame cameras, particularly with their half-frame SLR-based Olympus Pen-F, Pen-Ft and Pen-FV cameras, Olympus set out with its chief designer Yoshihisa Maitani to later create a compact SLR—the M-1—with new compact lenses and a large bayonet mount that could accept almost any SLR design optic. Shortly after being launched the camera was renamed the OM-1 to avoid a trademark conflict with Leica. The mechanical, manual OM-1 was significantly smaller and lighter than contemporary SLRs, but no less functional. The camera was supported by one {{of the most}} comprehensive 35mm SLR lens and accessory systems available. Maitani decreased the size and weight by totally redesigning the SLR from the ground up with unprecedented use of metallurgy, which included repositioning the shutter <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> {{to the front of the}} lens mount, instead of a more conventional position on top of the body.|$|E
5000|$|Low-end: (90/30, 90/25, 90/40): Separately {{from the}} {{high-end}} series, Sperry Univac introduced the Univac 90/30 in about 1975 {{to provide an}} upgrade path for 9x00 users and to compete with IBM's System 3. It used a disk operating system and had either a 300 or 600 lines per minute printer, a card reader, optionally a card punch, a console (Uniscope 100), attached disk drives that had removable disk packs, several 1600 or 6250 BpI tape drives, and an optional communications controller supporting up to 16 terminals (later 32) The standard disk drive was the 8416 which held a multi-layer platter removable disk pack that held approximately 29 million bytes. The 8418 drive was an enhanced version that supported both 29MB and [...] "double-density" [...] 58MB disk packs. These disk drives operated on the IDA (Integrated Disk Adapter). There was also an optional 8430 drive with a 100MB capacity that operated on a separate high <b>speed</b> <b>selector</b> channel. Available tape drives were the Uniservo 10 (Mux Channel) and Uniservo 14 (Selector channel). The optional Selector Channel also enabled the use of other high speed devices such as the 1200 lpm 0776 printer or the 2000 lpm 0770 printer. The machine had either 4K or 16K memory chips, and typical machines had between 128 to 512 KiB memory. It ran an OS called OS/3, and could run up to 7 jobs at one time, not counting various OS extensions such as the print spooler and telecommunications access (ICAM). It was an upgrade path for users who had outgrown the IBM System/3. It ran Cobol-74, RPG2, Fortran, and Assembler. The instruction set of the 90/xx series was implemented in microcode and was loaded into control storage {{as part of the}} boot up process, before loading the operating system.|$|E
