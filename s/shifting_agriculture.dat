Residents generally live in villages of 20 to 60 families {{and engage in}} subsistence <b>shifting</b> <b>agriculture.</b> Ratanakiri is among the least developed provinces of Cambodia. Its infrastructure is poor, and the local government is weak. Health indicators in Ratanakiri are extremely poor; men's life expectancy is 39 years, and women's is 43 years.

5|$|Aboriginal {{cultural}} areas {{depend upon}} their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, {{at the time}} of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, <b>shifting</b> <b>agriculture</b> was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash. While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet. The caribou, fish, other marine mammals {{and to a lesser extent}} plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet. One of the most noticeable symbols of Inuit culture, the inukshuk is the emblem of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Inuksuit are rock sculptures made by stacking stones; in the shape of a human figure, they are called inunnguaq.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Ward Barrett {{considers}} that the [...] "region {{now known as}} Morelos has a physical unity sufficient to define and set it in strong contrast to other regions of Mexico." [...] Much of this definition comes from its geography, which is a basin into which abundant water flows. The arrival of the Spanish <b>shifted</b> <b>agriculture</b> subsistence maize production and cotton cultivation to sugar cane and the refining of such into sugar in nearby mills. Since this sugar competed with that grown in the Caribbean by slaves, the hacienda system was extremely powerful, reducing many indigenous to landless peasants, dependent on wage labor. This system would remain more or less intact until the Mexican Revolution.|$|R

50|$|Laos lies {{almost entirely}} within the lower Mekong basin. Its climate, {{landscape}} {{and land use}} are the major factors shaping the hydrology of the river. The mountainous landscape means that only 16 {{percent of the country}} is farmed under lowland terrace or upland shifting cultivation. With upland <b>shifting</b> <b>agriculture</b> (slash and burn), soils recover within 10 to 20 years but the vegetation does not. Shifting cultivation is common in the uplands of northern Laos and is reported to account for as much as 27 percent of the total land under rice cultivation. As elsewhere in the basin, forest cover has been steadily reduced during the last three decades by <b>shifting</b> <b>agriculture</b> and permanent agriculture. The cumulative impacts of these activities on the river regime have not been measured. However, the hydrological impacts of land cover changes induced by the Vietnam War were quantified in two sub-catchments of the lower Mekong River basin.|$|E
50|$|Family {{properties}} {{which are}} covered by inheritance consist mainly of acquired Chinese jars, gongs, jewelry, and, in later times, currency. The ownership of cultivated land, the swidden field, is deemed temporary, because the Subanen family moves from place to place, and necessitated by the practice of <b>shifting</b> <b>agriculture.</b> The grains stored in bins or jars do not last long, and therefore {{are not covered by}} inheritance.|$|E
