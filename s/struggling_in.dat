40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} theory of {{recognition}} by Axel Honneth {{and whether or not}} a <b>struggle</b> <b>in</b> his theory is necessarily a power struggle. I distinguished three different forms of <b>struggles</b> <b>in</b> Honneth's work: a conflict of interests, a conflict for recognition, and a collision. Only the last two are within the scope of {{the theory of}} recognition. A struggle for recognition is a situation in one is not recognized as an equal - this is a power <b>struggle.</b> <b>In</b> a collision there is mutual recognition, but a difference in how this should be expressed - this is not a power struggle. This means that a <b>struggle</b> <b>in</b> the theory of recognition is not necessarily a power <b>struggle.</b> <b>In</b> the last chapter I point out the importance of trust in order to cultivate relationships based on mutual recognition...|$|R

Leading scholars, researchers and others, from both the Nordic countries and southern Africa, concerned with documenting those struggles, attended the workshop.

It was expected that Higginbotham would eventually move unless Derby did well enough to gain promotion back to the Premier League, and so in January 2003, with Derby <b>struggling</b> <b>in</b> the First Division, he moved to Southampton on loan, joining permanently in February.|$|E
5|$|The 2014–15 {{season was}} Nigel Worthington's second start to a season {{as manager of}} York City, having taken charge in March 2013. Worthington {{resigned}} in October 2014 with York one place above the relegation zone. He was replaced by Russ Wilcox, who had led Scunthorpe United to promotion from League Two last season before being sacked with them <b>struggling</b> <b>in</b> League One.

5|$|The large Polish {{emigrant}} {{communities in}} North America, Western Europe, and elsewhere, were politically active and lent significant support to those <b>struggling</b> <b>in</b> the country.

Of the Polish institutions in the West the most important were the Radio Free Europe, whose Polish section was run by Jan Nowak-Jeziorański, and the monthly literary Kultura magazine in Paris, led by Jerzy Giedroyc and Juliusz Mieroszewski.|$|E

5|$|After <b>struggling</b> <b>in</b> {{the latter}} half of the 1960s and the entire 1970s, the Giants hired an outsider, George Young, to run {{football}} operations for the first time in several decades. The Giants on-field product and business aspects improved rapidly following the hiring. In 1990, Jack Mara's son, Tim, who was struggling with cancer at the time, sold his half of the team to Bob Tisch. This marked the first time in franchise history the team had not been solely owned by the Mara family. In 2005, Wellington Mara, who had been with the team since its inception in 1925 when he worked as a ball boy, died. His death was followed two weeks later by the death of Tisch.|$|E
5|$|Bradford City were <b>struggling</b> <b>in</b> the Second Division at {{the time}} of Cowan's signing, having won just one of their first ten games of the 1935–36 season. Cowan made his debut for them on 19 October 1935 in a 2–2 draw with Swindon Town, {{but it was not until}} Cowan's third game that Bradford won for the second time that season. Cowan missed just three of the club's {{remaining}} fixtures that season, playing 29 times in the league and three in the FA Cup as City finished 12th. The following season, City again struggled. Cowan missed just one of the first 23 games, but after Christmas, he was restricted to just six; and without Cowan, Bradford finished 21st and were relegated to the Third Division (North).|$|E
5|$|Duquesne enjoyed {{another game}} {{at home on}} February 14 against the La Salle Explorers. Ron Everhart sought a new {{strategy}} for his team, which was <b>struggling</b> <b>in</b> conference play. In this game, La Salle was missing three players, leaving them with an active roster of only eight players. Duquesne ran a 10–40 pattern, in which two squads of five players execute short, intense bursts before being switched out for the other squad. At first, Duquesne fell behind by 14points, but the strategy paid off as La Salle's players tired. With La Salle fatigued, Duquesne switched back to a normal rotation {{and went on to}} win 103–82. Bill Clark scored a career high 34points, and also surpassed the 1,000point mark.|$|E

5|$|Following the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle {{manager in}} February 2006, Bruce was again {{linked with the}} job, which {{ultimately}} went to Glenn Roeder. By {{this stage of the}} 2005–06 season, Birmingham were <b>struggling</b> <b>in</b> the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club began to call for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed to climb out of the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} nearly six months after a win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{win over}} Leicester City, Burnley were drawn against Queens Park Rangers at Turf Moor in the Second Round. Despite a good {{performance}} by their opponents, Burnley progressed to the Third Round with a 4–2 win, in which Bob Kelly struck twice {{in the first half}} and Joe Anderson scored either side of half time. In the Third Round, Burnley were handed an away tie at Hull City, who at the time were <b>struggling</b> <b>in</b> the Football League Second Division and had won only two matches in the previous five months. Despite being without first-team regulars George Halley and Joe Anderson through injury, Burnley were expected to win comfortably, not having lost since 4September 1920. Hull City played above all expectations and Burnley suffered a 0–3 defeat after being 0–1 behind at half time.|$|E
5|$|On the Côte de Peille, Contador {{attacked}} in the peloton. He quickly built an advantage, with Kiserlovski and Trofimov dropping {{back from the}} breakaway to assist him. They built a lead of around a minute, but Team Sky pulled the lead back and Contador's group was caught by {{the foot of the}} Col d'Èze, with only Tim Wellens (Lotto–Soudal) ahead. Romain Bardet attacked, but Contador chased him down. Contador himself attacked several times, with Sky's Sergio Henao and the Orica–GreenEDGE team chasing him down; Thomas appeared to be <b>struggling.</b> <b>In</b> the final part of the climb, Contador got away, initially with Majka and then with Richie Porte. At the top of the climb, they caught Wellens and had a 30-second advantage over the chasing group.|$|E

5|$|Preparing for the Canucks' {{training}} {{camp for the}} 2009–10 season, Hodgson injured his back while working out in the summer. The injury, which was misdiagnosed as a bulging disc in his lower back, caused him to miss two months of summer training. After being cleared to play by Canucks team doctors on September 11, 2009, and a back specialist in Toronto, Hodgson was again expected to secure a roster spot during {{training camp}}. After <b>struggling</b> <b>in</b> six pre-season games, he was returned to the Brampton Battalion on September 29 {{in the final round}} of team cuts.|$|E
5|$|Shankly {{began his}} {{managerial}} {{career at the}} club where his professional playing career had started. Carlisle in the 1948–49 season were <b>struggling</b> <b>in</b> {{the bottom half of}} the Third Division North and finding it difficult to attract southern-based players because of the town's geographic remoteness in the far north of England. Shankly's work ethic transformed the team who finished 15th in 1948–49 after he had been in charge for only the last few matches. They improved to ninth in 1949–50 and then to third in 1950–51, almost gaining promotion.|$|E
5|$|Situated in the Burnden area of Bolton, {{approximately}} one {{mile from the}} centre of the town, the ground served as the home of the town's football team for 102 years. In its heyday, Burnden Park could hold up to 70,000 supporters but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life. A section of The Embankment was sold off in 1986 {{to make way for a}} new Normid superstore. At this time, Bolton were in a dire position financially and were <b>struggling</b> <b>in</b> the Football League Third Division, so there was a low demand for tickets and the loss of part of the ground gave the Bolton directors good value for money.|$|E
