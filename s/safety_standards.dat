5|$|Roberts {{left his}} mark on Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} racing {{as a world}} championship winning rider, an advocate for increased <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> in racing, and as a racing team owner and a motorcycle engine and chassis constructor. His dirt track-based riding style changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. Roberts' proposal to create a rival motorcycle championship in 1979 broke the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) hegemony and increased the political clout of Grand Prix racers, which subsequently led to improved <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> and {{a new era of}} professionalism in the sport. In 2000, Roberts was named a Grand Prix Legend by the FIM.|$|E

5|$|The {{report on}} the crash in Dryden criticised {{approaches}} to deicing.

5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E

Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new <b>safety</b> <b>standards,</b> after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.

40|$|Nanoparticles provide great {{advantages}} {{but also}} great risks. Risks associating with nanoparticles are {{the problem of}} all technologies, but they increase in many times in nanotechnologies. Adequate methods of outgoing production inspection are necessary {{to solve the problem}} of risks, and the inspection must be based on the <b>safety</b> <b>standard.</b> Existing <b>safety</b> <b>standard</b> results from a principle of “maximum permissible concentrations or MPC”. This principle is not applicable to nanoparticles, but a <b>safety</b> <b>standard</b> reflecting risks inherent in nanoparticles doesn’t exist. Essence of the risks is illustrated by the example from pharmacology, since its safety assurance is conceptually based on MPC and it has already come against this problem. Possible formula of <b>safety</b> <b>standard</b> for nanoparticles is reflected in many publications, but conventional inspection methods cannot provide its realization, and this gap is an obstacle to assumption of similar formulas. Therefore the development of nanoparticle industry as a whole (also development of the pharmacology in particular) is impossible without the creation of an adequate inspection method. There are suggested new inspection methods founded on the new physical principle and satisfying to the adequate <b>safety</b> <b>standard</b> for nanoparticles. These methods demonstrate that creation of the adequate <b>safety</b> <b>standard</b> and the outgoing production inspection in a large-scale manufacturing of nanoparticles are the solvable problems. However there is a great distance between the physical principle and its hardware realization, and a transition from the principle to the hardware demands great intellectual and material costs. Therefore it is desirable to call attention of the public at large to the necessity of urgent expansions of investigations associated with outgoing inspections in nanoparticles technologies. It is necessary also to attract attention, first, of representatives of state structures controlling approvals of the adequate <b>safety</b> <b>standard</b> to this problem, since it is impossible to compel producers providing the safety without the similar standard, and, second, of leaders of pharmacological industry, since their industry already entered into the nanotechnology era, and they have taken an interest in a forthcoming development of inspection methods...|$|R
