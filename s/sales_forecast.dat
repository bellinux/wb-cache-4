In a {{world of}} unpredictability and complexity, <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> is becoming recognised as essential to operations planning in business and industry. With increased globalisation and higher competition, more products are being developed at more locations, but with shorter product lifecycles. As technology improves, more sophisticated <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> systems are developed which require increasing complexity. We tum to adaptive agent architectures to consider an alternative approach for modelling complex <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> systems. This research proposes modelling a <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> system using an adaptive agent architecture. It additionally investigates the suitability of Bayesian networks as a <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> technique. This is achieved through BaBe, an adaptive agent architecture which employs Bayesian networks as internal models. We develop a <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> system for a meat wholesale company whose sales are largely affected by exogenous factors. The company's current <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> approach is solely qualitative, {{and the nature of}} their sales is such that they would benefit from a reliable exogenous data <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> system. We implement the system using BaBe, and incorporate a Bayesian network representing the causal relationships affecting sales. We introduce a learning adjustment component to adjust the estimated sales towards closer approximations. This is required as BaBe is currently unable to use continuous data, resulting in a loss of accuracy during discretisation. The learning adjustment additionally provides a feedback aspect, often found in adaptive agent architectures. The adjustment algorithm is based on the mean error calculation, commonly used as <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> performance measures, but is extended to incorporate a number of exogenous variables. We test the system using the holdout procedure, with a 5 -fold cross validation data-splitting approach, and contrast the accuracy of the estimated sales, provided by the system, with sales estimated using a regression approach.

The literature suggests that this gap should be addressed by examining new factors in <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting.</b> Accuracy, bias, timeliness, cost and environmental turbulence are the most studied <b>forecasting</b> criteria in <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> effectiveness. There are some literatures which address how these factors are affected by the forecast methods the firm uses. Empirical evidence on such a role of the forecasting method is lacking, and existing literature {{does not take into account}} whether forecasting criteria's influence on export <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> effectiveness vary depending on the forecasting methods used by the firm.

Linking the forecasting effectiveness to the business performance was reported to be critical in evaluating and improving the firm's <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> capability and <b>sales</b> <b>forecasting</b> climate.

Our finding revealed the impact of bias, timeliness and cost on forecasting effectiveness varies depending on the forecasting methods used by the firm. But no moderating impact of forecasting methods has been found for accuracy and environmental turbulence. Moreover, this study reported the linkage between forecasting effectiveness and export performance when composite forecasting method is used. Identifying the relative importance of all the factors (i. e. accuracy, bias, cost, timeliness, forecasting methods, etc) it becomes possible to set priorities directly reflecting managerial preferences for different forecast criteria. If implementation of such priorities is seen to contradict principles of good forecasting practice, action can be taken to inform managers of the potential negative consequences...|$|R
