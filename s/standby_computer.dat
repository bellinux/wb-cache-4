2500|$|To {{meet the}} {{reliability}} {{requirements of the}} 1951 US digital computer Whirlwind, [...] "special-quality" [...] tubes with extended life, and a long-lasting cathode in particular, were produced. The problem of short lifetime was traced to evaporation of silicon, used in the tungsten alloy to make the heater wire easier to draw. Elimination of silicon from the heater wire alloy (and more frequent replacement of the wire drawing dies) allowed production of tubes that were reliable enough for the Whirlwind project. The tubes developed for Whirlwind were later used in the giant SAGE air-defense computer system. SAGE computers were dual installations, with one operating, {{and the other in}} standby. To locate potential tube failures in the <b>standby</b> <b>computer,</b> heater voltages were reduced, which caused failures of tubes which would otherwise fail in service.

As the Liberal Party reduced in importance the swingometer was brought back for the 1979 general election but for the 1983 and 1987 general elections computers were introduced to show changes in support in both map and graphic form.|$|R
50|$|In {{computing}} {{and related}} {{technologies such as}} networking, failover is switching to a redundant or <b>standby</b> <b>computer</b> server, system, hardware component or network upon the failure or abnormal termination of the previously active application, server, system, hardware component, or network. Failover and switchover are essentially the same operation, except that failover is automatic and usually operates without warning, while switchover requires human intervention.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on {{reliability}} and profit analysis of a two unit cold <b>standby</b> <b>computer</b> system. In each unit h/w and s/w fail independently from normal mode. There is a single server who takes some time to arrive at s/w failure with the condition that he has to visit the system immediately at h/w failure. The unit is repaired at h/w failure while s/w is replaced by new one with some replacement time when it fails to execute the required instructions properly. Server can leave the system only after finishing all jobs available to him. All random variables are statistically independent. The time to failure of h/w and s/w is distributed exponentially while the arrival time of the server, h/w repair time and s/w replacement time are arbitrarily distributed with different probability density functions (pdf). The expressions for various reliability measures are derived using semi-Markov process and regenerative point technique. The results for a particular case are obtained to depict the graphical behaviour of some important measures of system effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new fault tolerance scheme suitable for humanoid robot applications. In the future, various tasks ranging from daily chores to safety-related tasks {{will be carried}} out by individual humanoid robots. If the importance of the tasks is different, the required dependability will vary accordingly. Therefore, for mobile humanoid robots operating under power constraints, fault tolerance that dynamically changes based on the importance of the tasks is desirable because fault-tolerant designs involving hardware redundancy are power intensive. In the proposed fault tolerance scheme, a duplex computer system switches between hot standby and cold standby according to each individual task. However, in mobile humanoid robots, a safety issue arises when cold standby is used for the <b>standby</b> <b>computer</b> unit. Since an unpowered unit cannot immediately start to operate, a biped-walking robot falls down when failover occurs during cold standby. This paper proposes a safety failover method to resolve this issue and describes the hardware design of the safety failover subsystem.

40|$|This {{study of}} the {{feasibility}} of further automating the Central Laboratories deals specifically with the combined laboratory operations in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Denver, Colorado and is prepared {{with the understanding that}} such a system will also be implemented at the Central Laboratories in Atlanta, Georgia, and Albany, New York. The goals of automation are defined in terms of the mission of a water analysis laboratory, propose alternative computer systems for meeting such goals, and evaluate these alternatives in terms of cost effectiveness and other specified criteria. It is found that further automation will be beneficial and an in-house system that incorporates dual minicomputers is recommended: one for time-shared data acquisition, processing, and control; the second for data management. High-use analytical instruments are placed on-line to the time-shared minicomputer, with a terminal at each instrument and backup data storage on magnetic tape. A third, <b>standby</b> <b>computer</b> is switched in manually should the time-shared computer go down. Field-proven, modular hardware and software are chosen. Also recommended is the incorporation of the highly developed, computer-integrated instruments that are commercially available for determining petrochemicals and other organic substances, and are essential to the Laboratories' mission.
