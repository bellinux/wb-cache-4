Moreover, {{the trench}} process is being produced only down to 90 nm, whereas the <b>stacked</b> <b>capacitor</b> process is being produced at the 65 nm lithography.

50|$|The {{capacitor}} in the <b>stacked</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{scheme is}} constructed {{above the surface}} of the substrate. The capacitor is constructed from an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) dielectric sandwiched in between two layers of polysilicon plates (the top plate is shared by all DRAM cells in an IC), and its shape can be a rectangle, a cylinder, or some other more complex shape. There are two basic variations of the <b>stacked</b> <b>capacitor,</b> based on its location relative to the bitline - capacitor-over-bitline (COB) and capacitor-under-bitline (CUB). In a former variation, the capacitor is underneath the bitline, which is usually made of metal, and the bitline has a polysilicon contact that extends downwards to connect it to the access transistor's source terminal. In the latter variation, the capacitor is constructed above the bitline, which is almost always made of polysilicon, but is otherwise identical to the COB variation. The advantage the COB variant possesses is the ease of fabricating the contact between the bitline and the access transistor's source as it is physically close to the substrate surface. However, this requires the active area to be laid out at a 45-degree angle when viewed from above, which makes it difficult to ensure that the capacitor contact does not touch the bitline. CUB cells avoid this, but suffer from difficulties in inserting contacts in between bitlines, since the size of features this close to the surface are at or near the minimum feature size of the process technology (Kenner, pp. 33-42).|$|E
50|$|Up {{until the}} mid-1980s, the {{capacitors}} in DRAM cells were co-planar with the access transistor (they were constructed {{on the surface}} of the substrate), thus they were referred to as planar capacitors. The drive to increase both density, and to a lesser extent, performance, required denser designs. This was strongly motivated by economics; a major consideration for DRAM devices, especially commodity DRAMs. The minimization of DRAM cell area can produce a denser device (which could be sold at a higher price), or a lower priced device with the same capacity. Starting in the mid-1980s, the capacitor has been moved above or below the silicon substrate in order to meet these objectives. DRAM cells featuring capacitors above the substrate are referred to as stacked or folded plate capacitors; whereas those with capacitors buried beneath the substrate surface are referred to as trench capacitors. In the 2000s, manufacturers were sharply divided by the type of capacitor used by their DRAMs, and the relative cost and long-term scalability of both designs has been the subject of extensive debate. The majority of DRAMs, from major manufactures such as Hynix, Micron Technology, Samsung Electronics use the <b>stacked</b> <b>capacitor</b> structure, whereas smaller manufacturers such Nanya Technology use the trench capacitor structure (Jacob, pp. 355-357).|$|E

It is shown that the doping process of the underlaying polysilicon {{plays an important role}} in the dielectric breakdown behavior. Evaluation of I-E characteristics from voltage ramp measurements demonstrates the influence of top and bottom oxide thickness. Under NO double layers generally a native oxide is found. This leads to similar eliability results as found for triple layers. Real double layers (ON) without any potential barrier at the top electrode show significantly shorter lifetimes at positive gate voltage. Hence the native oxide between bottom elec-trode and nitride is not negligible.

It {{is possible to}} use ordinary bulk-CMOS devices at temperature up to 175 ⁰C, but the lifetime at these temperatures is to low for a down-hole instrumentation unit. An alternative is to use s Silicon on Insulator process under the fabrication of the semiconductors. The SOI process is a fabrication process where there is buried a oxide layer in the silicon wafer, and thus allowing higher breakdown voltage and/or lower current leakage. The low current leakage allows the semiconductors to be used at higher junction temperature. SOI devices that are commercial available off-the-shelf as a expected lifetime for at least 5 years at 225 ⁰C and thus much lower at junction temperatures below 200 ⁰C. The SOI technology can then be used together with hybrid circuits using ceramic substrate {{as a replacement for}} organic PCB and thick-film technology for the passive devices. A package like this gives a system with high reliability both toward high temperature operation and lifetime. The main limitation in the high temperature design is the availability off the larger capacitors; the limitation for high temperature <b>stacked</b> <b>capacitors</b> is 200 ⁰C. The converters designed are the standard step-up and step-down switch-mode power supplies.

The transistors have always some small perturbations in their specifications, this has to be considered when connecting transistors in series. This perturbations in for example turn-off speed makes an uneven voltage sharing; this is solved by connecting suitable capacitors in parallel with the switches to maintain an even voltage sharing. </p...|$|R
