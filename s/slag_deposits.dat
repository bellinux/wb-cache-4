50|$|With {{this type}} of firing, {{combustion}} is extremely rapid, and short flame length results. The mixing is so intense that combustion rates exceeding 35,000 Btu/(ft3·h) or 360 kW/m3 are practical under certain conditions. However, since there is considerable impingement of flame over the furnace walls it is absolutely necessary that they be fully water-cooled. This sweeping of the water-cooled surfaces, in the furnace, by the gas increases the evaporation rate. Thus, in addition to absorption by radiation from the flame envelope, there is transfer by convection, and the resulting furnace temperatures are lower than {{with other types of}} burners, even though the heat liberation rates may be somewhat higher. Tangentially fired furnaces are usually clean in the upper zone and, as a result, both the furnace and the boiler are comparatively free from objectionable <b>slag</b> <b>deposits.</b>|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{shotguns}} {{have long}} been used for specialized applications in servicing lime kilns, blast furnaces, and even for making seismic shots. Typically of 8 gauge, industrial shotguns are much larger than shotguns designed for use as weapons and are designed for firing using fixed mount stations, not being intended for firing from the shoulder. They are used for removing lime deposits from inside kilns and for removing <b>slag</b> <b>deposits</b> from inside blast furnaces, both being used during routine maintenance. The idea is comparable to sandblasting, in that projectiles are forcibly delivered by gas under pressure. When used for generating seismic shots, they provide very repetitive and consistent peak amplitude levels. Industrial shotguns have also been used in lesser sizes (most commonly 10 and 12 gauge) for use in bird control around airports. Both blanks and slugs are used in industrial shotguns, depending on the exact effect desired, blanks most commonly being used for bird control.|$|E

50|$|The gold {{roasting}} furnace site {{consists of four}} parallel 22 metres by 2.75 metres brick plinths with collapsed brick arched roofs, interpreted as being {{roasting furnace}} bases. The plinths are separated by approximately 5.25 metres spaces between them, one of which at least is paved (the others are largely covered with soils and rubble). The furnaces fed in pairs into two chimneys via brick and stone flues, interconnected with a cross flue between each pair. The furnace bases have flat floors that {{appear to have been}} 2 metres wide internally, with arched roofs about 1.5 metres high, and the floors step up towards the flue-end by one course of brick every 3 metres. There are vaulted tunnels/boxes under two of the furnaces about 2 metres from the end opposite the flues, but there are no apparent fireboxes. The furnace bricks are not firebricks, and there is no vitrification or <b>slag</b> <b>deposit</b> in them, suggesting they were used for roasting rather than smelting.|$|R
50|$|The ironsmelting furnace {{associated}} to these Urewe ceramics comprised a basin filled with fresh green leafy branches and herbs {{which served as}} a filter for the <b>slag</b> <b>deposit</b> at the base.

The decorated furnace, with its fluted patterns on the upper roll and deeply incised criss-cross or s-shaped patterns on the outer surface, may be reminiscent of the rim or neck of the ceramic pottery. Analyses carried out on the ironworking residue have not yet provided data on the efficiency of these furnaces, or whether they were a measure of their technical nature. Iron ore and fuel were readily available. The word “ubutare” meaning “iron” still crops up in many place names. The wooded crown cover was used to produce charcoal.

40|$|Low carbon {{economy and}} the current {{dominant}} role of fossil fuel power plants in serving electricity require the decrease of emission due to carbon dioxide by improving the boiler efficiency. Literature review and industry practice show that neural network based methods are applied to improve the boiler efficiency {{in a number of}} power plants. However, slagging and fouling are still serious problems which impair the efficiency of heat transfer and degrade the performance of a boiler in power plant that uses fossil fuels with high fouling tendency. This paper proposes a new strategy which can be applied to optimize the boiler combustion process by an online adaptive tuning technology based on Integrating Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs). First, a simple heat transfer case with slagging influence consideration is modeled using CFD. Second, an online GA is applied to optimize the complex process in which a fire ball and a slagging layer are simulated. Finally, Simulink programs are created to simulate how to integrate GA with CFD to optimize the heat transfer process where <b>slag</b> <b>deposit</b> is considered. The model results show that the optimized thermal dynamic system obtains higher heat transfer efficiency than one without optimizing...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to an inquiry by the Department of Mineral Resources in Thailand, the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) prepared a program to assess the responsiveness of Sin Pun lignite to the temperature and pressure conditions of hot-water drying. The results indicate that drying made several improvements in the coal, notably increases in heating value and carbon content and reductions in equilibrium moisture and oxygen content. The equilibrium moisture content decreased from 27 wt% for the raw coal to about 15 wt% for the hot-water-dried (HWD) coals. The energy density for a pumpable coal-water fuel (CWF) indicates an increase from 4500 to 6100 Btu/lb by hot-water drying. Approximately 650 lb of HWD Sin Pun CWF were fired in the EERC`s combustion test facility. The fuel burned extremely well, with no feed problems noted {{during the course of}} the test. Fouling and <b>slagging</b> <b>deposits</b> each indicated a very low rate of ash deposition, with only a dusty layer formed on the cooled metal surfaces.

40|$|Steel ladle {{sidewall}} buildup is {{a phenomenon}} that has been observed in steel plants across the world. A laboratory-based investigation that involved immersing test rods of ladle refractory sidewall brick into molten slags of varying compositions was conducted. The mechanism of sidewall buildup was subsequently investigated by varying the thermal regime following slag immersion and observing the resulting microstructures. Slags high in silica exhibited a discontinuous precipitation of corundum, with an additional deposit of anorthite depending on the cooling rate following slag immersion. Slags containing large quantities of alumina were observed to form well-defined bands of hibonite and calcium dialuminate, {{in addition to a}} matrix in some regions, which contained spinel and calcium aluminate. Increasing lime in high-alumina slags was observed to decrease the quantity of <b>slag</b> <b>deposited</b> on the test rods. Experimental results suggest that the mechanism of sidewall buildup may involve a dual-stage process in which dissolution of the sidewall into the bulk slag layer during casting contributes to a loss of material, and dissolution into an adhered liquid layer following casting promotes the formation of solid phases and contributes to increased sidewall thickness...|$|R

40|$|Ways of {{increasing}} productivity have been always a challenging issue for pyrometallurgical processes. Increasing the throughput of the reactor through higher temperature and vigorous agitation in bath are possible options for enhancing the kinetics of reactions in the multiphase system processes. On the other hand, these measures {{also lead to}} rapid degradation of the refractory and premature shutdown of the reactor for relining, imposing additional costs on processes {{in the form of}} planned and unplanned maintenance. An alternative solution to this problem is the formation of a slag freeze lining rather than direct contact of refractory layers with the hot bath. Slag freeze-linings are increasingly used in industrial pyrometallurgical processes to ensure furnace integrity is maintained in aggressive high temperature environments. Most previous studies of freeze-linings have analysed the formation of <b>slag</b> <b>deposits</b> based solely on heat transfer models.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, many {{embankments}} and levees have collapsed during strong earthquakes or floods. In the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (North-Eastern Italy), {{the main source of}} this type of risk is a <b>slag</b> <b>deposit</b> of about 2 x 106 m 3 deriving from galena and lead mining activity until 1991 in the village of Raibl. For the final remedial action plan, several in situ tests were performed: five boreholes equipped with piezometers, four CPTE and some geophysical tests with different approaches (refraction, ReMi and HVSR). Laboratory tests were conducted on the collected samples: geotechnical classification, triaxial compression tests and constant head permeability tests in triaxial cell. Pressure plate tests were also done on unsaturated slag to evaluate the characteristic soil-water curve useful for transient seepage analysis. A seepage analysis was performed in order to obtain the maximum pore water pressures during the intense rainfall event which hit the area on 29 th August 2003. The results highlight that the slag low permeability prevents the infiltration of rainwater, which instead seeps easily through the boundary levees built with coarse materials. For this reason pore water pressures inside the deposits are not particularly influenced by rainfall intensity and frequency. Seismic stability analysis was performed with both the pseudo-static method, coupled with Newmark’s method, and dynamic methods, using as design earthquake the one registered in Tolmezzo (Udine) on 6 th May 1976.
