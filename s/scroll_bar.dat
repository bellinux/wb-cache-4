25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a still photo of Rowland and a [...] "slide-lock" [...] {{function}} from the iPad in the foreground. A single finger appears and unlocks the image by sliding the slider from left to right. The music begins and four small images appear on screen. The finger reappears and clicks on the third image, resulting in that image zooming to fit the whole screen. In this scene, Rowland wears an orange knee-length skirt, T-shirt, and a blue cropped denim jacket. She walks around on a rooftop in Los Angeles. The video then flicks between this scene and another where she is seen partying with her friends. As the chorus begins, Rowland and her friends are seen riding in a convertible car. Then they are seen sitting on some concrete stairs as some skate-boarders ride past them. When the bridge kicks in, the images flicker to a party scene on a rooftop with lots of people enjoying themselves. The finger then re-appears and clicks on the <b>scroll</b> <b>bar,</b> which appears on screen as if to rewind the clip and the original scene of Rowland alone on the rooftop plays as the music fades.|$|E

2500|$|South Africa adopted it and, in 1950, {{intended}} {{to introduce a}} bilingual version, with a <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> {{similar to that of}} the Efficiency Medal (South Africa) above the suspender and the inscriptions [...] "AIR EFFICIENCY AWARD" [...] and [...] "TOEKENNING VIR BEKWAAMHEID (LUGMAG)" [...] on the reverse.
