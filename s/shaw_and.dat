5|$|Supplies of {{raw cotton}} from the United States were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865, {{leading to the}} {{formation}} of the Crompton Local Board of Health in 1863, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality. The Great Depression, and First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline in <b>Shaw</b> <b>and</b> Crompton. Although the industry endured, as imports of cheaper foreign yarns increased during the mid-20th century, <b>Shaw</b> <b>and</b> Crompton's textile sector declined gradually to a halt; said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, cotton spinning reduced in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the early 1980s only four mills were operational.
