Murray defeated Nicolas Mahut in straight sets despite facing a <b>set</b> <b>point</b> in the first set and three set points in the second set. He then defeated his countryman Aljaž Bedene in straight sets. He then had three set wins over Kyle Edmund, another countryman, and No. 5 seed Marin Čilić. In the final he was down a set and a break to 3rd seed Milos Raonic. Murray still managed to come back and win a record 5th Queen's Club Championships and it was also his 2nd title in 2016. Murray then played at the third major of the year at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships as the 2nd seed. Murray had straight set wins over Liam Broady, Lu Yen-hsun, John Millman, and Nick Kyrgios in the first four rounds. Murray then defeated 12th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in five sets in the quarterfinal and 10th seed Tomáš Berdych in straight sets to reach his third straight major final. In the final on 10 July, Murray defeated Raonic in straight sets to win his second Wimbledon title and third Major title overall. His Wimbledon crown was his 3rd title of the season and 38th career Tour title.|$|E

40|$|A {{recently}} developed strategy to calculate <b>set</b> <b>points</b> for controllable diesel engine systems is described, further developed, and evaluated. The strategy calculates <b>set</b> <b>points</b> with an aim to minimize fuel consumption {{for a given}} dynamic vehicle driving cycle, while keeping accumulated emissions below given limits. The strategy is based on existing methodology for steady-state engine operation, but extended to handle transient effects in the engine caused by dynamics in the engine air system. Using the strategy, <b>set</b> <b>points</b> for the complete operating range of the engine can be calculated off-line and stored in an Engine Management System, hence <b>set</b> <b>points</b> can be derived for any (steady-state or transient) driving scenario. The strategy has been evaluated using a simulation model of a complete diesel engine vehicle system. The model estimates fuel consumption, NOX, and soot emissions for a dynamic vehicle driving cycle depending on <b>set</b> <b>points</b> for boost pressure, oxygen fraction in the intake manifold, and injection timing, throughout the simulation. Using this simulation model, the strategy {{has been shown to}} decrease fuel consumption for the New European Driving Cycle with 0. 56 %, the Federal Test Procedure with 1. 04 %, and the Japanese JC 08 cycle with 0. 84 % compared to a strategy based on steady-state engine operation...|$|R

For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40-love, the player has a triple game point (triple <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game.

25|$|Water {{and steam}} based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the central {{system would be}} switched on when the temperature drops below the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.|$|E
