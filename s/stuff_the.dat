25|$|Each parish {{also had}} an assembly, where every parishioner was present and {{decisions}} were only taken unanimously.

He dealt with most matters since he was in contact with every parishioner. He meddled in conflicts and gave advice and comfort in various situations. Besides preaching and informing the priest was also a farmer himself, often a forerunner in the field. The priest did not always go the authority's errand, sometimes he tried to help his fellow parishioners fend off extra taxes and military services.|$|E
