40|$|A new mock {{circulatory system}} (MCS) was {{designed}} to evaluate and characterise the hydraulic performance of ventricular assist devices (VADs). The MCS consists of a preload section and a multipurpose afterload section, with an adjustable compliance chamber (C) and peripheral resistor (Rd as principal components. The MCS was connected to a pulse <b>duplicator</b> <b>system</b> for validation, simulating {{a wide range of}} afterload conditions. Both pressure and flow were measured, and the values of the different components calculated. The data perfectly fits a 4 -element electrical analogon (EA). The MCS was further used to assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of the Medos VAD {{as an example of a}} displacement pump. Data was measured for various MCS settings and at different pump rates, yielding device specific pump function graphs for water and pig blood. Our data demonstrate (i) flow sensitivity to preload and afterload and (ii) the effect of test fluid on hemodynamic performance. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Until today, {{the tissue}} {{engineering}} of the aortic heart valve {{is limited by}} the lack of an appropriate 3 D stentless scaold. The necessity of incorporating functional open-ing/closing behavior of the lea ets is of eminency for in vitro mechanical conditioning in obtaining tissue maturation and formation prior to implantation as well as proper func-tioning of the valve upon implantation. Therefore, a parameterized computer model is developed, enabling the user to create any desired valve geometry. From the computer model a mold of the aortic valve is designed for the purpose of electrospinning. In this study, an electrospun poly(-caprolactone) aortic valve scaold is produced and tested for its functional performance in a pulse <b>duplicator</b> <b>system.</b> Natural valve characteris-tics like the coaptation of the lea ets upon closing, where the physiological mechanical environments is approached, are obtained. 1 introduction Every year, 170. 000 aortic heart valve replacements are performed worldwide due to disease and or dysfunction.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to perform {{combined}} hydrodynamic and Doppler echocardiographic tests of the Omnicarbon 21 mm cardiac valve in aortic position in our Pulse <b>Duplicator</b> <b>System</b> for simultaneous assessment of valve performance and valve leakage data. During forward flow conditions, measured mean pressure gradients are between 4. 5 and 20. 2 mmHg (11. 9 +/- 4. 4 mmHg) for cardiac outputs between 3. 6 and 5. 3 l/min (4. 5 +/- 0. 4 l/min). Doppler-derived mean pressure gradients are between 2. 0 and 17. 0 mmHg (9. 3 +/- 3. 9 mmHg) for the same flow conditions. Effective Orifice area is 1. 31 +/- 0. 08 cm(2) and the performance index is 0. 74 +/- 0. 04, using the actual geometric orifice area, and 0. 38 +/- 0. 02, using the tissue annulus diameter, for a cardiac output of 4. 5 +/- 0. 4 l/min.

40|$|The high {{incidence}} of thromboembolic complications of mechanical heart valves (MHV) limits their success as permanent implants. The thrombogenicity of all MHV is primarily due to platelet activation by contact with foreign surfaces and by nonphysiological flow patterns. The latter include elevated flow stresses and regions of recirculation of blood that are induced by valve design characteristics. A numerical simulation of unsteady turbulent flow through a bileaflet MHV was conducted, using the Wilcox k–ω turbulence model for internal low-Reynolds-number flows, and compared to quantitative flow visualization performed in a pulse <b>duplicator</b> <b>system</b> using Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV). The wake of the valve leaflet during the deceleration phase revealed an intricate pattern of interacting shed vortices. Particle paths showed that platelets that {{were exposed to the}} highest flow stresses around the leaflets were entrapped within the shed vortices. Potentially activated, such platelets may tend to aggregate and form free emboli. Once formed, such free emboli would be convected downstream by the shed vortices, increasing the risk of systemic emboli...|$|R
5000|$|The {{very first}} DocuTech system, {{known as the}} DocuTech Production Publisher was {{announced}} on October 2, 1990. Its 135 page-per minute, black and white, xerographic print engine and attached finisher module were largely based on ones previously developed for the Xerox 5090 <b>Duplicator</b> <b>system</b> (announced by Xerox in 1988). However, image generation in the DocuTech was performed using a digitally driven, dual-beam, Laser ROS (Raster Output Scanner) {{rather than by the}} light-lens optics and exposure lamps found in the [...] "analog" [...] 5090 system. The system's scanner module allowed document scanning in a number of modes including manually from the platen or automatically using a 23 page-per-minute recirculating document feeder. The scanner also had a semi-automatic side feeder which could be used to scan large originals and computer fan-fold (CFF) input. The entire system was controlled by an electronic sub-system (ESS) of a proprietary Xerox design. The ESS incorporated a large number of Xerox proprietary Mesa processors which were specifically designed for high-speed image processing, 32 MegaBytes of RAM, I/O control interfaces for communicating with the Printer and Scanner modules, as well as 3 disk drives which contained system software and space for storing images (including those for saved jobs).|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous tissue {{engineering}} approaches to create heart valves {{have been limited}} by the structural immaturity and mechanical properties of the valve constructs. This study used an in vitro pulse <b>duplicator</b> <b>system</b> to provide a biomimetic environment during tissue formation to yield more mature implantable heart valves derived from autologous tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS: Trileaflet heart valves were fabricated from novel bioabsorbable polymers and sequentially seeded with autologous ovine myofibroblasts and endothelial cells. The constructs were grown for 14 days in a pulse <b>duplicator</b> in vitro <b>system</b> under gradually increasing flow and pressure conditions. By use of cardiopulmonary bypass, the native pulmonary leaflets were resected, and the valve constructs were implanted into 6 lambs (weight 19 +/- 2. 8 kg). All animals had uneventful postoperative courses, and the valves were explanted at 1 day and at 4, 6, 8, 16, and 20 weeks. Echocardiography demonstrated mobile functioning leaflets without stenosis, thrombus, or aneurysm up to 20 weeks. Histology (16 and 20 weeks) showed uniform layered cuspal tissue with endothelium. Environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed a confluent smooth valvular surface. Mechanical properties were {{comparable to those of}} native tissue at 20 weeks. Complete degradation of the polymers occurred by 8 weeks. Extracellular matrix content (collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and elastin) and DNA content increased to levels of native tissue and higher at 20 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates in vitro generation of implantable complete living heart valves based on a biomimetic flow culture system. These autologous tissue-engineered valves functioned up to 5 months and resembled normal heart valves in microstructure, mechanical properties, and extracellular matrix formation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic venous {{insufficiency}} (CVI) represents a major {{global health problem}} with increasing prevalence and morbidity. CVI is due to an incompetence of the venous valves, which causes venous reflux and distal venous hypertension. Several {{studies have focused on}} the replacement of diseased venous valves using xeno- and allogenic transplants, so far with moderate success due to immunologic and thromboembolic complications. Autologous cell-derived tissue-engineered venous valves (TEVVs) based on fully biodegradable scaffolds could overcome these limitations by providing non-immunogenic, non-thrombogenic constructs with remodeling and growth potential. Methods: Tri- and bicuspid venous valves (n= 27) based on polyglycolic acid-poly- 4 -hydroxybutyrate composite scaffolds, integrated into self-expandable nitinol stents, were engineered from autologous ovine bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and endothelialized. After in vitro conditioning in a (flow) pulse <b>duplicator</b> <b>system,</b> the TEVVs were crimped (n= 18) and experimentally delivered (n= 7). The effects of crimping on the tissue-engineered constructs were investigated using histology, immunohistochemistry, scanning electron microscopy, grating interferometry (GI), and planar fluorescence reflectance imaging. Results: The generated TEVVs showed layered tissue formation with increasing collagen and glycosaminoglycan levels dependent on the duration of in vitro conditioning. After crimping no effects were found on the MSC level in scanning electron microscopy analysis, GI, histology, and extracellular matrix analysis. However, substantial endothelial cell loss was detected after the crimping procedure, which could be reduced by increasing the static conditioning phase. Conclusions: Autologous living small-diameter TEVVs can be successfully fabricated from ovine BM-MSCs using a (flow) pulse duplicator conditioning approach. These constructs hold the potential to overcome the limitations of currently used non-autologous replacement materials and may open new therapeutic concepts for the treatment of CVI in the future...|$|R
40|$|Background-: A novel concept {{providing}} prenatally tissue engineered human autologous {{heart valves}} based on routinely obtained fetal amniotic fluid progenitors as single cell source is introduced. Methods and Results-: Fetal human amniotic progenitors were isolated from routinely sampled amniotic fluid and sorted using CD 133 magnetic beads. After expansion and differentiation, cell phenotypes of CD 133 - and CD 133 + cells {{were analyzed by}} immunohistochemistry and flowcytometry. After characterization, CD 133 - derived cells were seeded onto heart valve leaflet scaffolds (n= 18) fabricated from rapidly biodegradable polymers, conditioned in a pulse <b>duplicator</b> <b>system,</b> and subsequently coated with CD 133 + derived cells. After in vitro maturation, opening and closing behavior of leaflets was investigated. Neo-tissues were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Extracellular matrix (ECM) elements and cell numbers were quantified biochemically. Mechanical properties were assessed by tensile testing. CD 133 - derived cells demonstrated characteristics of mesenchymal progenitors expressing CD 44 and CD 105. Differentiated CD 133 + cells showed features of functional endothelial cells by eNOS and CD 141 expression. Engineered heart valve leaflets demonstrated endothelialized tissue formation with production of ECM elements (GAG 80 %, HYP 5 %, cell number 100 % of native values). SEM showed intact endothelial surfaces. Opening and closing behavior was sufficient under half of systemic conditions. Conclusions-: The use of amniotic fluid as single cell source is a promising low-risk approach enabling the prenatal fabrication of heart valves ready to use at birth. These living replacements with the potential of growth, remodeling, and regeneration may realize the early repair of congenital malformations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Stent {{mounting}} of a porcine {{aortic valve}} induces loss of mobility {{and reduces the}} effective orifice area. Any stentless design conserves {{the flexibility of the}} valvular apparatus, but unfortunately, these valves require a more elaborate implantation technique which is considered a major drawback by many surgeons. In an attempt to see if the insertion of the Toronto SPV stentless valve could be made easier, we altered the configuration by lowering the profile at the depth of both coronary sinuses. Theoretically, this could enable insertion of the valve by a single suture layer under the two coronary ostia, in addition to some fixation points at the commissures. METHODS: Two modified 20 mm Toronto SPV valves were tested in vitro for hydrodynamics in a computer-controlled pulse <b>duplicator</b> <b>system</b> and compared with two standard 20 mm valves. Animal implant studies using three standard versus three modified valves (21, 23 and 25 mm) were conducted in juvenile sheep for durability and biocompatibility over a period of three months. RESULTS: The standard Toronto SPV valve provided excellent hemodynamics. The altered configuration performed less optimally during hydrodynamic testing with increased transvalvular gradients. In animal implant studies, cusps adjacent to all reduced-height sinuses showed markedly accelerated fibrosis and substantial calcification, in contrast to only mild fibrosis on the inflow aspects of the standard leaflets. CONCLUSIONS: The more pronounced the deformation of the stentless valve, the faster the calcification of the leaflets adjacent to the distorted sinuses. As both valves types were prepared using an identical preservation technique, the role of loss of mobility in leading to early failure is clearly demonstrated. These findings also underline the extreme importance of correct implantation technique for all stentless valves in order to prevent degeneration. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Björk-Shiley (BScc) {{mechanical}} {{heart valve}} has extensively {{been used in}} surgery from 1979 to 1986. There is, compared with equivalent valve types, increased occurrence of unexpected mechanical failure of the outlet strut of the valve, with {{a high incidence of}} mortality, when it occurs. Many approaches have been attempted to noninvasively determine BScc valve integrity. None of the approaches resulted in adequate assessment, mostly {{due to a lack of}} either sensitivity or specificity demonstrated in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. In our study we analyze leg movement of the BScc valves outlet strut during the cardiac cycle with ultrasound. For a broken strut, the movement of both legs will be significantly different, whereas the difference will be negligible for an intact strut. BScc valves were mounted in the mitral position in an in vitro pulse <b>duplicator</b> <b>system.</b> A focused single-element transducer was used to direct ultrasound on a leg of the outlet strut. Correlation-based time delay estimation was used to estimate differences in time of flight of the outlet strut echoes to determine outlet strut leg movement. The movement of an intact valve and a valve with a single-leg fracture with both ends grating against each other (SLF), the most difficult fracture to diagnose, has been studied. The results showed no significant difference in movement between both legs of the outlet strut of the intact BScc valve (amplitude of movement 9. 2 µm ± 0. 1 µm). Whereas for the defective valve, the amplitude of movement of the broken leg of the SLF valve was 12 µm ± 1. 6 µm vs. 8. 6 µm ± 0. 1 µm for the intact leg. In conclusion, the proposed method has shown to be feasible in vitro and has potentials for in vivo detection of BScc valve outlet strut fracture...|$|R

No presente estudo, foi avaliado o desempenho hidrodinámico de biopróteses de pericárdio bovino (Biopro-PB-Braile Biomédica) comparativamente às válvulas porcinas (Biopro-PP-Braile Biomédica) através do gradiente médio transvalvular. Os testes hidrodinámicos foram realizados em próteses de diâmetros variando de 19 a 35 mm, submetidas ao Sistema Duplicador de Pulsos Shelhigh (Shelhigh Inc.). O volume de ejeção foi mantido constante em 90 ml, com freqüência de pulso de 60, 70, 80, 90 e 100 ciclos por minuto, possibilitando fluxos entre 5 e 9 litros por minuto, equivalentes a fluxos contínuos aproximados de 8 a 18 litros por minuto. Houve tendência à diminuição dos gradientes pressóricos à medida em que aumenta o diâmetro externo das próteses.

In this study, the hydrodynamic performance of bovine pericardial bioprostheses (Biopro-BP-Braile Biomedica) was evaluated comparatively to porcine valves (Biopro-PP-Braile Biomedica), through the transvalvular medium gradient. The hydrodynamic tests were made on prostheses varying from 19 to 35 mm in diameter, which underwent the pulse <b>duplicator</b> <b>system</b> Shelhigh (Shelligh Inc.). The ejection volume was constantly kept at 90 ml. The pulse frequencies varied between 60 and 100 cycles per minute, allowing flows between 5 and 9 liters per minute, equivalent to approximate continuos flows of 8 to 18 liters per minute. There was tendency to decrease the gradients, in proportion to increase of the bioprostheses external diameters. The medium pressure gradient found in the bovine pericardial prostheses was significantly smaller than that in the porcine prostheses (p< 0. 01), for all diameters studied. Respecting the large variability of protocols of tests in the literature for hydrodynamic evaluation of valve prostheses, the necessity of standard tests becomes stronger, seeking adequate comparison among the several valves...|$|R
