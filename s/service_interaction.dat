30|$|Regarding the {{consequences}} of (<b>service)</b> <b>interaction</b> quality, scholars have asserted that interaction quality between the frontline service employee and the customer {{to be the most}} important determinant of customers’ perceptions of service quality [20, 25, 26]. In relation to customer loyalty, prior studies have found that customer’s perception of the excellence of face-to-face interaction (i.e. interaction quality) with the service provider is one of the strongest determinants of loyalty [27, 28]. Moreover, Lloyd and Luk [29] review literature and show that <b>service</b> <b>interaction</b> leads to customer satisfaction and positive WOM [22, 30].

40|$|Abstract. In Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs), {{software}} {{systems are}} decomposed into independent units, namely services, that interact {{with one another}} through message exchanges. To promote reuse and evolvability, these interactions are explicitly described right from the early phases of the development lifecycle. Up to now, emphasis has been placed on capturing structural aspects of <b>service</b> <b>interactions.</b> Gradually though, the description of behavioral dependencies between <b>service</b> <b>interactions</b> is gaining increasing attention as a means to push forward the SOA vision. This paper deals with the description of these behavioral dependencies during the analysis and design phases. The paper outlines a set of requirements that a language for modeling <b>service</b> <b>interactions</b> at this level should fulfill, and proposes a language whose design is driven by these requirements. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss a model-based {{approach}} to the analysis of <b>service</b> <b>interactions</b> for coordinated web service compositions using obligation policies specified in the form of Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) and implemented in the Web Service Choreography Description Language (WS-CDL). The approach uses finite state machine representations of web service compositions (implemented in BPEL 4 WS) and service choreography rules, and assigns semantics to the distributed process interactions. The move towards implementing web service choreography requires design time verification of these <b>service</b> <b>interactions</b> to ensure that service implementations fulfill requirements for multiple interested partners before such compositions and choreographies are deployed. The described approach is supported by a suite of cooperating tools for specification, formal modeling, animation and providing verification results from choreographed web <b>service</b> <b>interactions.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} growth of Web {{services}} on the Internet, the atomic Web services as nodes and their functionality dependency relationships as edges form a complex Web service network.

In this paper, we propose a model which is able to generate two types of Web <b>service</b> <b>interaction</b> networks, namely complementary Web <b>service</b> <b>interaction</b> network (CWSIN) and similar Web <b>service</b> <b>interaction</b> network (SWSIN).

40|$|Abstract. Web <b>service</b> <b>interactions</b> have {{triggered}} {{the initiative to}} identify and solve mismatches from a behavioral aspect. However, current approaches are limited because they mainly focus on control-flow and largely ignore data-flow. Such ignorance may cause unexpected or wrong, even unsupported interactions. To address these problems, we propose a scenario-view based approach, which considers both control-flow and data-flow, to support Web <b>service</b> <b>interactions.</b> We firstly generate scenarios and views for describing a public process. Then, the degree of compatibility of two public processes is computed based on pairwise compatibility of their views. A process mediator is generated for compatible public processes, and thus an interaction is carried out despite mismatches exist among them. This novel approach will benefit service modelers and users not only for {{a better understanding of}} public processes, but also for improved capability to identify and solve mismatches, which will further facilitate Web <b>service</b> <b>interactions...</b>|$|R
