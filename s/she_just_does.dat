5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
500|$|With Lisa {{now facing}} a long jail sentence, Marge decides {{to help her}} out. She starts reading Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species and becomes {{addicted}} to it. When the trial resumes, Marge tells Lisa that she now knows a way that she can help her. While Ned is being cross-examined by Clarice, Marge gives Homer a cold beer. Homer, ecstatic at getting a beer, tries to open it unsuccessfully. The more he tries, the more primitive he gets, hooting and banging the bottle on the bench, disrupting the trial. Finally, Ned loses his cool and refers to Homer as a [...] "big monkey-faced gorilla." [...] Clarice then asks Ned to compare {{the picture of the}} [...] "missing link" [...] and Homer shaking the beer over his head, and asks if he truthfully believes Homer cannot be related to apes. Ned cannot and concedes victory to Lisa. Lisa kindly tells Ned that she fully respects religious beliefs, but <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not think it is proper for the church to dominate the school, the same way that Mr. Flanders and Reverend Lovejoy do not want scientists taking over the church. Ned agrees and offers to take Lisa and his kids out for ice cream.|$|E
2500|$|Bree's {{return in}} November 2013 saw her {{arriving}} to see Brooke in what Blampied described as, [...] "her time of need". Bree returned to Ferndale after Brooke fell ill and required a kidney transplant. Blampied {{believed that there}} was genuine feelings between the sisters, [...] "she really does care for Brooke {{but at the same}} time, she is self-preserving. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> things in strange ways." ...|$|E

5000|$|At an interview, Paul Clarke, Australia's head of {{delegation}} to the Eurovision Song Contest, {{was asked about the}} potential of Im's performance at the contest. Clarke remarked that Im's journey as a migrant to Australia at the age of nine and learning English from songs of Kylie Minogue was conducive to the multiculturalism and diversity of the European competition. Clarke adds that [...] "Im is also a lightning rod of emotion when she performs", which is something he believes will resonate with the Eurovision audience. He further notes that [...] "She can just feel an audience and be able to be the conductor of it, better than just about any performer I've ever seen, <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> it intuitively." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The more a {{thing is}} stereotyped to death, the more {{refreshing}} it is to encounter the skilled reaffirmation of its ideal. With Guatemala-born, L.A.-based Gaby Moreno (October 9, McRaney's Tavern), it's the female singer-songwriter form that she has rescued from the abyss of cliché. She doesn't radically change its rules or anything - <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> {{it with a little}} more flavor and a lot more skill. And that's what separates her from typical coffeehouse fare. With an exceptionally rich and assured voice, and a palette that spans Latin, blues, folk, jazz and pop, she's a marquee talent. Her singing is effortlessly bright with purpose and not just a display of ostentatious acrobatics. In fact, there's something very classic about her expression. In her voice, the flame of the female greats is alive." [...] -Orlando Weekly ...|$|E

50|$|Again Bertha escapes to the Continent, {{again with}} her aunt, {{this time to}} Rome (while Edward Craddock has not once in his life been abroad). Claiming that her {{delicate}} health demands spending the winter in a warm climate, she is back in London in the following spring after having enjoyed six months of freedom but now must face reality again and no longer delay her return to her husband. This is when 19-year-old Gerald Vaudrey, a cousin of hers she has never met before, enters her life. Gerald, handsome and still looking like a schoolboy, is to stay in London {{for a couple of}} weeks to wait for his passage to the United States, where he has been assigned to go by his parents as a punishment for his misdemeanours. Visiting his—and Bertha's - aunt, he is introduced to his cousin at Mary Ley's flat, and from the moment they first set eyes on each other Bertha and Gerald are curiously attracted to each other. They go off almost every day exploring the sights of London, and 26-year-old Bertha, unable as well as unwilling to face the facts, feels flattered by the youth's many attentions. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not really want to believe that Gerald has been expelled from his parental home after seducing the maid; she refuses to see a womaniser in Gerald and, although she tries hard to resist her feelings, genuinely falls in love with the boy.|$|E
5000|$|Rater {{intended}} {{the theme of}} the episode to be [...] "paranoia", elaborating: [...] "After Richard dropped the bomb that the hospital would be merging with Mercy West, we knew that this episode would have to deal with people's paranoia. Because merger means change. And change means fear. And the worst kind of fear is the kind that lives in your head. The dark thoughts. The paranoia. The worst case scenarios that you play out that usually don't come true. And with Richard holing himself up inside his office, it's just a breeding ground for rumor, fear and paranoia. So, when we started talking about this episode, the theme of paranoia emerged pretty quickly." [...] All storylines in the episode were inspired by Rater's friend base, including the story on schizophrenia. She offered her insight: [...] "My inspiration for the story of Tom and Jodie came from a kid I knew growing up named Jon. I babysat for him. His mom, Barbara and my mom are friends. We went on vacations with their family. And he grew up and became a paranoid schizophrenic. My mom recently told me a story that when Jon (who’s now 30) needs a haircut, Barbara is unavailable all day for golf or bridge because she never knows {{how long it will take}} for Jon to find a barber shop he’s okay with. She has to drive from barbershop to barbershop, waiting for him to get a 'good feeling' about one. It might happen right away, it might take all day. And she's patient and kind and <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> it because she's his mother. I was really moved when my mom told me this story because I know these people and I know how painful this has been for her but how she just handles it, with dignity and humor. I can just picture the scene in the car as she pulls up to yet another one, [...] "Well, Jon?" [...] I can totally see her trying to talk him into giving one a try. And I can see him wanting to do it, to please her, but ultimately being too afraid and telling her they have to try another one. I can just picture the front seat of that car, so full of love and disappointment and fear as they negotiate this very mundane thing that for them has become anything but mundane. Then the story became what it became, with Tom choking Lexie, and falling down the stairs creating a real dilemma for Jodie. And the idea of Bailey pricking her finger to show Tom that she's human, she's a mother and she's a doctor and she's human, that idea came from Krista Vernoff, but the original inspiration was the complicated love that I've witnessed between these family friends."

And when it's the guy <b>doing</b> everything <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> in the previous scenes, it becomes all too familiar—which is Beyoncé's point." ...|$|R

Although his friend's mother and stepfather, who had six other children between them, were reluctant at first, they took him in within a few months.
