2500|$|Since {{structural}} columns {{are commonly}} of intermediate length, the Euler formula has little practical application for ordinary design. Issues that cause {{deviation from the}} pure Euler column behaviour include imperfections in geometry of the column in combination with plasticity/non-linear <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> behaviour of the column's material. Consequently, a number of empirical column formulae have been developed that agree with test data, all of which embody the slenderness ratio. Due to the uncertainty {{in the behavior of}} columns, for design, appropriate safety factors are introduced into these formulae. One such formula is the Perry Robertson formula which estimates the critical buckling load based on an assumed small initial curvature, hence an eccentricity of the axial load. The Rankine Gordon formula (Named for William John Macquorn Rankine and Perry Hugesworth Gordon (1899 [...] 1966)) is also based on experimental results and suggests that a column will buckle at a load Fmax given by: ...|$|E
2500|$|Whereas the Cauchy {{stress tensor}} [...] relates {{stresses}} {{in the current}} configuration, the deformation gradient and strain tensors are described by relating the motion to the reference configuration; thus not all tensors describing {{the state of the}} material are in either the reference or current configuration. Describing the <b>stress,</b> <b>strain</b> and deformation either in the reference or current configuration would make it easier to define constitutive models (for example, the Cauchy Stress tensor is variant to a pure rotation, while the deformation strain tensor is invariant; thus creating problems in defining a constitutive model that relates a varying tensor, in terms of an invariant one during pure rotation; as by definition constitutive models have to be invariant to pure rotations).

40|$|To {{account for}} phenomenological {{theories}} {{and a set}} of invariants, <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> are usually decomposed into a pair of pressure and deviatoric stress and a pair of volumetric strain and deviatoric strain. However, the conventional decomposition method only focuses on individual <b>stress</b> and <b>strain,</b> so that cannot be directly applied to either formulation in Finite Element Method (FEM) or Boundary Element Method (BEM). In this paper, a simpler, more general, and widely applicable decomposition is suggested. A new decomposition method adopts multiplying decomposition tensors or matrices to not only <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> but also constitutive and compliance relation.

The elastic <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> {{fields in}} a {{circular}} cross-section bar with semielliptic groove subjected to uniaxial tension are systematically investigated using the finite element method.

The relation between the <b>stress</b> and the <b>strain</b> concentration factors depends on Poisson’s ratio and the groove’s geometric configuration. The coupled influences of the shape factor of the semielliptic groove and the relative depth of the groove on the <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> concentrations are examined.

40|$|Variations of <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> are {{commonly}} expressed by patterns of <b>stress</b> or <b>strain</b> trajectories: three mutually orthogonal families of continuous lines, parallel to maximum, intermediate and minimum <b>stress</b> or <b>strain</b> axes. It might {{be assumed that}} there are equivalent continuous principal surfaces of <b>stress</b> or <b>strain,</b> for any state of continuously varying <b>stress</b> or <b>strain.</b> We demonstrate that this will not generally be the case for three-dimensionally varying states of <b>stress</b> or <b>strain.</b> Whether or not principal surfaces of <b>stress</b> or <b>strain</b> exist is governed by the abnormality of the vector field of principal trajectories. We consider the Z vector fields for examples of many types of three-dimensional heterogeneous deformation, and show {{that most of these}} do not lead to definable principal XY strain surfaces. An alternative geometric test is presented, termed the continuity loop, for simply demonstrating the existence (or not) of principal surfaces, using geometrical and orientational information. It is important to the understanding of geological structures to know which kinds of heterogeneous deformation give rise to principal surfaces of <b>stress</b> or <b>strain.</b> We conclude with examples of structures which might be indicative of the absence of continuous principal surfaces of stress (segmented faults, echelon veins and dykes), a discussion of the implication for strain fabrics and foliations, and a warning that foliation trace trajectories on maps or sections may not necessarily indicate the existence of real foliation surfaces in three dimensions...|$|R

40|$|Accurate <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> {{calculations}} at a notch usually {{require a}} non-linear {{finite element analysis}} when local yielding has occurred. The strain energy density hypothesis is a method to predict these <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> values. This method proposes that the plastic strain energy density {{is equivalent to the}} strain energy density found assuming the material to be entirely elastic. This hypothesis was evaluated using the finite element method, which was tested by comparing to exact solutions of elastic and elasto-plastic problems, to calculate the <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> field for two notched plates of varying widths under elasto-plastic loading. For both geometries, a plane <b>stress</b> and plane <b>strain</b> analysis was performed. The elasto-plastic strain energy density from the finite element method was found to be greater than that predicted by this proposal, which in turn resulted in under-predicting the local <b>stresses</b> and <b>strains.</b> This difference was greater for the plane stress condition than for the plane strain condition. Comparisons were also made with notch stresses based the Neuber method. The two methods appear to give an upper and lower bound to the actual <b>stresses</b> and <b>strains.</b> By combining the results of the strain energy density method and the Neuber method, reasonably accurate estimates of <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> values can be obtained.
