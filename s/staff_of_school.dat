50|$|This {{approach}} {{was introduced by}} alternative schools established in the early 1990s. These schools were founded {{with the aim of}} providing education satisfying the individual needs of children coming from an underprivileged social background and being unable to manage in a traditional school. According to the philosophy common to these models problems can most clearly be seen by a person who directly experience them at school. However, difficulties may also result from this situation, since it is not simple to represent a family against the school or the staff while being employed by that very school. Nevertheless, such schools have been employing school social workers up to this day. At some schools this practice goes back fifteen years. Success of the model is presumably due to the philosophy that the staff is involved in handling problems that pupils face outside school and that teachers have a supporting attitude toward pupils in class. In these schools educational and social work overlap. According to the educational concept the <b>staff</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> relies heavily on utilizing social expertise in educational work. Furthermore, in schools like these (e.g. Burattino, Gandhi Gimnázium, Belvárosi Tanoda, Zöld Kakas Líceum) pupils are facing deep social problems, thus school social work could survive here even when traditional schools ceased to offer or altered this service to a great extent. Therefore, both the need emerged among the pupils and educational-academic mission of the alternative schools legitimized the role of the school social worker.|$|E

Professor, Department of Preventive Medicine, {{faculty of}} Public Health, Kaunas University of Medicine Aim of study. To {{evaluate}} {{the need of}} health care services in the secondary schools of Alytus. Objectives: 1. 	To assess the health and health behavioral problems in school-aged children. 2. 	To evaluate the attitudes of parents to the need of health care services at the secondary schools. 3. 	To evaluate the attitudes of staff of health care services at school about the provision of health care services in school settings. Methods. Questionnaire survey {{was carried out in}} parents of school-aged children of 3 rd, 7 th and 11 th grades at the secondary schools in Alytus town in 2004. 216 respondents were selected for the study, 161 (74. 5 %) of them have filled in the questionnaire forms (response rate – 74. 5 %). A set of questions was addressed to parents in order to clarify parents’ attitudes about the health care services at schools. Also another questionnaire was developed for health care specialists of secondary schools: 9 from 12 have responded (75. 0 %). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 10; criterion and p< 0. 05 confidence level was used for comparison between the variables. Results. Health care services were provided for students at all 18 secondary schools in Alytus. 12 health care specialists were conducting their duties in these school settings. Average distribution was 1086 students per one staff member of school health service in town. Questionnaire survey data of parents showed that according the opinion of 31. 1 % of respondents the health of students was satisfactory or fair. Health of older students (11 th form) was worse (p< 0. 05) than in younger age group (3 rd form). The most common health problems mentioned by parents were: tired ness (53. 4 %), nutrition problems (51, 6 %), sleep (41. 0 %), physical activity (29, 8 %), communication 19. 9 %, smoking (8. 7 %), alcohol (4. 3 %) and drug abuse (1. 2 %). 92, 5 % of respondents pointed out that school health case services are essential at schools. 96. 3 % of parents expect provision of emergency and first aid services, 65, 8 % of disease prevention, 64. 4 % - health promotion, 64. 6 % - provision of personal hygiene, environmental control, 62. 7 % health monitoring at school (55. 3 %). Questionnaire survey of <b>staff</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> health care services has indicated that they are lacking knowledge and skills in health program planning (55. 6 %), nutrition management (55. 6 %), work with special risk groups (44. 4 %), in conducting statistical comparative analysis of students health (44. 4 %), family planning (44. 4 %), personality empowerment and education (33. 3 %). Conclusions: 1. 	Health of school-aged children was not favorable by opinion of parents and health care professionals of school health services. Behavioral health problems (such as sleep problems, tiredness, unbalanced nutrition, physical activity problems, substance abuse) constitute a threat for health career. 2. 	Majority of parents has evaluated actual provision health care services and need to continue these services at school positively. 3. 	<b>Staff</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> health care services is not introduced and trained sufficiently in relatively new their competency areas such as health promotion and disease prevention, planning of health programs at school...|$|E

(1998) {{state that}} "Development cannot be forced {{because it is}} the teacher who {{develops}} (active) and not the teacher who is developed (passive) ". Active teacher participation in professional development programmes will result in greater school improvement and teacher empowerment. The study is based on the parameter that if the teachers have no real input in the planning stage of the development programmes, such development programmes are likely to be ineffective. This study seeks to investigate whether these school-based professional development activities help teachers to teach effectively or make the school efficient. The study aims to investigate the perceptions of teachers {{and the role of the}} school managers regarding the value and usefulness of school-based teacher professional development programmes in school X. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used and data was collected through semi-structured interviews with members of the school management and questionnaires with educators. The investigation was limited to the data obtained from all the questionnaires and interviews that were responded to by the entire academic <b>staff</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> X. The findings are based on data collected only from the interviews and questionnaires. The findings of the study showed diverse views towards the current form of school-based professional development programmes. There were however all encompassing parameters that can be summed up basically as follows: Both educators and school management regard school-based professional development as important aspects of teaching to improve educator performance. Development programmes should become an integral part of schooling and an official policy should be established in this regard. Development programmes have to be a continuous process and should be related to the subject taught be relevant and practical. Subject knowledge and teaching methods should be improved for effective teaching and learning to take place. Professional development programmes should be evaluated to determine whether meaningful outcomes have been achieved or not, and continuous feedback should be given to educators...|$|E

The theoretical part discusses the conceptual basis of private education, highlights emerging {{issues and the}} principles which direct how private schools operate. Next, I present the different private schools in Slovenia, the specific teaching methods and focus, describe their pedagogical and educational orientation, their view on the developmental stage of the child, the teacher's role, cooperation with parents and their educational goals. In the empirical part, I present a qualitative analysis based on five interviews with management <b>staff</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> {{in an attempt to}} present a comprehensive overview of the work and goals of private primary schools in Slovenia. Results are presented in several sections dedicated to specific topics: the foundation, the purpose of the establishment of the school, goals of private primary school, uniqueness of the school, the role of the teacher, the motives of the parents, parental involvement with the school, social diversity and tuition fees, ensuring enrolment and the aspect of the school’s future activities. The purpose of establishment of private schools and their goals are reflected in different pedagogical approaches or other educational approaches of interest to parents. The specific nature of different private schools is reflected in their curricula, working methods and educational approaches. Teachers in private schools their education expand their knowledge of pedagogical approaches the school represents, or by accepting the religious inclination the school, if such inclination exists. The motives of the parents in enrollment are different, leading the desire for education of their children under the approaches that schools offer. Cooperation with the school is not mandatory, but parental involvement is substantial in the schools’ opinion. The tuition fee varies both between schools and between pupils of the same school. Promotion of school mostly spread through word of mouth among parents, schools do not make use of advertising. The development of schools in the future, as reported by heads of schools, is associated with the continuation of the educational goal, some by upgrading secondary education, much of them highlighting the current unequal regulation of co-financing of private schools and emphasize that they want, with education they offer, to enrich and {{contribute to the development of}} education in Slovenia. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The {{purpose of this study}} was to collect information about the conditions, opportunities, problems and needs of teachers at the beginning of their career and to assist in the development of services to them. National Survey of Teachers in Their First Year of Service, 1966 - 1967 (SN: 66031, 66032, 66033, 67032, 67033) This group of surveys serves both as a demographic study of probationary teachers and as a longitudinal study in which characteristics of the teachers at the beginning and at the end of the year were related to each other and to characteristics of the school and of the employing authority. It covers seven main areas: probationary background and training; their distribution; appointment and placement; in-service guidance; probationers in the classroom; in the school community; outside school; and career intentions. Arising from findings of this group of surveys, a further research and development project was undertaken by the University of Bristol to investigate the needs, problems, and advantages associated with the mounting of in-service courses for probationers. The data from this project are held as SN: 14 Probationary Teachers, 1968 - 1969 and SN: 15 Probationary Teachers, 1969 - 1970. The phasing of the enquiry followed the timetable: Spring 1966 : Survey of Directors of Education in the 162 LEA's in England and Wales (SN: 66031) June 1966 : Survey of Head Teachers (SN: 66032) Sept 1966 : First survey of probationers (SN: 66033) March 1967 : Oral interviews with sub-sample of probationers (SN: 67032) May 1967 : Follow-up questionnaire to probationers who responded to first questionnaire (SN: 67033) SN: 14 includes two questionnaires (A 1 and B 1) distributed to probationers in one rural and three urban areas in July 1969. These probationers had completed their probationary year and had experienced only traditional forms of in-service guidance; they formed a control group for the project. SN: 15 includes nine questionnaires, distributed between September 1969 and July 1970 in conjunction with a series of project-organized induction courses and discussion meetings. The questionnaires were administered according to the following timetable: Sept 1969 : Questionnaire A 2 and B 2 to all probationers Sept-Oct 1969 : Questionnaire C 1 to those attending induction conference Oct-Dec 1969 : Questionnaire C 2 to those attending discussion meetings Jan-June 1970 : Questionnaire C 3 to those at optional topics courses July 1970 : Questionnaire C 4 to those at overview conference July 1970 : Questionnaire C 5 to all probationers July 1970 : Questionnaire A 3 to all probationers (Questionnaire A 1, A 2 and A 3 were essentially identical, B 1, B 2 and B 3 completely identical.) The questionnaires therefore measured both response to various course programmes and discussion meetings, and the overall effect of such courses on the professional judgements, opinions and actions of probationary teachers. Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions In this first questionnaire submitted to probationary teachers (see SN: 67033 for second follow-up questionnaire), information is obtained in five major categories: 1. Appointment and Placement: whether application for present post was to LEA, to the particular school or post; degree of satisfaction felt with processing of application and placement; whether choice of particular school was offered by LEA; month and year of initial application; of notification of success of application and of notification of placement in particular school; whether probationer invited to visit school soon after appointment confirmed; if visit took place; whether expenses reimbursed and what was seen during first visit to school; date by which probationer was notified of age and ability level of children to be taught, and of relevant syllabus and/or schemes of work to be used; whether probationer was given opportunity to work in present school in preceding term and, if so, whether paid for such work and during subsequent vacation period; factors which influenced choice of LEA or school; and finally whether probationer is working with an age-range for which not specifically trained and, if so, why this is so. 2. Guidance for Teachers During Their First Year of Service: whether probationer invited to attend special induction course in area before start of term and, if so, whether probationer attended; awareness of any other organised discussions or lectures or courses for teachers in area and whether probationer has attended or will attend such courses; and whether any such courses are specifically designed for young or probationary teachers. 3. Teaching Data: composition by sex of classes in which most of teaching time is spent, as well as general ability level or stream of such classes and whether any classes for which probationer is responsible are for backward or ESN children; number of children in class; number of hours of teaching time per week and hours as 'free periods' in work; whether probationer supervises any out-of-school activities and whether as result of own suggestion or at request of school; proportion of time spent (in secondary school) teaching principal subject/s, in classes directed towards external examination and in 6 th form work; amount of freedom given probationer to work at own pace or with own emphasis; whether teaching in purpose-built or make-shift classroom; relationship of present teaching methods to those advocated by College or Department during training, and reasons for changes if any; relationship of probationer's methods to those of colleagues; whether working with any organisational scheme of which probationer has little or no previous knowledge (ITA, teaching machines, Nuffield Science, streamed classes, CSE Mode 3, etc.); whether probationer told of rules and conventions governing life at school; attitude of probationer towards amenities provided for his use and towards lack of amenities which impair efficiency of teaching. 4. The School Community: composition of <b>staff</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> by sex; provision of staff-room and lockers; whether staff-rooms segregated by sex; individual preference for single-sex or mixed staff-room; relationship of teaching atmosphere in school with expectations built up during training; attitude to general standards of teaching in school and to friendliness of other staff; whether attendance at full staff-meeting possible; people with whom probationer has discussed problems of teaching; whether specific teacher has been deputised by Head to provide advice and whether this advice considered sufficient. 5. Personal Data: general background and personal data includes: LEA; type and identification of school; age; sex and marital status of probationer; whether spouse or fiance/e is teacher; father's occupation; whether any member of immediate family is or has been a teacher; whether teaching was first choice of career; whether any youth work done before; educational background, with dates and details, as well as teaching and general employment background; whether lived at home during training; present living arrangements; whether assistance in finding accommodation offered by LEA; travel time to school in morning; general attitude to present area; to area where trained or home area and to friends from that period; amount of leisure time available now in relation to previous year; whether any leisure activities abandoned because of lack of time and, finally, probationer's initial reaction to first two weeks as professional teacher...|$|E
40|$|Summary:Semper Progrediens:A {{story of}} the coming of age of {{education}} in Sint Maarten (1954  2000) Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Marc Depaepe. Co-supervisor: Dr. Maria Van EnckevortThis research has two main objectives. First, it maps out the development of national primary education in St. Maarten between 1954 and 2000. Second, it seeks {{to tap into the}} experience of the protagonists of said development, giving them a voice in the recording of their own history. This research is based on both written and oral history. Therefore, the information used to meet the research objectives was gathered through the collection of primary written sources; the study of secondary written materials; but also interviews and meetings with relevant educational agents, who represent the <b>staff</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> administration, school management, teaching personnel, former pupils but also parents. In order to gather this material, we conducted field research on St. Maarten between September 2005 and December 2006. The research carried out was to describe the overall framework of education in St. Maarten. This included school management, teachers as well as students within the juridical space of the Kingdom of the Netherlands at large. In this framework the Kingdoms Statute and the federal Regulations of the Dutch Antilles established a system within which competencies and taskswere assigned and responsibilities were demarcated. We further documented how the rules, regulations and resources were applied at the island level. We documented the start and/or development of schools within educational networks. By means of interviews, meetings and responses to a questionnaire, we tapped into the experience of the individual protagonists of mostly primary education on the Island between 1954 and 2000. Through these efforts, we were able to voiced postcolonial subjects, who have often been by-passed or forgotten by mosttraditional historians and in a sense, rendered voiceless. In Part One, we speak about the Dutch Antilles in general and St. Maarten in particular. We discussed the effects of slavery and its consequences afterwards. Both before and after the restructuration of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954, education was essentially shaped by the different religious denominations on the Island. Over time, St. Maartens schooling system developed from an almost non-existing entity to a well-structured one. Moreover, the structure it adopted closely resembled the education framework in the Netherlands, its former colonial ruler. It did this despite St. Maartens geographical situation (i. e. in the Caribbean) and that fact that its main language is not Dutch, but English. Even So, our study has shown that the Netherlands did not significantly determine the content of the curriculum. Infact, another Caribbean island, Curaçao, has affected St. Maartens education far more than the Netherlands or the Kingdom. As a result, St. Maarten presents a mixed educational landscape. Our sources indicate that the Statute of 1954 as well as the dismantling of the Antilles in 2010 were turning points for St. Maarten, but not necessarily critical moments. Part Two reflects the respondents reactions to several issues concerning education in St. Maarten. Although the Statute allowed for modifications, the Dutch educational system was embedded inSt. Maarten through Curaçao. Although both students and teachers longed for St. Maarten-related curricular contents, the input of Curaçao was dominant. It was only after local St. Maarten students became teachers that topics about St. Maarten found their place in the curriculum. Even though it took some time to integrate integration about St. Maarten in the curriculum, based on our interviews and questionnaires, we discovered that the people of St. Maarten did not (and still do not) have the feeling that education has let them down. It is probably only now that people are beginning to question whether and to which extent schools are able to positively influence young people. In the past, they believed that schooling however foreign its curriculum may have been at time did actually help them to find a niche in the world. The Coat of Arms of St. Maarten summarizes our findings about the development of education on the Dutch Island half: Semper pro Grediens  Always progressing.
