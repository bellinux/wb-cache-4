40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the coupling resonance conditions of the tyre, cavity and rim with the attachment of trim layers on the inner surface of tyre to mitigate the resonance effect. In order to validate the mathematical formulation, finite element analysis and experimental modal testing were performed to determine the frequency response function (FRF) for a tyre-wheel assembly with and without the trim layers {{as well as for}} <b>separated</b> <b>tyre</b> and rim. It was found that the resonance magnitude has been reduced when the trim layers were added. Couplings of cavity resonance to the tyre and rim were plausible due to the proximity of their resonance frequencies. Trim materials were tested using an impedance tube to suggest the best sound absorbing materials {{that can be used to}} mitigate the tyre cavity resonance effect...|$|R
2500|$|After about 90 miles, as Moss {{approached}} Padua at [...] {{he saw in}} his {{mirror that}} Castellotti was closing fast. When Moss misjudged a corner and collided with some straw bales Castellotti went past and built an increasing lead. After 188 miles of racing the Italian had to stop in Ravenna to replace the Ferrari's tyres, and fell behind again. Marzotto's Ferrari started well but the tread <b>separated</b> from a <b>tyre</b> at over [...] {{and he had to}} withdraw from the race because the spare {{turned out to be the}} wrong size.|$|R
5000|$|Positions {{remained}} static {{until the}} start of lap five. Hamilton pressured Webber in turn one, and {{with the aid of}} the KERS button, overtook the Australian before turn two. Once clear of Webber, Hamilton started to cut into the gap that Alonso had built up at the front. Alonso's Renault was suffering from graining on its rear tyres (when the tyres shed little bits of rubber before sticking to the tread of the <b>tyre,</b> effectively <b>separating</b> the <b>tyre</b> from the track surface very slightly), and also a fuel pump problem, which forced him to change to a different fuel setting on the car. Alonso pitted on lap twelve, and was stationary for 6.4 seconds. However, he was released with his front right wheel incorrectly attached, causing the wheel-mounted brake duct or [...] "spinner" [...] to rotate while the wheel was turning. The duct then fell off and disintegrated at turn four, as Alonso continued to go round the circuit. The wheel then parted from the car at turn nine, and Alonso drove the car back to the pits on three wheels. The missing wheel was replaced, enabling him to continue in the race, but he returned to the pits on the following lap, as the earlier fuel pump problem proved terminal.|$|R
50|$|The first models {{featured}} dark grey one-piece plastic {{wheels and}} chromed plastic bases. These cheaper bases made the models lighter and perhaps less durable than Matchbox cars (Rixon 2005, pp. 32-33). Still, their construction did {{allow for a}} simple suspension system to be installed {{by means of the}} axle being positioned to be sandwiched between the main base and a section of the plastic base which was cut away on three of sides to form a plastic tongue, which acted as a crude springing mechanism. In 1969 Mettoy re-designed and improved the quality of the models. Die cast metal bases, better suspension and two-piece <b>separate</b> hub and <b>tyre</b> wheels were fitted to upgrade existing models along with a variety of new models that were added to the range.|$|R
25|$|At {{its first}} race in Brazil, the F2002 was victorious, {{being driven by}} Michael Schumacher and {{continuing}} Ferrari's trend since 1999 for its cars to win on their debut. Michael Schumacher clinched second on the grid and after a first lap altercation with Juan Pablo Montoya, took a somewhat easy win from his brother Ralf's Williams. There was some controversy surrounding tyre allocation because the team only had one F2002 chassis at the race. Therefore, Schumacher's spare car was an F2001 chassis and because the two chassis used different wheel rim designs each required <b>separate</b> wheels and <b>tyres.</b> It was thus argued that Schumacher had in-effect twice the allocation of tyres as any other driver. The controversy was managed by Ferrari agreeing to aggregate their tyre usage between the two cars, ensuring that Schumacher used the same total number of tyres as all the other drivers.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, while Antony was thus wasting {{his time in}} luxury and {{pleasure}} with Cleopatra, his public duties were neglected, and every thing was getting into confusion. Fulvia remained in Italy. Her position and her character gave her a commanding political influence, and she exerted herself in a very energetic manner to sustain, in that quarter of the world, the interests of her husband's cause. She was surrounded with difficulties and dangers, the details of which can not, however, be here particularly described. She wrote continually to Antony, urgently entreating {{him to come to}} Rome, and displaying in her letters all those marks of agitation and distress which a wife would naturally feel under the circumstances in which she was placed. The thought that her husband had been so completely drawn away from her by the guilty arts of such a woman, and led by her to abandon his wife and his family, and leave in neglect and confusion concerns of such momentous magnitude as those which demanded his attention at home, produced an excitement in her mind bordering upon frensy. Antony was at length so far influenced by the urgency of the case that he determined to return. He broke up his quarters at Tarsus and moved south toward Tyre, which was a great naval port and station in those days. Cleopatra went with him. They were to <b>separate</b> at <b>Tyre.</b> She was to embark there for Egypt, and he for Rome.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that wheels are {{responsible}} for a significant amount of the total aerodynamic drag of passenger vehicles. Tyres, and mostly rims, {{have been the subject of}} research in the automotive industry for the past years, but their effect and interaction with each other and with the car exterior is still not completely understood. This paper focuses on the use of CFD to study the effects of tyre geometry (tyre profile and tyre tread) on road vehicle aerodynamics. Whenever possible, results of the numerical computations are compared with experiments. More than sixty configurations were simulated. These simulations combined different tyre profiles, treads, rim designs and spoke orientation on two car types: a sedan and a sports wagon. Two tyre geometries were obtained directly from the tyre manufacturer, while a third geometry was obtained from our database and represents a generic tyre which covers different profiles of a given tyre size. All geometries were deformed based on measured wind tunnel data under a defined load and rotating conditions of 100 kph. Results have shown that the main grooves consistently lead to a decrease of both drag and lift. The edge pattern however, did not show a clear trend for drag and lift with respect to the different configurations studied, although its influence was always more noticeable on the sports wagon. The larger profile of the generic tyre resulted in higher drag and lift values with relation to the tyres obtained from the manufacturer. For a given rim, a drag difference was observed between two tyre geometries with same profile but different tyre tread. These findings lead to the conclusion that tyre profile, as well as tyre pattern, are important to consider. These results were confirmed by wind tunnel tests. In conclusion, the work of aerodynamic optimization of rims cannot be <b>separated</b> from the <b>tyre</b> itself...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION In 1838 peat-cutters found a {{one-piece}} {{disc wheel}} the very clumsiness of which roused the curiosity of journalists and authorities, {{so that it}} was saved from destruction. Eventually the wel 1 known Leiden antiquarian L. J. F. Janssen (1848, pp. 94 - 97) examined and commented upon this wheel. Its close resemblance to what was known of the tympana of the Roman plaustra, coupled with a fallacious chain of tempting arguments, led him to the misconception that this wheel (and a second one of different type) was of Roman origin. Once labelled they were labelled forever; and in so far as they were not thought to represent giant lids or even table tops (Pleyte, 1882, p. p), these wheels and the more recent comparable finds continued to be considered of Roman origin. It was only in 1955, when still another wheel of the Same type turned up in direct connection with a Neolithic trackway at Nieuw-Dordrecht (then under excavation), that Dr. W. van Zeist {{came to the conclusion that}} at least this wheel was to be considered of Neolithic origin. Even so, it remained questionable whether al 1 wheels of this type were of Neolithic age, or whether these spanned a much longer period. Since 1955 five more one-piece disc wheels have been found in the peat. On the basis of the palynological evidence (dealt with by Mrs. M. R. van der Spoel-Walvius in a recent paper, 1964) and C 14 measurements, the wheels al 1 proved to be contemporary with the Nieuw-Dordrecht wheel. This was inducement enough to study the. whole group of one-piece oak disc wheels found in the Northern Provinces of the Netherlands, and to collect as much information on these finds as possible. We now know that a total of ten finds, comprising in al 1 thirteen one-piece disc wheels of the Same type, have been recovered from the peat deposits of the provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel; of these ten finds, six could be dated, with the help of C 14 measurements and pollen analysis, to the end of the third millennium R. C. No comparable finds are known from other regions in the Netherlands. This study deals with the origin, dating, and implications of the wheel finds. Some later bi- and tripartite disc wheel finds are also discussed, notably those from the excavations at Ezinge in the years 1924 - 1934 (very kindly made available for publication by their excavator, Prof. Dr. A. E. van Giffen). In an introductory section, a brief survey is given of the present state of knowledge concerning the Neolithic cultures met with in the northern provinces of the Netherlands, to serve as a background for the discussion. The paper concludes with a complete catalogue of Dutch disc wheel finds. The historiography of wheeled traction sprang from the study of the representational art and the treatises of the ancients. As early as 1817, J. C. Ginzroth(1 nspector of Wagon-building to the King of Bavaria) published his magnificent work Die Wagen und Fahrwerke der Griechen und Römer und anderer alten Völker. Thus, the disc wheel became known from ancient art, and even such problems as wheels turning with the axles or on the axles were discussed, long before the first actual disc wheel find was recorded. In fact, the finds from Gasselterboerveen and Valthe, registered by L. J. F. Janssen in 1848, might wel 1 be the first authentic prehistoric disc wheels to enter scientific literature. The lack of actual finds must have been responsible for the often theoretical character of the discussions, which centred, for instance, on the question as to the invention of the wheel. Was the cart developed out of the sledge, which eventually might have been used with rollers underneath to carry stones (as Ginzroth had suggested), or was the vehicle invented in ritual context, and had spindle whorls been the prototypes for the wheel? Mötefindt (1918) gives a survey of the different opinions on this point, but he als 0 presents a classification of disc and early spoked wheels based on a realistic discussion of the available evidence, still largely derived from classica 1 sources. In the last half century, the multiplication of finds of actual remains and models of prehistoric wheels and vehicles has pushed the problems of theoretical character into the background; the centre of invention of wheeled vehicles and the history of their diffusion became the main points of interest. These problems have been specially dear to Childe, whose studies on the subject are of primary importance (1951, 1954, 1955). The most recent publication is by I. Bóna (1960), who, in a searching study, takes int 0 account new finds from Southeastern and Eastern Europe and their implications. Thus, at the outset of our discussion, the following synoptic picture can be drawn. The solid disc wheel can be traced back as far as the Uruk period (late 4 th millennium B. C.) in Mesopotamia, where script signs on pictographic tablets represent both sledges and vehicles which are identical to these sledges but for the wheels that are added underneath. From the early 3 rd millennium onward, wheeled vehicles (both wagons and carts) appear in the Royal tombs of Southern Mesopotamia serving as hearses (at Kish, Susa, Khafaje, and Ur) and in the representational art. The wheels present themselves already as compound plankbuilt discs with <b>separate</b> naves and <b>tyres.</b> By the beginning of the 3 rd millennium models of carts, wagons and wheels occur in Assyria (Tepe Gawra VIII) and Turkmenia (Anau I 11 and Shah Tepe ILI), demonstrating the rapid spread of wheeled traction. Still in the first half of the 3 rd millennium, model disc wheels make their appearance in some of the settlements of the Kuro-Araxes Culture in the Southern Caucasus and Eastern Asia Minor. The first disc wheel and wagon models of the Danubian area are hardly to be dated later. In the second half of the 3 rd millennium, solid disc wheels appear in the South-Russian steppe area, and, far to the East, in the Indus valley. Further afield in temperate Europe, the picture was by no means clear. Of the ambiguous engravings on the slabs of the portholed stone cist at Lohne-Zuschen (Hessen) in Germany, neither the date nor the fact that ox-drawn carts are really represented is agreed upon. The date secured by pollen analysis for a wooden disc wheel found at Beckdorf (Lower Saxony) in Germany at the end of the Neolithic or in the Early Bronze Age was but hesitantly accepted. Only the tripartite disc wheels from the North-Italian lakeside dwellings of Castione and Mercurago and from the Wasserburg Buchau in Southern Germany, datable to the 13 th century and c. 1000 B. C. respectively, gave a firm hold. Thus, it would even have been possible to believe that the spoked wheel had made its appearance in temperate Europe at an earlier date than the disc wheel. The spoked wheel is likely to have originated in connection with the adoption of the horse as a draught animal, when vehicles of lighter construction and greater manoeuvrability, such as war chariots, had to be constructed. Its centre of origin in the Near East, somewhere near the eastern border of Anatolia, is not yet clear, but the date of its first appearance may have been shortly after 2000 B. C. The earliest spoked wheel evidence from continental European soil is furnished by clay models from VëteFov settlements in Moravia and Slovakia, datable about I 500 B. C. (according to Bóna, shortly after 1400 B. C.). The history of spoked wheels in Europe can then be continued down int 0 the Iron Age by a series of models and actual bronze wheels belonging to votive wagons, wheeled cauldrons, wagons serving as hearses on the pyre and by representations of chariots on rock engravings. Thus, the spoked wheel was connected with ritual, burial and warfare. But ordinary transport in Europe probably remained true to disc wheels up to the beginning of. our era, as the disc wheel finds suggest. In the present study, the view is presented that the first disc wheels found their way into Northwestern Europe as an element of a specific group of cultures - the Battle Axe Cultures. The evidence seems to support this conception. It is based, however, on a limited number of chance finds, and future discoveries might conceivably show that the turning wheel was rather propagated by diffusion, independent of cultural barriers.
