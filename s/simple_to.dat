From <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> advanced, these are: {{relying on the}} game's AI to control most actions, digital puppetry, recamming, and precise scripting of actions. Although <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> produce, AI-dependent results are unpredictable, thus complicating the realization of a preconceived film script. For example, when Rooster Teeth produced The Strangerhood using The Sims 2, a game that encourages the use of its AI, the group had to create multiple instances of each character to accommodate different moods. Individual instances were selected at different times to produce appropriate actions.|$|E

5|$|Beat 'em ups often {{allow the}} player {{to choose between}} a {{selection}} of protagonists—each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and set of moves. Attacks can include rapid combinations of basic attacks (combos) as well as jumping and grappling attacks. Characters often have their own special attacks, which leads to different strategies depending on which character the player selects. The control system is usually <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> learn, comprising as little as two buttons. These buttons can be combined to pull off combos, as well as jumping and grappling attacks. Since the release of Double Dragon, many beat 'em ups have allowed two players {{to play the game}} cooperatively—a central aspect to the appeal of these games. Beat 'em ups are more likely to feature cooperative play than other game genres.|$|E
5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} habitat specificity, {{many species of}} beetles have been {{suggested}} as suitable as indicators, their presence, numbers, or absence providing a measure of habitat quality. Predatory beetles such as the tiger beetles (Cicindelidae) have found scientific use as an indicator taxon for measuring regional patterns of biodiversity. They are suitable for this as their taxonomy is stable; their life history is well described; they are large and <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> observe when visiting a site; they occur {{around the world in}} many habitats, with species specialised to particular habitats; and their occurrence by species accurately indicates other species, both vertebrate and invertebrate. According to the habitats, many other groups such as the rove beetles in human-modified habitats, dung beetles in savannas and saproxylic beetles in forests have been suggested as potential indicator species.|$|E
5|$|In November 1844, the {{anonymously}} published popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, {{written by}} Scottish journalist Robert Chambers, widened {{public interest in}} the concept of transmutation of species. Vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. Vestiges had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped {{to pave the way for}} the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated Origin by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream. While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, Herbert Spencer became an active proponent of Lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|In both of God of War: Ascensions single-player and {{multiplayer}} elements, it {{is primarily}} a third-person video game viewed from a fixed camera perspective. Some scenes in the single-player campaign feature a first-person camera view. In single-player mode, the player controls the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle games. The enemies are an assortment of creatures, {{most of whom are}} drawn from Greek mythology, including cyclopes, cerberuses, empusas, Sirens, Gorgons, satyrs, harpies, and centaurs. Other monsters were created specifically for the game, such as the juggernauts, wraiths, and manticores. Many of the monsters also appear in the multiplayer mode. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, and slide down walls to proceed through sections of the game. The game features a variety of puzzles, ranging from <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> complex.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneously, an {{unrelated}} movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds {{to symbolize the}} basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound {{was accompanied by a}} specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these {{can be stored in}} a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} {{encounters}} various minigames, {{which range from}} <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> more complex. The first type of minigame encountered is a battle sequence that resembles a fighting game, but no interaction from the player is required to fight. These recurring battle sequences represent when {{the members of the}} Little Busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others. Each member of the fight has a set of statistics attributed to them (which includes strength, stamina, agility, reflex, concentration, judgment, and luck) along with a life bar to keep track of how many hit points a fighter has left. The maximum number of hit points is determined by the given fighter's stamina rating. Weapons may be used along with any accessories the fighter has in their possession, and these items may be exchanged with other characters. Another recurring minigame involves the player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of the Little Busters. The player, as Riki, controls his position and when to swing the bat.|$|E

5|$|Development of Space Race began {{soon after}} the {{founding}} of Atari in Summer 1972 under the name Asteroid. Co-founders Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney had the initial idea for the game while developing the 1971 Computer Space, the first arcade video game, but felt the more complicated Computer Space was a better first game. After leaving Nutting Associates and founding Atari in May 1972, Bushnell spent a few days designing Asteroid, but soon had to drop the project to focus on running the company. After the release of Pong, Atari's first game, development resumed on the title in Spring 1973. Dabney has claimed credit for the game's final design, though Pong designer Allan Alcorn has stated that he and Bushnell {{may have been involved}} as well. Asteroid, codenamed VP-2, was designed to be a racing game that would be <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> create to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway; Atari had initially offered Pong during its development to fulfill the contract, but had been rejected. The company was also interested in producing a very different game from their previous success, as they felt that innovative design was what would separate them from their competitors, which they saw as flooding the market with Pong clones rather than making new video games.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Ocean Software ported {{the game}} to home gaming systems, {{including}} the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Due to the hardware limitations of the various systems, the graphics and sounds of the ports differ from the original arcade version. Some home versions use a light gun peripheral to simulate the control scheme of the arcade format. The Sega Master System port uses the Sega Light Phaser accessory. The Amiga and Atari ST versions {{are one of the}} few games to use the Trojan Light Gun. In developing the Amiga conversion, the team video taped the arcade machine in operation as a reference for the graphics, pausing the video at relevant spots to take notes before recreating them. Programmer Damien Stones spent four months on the ZX Spectrum version. He kept the graphical detail of the backgrounds <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> allow for more action in the foreground. Taking into account the system's lower capabilities compared to the arcade hardware, Stones designed {{the game to}} handle a large number of on-screen sprites. In 2005, Space Gun was included in the compilation title Taito Legends for the PlayStation 2, personal computer and Xbox.|$|E
5|$|Jean Baptiste Lamarck used fossils in his {{arguments}} for {{his theory of}} the transmutation of species in the early 19th century. Fossil finds, and the emerging evidence that life had changed over time, fueled speculation on this topic {{during the next few}} decades. Robert Chambers used fossil evidence in his 1844 popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, which advocated an evolutionary origin for the cosmos as well as for life on earth. Like Lamarck's theory it maintained that life had progressed from the <b>simple</b> <b>to</b> the complex. These early evolutionary ideas were widely discussed in scientific circles but were not accepted into the scientific mainstream. Many of the critics of transmutational ideas used fossil evidence in their arguments. In the same paper that coined the term dinosaur Richard Owen pointed out that dinosaurs were at least as sophisticated and complex as modern reptiles, which he claimed contradicted transmutational theories. Hugh Miller would make a similar argument, pointing out that the fossil fish found in the Old Red Sandstone formation were fully as complex as any later fish, and not the primitive forms alleged by Vestiges. While these early evolutionary theories failed to become accepted as mainstream science, the debates over them would help pave the way for the acceptance of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection a few years later.|$|E
