3000|$|This study uses {{borehole}} array recordings {{to measure}} the propagation characteristics of bedrock waves traveling from pre-Tertiary basement (<b>seismic</b> bedrock) to <b>engineering</b> bedrock with an S-wave velocity of approximately 0.5 – 0.8 km/s. To avoid the destructive interference of surface-reflected down-going waves and incidence waves in <b>seismic</b> and <b>engineering</b> bedrock, borehole data recorded at sufficient depth levels are used in this study. This {{is the most important}} aspect of the fundamental basis of this study. The propagation characteristics, i.e., the transfer function, of bedrock motions for S-waves are well represented by a Butterworth-type low-pass filter model with a high corner frequency in excess of 15 Hz and a low decay rate of — 3 power of frequency. The use of such a filter model is based on the concise representation of the transfer function from an engineering viewpoint. Simple one-dimensional ray theory with a plane wave approximation explains the characteristics of the model filter at low frequencies of less than approximately 5 Hz; however, one-dimensional ray theory with a plane wave approximation at high frequencies in excess of 5 Hz requires the unusual frequency characteristics of Q [...]...|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the high}} seismic {{activity}} observed in Mexico city, prior to its construction, a highly advanced <b>seismic</b> <b>engineering</b> study was conducted.

The building is also equipped with 65 seismic shock absorbers. With this, it can withstand an earthquake up to 8.5 degrees on the Richter scale.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} REXELite, {{an internet}} version of REXEL, a software for automatic selection of ground motion suites for nonlinear dynamic analysis of structures. REXELite was developed {{with the aim}} of integrating an advanced earthquake records' repository, such as the ITalian ACcelerometric Archive (ITACA), with a tool to define <b>seismic</b> input for <b>engineering</b> <b>seismic</b> analysis according to international standards (with priority to Europe). In fact, REXELite allows to define target design spectra according either to Eurocode 8 or to the Italian building code, and to search ITACA for suitable sets of seven records (comprised of one or two horizontal ground motion components) matching such target spectra: on average, in a user-specified period range, and with the desired tolerance. The records in the set also have, individually and according to some criteria, the most similar spectral shape with respect to that of the code. Selection options include magnitude, source-to-site distance, soil conditions and, if desired, linear scaling of records to reduce further record-to-record variability of the selected suite...|$|R

40|$|Integrated {{software}} {{has been}} written that comprises the tool kit for the Intelligent Computing System (ICS). The software tools in ICS {{have been developed for}} characterization of reservoir properties and evaluation of hydrocarbon potential using a combination of inter-disciplinary data sources such as geophysical, geologic and engineering variables. The ICS tools provide a means for logical and consistent reservoir characterization and oil reserve estimates. The tools can be broadly characterized as (1) clustering tools, (2) neural solvers, (3) multiple-linear regression, (4) entrapment-potential calculator and (5) file utility tools. ICS tools are extremely flexible in their approach and use, and applicable to most geologic settings. The tools are primarily designed to correlate relationships between <b>seismic</b> information and <b>engineering</b> and geologic data obtained from wells, and to convert or translate <b>seismic</b> information into <b>engineering</b> and geologic terms or units. It is also possible to apply ICS in a simple framework that may include reservoir characterization using only <b>engineering,</b> <b>seismic,</b> or geologic data in the analysis. ICS tools were developed and tested using geophysical, geologic and engineering data obtained from an exploitation and development project involving the Red River Formation in Bowman County, North Dakota and Harding County, South Dakota. Data obtained from 3 D seismic surveys, and 2 D seismic lines encompassing nine prospective field areas were used in the analysis. The geologic setting of the Red River Formation in Bowman and Harding counties is that of a shallow-shelf, carbonate system. Present-day depth of the Red River formation is approximately 8000 to 10, 000 ft below ground surface.
