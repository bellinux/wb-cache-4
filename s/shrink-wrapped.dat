25|$|The {{airport was}} home to the fully {{restored}} World War II B-17 bomber, My Gal Sal (one of three B-17E bombers in existence). It was housed in the Warbirds hangar and open for touring at certain scheduled times. Plans were in place to make the bomber the centerpiece of an aviation museum at the airport. Despite having private funding already promised {{for the construction of}} the museum, the plans were abandoned when the airport was closed in 2012. The bomber was <b>shrink-wrapped</b> and sent to the National World War II Museum in New Orleans in August 2012.|$|E
25|$|Property {{destruction}} {{began to}} increase substantially after several high-profile campaigns closed down facilities {{perceived to be}} abusive to animals. Consort Kennels, a facility breeding beagles for animal testing; Hillgrove Farm, which bred cats; and Newchurch Farm, which bred guinea pigs, were all closed after being targeted by animal rights campaigns that appeared to involve the ALF. In the UK, the financial year 1991–1992 saw around 100 refrigerated meat trucks destroyed by incendiary devices {{at a cost of}} around £5 million. Butchers' locks were superglued, <b>shrink-wrapped</b> meats were pierced in supermarkets, slaughterhouses and refrigerated meat trucks were set on fire.|$|E
25|$|Electro Body was {{released}} in professional packaging, comparable to games released by Western publishers. The box contained an instruction manual, reference card with controls and a cassette tape containing the game soundtrack, thus allowing even players without sound cards to enjoy the music. Creating the boxes {{at the time was}} not a simple task for the developers; the boxes were <b>shrink-wrapped</b> by hand, {{with the help of a}} kitchen heat sealer and a sandwich toaster. The back of the box was decorated with screenshots made with a photo camera. Advertising material created for the game included posters and radio advertisements.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} also {{promoted}} through Concrete Marketing's Concrete Corner program. [...] The promotion saw 100,000 {{copies of a}} compilation CD featuring tracks of breakthrough artists approved by Korn, {{as well as a}} previously unreleased Korn track, being <b>shrink-wrapped</b> to the album at participating stores and given away for free with each purchase of the album. [...] Band artists (at the time) featured on this CD included Kid Rock, Orgy, Powerman 5000 and Limp Bizkit. The album had five singles issued: [...] "All in the Family", [...] "Got the Life", [...] "Freak on a Leash", [...] "Children of the Korn", and [...] "B.B.K." ...|$|E
500|$|The band never {{received}} particularly glowing reviews, with many reviewers dismissing {{them as a}} joke act based on the humorous slant of its music videos. British publication NME was particularly critical of the trio, begging them to [...] "fuck right off," [...] and comparing them to [...] "that sanitised, castrated, <b>shrink-wrapped</b> 'new wave' crap that the major US record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt {{to jump on the}} 'punk' bandwagon." [...] Nevertheless, subsequent reviews of the band's discography have been more positive. Andy Greenwald of Blender wrote, [...] "the quick transformation from nudists to near geniuses is down-right astonishing." [...] James Montgomery of MTV called Blink-182 one of the [...] "most influential bands of the past 20 years," [...] writing, [...] "despite their maturation, Blink never took themselves particularly seriously, which was another reason they were so accessible." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Nirvana's success, Michael Azerrad wrote in a 1992 Rolling Stone article, Smells Like Teen Spirit' is an anthem for (or is it against?) the 'Why Ask Why?' generation. Just don't call Cobain a {{spokesman}} for a generation." [...] Nevertheless, the music press awarded the song an [...] "anthem-of-a-generation" [...] status, placing Cobain as a reluctant spokesman for Generation X. The New York Times observed that Smells Like Teen Spirit' could be this generation’s version of the Sex Pistols' 1976 single, 'Anarchy in the U.K.', if it weren’t for the bitter irony that pervades its title," [...] and added, [...] "As Nirvana knows only too well, teen spirit is routinely bottled, <b>shrink-wrapped</b> and sold." [...] The band grew uncomfortable with the song's success, and in later concerts often pointedly excluded it from the set list. Prior {{to the release of}} the band's 1993 follow-up album In Utero, Novoselic remarked, [...] "If it wasn't for 'Teen Spirit' I don't know how Nevermind would have done," [...] and observed, [...] "There are no 'Teen Spirits' on In Utero." [...] Cobain said in 1994, [...] "I still like playing 'Teen Spirit,' but it's almost an embarrassment to play it [...] Everyone has focused on that song so much." ...|$|E

40|$|Hyperbolic Programming (HP) [...] {{minimizing}} {{a linear}} functional over an affine subspace of a finite-dimensional real vector space intersected {{with the so-called}} hyperbolicity cone [...] is a class of convex optimization problems that contains well-known Linear Programming (LP). In particular, for any LP one can readily provide a sequence of HP relaxations. Based on these hyperbolic relaxations, a new <b>Shrink-Wrapping</b> approach to solve LP has been proposed by Renegar. The resulting <b>Shrink-Wrapping</b> trajectories, in a sense, generalize the notion of central path in interior-point methods. We study the geometry of <b>Shrink-Wrapping</b> trajectories for Linear Programming. In particular, we analyze the geometry of these trajectories in {{the proximity of the}} so-called central line, and contrast the behavior of these trajectories with that of the central path for some pathological LP instances. In addition, we provide an elementary proof of convexity of hyperbolicity cones over reals.

500|$|The Village Voice {{called the}} sound [...] "emo-core... intercut with elegiac little pauses that align Blink 182 with {{a branch of}} punk rock you could trace back through The Replacements and Ramones Leave Home, to the more {{ethereal}} of early Who songs". Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine, however, found the sound to be recycled from the band's previous efforts, writing, [...] "Blink shines when they deviate from their formula, but it is awfully rare... The album {{seems to be more}} concerned with maintaining the band's large teenage fanbase than with expanding their overall audience." [...] Entertainment Weekly felt similarly, with David Browne opining that [...] "the album is angrier and more teeth gnashing than you'd expect. The band work so hard at it, and the music is such processed sounding mainstream rock played fast, that the album becomes a paradox: adolescent energy and rebellion made joyless". British magazine New Musical Express, who heavily criticized the band in their previous efforts, felt no more negative this time, saying [...] "Blink-182 are now indistinguishable from the increasingly tedious 'teenage dirtbag' genre they helped spawn". The magazine continued, [...] "It [...] like all that sanitised, castrated, <b>shrink-wrapped</b> 'new wave' crap that the major US record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt to jump on the 'punk' bandwagon." ...|$|E

2500|$|HyperCard was a {{huge hit}} almost instantly. Many people who thought they {{would never be able}} to program a {{computer}} started using HyperCard for many automation and prototyping tasks, a surprise even to its creator. Apple never seemed to understand what HyperCard's target market for users should be. Project managers found it was being used by a huge number of people, internally and externally. Bug reports and upgrade suggestions continued to flow in, demonstrating it had a wide variety of users. Since it was also free, it was difficult to justify dedicating engineering resources to improvements in the software. [...] It was not lost on Apple or its mainstream developers that the power HyperCard gave to people could cut into the sales of ordinary <b>shrink-wrapped</b> products.|$|E
5000|$|Click-wrap license {{agreements}} {{refer to}} website based contract formation (see iLan Systems, Inc. v. Netscout Service Level Corp.). A common {{example of this}} occurs where a user must affirmatively assent to license terms of a website, by clicking [...] "yes" [...] on a pop-up, in order to access website features. This is therefore analogous to <b>shrink-wrap</b> licenses, where a buyer implied agrees to license terms by first removing the software package's <b>shrink-wrap</b> and then utilizing the software itself. In both types of analysis, {{focus is on the}} actions of end user and asks whether there is an explicit or implicit acceptance of the additional licensing terms.|$|R

[...] For several years, the incomplete project sat partially finished, <b>shrink-wrapped</b> in white plastic sheeting, reminiscent of a condom, hence its local nickname: [...] "Trojan Tower." [...] In September 2008, the shrink-wrap was removed {{for the second time}} from the building. [...] In the summer of 2009, after years of extensive reconstruction work, the building finally received its certificate of occupancy and has been replanned for monthly rental apartments. [...] Its first residents began moving into the building in August 2009, a full six years after the original developer of the project broke ground.|$|E

In addition, the song [...] "South Side", sung as a duet with No Doubt frontwoman Gwen Stefani, was released as a single (becoming his only song to ever appear on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 14). Thanks to its music video and heavy airplay, the song helped to push {{the success of the}} album even further. Later on, Play was re-released with the single version of [...] "South Side" [...] featuring Gwen Stefani replacing the original.
