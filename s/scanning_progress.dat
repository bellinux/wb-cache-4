The paper presents an in-flight quality monitoring tool that allows assessing the quality of the recorded data “on the fly”, featuring a real-time processing of the GPS/INS data and the subsequent georeferencing of the laser returns. The tool is capable of displaying the <b>scanning</b> <b>progress</b> in real-time and detecting data gaps immediately after terminating the strip. The paper presents the adopted strategy for data processing and communication in order to achieve scalable distribution across a network of computers. Further we discuss first experiences with this tool within airborne survey projects that demonstrate its successful application in practice. 1. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Channel {{scanning}} is {{an important}} aspect of seamless handovers since it is required in order to find a target point of attachment (PoA). In the IEEE 802. 11 WLAN, scanning of other channels causes service disruptions with the current AP so that the provided quality of service (QoS) will be degraded seriously during the handoff. In this paper, we propose a QoS supported dynamic channel scanning algorithm. The scanning period is scheduled to guarantee the user’s QoS requirements while the <b>scan</b> <b>progresses.</b> The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism reduces service disruptions and provides the desired quality of service to users during the scanning period. * I...|$|R

Highly selective binding for β-amyloid over other proteins (e.g., tau and a-synuclein) {{has been demonstrated}} in vitro. Initial single-center studies demonstrated the potential for florbetaben PET imaging to discriminate between AD patients and non-AD patients or healthy volunteers. Single dose pharmacokinetics of 300 MBq florbetaben of low or high mass dose (<=5 and 50-55 μg) showed no relevant differences between Japanese and Caucasian populations. When compared to healthy subjects, cortical uptake of florbetaben was demonstrated to be generally higher in {{a large proportion of}} patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD or mild cognitive impairment. Longitudinal data of 45 patients with MCI indicated that florbetaben PET imaging may be useful to identify patients who will progress to AD. A substantial proportion of patients with a positive florbetaben PET <b>scan</b> <b>progressed</b> to AD-dementia over a 2-year and 4-year time frame. At 4-year follow-up, 88% (21/24) of individuals with MCI and positive florbetaben uptake converted to clinical dementia due to AD, whereas none of 21 florbetaben-negative individuals with MCI experienced a conversion. The pivotal phase III study investigated the relationship of florbetaben imaging and amyloid deposition in the brain in patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD and other dementias and subjects without dementia.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{meta-analysis}} of 367 mice from a collection of behaviour neuroscience and behaviour genetic studies run in the same lab in Zurich, Switzerland. We employed correlation-based statistics to confirm and quantify consistencies in behaviour across the testing environments. All 367 mice ran exactly the same behavioural arenas: the light/dark box, the null maze, the open field arena, an emergence task and finally an object exploration task. We analysed consistency of three movement types across those arenas (resting, <b>scanning,</b> <b>progressing),</b> and their relative preference for three zones of the arenas (home, transition, exploration). Results were that 5 / 6 measures showed strong individual-differences consistency across the tests. Mean inter-arena correlations for these five measures ranged from +. 12 to +. 53. Unrotated principal component factor analysis (UPCFA) and Cronbach&#x 2019;s alpha measures showed these traits to be reliable and substantial (32 - 63 % of variance across the five arenas). UPCFA loadings then indicate which tasks give the best information about these cross-task traits. One measure (that {{of time spent in}} &#x 201 c;intermediate&#x 201 d; zones) was not reliable across arenas. Conclusions centre on the use of individual differences research and behavioural batteries to revise understandings of what measures in one task predict for behaviour in others. Developing better behaviour measures also makes sound scientific and ethical sense...|$|R
40|$|Wear {{behavior}} of freshly cleaved single crystal calcite (CaCO 3) was investigated by continuous scanning using the Hysitron Triboindenter in ambient environment {{as a function}} of scanning frequency (1 Hz 3 Hz) and contact load (2 µN 8 µN). At lower loads below 4 µN, initiation of the ripples takes place {{at the bottom of the}} surface slope, which continue to propagate up the slope as <b>scanning</b> <b>progresses.</b> The orientation of these ripple structures is perpendicular to the long scan direction. As the number of scans increases, ripples become fully developed, and their height and periodicity increase with the number of scans. At 6 µN normal load, tip-induced wear occurs as the tip begins removing the ripple structures with increased number of scan cycles. As the contact load increased further, ripples did not initiate and only tip-induced wear occurred on the surface, and saturated after 20 scans. At 1 Hz frequency wear takes place as material slides towards the scan edges when the tip moves back and forth. Material removal rate increased with contact load and it is observed that the number of scans required to create a new surface is inversely proportional to the contact load. Possible mechanisms responsible for the formation of ripples at higher frequencies are attributed to the slope of the surface, piezo hysteresis, system dynamics, or a combination of effects. The wear regime is due to abrasive wear. Single crystal calcite hardness of 2. 8 ± 0. 3 GPa and elastic modulus of 75 ± 4. 9 GPa were measured using nanoindentation and used to determine the wear mode...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{surface structure}} of (111) n-type silicon was investigated {{through the use}} of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) to develop a model to determine oxide presence on a passivated silicon surface. I-V curves were obtained with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) using a tungsten tip on various locations of passivated silicon while the passivation layer desorbed from the surface under standard atmospheric conditions. The derivative (dI/dV) of these curves then revealed the electronic structure of the surface of the sample. Through these scans, it was determined the system was operating in the same mode as a Shockley diode. The separation of the band energies between the tungsten tip and n-type silicon created a Shockley diode with a barrier height of 0. 45 V that was verified with the dI/dV curves. The scans obtained showed a general shift in surface properties through a shift in the width and location of the conductance peaks as the <b>scan</b> time <b>progressed.</b> The shifts suggest an oxide growth due to the change in electrical structure or local density of states (LDOS) over time...|$|R

Formation of tip induced nanowear ripples is studied on a freshly cleaved calcite single crystal {{as a function of}} scanning frequency and contact load of the diamond tip. At lower loads, initiation of the ripples takes place {{at the bottom of the}} surface slope at 3 Hz scanning frequency, which continue to propagate as <b>scanning</b> <b>progresses.</b> The orientation of these ripple structures is perpendicular to the scan direction. As the number of scans increases, ripples fully develop, and their height and periodicity increase with the number of scans by merging ripples together. At 6 mu N normal load, tip induced wear occurred as the tip started removing the ripple structures with increased number of scan cycles. As the contact load increased further, a ripple structure was not initiated and only tip induced wear occurred on the surface. At 1 Hz frequency material removal takes place as the tip moves back and forth and material slides towards the scan edges. Material removal rate increased with contact load and it is observed that the number of scans required to create a new surface is inversely proportional to the contact load. Possible mechanisms responsible for {{the formation of}} ripples at higher frequencies are attributed to the slope of the surface, piezo hysteresis,system dynamics or a combination of effects. Single crystal calcite hardness of 2. 8 GPa and elastic modulus of 80 GPa were measured using nanoindentation. Evolution of nanostructures on the InP surface due to ion bombardment has been studied with scanning tunneling microscopy in UHV environment. InP crystal surfaces were irradiated by Argon ion incident beam with 3 KeV energy at an incident angle of 75 degrees. Self-organization of the surface was studied by varying the ion fluence from 7. 7 E 13 to 4. 6 E 17 ions per square centimeter. The observed nanoripple morphologies have been explained based on the concept of interplay between roughening and smoothing processes. Wavelength of the nanostructures linearly increases with the logarithm of the fluence. The rms roughness is approximately linear with the logarithm of the fluence. Nanoindentation experiments were performed on InP surface before and after ion bombardment to determine variation in hardness and elastic modulus.

Nowadays digital television is prevailing in China, and the government is promoting the popularity of digital television. However, because of the economic development, analog television will still take its place in the TV market during a long period. But the broadcasting system has not been reformed, as a result, we should not only take use of the traditional analog system we already have, but also improve the quality of the pictures of analog system. With the high-speed development of high-end television, the research and application of digital television technique, the flaws caused by interlaced scan in traditional analog television, such as color-crawling, flicker and fast-moved object's boundary blur and zigzag, are more and more obvious. Therefore the conversion of interlaced <b>scan</b> to <b>progressing</b> <b>scan,</b> which is de-interlacing, {{is an important part of}} current television production. At present there are many kinds of TV sets appearing in the market. They are based on digital processing technology and use various digital methods to process the interlaced, low-field rate video data, including the de-interlacing and field rate conversion. The digital process chip of television is the heart of the new-fashioned TV set, and is the reason of visual quality improvement. As a requirement of real time television signal processing, most of these chips has developed novel hardware architecture or data processing algorithm. So far, the most quality effective algorithm is based on motion compensation, in which motion detection and motion estimation will be inevitably involved, in despite of the high computation cost. in video processing chips, the performance and complexity of motion estimation algorithm have a direct impact on speed area and power consumption of chips. Also, motion estimation determined the efficiency of the coding algorithms in video compression. This thesis proposes a Down-sampled Diamond NTSS algorithm (DSD-NTSS) based on New Three Step Search (NTSS) algorithm, taking both performance and complexity of motion estimation algorithms into consideration. The proposed DSD-NTSS algorithm makes use of the similarity of neighboring pixels in the same image and down-samples pixels in the reference blocks with the decussate pattern to reduce the computation cost. Experiment results show that DSD-NTSS is a better tradeoff in the terms of performance and complexity. The proposed DSD-NTSS reduces the computation cost by half compared with NTSS when having the equivalent image quality. Further compared with Four Step Search(FSS) Diamond Search(DS) 、Three Step Search(TSS) and some other fast searching algorithms, the proposed DSD-NTSS generally surpasses in performance and complexity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a scan line algorithm for drawing picture of parametrically defined surfaces. A scan line algorithm {{is characterized by}} the order in which it generates the picture elements of the image. These are generated left to right, top to bottom in much the same was as a picture is scanned out on a TV screen. Parametrically defined surfaces are those generated by a set of bivariate functions defining the X, Y and Z position of points on the surface. The primary driving mechanism behind such an algorithm is the inversion of the functions used to define the surface. To keep the algorithm general enough to apply {{to a wide variety of}} functional forms, this inversion is done numerically. It is only required to provide mechanism for evaluating the function and its derivatives at any parametric location. The algorithm proceeds in two phases. First, a numerical search is made to find the local maxima of the Y definition function within the desired parameter ranges. These determine when portions of the surface first become visible as the <b>scan</b> plane <b>progresses</b> down the screen. Secondly, the actual scan conversion process is performed, maintaining a list of segments of the surface intersecting the current scan plane. As the scan plane passes local maxima of the Y function new segments are added to the list. In addition, any existing segments are updated to reflect their intersection with the updated scan plane. All intersection calculations are performed by a bivariate Newton-Raphson solution of the defining equations. If the solution does not converge, it is due to the scan plane passing a local minimum, causing segments to be deleted from the active list. Finally, within one scan line, an X scan must be performed to generate the Z information about the surface for each picture element. This is also performed by a bivariate Newton-Raphson iteration with a different set of defining functions...|$|R

For this purpose, two poly(DL-lactide) samples of a very different molecular weight have been combined. The basic concept relies upon the capability of the high molecular weight component (Mn: 65 000) to provide the microspheres with a high mechanical strength, whereas the low molecular weight component (Mn: 3500) should decrease the particle lifetime dramatically. It {{has been shown that}} changing the weight ratio of these two components is an efficient way to control the kinetics of the in vitro degradation of poly(DL-lactide) microspheres on the expected time scale. The microspheres have been prepared by the oil-in-water emulsion/evaporation process, and their final polymer content has been compared to the initial composition of the oil phase. They have also been analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry to know whether the two polymers form a monophase blend or not. Kinetics of the in vitro biodegradation has been estimated from the decrease in molecular weight of the constitutive poly(DL-lactide) s, the time-dependency of the microsphere weight and the observation of changes in the morphology by <b>scanning</b> electron microscopy. <b>Progress</b> in the hydrolysis of the ester groups has also been reckoned from the increasing acidity of the incubation medium and associated with the polymer.

40|$|Introduction: Diagnosis and {{localization}} {{of offending}} glands in hyperparathyroid patients {{is a subject}} that has always concerned surgeons. Until two decades ago this could only be achieved through complete neck exploration by the surgeon. In recent decades, with introduction of better imaging techniques such as advanced sonography and isotopic <b>scans,</b> remarkable <b>progress</b> {{has been made in}} this field. To evaluate these techniques a study was designed and performed. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective descriptive study in a group of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who underwent parathyroidectomy in Imam Khomeini General hospital and Dr. Shariati General hospital, Tehran university of medical sciences, during the years 1989 to 1998. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of the available imaging facilities in diagnosis and localization of the offending gland(s), compared to intraoperative findings. Findings: 61 patients were studied. 11 men (18 %) and 50 women (82 %) 47 single adenoma (77 %), 2 multiple adenoma (3 %) and 12 hyperplasias (20 %) were reported. 24 patients with single adenoma had MIbI scan with a sensitivity and accuracy of 70 % and 100 %, respectively. In all cases of multiple adenoma and hyperplasia who had MIbI scan, the results was false negative. Sensitivity of Th-Tc scan for single sadenoma was 33. 3 %. Sonography had a sensitivity of 71. 5 % for adenoma and 40 % for hyperplasa with 100 % accuracy for both of them. Sensitivity and accuracy of intraoperative diagnosis and localization for adenoma was 100 % and 96. 7 %, respectively. For hyperplasia these figures were 83. 3 % sensitivity and 100 % accuracy. Conclusion: According to the results in diagnosis and localization of offending gland(s) in primary hyperparathyroidism, intraoperative judgment of experienced surgeon has a higher sensitivity and accuracy than available imaging facilities. This is specially true for multiple adenoma and hyperplasia. Therefore, we suggest that still during surgery for hyperparathyroidism all parathyroid glands should be explored, and limited dissection directed by imaging findings should be avoided. However, with increasing experience and introduction of new technologies such as radiotracing, one may expect better results from imaging day by day...|$|R
40|$|Background: Indigenous Australians have poorer {{outcomes}} {{from cancer}} {{for a variety}} of reasons including poorer participation in screening programs, later diagnosis, higher rates of cancer with poor prognosis and poorer uptake and completion of treatment. Cancer prevention and support for people with cancer is part of the core business of the State and Territory Cancer Councils. To support sharing of lessons learned, this paper reports an environmental scan undertaken in 2010 in cancer councils (CCs) nationwide that aimed to support Indigenous cancer control. Methods: The methods replicated the approach used in a 2006 environmental scan of Indigenous related activity in CCs. The Chief Executive Officer of each CC nominated individuals for interview. Interviews explored staffing, projects, programs and activities to progress cancer control issues for Indigenous Australians, through phone or face-to-face interviews. Reported initiatives were tabulated using predetermined categories of activity and summaries were returned to interviewees, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Subcommittee and Chief Executive Officers for verification. Results: All CCs participated and modest increases in activity had occurred in most states since 2006 through different means. Indigenous staff numbers were low and no Indigenous person had yet been employed in smaller CCs; no CC had an Indigenous Board member and efforts at capacity building were often directed outside of the organisation. Developing partnerships with Indigenous organisations were ongoing. Acknowledgement and specific mention of Indigenous people in policy was increasing. Momentum increased following the establishment of a national subcommittee which increased the profile of Indigenous issues and provided collegial and practical support for those committed to reducing Indigenous cancer disparities. Government funding of “Closing the Gap” and research in the larger CCs have been other avenues for increasing knowledge and activity in Indigenous cancer control. Conclusions: This environmental <b>scan</b> measured <b>progress,</b> allowed sharing of information and provided critical assessment of progress across areas of importance for increasing Indigenous cancer control. Structured examination of policies, institutional support systems, programs and interventions is a useful means of highlighting opportunities for progress with minority groups relevant for many organisations.

40|$|The main {{driver for}} Semiconductor and Bio-MEMS {{industries}} is decreasing the feature size, {{moving from the}} current state-of-the-art at 22 nm towards 10 nm node.

Therefore SPM has been suggested as one of the technologies that can fulfil the future requirements in terms of resolution and accuracy, while being capable of resolving 3 D futures. However, the throughput of the current state-of-the-art SPMs are extremely low, as compared to the high-volume manufacturing requirements. This paper presents the development of an architecture[1] for a fully automated high throughput SPM, which can meet the requirements of future process metrology and inspection for 450 mm wafers. The targeted specifications of the concept are 1) inspecting more than 20 sites per wafer, 2) each site with dimension of about 10 × 10 μm 2 (scalable to 100 × 100 μm 2) and 3) with a throughput of more than 7 wafers per hour, or 70 wafers per hour with a coarse/fine <b>scanning</b> approach. The <b>progress</b> of the high throughput SPM development is discussed and the baseline design of the critical sub-modules and the research issues are presented. © 2013 SPIE...|$|R
40|$|Background: A better {{understanding}} of the factors associated with the size and/or progression of osteolytic lesions has been hampered by a lack of sensitivity of radiographic measurement techniques. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed quantitative computed tomography scans that had been made with use of a high-resolution multi-slice scanner with a metal artifact-suppression protocol. The scans had been made to determine the volume of osteolytic lesions around thirty-five cementless Harris-Galante acetabular components that had been in situ for at least ten years. Repeat scans of thirty hips allowed for the measurement of progression in the size of os-teolytic lesions over a one-year period. Associations between the volume of osteolytic lesions, progression {{in the size of the}} lesions, polyethylene wear since the time of implantation, change in component position, and patient-related variables (age, gender, body mass index, activity level, walking limitations, joint pain, and function) were determined. Results: In sixteen of the thirty hips that had repeat computed tomography <b>scans,</b> the lesions <b>progressed</b> in size dur-ing the study period. The median size of the lesions in these sixteen hips was 10. 3 cm 3 at the time of the initial scan, compared with 13. 3 cm 3 at a median of fifteen months later (p = 0. 001). Osteolytic lesions measuring> 10 cm 3 in vol-ume on the initial scan were 2. 5 times (95 % confidence interval 1. 3 to 4. 8 times) more likely to progress in size over one year than smaller lesions were. Patients with greater polyethylene wear rates, higher activity levels, no walking limitations, and larger prosthetic femoral head dimensions (26 or 28 mm) had significantly larger osteolytic lesion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to investi-gate the pathomorphological and {{functional}} variations of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a Chinese population using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This population-based study enrolled 59 patients (age,> 45 years; eyes, 70) with early and intermediate-stage AMD from Youyi Road Community, Baoshan District, Shanghai, China. Comprehensive standard-ized ophthalmic examinations included visual acuity, anterior segment analysis using a slit lamp, dilated fundus evaluation by direct ophthalmoscopy, 90 D handheld lens analysis, fundus photography, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and fast optic disk scans using OCT. The macular CNV characteristic profiles in early and intermediate-stage AMD were deter-mined by OCT. Data were obtained on the first visit and the follow-up period ranged between 6 and 24 months, where FFA and OCT outcomes of early and intermediate-stage AMD patients were analyzed. Three profiles of early and interme-diate‑stage AMD were created from the OCT and FFA results, each with a different prognosis. Firstly, drusens with unclear boundaries and evident pigment proliferation, as well as hypofluorescence around the drusens, was observed via FFA. A slight small arch field located in the retinal pigment epithe-lium (RPE) /choriocapillary layer (CCL) was shown on OCT scans, indicating exudative AMD. Secondly, RPE detachments of> 1 pupillary distance, without CNV in the macular area, indicated geographic chorioretinitis atrophy. Finally, drusens with clear boundaries and few pigment proliferations and no certain surrounding fluorescence was observed via FFA, while a clear RPE/CCL band on the OCT <b>scans</b> indicated slow <b>progress.</b> The results {{of the present study}} demonstrated that combined OCT and FFA was the most efficient method for identifying CNV and diagnosing AMD. If the two techniques are not available concurrently, then OCT is a safer and more reliable technique to follow-up early and intermediate-stage AMD patients...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} contributed {{improvements}} to several {{key aspects of}} the COBRA double-beta decay experiment. A new data acquisition chain was developed for pulse-shape based readout of the COBRA coplanar grid (CPG) detectors. Prototype electronics for detector signal transmission and amplification were developed, {{as well as a}} software package with algorithms for pulse shape analysis of CPG detector signals. The pulse shape data readout has already resulted in significant improvements of the detector energy resolution. Pulse shape analysis has added interaction depth information to data output of the experiment, which has already shown itself to be an effective tool to suppress part of the background. A wavelet-based data compression technique has been developed to cope with the significant increase of data volume inherent to the recording of the full detector pulse shapes. A flexible data acquisition software framework was developed along with the new DAQ hardware chain. It is designed for both research and development applications and long-term physics data collection and is now in production use at several sites in the COBRA collaboration. The framework was also designed to scale up to the requirements of a large-scale experiment and its modular nature ensures that future components can be integrated easily. This work has contributed to the reduction of the radiation background level by over an order of magnitude, achieved by the combination of new CPG detector coatings and contacting methods with nitrogen flushing of the COBRA setup to create a radon-free environment. For the first time, low-background physics data was taken with a CdZnTe pixel detector. The results show that pixel detectors present an exciting option {{for the future of the}} experiment. Work is currently under way to scale up the new CPG electronics to a high channel count. The COBRA CPG setup at LNGS is scheduled to be upgraded to a higher number of detectors in 2011, which will all be run using the new DAQ system. A detailed study of the detector pulse shapes using simulations and collimated <b>scans,</b> currently in <b>progress,</b> will yield the necessary basis for advanced CPG pulse shape analysis. This will, in the future, enable new form of background suppression like separation between single-site and multi-site events...|$|R
