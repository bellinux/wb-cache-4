40|$|The {{sterilising}} {{efficiency of}} 0. 2 -mu m rated membranes is validated via a retention test using the small bacterium, Pseudomonas diminuta. Whilst {{the demand for}} such validation has increased, the tests are regarded as lengthy and are not always routinely carried out, Unfortunately, the results from integrity tests alone are not accurate enough to ascertain the sterilising ability of membranes. This review describes the current situation for the retention testing of 0. 2 -mu m rated membranes after first giving an outline {{of the process of}} <b>sterilising</b> <b>filtration</b> and of the retention test organism. Suggestions {{for the development of the}} standard retention test procedure are then given, namely the development of a rapid method of determining permeate sterility and also of a means of retention testing membranes during cross-flow filtration...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{value of}} core analysis in hydrogeology is critically {{examined in the}} light of the results of a systematic study of the porosity, density and intergranular permeability of the Permo-Triassic sandstones in the United Kingdom, based on the examination of 3500 test specimens. The Thesis begins with an account of the stratigraphy of the sandstones, illustrated by 51 vertical sections. This is followed by a description of the distribution and nature of the samples tested. The principal experimental methods employed were the liquid resaturation technique for measurement of porosity and density, and a gas permeameter was used to determine intrinsic permeability. Equipment systems are described which enable large numbers of samples to be handled rapidly. An improved water permeability test system incorporating <b>sterilising</b> <b>filtration</b> is described and tentative proposals for automated instrumentation are presented. The centrifuge method of measuring specific yield is re-examined. The test data are analysed in two ways: a) by making a detailed comparison of the lithology and physical properties of the test specimens, and b) by considering the porosity and permeability data as probability distributions. The second method permits the aquifer properties of the various sandstone subdivisions in different parts of the U. K. to be quantitatively compared for the first time. The parameter "primary" transmissivity is introduced to describe the intergranular component of transmissivity. Values for this parameter are compared with values for "total" transmissivity derived from analysis of pumping test data from six localities in widely differing hydrogeological environments. It is suggested that this comparison allows some general conclusions to be drawn about the relative importance of intergranular flow in sandstone aquifers. A further comparison is made of the permeability and transmissivity of British and German Triassic sandstone aquifers on the basis of data published by Hauthal (1967) and Durbaum, Matthess and Rainbow (1969). The study was deliberately intended to be of a general nature, so as to provide a firm basis for future me detailed work on the hydrodynamic behaviour of sandstone aquifers in the United Kingdom...|$|E
5000|$|The Casoni test is an {{immediate}} hypersensitivity skin test {{used in the}} diagnosis of hydatid disease introduced by casoni. The test involves the intradermal injection of 0.25 ml of sterilised fluid from hydatid cysts/human cyst and <b>sterilised</b> by Seitz <b>filtration</b> on forearm and equal volume of saline injected on the other forearm. Observations made for next 30 mins and after 1 to 2 days.A wheal response occurring at the injection site within 20 minutes is considered positive. (Immediate hypersensitivity). Delayed hypersensitivity reaction usually read after 18-24 hours. [...] The test is positive in about 90% of cases of hydatid disease affecting the liver, but positive in less than 50% of patients with hydatid disease elsewhere in the body; false positive results are also common. Precaution - Being a type I hypersensitivity reaction, anaphylactic reaction tray must be kept ready before carrying out the test.Consequently, serological tests are now generally used.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the culture media used in the {{presumptive}} diagnosis of suspiciuous colonies from plates inoculated with stools for isolation of enteric organisms do not always correctly indicate the major groups of enterobacteria. In an effort to obtain a medium affording more exact indications, several media (1 - 9) have been tested. Modifications of some of these media have also been tested with the result that a satisfactory modification of Monteverde's medium was finaly selected. This proved to be most satisfactory, affording, as a result of only one inoculation, a complete series of basic indications. The modification involves changes in the formula, in the method of preparation and in the manner of storage. The formulae are: A. Thymol blue indicator: NaOH 0. 1 /N [...] 34. 4 ml; Thymol blue [...] 1. 6 g; Water [...] 65. 6 ml. B. Andrade's indicator. C. Urea and sugar solution: Urea [...] . 20 g; Lactose [...] . 30 g; Sucrose [...] . 30 g; Water [...] 100 ml. The mixture (C.) should be warmed slightly in order to dissolve the ingredients rapidly. <b>Sterilise</b> by <b>filtration</b> (Seitz). Keep stock in refrigeratior. The modification of Monteverde's medium is prepared in two parts. Semi-solid part - Peptone (Difco) 2. 0 g; NaCl 0. 5 g; Agar 0. 5 g; Water 100. 0 ml. Boil to dissolve the ingredients. Adjust pH with NaOH to 7. 3 - 7. 4. Boil again for precipitation. Filter through cotton. Ad indicators "A" 0. 3 ml and "B" 1. 0 ml. Sterilise in autoclave 115 ºC, 15 minutes in amounts not higher than 200 ml. Just before using, add solution "C" asseptically in amounts of 10 ml to 200 ml of the melted semi-solid medium, maintained at 48 - 50 ºC. Solid part - Peptone (Difco) 1. 5 g; Trypticase (BBL) 0. 5 g; Agar 2. 0 g; Water 100, 00 ml. Boil to dissolve the ingredients. Adjust pH with NaOH to 7. 3 - 7. 4. Boils again. Filter through cotton. Add indicators "A" 0. 3 ml and "B" 1. 0 ml; ferrous ammonium sulfate 0. 02 g; sodiun thiosulfate 0. 02 g. Sterilise in autoclave 115 ºC, 15 minutes in amounts not higher than 200 ml. Just before using, add solution "C" asseptically in amounts of 10 ml to 200 ml of the melted solid medium, maintained at 48 - 50 ºC. Final medium - The semi-solid part is dispensed first (tubes about 12 x 120 mm) in 2. 5 ml amounts and left to harden at room temperature, in vertical position. The solid part is dispensed over the hardened semi-solid one in amounts from 2. 0 ml to 2. 5 ml and left to harden in slant position, affording a butt of 12 to 15 mm. The tubes of medium should be subjected to a sterility test in the incubator, overnight. Tubes showing spontaneous gas bubbles (air) should then be discarded. The medium should be stored in the incubator (37 ºC), for not more than 2 to 4 days. Storage of the tubes in the ice-box produces the absorption of air which is released as bubbles when the tubes are incubated at 37 ºC after inoculation. This fact confirmed the observation of ARCHAMBAULT & McCRADY (10) who worked with liquid media and the aplication of their observation was found to be essential to the proper working conditions of this double-layer medium. Inoculation - The inoculation is made by means of a long straight needle, as is usually done on the triple sugar, but the needel should penetrate only to about half of the height of the semi-solid column. Indol detection - After inoculation, a strip of sterelized filter papaer previously moistened with Ehrlich's reagent, is suspended above the surface of the medium, being held between the cotton plug and the tube. Indications given - In addition to providing a mass of organisms on the slant for serological invetigations, the medium gives the following indications: 1. Acid from lactose and/or sucrose (red, of yellowsh with strains which reduce the indicators). 2. Gas from lactose and/or sucrose (bubbles). 3. H[2]S production, observed on the solid part (black). 4. Motility observed on the semi-solid part (tubidity). 5. Urease production, observed on solid and semi-solid parts (blue). 6. Indol production, observed on the strip of filter paper (red or purplish). Indol production is not observed with indol positive strains which rapidly acidify the surface o the slant, and the use of oxalic acid has proved to give less sensitive reaction (11). Reading of results - In most cases overnight incubation is enough; sometimes the reactions appear within only a few hours of incubation, affording a definitive orientation of the diagnosis. With some cultures it is necessary to observe the medium during 48 hours of incubation. A description showing typical differential reaction follows: Salmonella: Color of the medium unchanged, with blackening of the solid part when H[2]S is positive. The slant tends to alkalinity (greenish of bluish). Gas always absent. Indol negative. Motility positive or negative. Shigella: Color of the medium unchanged at the beginning of incubation period, but acquiring a red color when the strain is late lactose/sucrose positive. Slant tending to alkalinity (greenish or purplish). Indol positive or negative. Motility, gas and H[2]S always negative. Proteus: Color of the medium generally changes entirely to blue or sometimes to green (urease positive delayed), with blackening of solid part when H[2]S is positive. Motility positive of negative. Indol positive. Gas positive or negative. The strains which attack rapidly sucrose may give a yellow-greenish color to the medium. Sometimes the intense blue color of the medium renders difficult the reading of the H[2]S production. Escherichiae and Klebsiellae: Color of the medium red or yellow (acid) with great and rapid production of gas. Motility positive or negative. Indol generally impossible to observe. Paracoli: Those lactose of sucrose positive give the same reaction as Esherichia. Those lactose or sucrose negatives give the same reactions as Salmonellae. Sometimes indol positive and H[2]S negative. Pseudomonas: Color of the medium unchanged. The slant tends to alkalinity. It is impossible to observe motility because there is no growth in the bottom. Alkaligenes: Color of the medium unchanged. The slant tends to alkalinity. The medium does not alter the antigenic properties of the strains and with the mass of organisms on the slant we can make the serologic diagnosis. It is admitted that this medium is somewhat more laborious to prepare than others used for similar purposes. Nevertheless it can give informations generally obtained by two or three other media. Its use represents much saving in time, labor and material, and we suggest it for routine laboratory work in which a quick presumptive preliminary grouping of enteric organisms is needed...|$|R
