5|$|The {{first three}} P.1127s crashed, {{the second and}} third {{occurring}} during development. In 1963, the first prototype, XP831, publicly crashed at the Paris Air Show; the accident had been caused by a <b>speck</b> of dirt in the air feed lines of the nozzle control motor, which had caused the engine nozzles to stick. XP831 was later fully repaired and resumed development flying. All the pilots involved survived.|$|E
40|$|Microbes or danger signals trigger inflammasome sensors, which induce {{polymerization}} of the adaptor ASC and {{the assembly}} of ASC <b>specks.</b> ASC <b>specks</b> recruit and activate caspase- 1, which induces maturation of the cytokine interleukin 1 β (IL- 1 β) and pyroptotic cell death. Here we found that after pyroptosis, ASC <b>specks</b> accumulated in the extracellular space, where they promoted further maturation of IL- 1 β. In addition, phagocytosis of ASC <b>specks</b> by macrophages induced lysosomal damage and nucleation of soluble ASC, as well as activation of IL- 1 β in recipient cells. ASC <b>specks</b> appeared in bodily fluids from inflamed tissues, and autoantibodies to ASC <b>specks</b> developed in patients and mice with autoimmune pathologies. Together these findings reveal extracellular functions of ASC <b>specks</b> and a previously unknown form of cell-to-cell communication...|$|R

5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark <b>speck</b> of life to come.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{latest project}} is Journey, which was {{released}} on March 13, 2012. It was the final game in Thatgamecompany's three-game contract with Sony, and was developed {{by a team of}} fourteen. This team did not include Santiago, who, in order to concentrate on her role as the company's president, was replaced as a producer by Robin Hunicke. The game was in development for three years, despite having been expected to take one year, and the development team faced several problems in expanding the company from seven employees as they began the game to eighteen, and risked running out of money. Upon release, the game achieved both critical and commercial success. It became the fastest-selling game to date on PlayStation Store in North America and Europe. After the game was released, as the company began work on another project, several employees left for other opportunities. Santiago left the company to pursue other ventures, designer Chris Bell left to form his own studio The Willderness, and Hunicke resigned to work at Tiny <b>Speck.</b> Chen attributes the exodus to the end of Thatgamecompany's three-game contract, and {{to the fact that the}} company had run out of money to pay employees, mandating an unpaid hiatus until the revenue from Journey came in.|$|E

25|$|After {{a year in}} Santo, <b>Speck</b> {{moved with}} his mother, his stepfather, and his sister Carolyn to the East Dallas section of Dallas, Texas, living at ten {{addresses}} in poor neighborhoods over the next dozen years. <b>Speck</b> loathed his often drunk and frequently absent stepfather, who psychologically abused him with insults and threats. <b>Speck,</b> a poor student who needed glasses for reading but refused to wear them, struggled through Dallas public schools from fourth through eighth grade, repeating eighth grade at J.

40|$|White <b>specks</b> are undyed {{spots on}} dyed fabric, and are {{commonly}} caused by neps. According to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM D 123 - 96, 1996), a nep is “a tightly tangled knot-like mass of unorganized fibers. ” Due to low cellulose {{content of the}} neps, clumps of these fibers do not accept dye. Therefore, when a fabric is dyed, the mechanical and biological neps formed by fine or immature fibers create undyed spots in the finished fabric. These undyed spots are known as white <b>specks.</b> Quality of a finished garment is determined by, among other things, the number of imperfections contained within the fabric. The more imperfections found in the cloth, the less value added the product has from the manufacturer. Since uniform surface color is a desirable aspect for fabrics, the inclusion of white <b>specks</b> is detrimental to fabric quality. The process of counting white <b>specks</b> is very tedious and time consuming. Since the late 1930 s, white <b>specks</b> were counted manually using a back light or a black background. Even today, white <b>specks</b> are being counted manually relying on visual inspection. The manual counting {{is not only a}} tedious and timeconsuming process but also inconsistent and prone to error because it is very subjective. In this research, a robust image analysis system was developed to count and size white <b>specks</b> on dyed fabric that can minimize the variations from light fluctuations and automatically perform threshold and calibration...|$|R
