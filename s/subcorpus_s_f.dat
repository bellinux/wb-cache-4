40|$|A strong measles-specific gel {{precipitation}} reaction {{was found in}} the cerebrospinal fluid (C. <b>S.</b> <b>F.)</b> of two patients with multiple sclerosis (M. S.) (total of 15 tested). The serum and C. <b>S.</b> <b>F.</b> specimens from these two patients were tested for measles antibody by six assay methods. The results were compared with those obtained from serum and C. <b>S.</b> <b>F.</b> specimens of a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (S. S. P. E.). The gel precipitation line produced by the C. <b>S.</b> <b>F.</b> from the M. S. patients was identical with one of the three lines produced by the C. <b>S.</b> <b>F.</b> from the <b>S.</b> S. P.

40|$|The blood-perfused choroid plexuses {{from the}} lateral ventricles {{of the sheep}} were used to {{determine}} the nature of sugar exchanges between blood and cerebrospinal fluid (c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.).</b> There was a net entry of sugars from blood to c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> at all concentrations of sugars which were used and this net entry was seen when the sugars were measured either directly by enzymic analysis or by the use of isotopically labelled sugars. From competition experiments the order of affinity of the transporting system from both blood to c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> and c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> to blood was the same, i. e. 2 -deoxy-D-glucose much greater than D-glucose greater than 3 -O-methyl-D-glucose much greater than D-galactose. The transport of sugars from c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> to blood and blood to c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> consists in both cases of a non-saturable and a saturable component. However, the affinity of the two systems is markedly different, the blood to c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> being a system of low affinity and high capacity while that of the c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> to blood has a high affinity and a low capacity. The concentration of glucose in the newly formed c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> was estimated from the rate of c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> secretion and the net flux of glucose across the choroid plexus. The concentration of glucose in this fluid was some 45 - 60 % of that in plasma and so the low glucose concentration observed in bulk c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> would appear to be a result of the entry process and not that of cerebral metabolism...|$|R

We examine whether postcranial morphology dif-fers between the purebred subspecies and their hybrids, and whether hy-brids exhibit heterosis indicative of genetic differences between the parental subspecies. Fifty postcranial dimensions, or traits, were mea-sured on 287 S. fuscicollis skeletons. Measurements were corrected for sex differences and environmental differences (wild-derived or laboratory-born). Females were larger than males for most postcranial dimensions, especially in the pelvis. Significant environmental differences were found throughout the postcranial skeleton, with wild-derived animals generally larger than animals born in the laboratory. Significant heterosis was found for six postcranial traits in the <b>S.</b> <b>f.</b> illigeri · <b>S.</b> <b>f.</b> leucogenys cross, and heterosis was found for 15 postcranial traits in the <b>S.</b> <b>f.</b> illigeri · <b>S.</b> <b>f.</b> lagonotus cross.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the neuroleptanalgesic drug combinations, {{droperidol}} 5 mg + phenoperi-dine 1. 5 mg, and droperidol 5 mg + fentanyl 0. 1 mg, on the cerebrospinal fluid (c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.)</b> pressure, have been studied in patients with normal c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> pathways during controlled ventilation. The influence of droperidol 5 mg+fentanyl 0. 1 mg on intracranial pressure has also been investigated in patients with intracranial space-occupying lesions. In patients with normal c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> pathways, droperidol and phenoperidine produced only small alterations in c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> pressure in either direction, while droperidol plus fentanyl resulted in falls in c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> pressure in each case studied, with {{a significant decrease in}} overall mean c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> pressure. Similarly, in patients with intracranial space-occupying lesions, droperidol plus fentanyl produced decreases in c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> pressure in {{all but one of the}} cases studied. The striking difference between the effect on c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> pressure of these drugs and of the volatile anaesthetic agents could be of importance to the clinical anaesthetist dealing with head injuries or working in a neurosurgical unit, when under conditions of controlled ventilation these drugs could be used as adjuvants to nitrous oxide-oxygen anaesthesia. In the past few years, it has been recognized that volatile anaesthetic agents can elevate the intra-cranial pressure even in the absence of hyper-capnia (Hunter, 1964; McDowall, Barker and Jennett, 1966); and that the increases in intra-cranial pressure produced by these drugs are markedly greater in patients with intracranial space-occupying lesions than in patients with normal cerebrospinal fluid (c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.)</b> pathway...|$|R

Application of a simple Mach number scaling procedure results in good correlation between <b>S</b> <b>F</b> 6 abnd air even for pressures at which nonideal gas effects are significant.

Resistance to absorption of the c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> was estimated by the constant rate infusion technique. Mean absorption resistance for infusions of artificial c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> into the lateral ventricles and into the cerebral subarachnoid space were 15. 48 and 16. 52 mmH 2 O min microliter- 1 respectively. This difference was not significant and it is concluded that the pores in the posterior tela situated in the roof of the fourth ventricle do not offer any resistance to the flow of c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> out of the ventricles. The resistance to drainage of the c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> in this amphibian is higher than that found for mammals. Mean resting c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> pressure, estimated from the intercept of the regression line with the pressure axis at zero infusion rate was 18. 0 mmH 2 O. Absorption resistance was measured from the cerebral subarachnoid space before and after injection of 4 microliter Indian ink solution. There was a 3 -fold increase in resistance following ink injection. Two-way analysis of variance showed the difference to be significant (P less than 0. 01) suggesting that the outflow sites can become partially blocked by particulate matter. During a continuous 3 h infusion of artificial c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> containing [14 C]dextran or [125 I]-labelled human serum albumin (RISA) into the lateral ventricles, the mean percentage uptakes into the systemic circulation after the first 0. 5 h of a 3 h period were 74. 1 and 61. 9 % respectively. The difference is not significant. The rapid and high uptake into blood suggests there is a direct communication between c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> and blood in amphibians. During continuous infusion of RISA into the lateral ventricles, simultaneous blood samples were taken from the femoral artery and the internal dorsal vertebral vein. Radioactivity was found to be 13. 2 % higher in venous samples. This suggests that at least some c. <b>s.</b> <b>f.</b> drainage takes place directly into the spinal venous system.
