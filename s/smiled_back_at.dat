60|$|I <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her. It was {{impossible}} to take her seriously.|$|E
60|$|He <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her. The reawakening of {{her sense}} of humour was something.|$|E
60|$|Barney Custer {{smiled up}} at her in encouragement, and the girl <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
60|$|Nick {{regarded}} {{her for a}} moment, and then his face lighted up with that smile which won every one he met, which inevitably made them <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Perry, {{and good}} luck to you," [...] I answered, <b>smiling</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him. But I fought off that awful lethargy. I was very young--I did not want to die.|$|R
5000|$|Following the match, Browning begins talking smack to Escudero who {{is still}} in the cage being looked at by the doctors and his coaches. Escudero simply <b>smiles</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Browning's {{continuing}} taunts.|$|R
60|$|He {{smiled and}} left his {{sentence}} unfinished, and she <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him to show she understood.|$|E
60|$|I <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> them, and in {{the eyes}} of more than one I {{detected}} a look of commiseration.|$|E
60|$|And she had <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him bravely. Such was {{the first}} {{acknowledgment}} between them that the world existed.|$|E
50|$|Cannon did {{not leave}} Vana's {{headquarters}} without cost. As he {{looks in the mirror}} he sees Taras <b>smiling</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him as he is now stuck in the deep recesses of his subconscious.|$|R
50|$|While Sanjay drives Chitra {{back to her}} dormitory, {{he stops}} at a {{crossing}} to let young children cross the road. A young girl smiles at him, and he reacts by <b>smiling</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not entirely, I think. Some {{faces are}} so true {{an index of}} {{character}} that one cannot be mistaken. If you doubt this look down into the river, and such an one will inevitably <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> you." ...|$|R
60|$|Honora {{disengaged}} {{herself from}} {{his arms and}} fled to the screen door. As she opened it, she turned and <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sing, Tessa; sing! Quick! quick!' cried Tommo, twanging {{away with}} all his might, and showing his white teeth, as he <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the little gentle-folk.|$|E
60|$|She sat {{among her}} {{cushions}} smiling upon him. She was half ironical, half sincere. He <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her, {{his dark eyes}} full of trembling hope, and pleasure, and pride.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{look very}} attractive," [...] David admitted, <b>smiling</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> his companion, [...] "but I am, in reality, lunching alone. I came here because I know my {{stockbroker}} lunches {{every day in}} the grillroom, and I want to see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Greeting, Lady," [...] he said softly, <b>smiling</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} his lips and dreamy eyes, for his old face {{did not seem to}} move beneath its {{thousand}} wrinkles. [...] "I bring you milk. Drink; it is fresh and you need food." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good evening, Apollo!" [...] she answered, <b>smiling</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him, for he too looked unusually debonair, and {{the thought}} of {{entering}} the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> my {{companion}} as we drew near. [...] "This, Mrs Bowater," [...] said I, [...] "is Mr Anon. Would you please present him to Miss Thomasina of Bedlam?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, {{it is of}} {{no great}} consequence, at any rate.' She <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> me, closed my door, and {{a few moments later}} I heard her key turn in the lock." ...|$|E
6000|$|She <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him, a pale, timid smile, like a {{gleam of}} {{sunshine}} from a wintry sky. [...] "That matters nothing," [...] she assured him, and strove {{to make her}} voice sound brave.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do my best, Alec; and I {{think you}} will need me, for, wise as you are, you cannot {{understand}} a tender, timid little creature like Rose as a woman can," [...] said Mrs. Jessie, <b>smiling</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him with a heart full of motherly goodwill.|$|R
60|$|He {{had taken}} {{it out of his}} pocket, and he held it, smiling fondly upon it. Alice seemed to <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him. He had lost her in the {{reluctance}} of his father and sisters; and now his mother--it was his mother who had given her to him again. He thought how tenderly he loved his mother.|$|R
25|$|In July 2011, Rodger {{followed}} a couple he {{was jealous of}} out of a Starbucks in Goleta and threw coffee on them. In a later incident, he splashed his latte on two girls sitting {{at a bus stop}} in Isla Vista for not <b>smiling</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him. In July 2012, Rodger purchased a Super Soaker, filled it with orange juice, and used it to spray a group playing kickball at Girsh Park.|$|R
60|$|He {{shut the}} door upon a crowd of {{disturbing}} thoughts and fantastic imaginings, and <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her. Her fingers remained upon his arm. A queer gravity had come into her dainty little face.|$|E
6000|$|His {{smile was}} a caress. Her breath caught, she <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him fearfully. Then he was gone. In the {{editorial}} office was heard the banging of his heavy old typewriter--it was an office joke, Walter's hammering of the [...] "threshing-machine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} what the fellow {{wanted to do that}} for." [...] Then he <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Frank. [...] "These are decadent days. He wouldn't have got away with his scalp on if he'd come creeping into the room of the James boys." ...|$|E
50|$|The paper pasted by {{the boy on}} the {{elevator}} wall was a poster of the short film Punchirikku Parasparam written with the tagline Be Someone Else's Sunshine.

50|$|Upon {{interrogating}} Firmino, Amorim {{is interrupted}} and informed of his compulsory retirement. Disappointed {{with the way}} crime is handled in then current times, he greets a recently promoted Telma as she announces she will take his place. Telma then escorts Carla {{to the back of}} a police SUV while Amorim watches. Barão infiltrates himself among the photographers and smiles <b>at</b> Carla, who <b>smiles</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him in front of a confused Amorim.|$|R
5000|$|Macne Coco White (Mac音ココ白) is friendly, {{calm and}} mature. She is {{responsible}} for keeping the general Macne home running and works at [...] "Macne Cafe" [...] (Mac音カフェ). Though she is always smiling, others {{do not wish to}} see what her angry face might look like so everyone <b>smiles</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her. [...] She and her twin sister Macne Coco Black are 17 years old and currently the eldest two daughters of the Macne family.|$|R
60|$|Cicely <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him. Her {{face was}} scarlet, for the {{coupling}} of their names, and Drexley's quiet smile, was significant. But Douglas only laughed gaily {{as he reached}} for his hat, and drew Cicely's feather boa around her with a little air of protection.|$|E
60|$|Again {{that note}} of {{innocent}} frankness! What a child she was--what a beautiful, ignorant child, utterly unskilled {{in the art}} of hiding her feelings! But why should she hide them? They were as pure and beautiful as herself. Eric <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her with equal frankness.|$|E
60|$|He {{was smiling}} {{and the girl}} <b>smiled</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him. There was a {{slightly}} puzzled expression on her face--there was something tantalizingly familiar about that smile of his. She had met many a panthan--they came and went, following the fighting of a world--but she could not place this one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] replied Mr. Bentley, <b>smiling</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her, [...] "you {{like to see}} them, too. Most persons do. Children are {{not meant}} for the city, my dear young lady, their natural home is {{in the woods and}} fields, and these little fellows are a proof of it. When they come out here, they run wild. You perceive," [...] he added with a twinkle, as an expletive of {{unquestionable}} vigour was hurled across the diamond, [...] "they are not always so polite as they might be." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later Jim and Melinda talk to Aiden. Jim {{tells him}} {{that he should not}} deny his gift, and Melinda tells Aiden that it is called a gift for a reason and that it is neither {{something}} they should hide from each other nor something from which they should run away. As Jim and Melinda leave, Melinda turns to Aiden and {{tells him that}} she really meant it when she said he was her hero. He smiles and answers, [...] "Just like you are, Mom. Every day." [...] As the series concludes, we see Melinda <b>smile</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Aiden.|$|R
