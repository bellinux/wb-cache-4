25|$|Under an MMT {{framework}} where {{government spending}} injects new reserves into the commercial banking system, and taxes withdraw {{it from the}} banking system, government activity would have an instant effect on interbank lending. If on a particular day, the government spends more than it taxes, reserves {{have been added to}} the banking system (see vertical transactions). This will typically lead to a system-wide surplus of reserves, with competition between banks seeking to lend their excess reserves forcing the short-term interest rate down to the <b>support</b> <b>rate</b> (or alternately, to zero if a <b>support</b> <b>rate</b> is not in place). At this point banks will simply keep their reserve surplus with their central bank and earn the <b>support</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
25|$|At the end {{of every}} day, a {{commercial}} bank will have to examine the status of their reserve accounts. Those that are in deficit have the option of borrowing the required funds from the central bank, where they may be charged a lending rate (sometimes known as a discount rate) on the amount they borrow. On the other hand, the banks that have excess reserves can simply leave them with the central bank and earn a <b>support</b> <b>rate</b> from the central bank. Some countries, such as Japan, have a <b>support</b> <b>rate</b> of zero.|$|E
25|$|Banks {{with more}} {{reserves}} {{than they need}} {{will be willing to}} lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the interbank lending market. The surplus banks will want to earn a higher rate than the <b>support</b> <b>rate</b> that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the <b>support</b> <b>rate</b> and the discount rate.|$|E

25|$|The {{alternate}} case {{is where}} the government receives more taxes on a particular day than it spends. In this case, {{there may be a}} system-wide deficit of reserves. As a result, surplus funds will be in demand on the interbank market, and thus the short-term interest rate will rise towards the discount rate. Thus, if the central bank wants to maintain a target interest rate somewhere between the <b>support</b> <b>rate</b> and the discount rate, it must manage the liquidity in the system to ensure that there is the correct amount of reserves in the banking system.|$|E

This strategy was reaffirmed after Ozawa's resignation in June 2010 even though the DPJ's <b>support</b> <b>rate</b> had significantly fallen by then and winning both seats in a SNTV two-member district requires a very high margin in terms of party votes and an equal distribution of votes on the two candidates.|$|E

Paladino defeated Lazio in the Republican primary. Afterwards, Long barred Lorigo from party meetings. Lazio {{dropped out of the}} race on September 27, requiring a vacancy committee to convene and select a replacement; Lorigo claims that Suffolk County chairman Ed Walsh held a meeting among his party's members that claimed a 90 percent <b>support</b> <b>rate,</b> at odds with Long's claims.

50|$|The European Commission {{indicates}} the treaty {{will lead to}} savings of just over half a billion euros in taxes for EU exporters every year, mutual recognition in regulated professions such as architects, accountants and engineers, and easier transfers of company staff and other professionals between the EU and Canada. The European Commission claims CETA will create a more level playing field between Canada and the EU on intellectual property rights. A poll conducted by Angus Reid Institute in February 2017 concluded that 55 per cent of Canadians support CETA, while only 10 per cent oppose it.

Botswana claims to have deported 26,717 Zimbabweans residing in the country illegally in 2002. Beginning the following year, they also began to build an electrified fence along their boundary with Zimbabwe. Botswana's agricultural officials assert that the main purpose of the fence is to stop animal rather than human migration, with the aim of preventing the transmission of foot-and-mouth disease, but Zimbabwe's high commissioner in Gaborone rejects this explanation, calling it an attempt to make Zimbabwe into a [...] "Gaza Strip". One survey found a <b>support</b> <b>rate</b> of 63% for the fence.|$|E
