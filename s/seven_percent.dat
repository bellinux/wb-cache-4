5|$|Voyager 1 {{found that}} about <b>seven</b> <b>percent</b> {{of the volume}} of Saturn's upper {{atmosphere}} is helium (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter's atmosphere), while almost all the rest is hydrogen. Since Saturn's internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds in Saturn. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about 500m/s (1,100mph). The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.|$|E
40|$|Background: Overactive bladder (OAB) is a {{clinical}} syndrome consisting of symptom complex of urgency, {{with or without}} incontinence which has significant effects on {{quality of life and}} has to be managed properly. The aim {{of this study was to}} review the management of OAB by Indonesian urologists. Methods: A self-constructed questionnaires containing diagnostic and treatment options of OAB patients were distributed to Indonesian urologists. This was a cross-sectional study and descriptive analysis method was used to analyze the data. Results: 129 Indonesian urologists participated in this study. Most of them faced more than 20 OAB cases per year with the most common type was OAB without incontinence or dry OAB (57. 4 %). Most urologists (34. 1 %) ordered at least three diagnostic tools to determine OAB. They were bladder diary, urinalysis and scoring system. The most used scoring system (48. 9 %) was the overactive bladder symptoms score (OABSS). Thirty-five point <b>seven</b> <b>percents</b> (35. 7 %) of urologists used antimuscarinic and behavioral therapy as initial therapy. Solifenacin 5 mg/day was the most common antimuscarinic prescribed as the first line therapy (48 %). Most common items commonly evaluated for follow-up: symptoms (96. 9 %), bladder diary (72. 9 %); and drug’s side effect (58. 1 %). When initial therapy had failed, most of the urologists (54. 3 %) chose to increase the dose of antimuscarinic. None of them chose bladder botulinum toxin injection as their additional therapy. Conclusion: OAB is a frequent disorder which remains a challenge for urologists. The management of patients with OAB by Indonesian urologists has been suitable with the previous studies and guidelines. </p...|$|R

The nilgai can tolerate interference by livestock and degradation of vegetation in its habitat better than deer, possibly because they can reach high branches and do not depend on surface vegetation. The sambar deer and nilgai in Nepal have similar dietary preferences. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The protein content of the nilgai's {{should be at least}} <b>seven</b> <b>percent.</b> The nilgai can survive for long periods without water and do not drink regularly even in summer.

Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water.
