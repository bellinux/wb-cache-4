Arcelor Research is developing a numerical tool to support the feasibility analysis and to optimize the design of hot stamped parts made of USIBOR 1500 P®. Among the numerous bricks of such a simulation methodology, formability data of the material are of primary importance as the forming analysis relies on them to make a decision in terms of feasibility. Up to now, there was no experimental procedure available in literature to determine the forming limits of hot <b>stamping</b> <b>material,</b> taking into account the specificities of this process. This paper reports about the research performed in this field. First, an efficient experimental set-up which allows varying all the desired process conditions has been developed. Several hundred Nakazima hot stamping tests have been carried out for various process parameters (stroke, velocity, friction and heat exchange) and blank para-meters (temperature, thickness and shape). The third step consisted in developing and vali-dating an accurate analysis scheme to determine the critical strain values based on the Bragard method. Finally, the critical strain values have been confirmed and comparisons with industrial parts for various process conditions have been performed. In this paper these two last steps are mainly presented...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} two decades, soft lithographic {{techniques}} that circumvent the limitations of photolithography have emerged as important tools for the transfer of patterns with sub-micron dimensions. Among these techniques, microcontact printing (uCP) has shown special promise. In uCP, an elastomeric stamp is first inked with surface-reactive molecules and placed in contact with an ink-reactive surface, resulting in pattern transfer {{in the form of}} self-assembled monolayers in regions of conformal contact. The resolution in uCP is ultimately limited to the diffusion of ink and the elastomechanical properties of the bulk <b>stamping</b> <b>material.</b> One way to improve resolution is to eliminate diffusion by using inkless methods for pattern transfer. Inkless catalytic-uCP uses a chemical reaction between a stamp-immobilized catalyst and surface bearing cognate substrate to transfer pattern in the areas of conformal contact. By using pre-assembled cognate surfaces, the approach extends the range of surfaces readily amenable to patterning while obviating diffusive resolution limits imposed by traditional uCP. In this thesis, we report two methods using inkless catalytic uCP: biocatalytic-uCP utilizes an immobilized enzyme as a catalyst whereas catalytic-uCP utilizes an immobilized small molecule as a catalyst, such as an acid or base. Both catalytic techniques demonstrate pattern transfer at the microscale while using unconventional, acrylate-based stamp materials. Previous results produced with catalytic-uCP have shown pattern transfer with sub- 50 nm edge resolution. In this demonstration of catalytic-uCP, we use the technique to demonstrate a bi-layered patterning technique for H-terminated silicon, the foremost material in semi-conductor fabrication. This technique simultaneously protects the underlying silicon surface from degradation while a highly-reactive organic overlayer remains patternable by acidic-functionalized PU stamps. Lines bearing widths as small as 150 nm were reproduced on the reactive SAM overlayer, which would not be possible without circumvention of diffusion. Before and after patterning, no oxidation of the underlying silicon was observed, preserving desired electronic properties throughout the whole process. This bi-patterning technique could be extended to other technologically-relevant surfaces for further application in organic-based electronic devices and other related technologies.

A process compromising Electron-Beam Lithography of PMMA resist and megasonic development followed by a Reactive Ion Etching process using a hydrogen-bromide plasma to etch into polysilicon provided best results. Ideal passivation of masters was obtained by vapor deposition of a perfluoro-octyl-trichlorosilane. It formed a smooth monolayer on the master´s surface prohibiting sticking of the stamp.

A transfer was only observed {{at the edges of the}} patterns resulting in 60 nm patterns. Redox-active proteins cytochrome c and azurin served as model molecules with a very specific, easy accessible, fragile functionality. Laminin was used as model system with a binding functionality. ECM gel and polylysine were used as model molecules for cell adhesion proteins. Beside their functionality they were used to demonstrate the printing of sub 100 nm patterns, since their mobility at surfaces is rather low due to the huge mass. The binding functionality of laminin was proven to be unchanged. However, the redox activity of cyt c was lost, but this is also true for Wet Inking. Therefore a novel process called In-situ µCP was developed. It was shown, that this process allows to transfer cyt c in a patterned manner without loosing the functionality. The applicability of the protein transfer for the guiding of neuron growth with sub 1 µm patterns was demonstrated. The direction of neurite growth was dominated by the pattern direction. Larger patterns were preferred against thinner lines. First results indicate, that certain patterns might initiate a splitting of neurite bundles or a change of growth direction. Surlyn was used for printing various molecules. In order to use materials with a higher Young´s modulus a novel process called Air-Cushion µCP was introduced.

A novel process “Shuttle-Transfer Printing” was developed in order to transfer pre-patterned metal films with low kinetic energy to arbitrary substrates.

For alkanethiol molecules a tunneling like behavior was found, as expected. For long thiols the tunneling parameters were in agreement with various publications, while for shorter molecules the characteristic was dominated by the roughness of the electrodes. For junction with a cytochrome c interlayer also a tunneling behavior was observed.

A family of filled epoxies that can be cast-to-size into sheet metal stamping dies has been developed by GMR. Advantages of this material over commercial plastic tooling materials are a fast curing rate, high strength, and negligible volume shrinkage after curing. Superior Tooling And Molding Plastic (STAMP) tooling dies are considerably cheaper and faster to make than steel tooling dies; therefore, they are currently used for prototype applications throughout General Motors. With improvement of wear resistance, STAMP dies can be used for limited production applications involving 10, 000 or 20, 000 parts.

40|$|Solid state superionic {{stamping}} (S 4) is a non-photolithographic {{process for}} etching features into thin metal films which {{has shown the}} capability of reproducing features below 100 nm in recent years. The technique has significant potential because {{in addition to its}} high resolution capability it is both fast and inexpensive. Potential applications for this process include applied plasmonic and surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, as well as a many other devices which this process would allow to be scaled-down economically. Previous generations of stamps for this process were developed primarily to test the fundamental limits of the technique. However, for S 4 to become practically applicable in an industrial setting requires a body of knowledge surrounding stamp fabrication that allows the stamps to be simpler to produce than an alternate method for fabricating S 4 processed substrates. Specifically, S 4 stamp generation has been hindered by the ability to generate extremely high quality surfaces. With that in mind, several methods for working with traditional Ag 2 S stamps were examined. One goal was to produce larger diameter stamps without resorting to extensive waste of Ag 2 S. The ductile nature of the material was exploited to change the geometry of the material to increase the portion of the stamp actively participating in etching metal. These larger diameter films were also exploited in an attempt to produce sputtering targets in the hope of generating a new method for fabricating high quality stamps. In contrast to work with the previously demonstrated Ag 2 S <b>stamps,</b> alternative <b>materials</b> for S 4 patterning were also examined based on applicability to the S 4 process. A class of silver conducting superionic materials was identified as potentially beneficial for S 4 based on their low melting points and glass transition temperatures.
