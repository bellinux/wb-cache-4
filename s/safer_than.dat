An Earth-like atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort, and is much <b>safer</b> <b>than</b> the alternative, a pure oxygen atmosphere, because of increased fire risk such as occurred with Apollo 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} risk in flying is in takeoff and landing, meaning that longer aircraft trips are safer per mile.

5|$|In 2015, Ann Arbor {{was ranked}} 11th safest among cities in Michigan with a {{population}} of over 50,000. It ranked <b>safer</b> <b>than</b> cities such as Royal Oak, Livonia, Canton and Clinton Township. The level of most crimes in Ann Arbor has fallen significantly in the past 20 years. In 1995 there were 294 aggravated assaults, 132 robberies and 43 rapes while in 2015 there were 128 aggravated assaults, 42 robberies and 58 rapes (under the revised definition).|$|E
25|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {{depends on}} {{magnetic}} {{activity in the}} brain and does not use X-rays, so it is considered more <b>safe</b> <b>than</b> imaging techniques that do use X-rays.

Both PET and SPECT scans require the injection of radioactive materials, but the half-lives of isotopes used in SPECT can be more easily managed.|$|R

5|$|Dennis Pennington, {{who lived}} near Lanesville, {{became one of}} the county's early leading {{citizens}} and speaker of the territory's legislature. Corydon began competing with other southern Indiana settlements to become the new capital of the territory after its reorganization in 1809. Hostilities broke out in 1811 with the Native American tribes on the frontier, and the territorial capital was moved to Corydon on May1, 1813, after Pennington suggested it would be <b>safer</b> <b>than</b> Vincennes. For the next twelve years, Corydon was the political center of the territory and subsequent state. A state constitution was drafted in Corydon during June 1816 and after statehood the town served as the state capital until 1825.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that {{spent nuclear fuel}} and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from tens of thousands to a million years, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be <b>safer</b> <b>than</b> indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{responsibility}} for recreational diving service providers is usually limited {{as far as}} possible by waivers which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of recreational buddy divers is unclear and {{has been the subject of}} considerable litigation. It is probable that it varies between jurisdictions. In spite of this lack of clarity, buddy diving is recommended by recreational diver training agencies as <b>safer</b> <b>than</b> solo diving, and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs.|$|E

5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a prophylactic {{agent was}} accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem {{at this time}} was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much <b>safer</b> <b>than</b> quinine. Blackwater fever—which had a mortality rate of 25%—disappeared entirely.|$|E
5|$|The Knight on c6 is <b>safer</b> <b>than</b> on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} {{a general}} {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes in handy, in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{away from}} Merton at a {{supposedly}} temporary home, Wimbledon {{set a record}} for the lowest-ever English top-flight attendance on 22 August 1992 with 3,759 watching the clash with Coventry City, before breaking it twice more: 12 December 1992 against Oldham Athletic with 3,386, and finally on 26 January 1993, drawing only 3,039 fans to a Tuesday-night match against Everton, with reportedly 1,500 travelling from Liverpool. All ten of the Premier League's lowest attendances were Wimbledon home matches in the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons. However the general trend {{was one of a}} sharp rise—the club's average home attendance more than doubled at Selhurst Park from around 8,000 during the last years at Plough Lane to a peak of over 18,000 during the 1998–99 Premier League season. Wimbledon's fans were a blend between locals who had supported the club since its non-League days and supporters who had defected from other London teams. According to statistics compiled in 2000, 56% of Wimbledon season-ticket holders were locally born (the second lowest in the Premier League), and only 12% had fathers who were Wimbledon fans. Many attended Wimbledon matches as it was cheaper and <b>safer</b> <b>than</b> other clubs in the capital—Wimbledon had more women and children at their games than any other top-flight club. In 2000, 23% of Wimbledon season-ticket holders earned over £50,000 a year, the second-highest in the division after Chelsea (33%).|$|E

5|$|The {{trend toward}} {{artificial}} ice was hastened by the regular ice famines during the period, {{such as the}} 1898 British famine, which typically caused rapid price increases, fuelled demand for plant ice and encouraged investment in the new technologies. Concerns also grew over the safety of natural ice. Initial reports concerning ice being produced from polluted or unclean lakes and rivers had first emerged in the U.S. {{as early as the}} 1870s. The British public health authorities believed Norwegian ice was generally much purer and <b>safer</b> <b>than</b> American sourced ice, but reports in 1904 noted the risk of contamination in transit and recommended moving to the use of plant ice. In 1907, New York specialists claimed ice from the Hudson River to be unsafe for consumption and potentially containing typhoid germs; the report was successfully challenged by the natural ice industry, but public opinion was turning against natural ice on safety grounds. These fears of contamination was often played on by artificial ice manufacturers in their advertising. Major damage was also done to the industry by fire, including a famous blaze at the American Ice Company facilities at Iceoboro in 1910, which destroyed the buildings and the adjacent schooners, causing around $130,000 ($2,300,000 in 2010 terms) of damage and crippling the Maine ice industry.|$|E
