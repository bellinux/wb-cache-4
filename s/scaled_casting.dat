40|$|An {{effective}} field theory provides a model-independent and phenomenologically powerful parametrisation of new physics in the Higgs sector. We analyse two aspects of this framework that are relevant for measurements of the Higgs properties during Run 2 of the LHC. First, the limited precision of the LHC analyses cannot guarantee a clear hierarchy between the experimental momentum transfer and the probed new physics <b>scales,</b> <b>casting</b> doubt on {{the validity of the}} effective model. By comparing a range of new physics scenarios to their dimension-six approximation, we analyse if an effective description of the Higgs sector is useful, where it breaks down, and how its validity can be improved. Second, we use information geometry to understand and optimise Higgs measurements at the LHC. Our novel approach is based on the Fisher information, which encodes the maximum precision with which theory parameters can be measured in an experiment. We develop an algorithm to calculate the Fisher information in LHC processes and compute the information on dimension-six operators in different Higgs signatures. We demonstrate how information geometry lets us improve event selections, determine the most powerful observables, and compare the power of modern multivariate techniques to that of traditional histogram-based analyses...|$|R
40|$|In cold-chamber {{high-pressure}} die castings (HPDC), {{the microstructure}} consists of coarse externally solidified crystals (ESCs) that are commonly {{observed in the}} central region of cross sections. In the present work, controlled laboratory <b>scale</b> <b>casting</b> experiments have been conducted with particular emphasis on the flow and solidification conditions. An A 356 aluminum alloy was used to produce castings by pouring semi-solid metal through a steel die. Microstructures similar to those encountered in HPDC have been produced and the resulting microstructure is found {{to depend on the}} melt and die temperature: (1) the fraction of ESCs determines the extent of migration to the central region; (2) a maximum packing determines the area fraction of ESCs in the center; and (3) the die temperature affects the position of the ESCs-a higher die temperature can induce a displaced ESC distribution. It is found that the n-figration of crystals to the central region requires a flow, which is constrained at all melt/die interfaces. Furthermore, potential lift mechanisms are discussed. An assessment of the Saffman lift force on individual particles shows it has no significant effect on the migration of ESCs...|$|R

Preparation to the geometrical accuracy analysis of the measured objects consisted of the identification of particular geometrical features based on the large number of probing points, as well as the creation of the coordinate systems derived from the best-fitting algorithms which calculate the inscribed or circumscribed geometrical elements. Analysis of accuracy in every probing point has been performed through the comparison of their coordinates with nominal values set by 3 D model. Application of the 3 D optical coordinate scanner with advanced measurement software for the manufacturing accuracy inspection is very useful in case of large scale details produced with foundry technologies and allows to carry out full accuracy analysis of the examined detail...|$|R

Among the main improvements, the corrosion resistance evaluated both by the chemical method according to the ASTM G- 48 method, as well as electrochemical methods, was achieved.

40|$|Distinction must be {{made between}} real {{clinical}} condition and numbers EDITOR—We disagree with Wiese that the universal use of the revised 15 point Glasgow coma scale is the panacea to solve the recurrent problems communicating with local neurosurgical units. 1 - 3 We believe {{that much of the}} difficulty and confusion is due to assigning a number score to an individual's motor, verbal, and eye responses and subsequently totalling up the three components. At best, this requires decoding by the receiving clinician, and, at worst, valuable information can be lost because of the impossibility of conversion back to clinical responses unless the component scores and denominator are known. To avoid these problems the actual clinical response, rather than a numerical code, should be communicated and documented in the notes. The original Glasgow coma scale by Teasdale and Jennett does not describe a numerical system. 2 The subsequent introduction of such a tool has facilitated stratification of groups of patients in research settings. As a point of interest the neuro-observation charts in use in our unit and, perhaps more importantly, at the Institute of Neurological Sciences in Glasgow continue to describe the original 14 point <b>scale,</b> <b>casting</b> some doubt on Wiese's quote that the revised scale has been the accepted version for 25 years.

40|$|Modeling {{solidification}} microstructures {{has become}} an area of intense study in recent years. The properties of large <b>scale</b> <b>cast</b> products, ranging from automobile engine blocks to aircraft components and other industrial applications, are strongly dependent on the physics that occur at the mesoscopic and microscopic length scales during solidification. The predominant morphology found in solidification microstructures is the dendrite, a tree-like pattern of solid around which solidification proceeds. The microscopic properties of cast products {{are determined by the}} length scales of these dendrites, and their associated segregation profiles. For this reason understanding the mechanisms for pattern selection in dendritic growth has attracted a great deal of interest from the experimental and theoretical communities. In particular, a great deal of research has been undertaken to understand such issues as dendrite morphology, shape and growth speed. Experiments on dendrite evolution in pure materials by Glicksman and coworkers on succinonitrile (SCN), and more recently pivalic acid (PVA), as well as other transparent analogs of metals, have provided tests of theories for dendritic growth, and have stimulated considerable theoretical progress. These experiments have clearly demonstrated that in certain parameter ranges the physics of the dendrite tip can be characterized by a steady value for the dendrite tip velocity, radius of curvature and shape. Away from the tip, the time-dependent dendrite exhibits a characteristic sidebranching as it propagates, which is not yet well understood. These experiments are performed by observing individual dendrites growing into an undercooled melt. The experiments are characterized by the dimensionless undercooling. Most experiments are performed at low undercooling...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a series}} of seismic {{experiments}} designed to improve the understanding of the impact of mining blasts on verifying a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a sixteen station network of three-component seismic sensors were deployed around a large cast shot in the Black Thunder Mine. The seismic stations were placed, where possible, at a range of 2. 5 kilometers with a constant inter-station spacing of 22. 5 degrees. All of the data were recorded with the seismometers oriented such that the radial component pointed to the middle point of the approximately 2 kilometer long shot. High quality data were recorded at each station. Data were scaled to a range of 2. 5 kilometers and the sum of the absolute value of the vertical, radial, and transverse channels computed. These observations were used to construct radiation patterns of the seismic energy propagating from the cast shot. It is obvious that cast shots do not radiate seismic energy isotropically. Most of the vertical motion occurs behind the highwall while radial and transverse components of motion are enhanced in directions parallel to the highwall. These findings have implications for local (0. 1 to 15 kilometer range) and possibly for regional (100 to 2, 000 kilometer range) seismic observations of cast blasting. Locally, {{it could be argued that}} peak particle velocities could be scaled not only by range but also by azimuthal direction from the shot. This result implies that long term planning of pit orientation relative to sensitive structures could mitigate problems with vibration levels from future blasting operations. Regionally, the local radiation pattern may be important in determining the magnitude of large <b>scale</b> <b>cast</b> blasts. Improving the transparency of mining operations to international seismic monitoring systems may be possible with similar considerations...|$|R
