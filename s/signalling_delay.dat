40|$|Now a day’s {{efficient}} mobility {{management for}} mobile users in wireless networking {{is a crucial}} issue. To maintain global mobility in IP networking the Mobile internet protocol has been proposed. To reduce the signalling traffic related to the Mobile Terminals (MTs) registration with the Home Agents (HAs), whenever their Care-of-Addresses (CoAs) change several mobility management strategies have been proposed. And for registration process they use different Foreign Agents (FAs) and Gateway FAs (GFAs) hierarchies. For better and enhanced -mobility MTs, the Hierarchical MIP (HMIP) and Dynamic HMIP (DHMIP) strategies localize the registration in FAs and GFAs, yielding to high-mobility signalling. The registration processes in the GFAs got limitations by Multicast HMIP strategy. And it provides lowest mobility <b>signalling</b> <b>delay</b> compared to the HMIP and DHMIP approaches to achieve high-mobility MTs. However, for frequent MT mobility it is a resource consuming strategy. Hence, To evaluate the mean <b>signalling</b> <b>delay</b> and the mean bandwidth per call according {{to the type of}} MT mobility we propose an analytic model. In all the studied cases the performance of MHMIP is more and accurate as compared to the DHMIP and MIP strategies. In this paper we are proposing the analytic model that allows the mobility management...|$|E

In this work, hence, we propose a general three tier architecture leveraging low cost wireless technologies for acoustic communications between underwater sensors and standard technologies, Zigbee and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), for water surface communications. We have selected a suitable Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, after making a comparison with some common MAC protocols.

The 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) is specifying an IP Multimedia Sub-system (IMS) in UMTS Release 5 / 6, which is adjunct to the UMTS Packet Switched (PS) GPRS CN. This IP-based network will allow mobile operators to provide commonly used Internet applications to wireless user. The UMTS IMS uses the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defined text-based Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), {{to control a}} wide range of anticipated IP-based services offering new services such as multimedia calls, chat, presence services. Initial indications as to the <b>signalling</b> <b>delay</b> associated with SIP messages have concerned operators about the viability of such services over the UMTS air interface.

The work reported here in presents multi-criteria based hard handoff algorithm for micro and macro-cellular architecture. Fuzzy technique has been used as optimization engine. The fuzzy handoff algorithm based on Received Signal Strength (RSS), absolute threshold value, hysteresis level, slope ratios and speed of Mobile Terminal (MT) have been previously developed for conventional cellular networks. In this work the handoff algorithm has been improved by considering two new parameter, <b>signalling</b> <b>delay</b> and angle of motion of MT along with velocity as our input criteria. Two fuzzy models named Mamdani and Sugeno have been used for processing the input criteria. Further, ANFIS has also been used to tune the Sugeno model for parameter adjustment. The proposed fuzzy inference scheme uses triangular and trapezoidal membership function for fuzzification. The types of defuzzification method used are centriod and weighted average formula for Mamdani and Sugeno model respectively.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{unsolicited}} and advertisement telephony calls over traditional and Internet telephony has rapidly increased over recent few years. Every year, the telecommunication regulators, {{law enforcement agencies}} and telecommunication operators receive {{a very large number}} of complaints against these unsolicited, unwanted calls. These unwanted calls not only bring financial loss to the users of the telephony but also annoy them with unwanted ringing alerts. Therefore, it is important for the operators to block telephony spammers at the edge of the network so to gain trust of their customers. In this paper, we propose a novel spam detection system by incorporating different social network features for combating unwanted callers at the edge of the network. To this extent the reputation of each caller is computed by processing call detailed records of user using three social network features that are the frequency of the calls between caller and the callee, the duration between caller and the callee and the number of outgoing partners associated with the caller. Once the reputation of the caller is computed, the caller is then places in a spam and non-spam clusters using unsupervised machine learning. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using a synthetic dataset generated by simulating the social behaviour of the spammers and the non-spammers. The evaluation results reveal that the proposed approach is highly effective in blocking spammer with 2 % false positive rate under a large number of spammers. Moreover, the proposed approach does not require any change in the underlying VoIP network architecture, and also does not introduce any additional <b>signalling</b> <b>delay</b> in a call set-up phase...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a framework for}} bandwidth allocation and scheduling in the Agile All-Photonic Network (AAPN). This framework is also applicable to any single-hop communication network with significant <b>signalling</b> <b>delay</b> (such as satellite-TDMA systems). Slot-by-slot scheduling approaches do not provide adequate performance for wide-area networks, so we focus on frame-based scheduling. We propose three novel fixed-length frame scheduling algorithms (Minimum Cost Search, Fair Matching and Minimum Rejection) and a feedback control system for stabilization. MCS is a greedy algorithm, which allocates time-slots sequentially using a cost function. This function is defined such that the time-slots with higher blocking probability are assigned first. MCS does not guarantee 100 % throughput, thought it has a low blocking percentage. Our optimum scheduling approach is based on modifying the demand matrix such that the network resources are fully utilized, while the requests are optimally served. The Fair Matching Algorithm (FMA) uses the weighted max-min fairness criterion to achieve {{a fair share of}} resources amongst the connections in the network. When rejection is inevitable, FMA selects rejections such that the maximum percentage rejection experienced in the network is minimized. In another approach we formulate the rejection task as an optimization problem and propose the Minimum Rejection Algorithm (MRA), which minimizes total rejection. The minimum rejection problem is a special case of maximum flow problem. Due to the complexity of the algorithms that solve the max-flow problem we propose a heuristic algorithm with lower complexity. Scheduling in wide-area networks must be based on predictions of traffic demand and the resultant errors can lead to instability and unfairness. We design a feedback control system based on Smith's principle, which removes the destabilizing delays from the feedback loop by using a "loop cancelation" technique. The feedback control system we propose reduces the effect of prediction errors, increasing the speed of the response to sudden changes in traffic arrival rates and improving the fairness in the network through equalization of queue-lengths...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{satellites}} for {{mobile communication}} applications {{has become a}} global issue. The use of handheld, vehicle mounted and transportable terminals is a key feature of Satellite Personal Communication Networks (S-PCNs). Due to the higher eirp requirements on the Earths surface and also because of their inherent delay, geostationary (GEO) satellites are not considered suitable for such applications. Instead, constellations of satellites at lower altitudes have been proposed for use in what are termed 2 nd generation mobile satellite communication systems. Low intensity regions in the Earths surrounding trapped radiation bands, have resulted in two altitude bands of specific interest, resulting in two constellation types - LEO (Low Earth Orbit) constellations at around 1, 000 km and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) constellations at around 10, 000 km. A satellite constellation consists {{of a number of}} satellites orbiting at the same altitude and inclination and phased in a specific way. The work reported in this thesis proposes a network control architecture for LEO or MEO based S-PCN systems. Air-interface signalling aspects are then considered for mobility management and call setup signalling. LEO and MEO constellation design aspects and properties are initially considered. Important implications on the control network are drawn based on constellation coverage and connectivity properties. Other system constraints such as terrestrial network interworking considerations as well as user, network operator and regulator requirements are also considered. Finally network and more specifically satellite control signalling is examined before a S-PCN architecture is proposed. The reference architecture results in constellation control being distributed globally with individual satellite control, at any one time, being located at a specific earth station. The use of two earth station types allows network administration to be separated from traffic channel carrying aspects. In order to reduce system setup cost and delay, the reuse of network related standards from the GSM terrestrial mobile communication system is envisaged. An equivalence is made between the S-PCN architecture and the GSMs terrestrial architecture. Network implementation aspects are considered for a 14 satellite MEO constellation. Network implications resulting from the use of LEO and MEO constellations are considered. After an examination of S-PCN traffic demand on a MEO constellation, mobility management signalling is considered. A new approach is proposed based on the use of a positioning system. The performance of this approach is examined from a system signalling viewpoint for both LEO and MEO constellations and a method to minimise the required amount of signalling is described. The air interface signalling procedure for location update, based on a modified GSM network layer protocol, is simulated from a delay point of view for both LEO and MEO constellations. User-originated, user-terminated and user-to-user call setup signalling were also simulated and their delay performance examined. The importance of random access channel delay and of user cooperation with the link were highlighted as aspects which have a significant influence on the average <b>signalling</b> <b>delay.</b> Finally, the effect of common and dedicated control channel system signalling on satellite power consumption, based on busy hour call setup and mobility management signalling estimates, was examined for a MEO constellation. From this, conclusions can be made on the signalling power efficiency of S-PCN systems...|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art {{biochemical}} {{systems for}} medical applications and chemical computing are application-specific and cannot be re-programmed or trained once fabricated. The implementation of adaptive biochemical systems that would offer flexibility through programmability and autonomous adaptation faces major challenges {{because of the}} large number of required chemical species as well as the timing-sensitive feedback loops required for learning. Currently, biochemistry lacks a systems vision on how the user-level programming interface and abstraction with a subsequent translation to chemistry should look like. By developing adaptation in chemistry, we could replace multiple hard-wired systems with a single programmable template that can be (re) trained to match a desired input-output profile benefiting smart drug delivery, pattern recognition, and chemical computing. I aimed to address these challenges by proposing several approaches to learning and adaptation in Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs), a type of simulated chemistry, where species are unstructured, i. e., they are identified by symbols rather than molecular structure, and their dynamics or concentration evolution are driven by reactions and reaction rates that follow mass-action and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Several CRN and experimental DNA-based models of neural networks exist. However, these models successfully implement only the forward-pass, i. e., the input-weight integration part of a perceptron model. Learning is delegated to a non-chemical system that computes the weights before converting them to molecular concentrations. Autonomous learning, i. e., learning implemented fully inside chemistry has been absent from both theoretical and experimental research. The research in this thesis offers the first constructive evidence that learning in CRNs is, in fact, possible. I have introduced the original concept of a chemical binary perceptron that can learn all 14 linearly-separable logic functions and is robust to the perturbation of rate constants. That shows learning is universal and substrate-free. To simplify the model I later proposed and applied the ``asymmetric" chemical arithmetic providing a compact solution for representing negative numbers in chemistry. To tackle more difficult tasks and to serve more complicated biochemical applications, I introduced several key modular building blocks, each addressing certain aspects of chemical information processing and learning. These parts organically combined into gradually more complex systems. First, instead of simple static Boolean functions, I tackled analog time-series learning and signal processing by modeling an analog chemical perceptron. To store past input concentrations as a sliding window I implemented a chemical delay line, which feeds the values to the underlying chemical perceptron. That allows the system to learn, e. g., the linear moving-average and to some degree predict a highly nonlinear NARMA benchmark series. Another important contribution to the area of chemical learning, which I have helped to shape, is the composability of perceptrons into larger multi-compartment networks. Each compartment hosts a single chemical perceptron and compartments communicate with each other through a channel-mediated exchange of molecular species. Besides the feedforward pass, I implemented the chemical error backpropagation analogous to that of feedforward neural networks. Also, after applying mass-action kinetics for the catalytic reactions, I succeeded to systematically analyze the ODEs of my models and derive the closed exact and approximative formulas for both the input-weight integration and the weight update with a learning rate annealing. I proved mathematically that the formulas of certain chemical perceptrons equal the formal linear and sigmoid neurons, essentially bridging neural networks and adaptive CRNs. For all my models the basic methodology was to first design species and reactions, and then set the rate constants either "empirically" by hand, automatically by a standard genetic algorithm (GA), or analytically if possible. I performed all simulations in my COEL framework, which is the first cloud-based chemistry modeling tool, accessible at [URL] I minimized the amount of required molecular species and reactions to make wet chemical implementation possible. I applied an automatized mapping technique, Soloveichik's CRN-to-DNA-strand-displacement transformation, to the chemical linear perceptron and the manual <b>signalling</b> <b>delay</b> line and obtained their full DNA-strand specified implementations. As an alternative DNA-based substrate, I mapped these two models also to deoxyribozyme-mediated cleavage reactions reducing the size of the displacement variant to a third. Both DNA-based incarnations could directly serve as blue-prints for wet biochemicals. Besides an actual synthesis of my models and conducting an experiment in a biochemical laboratory, the most promising future work is to employ so-called reservoir computing (RC), which is a novel machine learning method based on recurrent neural networks. The RC approach is relevant because for time-series prediction it is clearly superior to classical recurrent networks. It can also be implemented in various ways, such as electrical circuits, physical systems, such as a colony of Escherichia Coli, and water. RC's loose structural assumptions therefore suggest that it could be expressed in a chemical form as well. This could further enhance the expressivity and capabilities of chemically-embedded learning. My chemical learning systems may have applications in the area of medical diagnosis and smart medication, e. g., concentration signal processing and monitoring, and the detection of harmful species, such as chemicals produced by cancer cells in a host (cancer miRNAs) or the detection of a severe event, defined as a linear or nonlinear temporal concentration pattern. My approach could replace “hard-coded” solutions and would allow to specify, train, and reuse chemical systems without redesigning them. With time-series integration, biochemical computers could keep a record of changing biological systems and act as diagnostic aids and tools in preventative and highly personalized medicine...|$|E

It is an important and challenging issue to support seamless vertical handoff management in such an integrated architecture that provides the mobile users uninterrupted service continuity anywhere, any time. In such a networking environment, the <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> of the vertical handoff is not fixed due to the traffic load in the backbone Internet, wireless channel quality and the distance between a mobile node and its home network.
