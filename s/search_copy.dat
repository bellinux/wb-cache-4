Parametric design technology is the most common way to achieve rapid design, but less in the electrical design of the specific application. With the electrical equipment model parameterization and the reuse technology model, develop electrical equipment design software based on CAD secondary development. Use of software, design by three levels of reuse technology on the equipment for quick drawing, editing, statistics, to avoid duplication of work more efficiently, to improve design efficiency and reduce human waste...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} BABAZ, {{an audio}} search system to search modified segments in large databases of music or video tracks. It {{is based on}} an efficient audio feature matching system which exploits the reciprocal nearest neighbors to produce a per-match similarity score. Temporal consistency is taken into account based on the audio matches, and boundary estimation allows the precise localization of the matching segments. The method is mainly intended for video retrieval based on their audio track, as typically evaluated in the copy detection task of TRECVID evaluation campaigns. The evaluation conducted on music retrieval shows that our system is comparable to a reference audio fingerprinting system for music retrieval, and significantly outperforms it on audio-based video retrieval, as shown by our experiments conducted on the dataset used in the copy detection task of TRECVID’ 2010 campaign.

A small amount of text is extracted from a document using hash functions and is used as the document's fingerprint. We build upon previous work by Broder et al.

We achieve robustness against these attacks with a new selection process. We also give theoretical and experimental results for these and other attacks on text sifting functions...|$|R

40|$|The {{isomorphic}} subgraph {{problem is}} finding two disjoint subgraphs of a graph which coincide {{on at least}} k edges. The graph is partitioned into a subgraph, its copy, and a remainder. The problem resembles the NP-hard largest common subgraph problem, which <b>searches</b> <b>copies</b> of a graph {{in a pair of}} graphs. In this paper we show that the isomorphic subgraph problem is NP-hard, even for restricted instances such as connected outerplanar graphs. Then we present two different heuristics for the computation of maximal connected isomorphic subgraphs. Both heuristics use weighting functions and have been tested on four independent test suites. Finally, we introduce a spring algorithm which preserves isomorphic subgraphs and displays them as copies of each other. The drawing algorithm yields nice drawings and emphasizes the isomorphic subgraphs...|$|R
