5|$|While an undergraduate, she {{did some}} {{practice}} {{teaching at the}} Chinese high school in town shortly before graduating in 1952. She had won a scholarship to study music at the Philippine Women's University under Maestra Adoracion Reyes, {{a close friend of}} Imelda's cousin, Loreto Romualdez Ramos. She had a job at a music store but left this for a better one at the Central Bank. Straight from the Central Bank, <b>she</b> <b>hurried</b> to the University every day. After a few lessons, Adoracion was convinced Imelda had talent and persuaded her to enroll at the College of Music and Fine Arts at PWU, under a special arrangement that would put her on register while Adoracion would continue to give her free lessons.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, {{she went}} as usual to her holiday home on Belle-Île {{with her family}} and close friends. There, she {{received}} {{the news of the}} assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{and the beginning of the}} First World War. <b>She</b> <b>hurried</b> back to Paris, which was threatened by an approaching German army. In September, Bernhardt was asked by the Minister of War to move to a safer place. She departed for a villa on the Bay of Arcachon, where her physician discovered that gangrene had developed on her injured leg. She was transported to Bordeaux, where on 22 February 1915, a surgeon amputated her leg almost to the hip. She refused the idea of an artificial leg, crutches, or a wheelchair, and instead was usually carried in a palanquin she designed, supported by two long shafts and carried by two men. She had the chair decorated in the Lous XV style, with white sides and gilded trim.|$|E
2500|$|In 1936 she {{was jailed}} {{for the fourth}} time after {{enduring}} gross abuse from the arresting officers in Madrid. Upon her release, <b>she</b> <b>hurried</b> to Asturias to campaign for the PCE in the general elections of February 16. In these elections, 323,310 ballots were cast. However, [...] "one ballot, one vote" [...] did not rule. Each voter could choose up to 13 candidates simultaneously. The PCE received 170,497 votes, enough to seat one member of Parliament, Dolores Ibárruri. The Popular Front's election platform included the release of political prisoners and La Pasionaria set out to free the detainees of Oviedo at once.|$|E

2500|$|Demmin's current chronicler, then 14 years old, recalls:My {{mother was}} also raped. And then, {{together}} {{with us and}} with neighbors, <b>she</b> <b>hurried</b> towards the Tollense river, resolutely prepared to jump into it. [...] My siblings [...] realized only much later that I had held her back, that I had pulled her out {{of what may be}} called a state of trance, to prevent her from jumping into the water. There were people. There was screaming. The people were prepared to die. Children were told: 'Do you want to live on? The town is burning. These and those are dead already. No, {{we do not want to}} live any more.' And so, people went mostly into the rivers. [...] That made even the Russians feel creepy. There are examples where Russians, too, tried to pull people out or hinder them. But these hundreds of people, they were unable to withhold. And the population here was extremely panicked.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1889, Damala reappeared at Bernhardt's door haggard, ill, and penniless. Bernhardt {{instantly}} forgave him, {{and offered}} him {{the role of}} Armand Duval in a new production of Dame aux Camélias at the Variétés. They performed together from 18 May until 30 June. He looked exhausted and old, confused his diction, and forgot his lines. The critic for Le Rappel wrote: [...] "Where is, alas, the handsome Armand Duval who was presented to us {{for the first time}} a few years ago at the Gaiéte?" [...] The critic Francisque Sarcey wrote simply, [...] "he makes us feel sick." [...] When his contract ended, he was able to get another contract as an actor at a different theater, and continued to harass Bernhardt. He attended one of her performances sitting in the first row, and made faces at her. Her current lover, Philippe Garnier, saw him and beat him. Later, he entered her house and ravaged the furniture. Bernhardt was a Roman Catholic, and did not want to divorce him. He continued to act, sometimes with success, particularly in a play by Georges Ohnet, Le Maître des Forges, in 1883. However, his morphine addiction continued to worsen. In August 1889, Bernhardt learned that he taken an overdose of morphine in Marseille. <b>She</b> <b>hurried</b> to his bedside and nursed him until he died on 18 August 1889, at the age of 34. He was buried in Athens. Bernhardt sent a bust she had made of him to be placed on his tomb, and when she toured in the Balkans, always made a detour to visit his grave. Until the end of her life, she continued to sign official documents as [...] "Sarah Bernhardt, widow of Damala".|$|E
