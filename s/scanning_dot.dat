Despite this, however, there are some technical problems of using DOT in biomedical imaging. The main problem is quantification of signals related to the probes in the biological tissue. This may be solved by using a newly proposed dual-wavelength technique in the DOT; this technique involves designing multi-detection probes. Another problem is sensitivity of the detection system. Noise {{is considered to be a}} limiting factor in the technology, making the sensitivity detection of very weak signals difficult. We will build an initial system for the quantification and sensitivity detections, with the system using two diode lasers in the near-infrared wavelengths where the light photons can penetrate deeper into tissues. Polystyrene beads are used for the simulation of the biological tissues. The propagation of light through a solution containing 1. 00 μm polystyrene beads will be investigated for quantification of the signals. Exposure to Research for Science Students Progra...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{dyslexia}} {{is suggested}} to affect approximately 5 - 10 % {{of the population}} (Habib, 2000). The most influential theory of dyslexia is the phonological-deficit theory of dyslexia (Liberman, 1973; Stanovich, 1988; Snowling, 2000). An alternative explanation is that visual deficits can lead to reading difficulties (e. g. Stein & Walsh, 1997). To date the findings are mixed regarding the extent of visual deficits within the dyslexic population. Whether these problems represent a cause, correlation or consequence of the reading difficulty also remains highly controversial. The data presented throughout this Thesis examined the possibility that reading difficulties, associated with dyslexia, are linked to poor binocular coordination. In three experiments binocular eye movements of adults, typically developing children and children with dyslexia were measured while they read sentences or <b>scanned</b> <b>dot</b> string targets. In these experiments findings of previous binocular studies were replicated. Specifically, fixation disparity was modulated by the amplitude of the preceding saccade and the fixation position on the screen regardless of whether fixations and saccades were targeted to dots or words. Additionally, during the <b>dot</b> <b>scanning</b> task adult’s binocular coordination was improved in relation to children’s, but no reliable {{differences were found between}} the three groups. Critically, a significantly greater magnitude of fixation disparity was found for dyslexic children compared to typically developing children and adults during the reading task alone. The existence of linguistically modulated differences in binocular coordination for dyslexic children is a novel finding. The patterns of results from the three experiments indicate that poor binocular coordination in dyslexic children is restricted to reading linguistic material. Clearly, this represents a stimulus specific deficit in regard to binocular coordination, for children with dyslexia. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The method of pattern generation, however, is fundamentally different and allows arbitrary illumination patterns to be generated under programmable control, and sectioning strategies to be changed rapidly in response to specific experimental conditions. Mie report the features of a PAM incorporating a digital micromirror device, including the axial sectioning response to fluorescent thin films and the imaging of biological specimens. Three axial sectioning strategies were compared: line <b>scans,</b> <b>dot</b> lattice <b>scans</b> and pseudo-random sequence scans. The three strategies varied widely in light throughput, sectioning strength and robustness when used on real biological samples. The axial response to thin fluorescent films demonstrated a consistent decrease in the full width at half maximum (FWHM), accompanied by an increase in offset, as the unit cells defining the patterns grew smaller. Experimental axial response curves represent the sum of the response from a given point of illumination and cross-talk from neighbouring points, Cross-talk is minimized in the plane of best focus and when measured together with the single point response produces a decrease in FWHM, In patterns having constant throughput, there appears to be tradeoff between the FWHM and the size of the offset. The PAM was compared to a confocal laser scanning microscope using biological samples. The PAM demonstrated higher signal levels and dynamic range despite a shorter acquisition time.

But {{it is not just}} the structure of a molecule that is of interest. It is of equal importance to visualize as many of its properties as possible on a submolecular scale. Scanning probe microscopy with single-molecule sensors and transducers offers a framework to approach this challenge [1]. If the junction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is functionalized with a nanoscale particle, images can be obtained that reveal the geometric structure the sample [2]. The particle (H 2, CO, Xe) acts as a force sensor, sensing forces and transducing them into a conductance signal [3, 4] that can be calibrated [5]. Indications of intermolecular bonding can also be seen [6, 7]. Even the local curvature of the potential can be measured [8]. More recently, we introduced <b>scanning</b> quantum <b>dot</b> microscopy (SQDM). It images electrostatic potentials with sub-nm and sub-meV resolution [9, 10]. An aromatic molecule is attached to the tip of an AFM. Single electron charging events of this molecular quantum dot are detected in the dynamic response of the AFM. SQDM, an example of the sensor/transducer approach, can measure electrostatic fields of neutral atoms or molecules as far as 7 nm away from the surface, providing quantitative 3 D imaging of electric fields of a wide variety of nanostructures.

In 32 of these cirrhosis was present; the other 18 scans were from patients {{with a wide variety of}} con-ditions, including secondary deposits, hepatitis, and diseases involving the reticuloendothelial system. A measure of the total activity in the spleen was derived from the peak activity and the length of the spleen. In cirrhosis this was closely related to the finding of oesophageal varices thus showing the importance of a collateral circulation (which allows colloid to bypass the liver) in the increased uptake of colloid by the spleen.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{results obtained}} by a novel scanning technique, called Subsurface Charge Accumulation (SCA) Imaging, {{that enables the}} direct imaging of electronic systems buried inside semiconductor materials. Using SCA Imaging, we image and measure properties of a two-dimensional electron system (2 DES) in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, in the regime of the integer quantum Hall effect. We observe general charging features in a plain 2 DES near quantum Hall integer filling factors. We proceed by imaging low compressibility strips {{in the presence of}} an artificially created density gradient in the 2 DES. We study them in detail at Landau level filling factors v = 2, 4. The strips appear significantly wider than predicted by theory and we account for the discrepancy by presenting a model that considers the disorder-induced nonzero density of states in the cyclotron gap. We also measure the charging properties of incompressible strips that form parallel to the edges of a metal gate deposited on the surface of our sample. An RC model considering charging of the 2 DES across the strip, closely fits the data. This allows us to determine the longitudinal resistivity of the incompressible part of the edge state that runs parallel to the gate, for a range of filling factors. Surprisingly, the strip becomes more resistive in regions of high electronic density gradient, where its width is expected to decrease. By sensing charge from the motion of single electrons inside the 2 DES we produce a topographic map of the random potential inside the integer quantum Hall liquid. (cont.) We achieve this by creating a mobile quantum dot inside the 2 DES. By <b>scanning</b> the <b>dot,</b> single electrons enter or leave it, in response to the local potential. Detection of this motion leads {{to the creation of a}} potential contour map. We find that the 2 D electron screening of the random potential induced by external impurities, changes little between quantum Hall plateaus and within each plateau.

40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) have been {{considered}} as premium future power generation devices because they have demonstrated high energy-conversion efficiency, high power density, and extremely low pollution, and have the flexibility of using hydrocarbon fuel. The Solid-State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) initiative, supported by the U. S. Department of Energy and private industries, is leading the development and commercialization of SOFCs for low-cost stationary and automotive markets. The targeted power density for the initiative is rather low, so that the SECA SOFC can be operated at a relatively low temperature (approx. 700 C) and inexpensive metallic interconnects can be utilized in the SOFC stack. As only NASA can, the agency is investigating SOFCs for aerospace applications. Considerable high power density {{is required for the}} applications. As a result, the NASA SOFC will be operated at a high temperature (approx. 900 C) and ceramic interconnects will be employed. Lanthanum chromite-based materials have emerged as a leading candidate for the ceramic interconnects. The interconnects are expected to co-sinter with zirconia electrolyte to mitigate the interface electric resistance and to simplify the processing procedure. Lanthanum chromites made by the traditional method are sintered at 1500 C or above. They react with zirconia electrolytes (which typically sinter between 1300 and 1400 C) at the sintering temperature of lanthanum chromites. It has been envisioned that lanthanum chromites with lower sintering temperatures can be co-fired with zirconia electrolyte. Nonstoichiometric lanthanum chromites can be sintered at lower temperatures, but they are unstable and react with zirconia electrolyte during co-sintering. NASA Glenn Research Center s Ceramics Branch investigated a glycine nitrate process to generate fine powder of the lanthanum-chromite-based materials. By simultaneously doping calcium on the lanthanum site, and cobalt and aluminum on the chromium site, we could sinter the materials below 1400 C. The doping concentrations were adjusted so that the thermal expansion coefficient matched that of the zirconia electrolyte. Also, the investigation was focused on stoichiometric compositions so that the materials would have better stability. Co-sintering and chemical compatibility with zirconia electrolyte were examined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy (line <b>scanning</b> and <b>dot</b> map).

The application of DOT {{as a tool to}} aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is explored in this work. Algorithms for improving the image reconstruction process and for enhancing the clinical value of DOT images are presented in detail. The clinical data considered in this work consists of 99 fingers from subjects with RA and 120 fingers from healthy subjects. <b>DOT</b> <b>scans</b> of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of each finger is performed with modulation frequencies of 0, 300, and 600 MHz. A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) framework for extracting heuristic features from DOT images and a method for using these same features to classify each joint as affected or not affected by RA is presented. The framework is applied to the clinical data and results are discussed in detail. Then, an algorithm for recovering the optical properties of biological media using the simplified spherical harmonics (SPN) light propagation model is presented. The computational performance of the algorithm is analyzed and reported. Finally, the SPN reconstruction algorithm is applied to clinical data of subjects with RA and the resulting images are analyzed with the CAD framework. As {{the first part of the}} CAD framework, heuristic image features are extracted from the absorption and the scattering coefficient images using multiple compression and dimensionality reduction techniques. Overall, 594 features are extracted from the images of each joint. Then, machine-learning techniques are used to evaluate the ability to discriminate between images of joints with RA and images of healthy joints. An evolution-strategy optimization algorithm is developed to evaluate the classification strength of each feature and to find the multidimensional feature combination that results in optimal classification accuracy. Classification is performed with k-nearest neighbors (KNN), linear (LDA) and quadratic discriminate analysis (QDA), self-organizing maps (SOM), or support vector machines (SVM). Classification accuracy is evaluated based on diagnostic sensitivity and specificity values. Strong evidence is presented that suggest there are clear differences between the tissue optical parameters of joints with RA and joints without RA. It is first shown that data obtained at 600 MHz leads to better classification results than data obtained at 300 and 0 MHz. Analysis of each extracted feature shows that DOT images of subjects with RA are statistically different (p < 0. 05) from images of subjects without RA for over 90 % of the features. Evidence shows that subjects with RA that do not have detectable signs of erosion, effusion, or synovitis (i. e. asymptomatic subjects) in MRI and US images have optical profiles similar to subjects who do have signs of erosion, effusion, or synovitis; furthermore, both of these cohorts differ from healthy controls subjects. This shows that it may be possible to accurately identify asymptomatic subjects with <b>DOT</b> <b>scans.</b> In contrast, these subjects remain difficult to identify from MRI and US images. The implications of these results are profound, as they suggest it may be possible to identify RA with DOT at an earlier stage compared to standard imaging techniques. Results from the feature-selection algorithm show that the SVM algorithm (with a third order polynomial kernel) achieves 100. 0 % sensitivity and 97. 8 % specificity. Lower bounds for these results (at 95. 0 % confidence level) are 96. 4 % and 93. 8 %, respectively. Image features most predictive of RA are from the spatial variation of optical properties and the absolute range in feature values. The optimal classifiers are low dimensional combinations (< 7 features). Robust cross- validation is performed to ensure the generalization of these classification results. The SPN -based reconstruction algorithm uses a reduced-Hessian sequential quadratic programming (rSQP) PDE-constrained optimization approach to maximize computational efficiency. The complex-valued forward model, or frequency domain SPN equations (N = 1, 3), is discretized using the finite-volume method and solved on unstructured computational grids using the restarted GMRES algorithm. The image reconstruction algorithm is presented in detail and its performance benchmarked against the ERT algorithm. The algorithm is subsequently used to recover the absorption and scattering coefficient images of joints scanned in the RA clinical study. While the SPN model is inherently less accurate than the ERT model, it is nevertheless shown that the images obtained with the SP 3 -based reconstruction algorithm are sufficiently accurate and allow for the diagnosis of RA at clinically relevant sensitivity [87. 9 % (78. 1 %, 100. 0 %) ] and specificity [92. 9 % (84. 6 %, 100. 0 %) ] values (the 95. 0 % confidence interval is specified in brackets). In contrast to results obtained with the SP 3 model, the images generated with the SP 1 algorithm yield significantly lower sensitivity [66. 7 % (46. 6 %, 100. 0 %) ] and specificity [81. 0 % (64. 8 %, 100. 0 %) ] values. While some numerical accuracy is sacrificed by selecting the SP 3 model over the ERT model, the superior computational performance of the SP 3 algorithm allows for computation of the absorption and the scattering coefficient images in under 15 minutes and requires less than 200 MB of RAM per finger (compared to the over 180 minutes and over 6 GB of RAM needed by the ERT-based algorithm). Overall, results indicate that the SP 3 -based reconstruction algorithm provides computational advantages over the ERT-based algorithm without sacrificing significant classification accuracy. In contrast, the SP 1 model provides computational advantages compared to the ERT at the expense of classification accuracy. This indicates that the frequency-domain SP 3 model is an ideal light propagation model for use in <b>DOT</b> <b>scanning</b> of finger joints with RA. Altogether, the results presented in this dissertation underscore the high potential for DOT to become a clinically useful diagnostic tool. The algorithms and framework developed as part of this dissertation can be directly used on future data to help further validate the hypotheses presented in this work and to further establish DOT imaging as a valuable diagnostic tool...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of semiconducting quantum dot nanoparticles (QDs) within thermotropic liquid crystalline (LC) materials are studied in this thesis. LC materials {{are ideal for}} bottom-up organization of nanoparticles as an active matrix that can be externally manipulated via electric or magnetic fields. In addition, the optical properties of QDs can be modified by the surrounding LC resulting in novel devices such as a quantum dot/liquid crystal laser. The first system studies the dispersion of spherical nanoparticles in the phase. The dispersion is investigated {{with the use of}} polarized optical microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and confocal <b>scanning</b> microscopy. Quantum <b>dots</b> well dispersed in the isotropic phase are expelled from ordered domains of LC at the phase transition. Under controlled conditions, the majority of QDs in the system can form ordered three dimensional assemblies that are situated at defect points in the liquid crystal. The internal order of the assemblies is probed utilizing Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), combined with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Furthermore, the location of these assemblies can be predetermined with the use of beads as defect nucleation points in the cell. 	The {{interaction of}} QDs in a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) is also investigated. The reflection band created by the periodic change of index of refraction in a planar aligned CLC acts as a 1 -D photonic cavity when the CLC is doped with a low concentration of QDs. A Cano-wedge cell varies the pitch of the CLC leading to the formation of Grandjean steps. This spatially tunes the photonic stop band, changing the resonance condition and continuously altering both the emission wavelength and polarization state of the QD ensemble. Using high resolution spatially and spectrally resolved photoluminescence measurements, the emission is shown to be elliptically polarized and that the tilt of the ellipse, while dependent on the emission wavelength, additionally varies with distance across the Grandjean steps. Using ultrafast spectroscopic techniques the time-resolved emission from QD ensembles in CLC matrices with either planar or homeotropic alignment is observed. In the case of planar alignment and a well-defined spectral stop band the emergence of a second, faster decay time of less than 2 ns is observed. This short recombination pathway is observed only in samples where the QD emission spectrum partially overlaps the CLC stop band by 50 % or more. Samples prepared with homeotropic alignment do not have a stop band and, consequently, do not lead to spectral or dynamical modulation of the QD emission. These observations indicate that coupling between the excitonic and the photonic cavity modes results in an enhancement and modulation of spontaneous emission in the liquid crystal medium. This work opens up the possibility of designing new QD based optical devices, such as tunable single photon sources, where spatial control of wavelength and polarization of the embedded QDs would allow great flexibility and added functionalities. For hybrid materials such as soft tunable photonic devices like liquid crystal lasers, stable dispersions of nanoparticles in LC are desired. For the system we investigate functionalizing the nanoparticles with LC like ligands. Isotropic and mesogenic ligands attached to the surface of CdSe (core only) and CdSe/ZnS (core/shell) QDs. The mesogenic ligand's flexible arm structure enhances ligand alignment with the local liquid crystal director, enhancing QD dispersion in the isotropic and nematic phases. To characterize QD dispersion on different length scales, fluorescence microscopy, x-ray scattering and scanning confocal photoluminescent imaging are used. These combined techniques demonstrate that the LC-modified QDs do not aggregate into the dense clusters observed for dots with simple isotropic ligands when dispersed in liquid crystal, but loosely associate in a fluid-like aggregate with an average inter-particle spacing of > 10 nm. 	The major goal in this research is to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} utilizing liquid crystal materials for hybrid and metamaterials. The techniques developed within this thesis will be useful for the next step of bottom-up metamaterial fabrication...|$|R
