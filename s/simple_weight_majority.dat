40|$|In {{this paper}} we use Block's {{classification}} of simple modules {{over the first}} Weyl algebra to obtain a complete classification of <b>simple</b> <b>weight</b> modules, in particular, of Harish-Chandra modules, over the 1 -spatial ageing algebra age(1). Most of these modules have infinite dimensional weight spaces and so far the algebra age(1) is the only Lie algebra having <b>simple</b> <b>weight</b> modules with infinite dimensional weight spaces for which such a classification exists. As an application we classify all <b>simple</b> <b>weight</b> modules over the (1 + 1) -dimensional space-time Schrodinger algebra S that have a simple age(1) -submodule thus constructing many new <b>simple</b> <b>weight</b> S-modules.

40|$|Let g be a {{classical}} Lie superalgebra of type I or a Cartan-type Lie superalgebra W(n). We study weight g-modules using a method inspired by Mathieu's classification of the <b>simple</b> <b>weight</b> modules with finite weight multiplicities over reductive Lie algebras, M.

This allows us to transfer many results for category O modules to the category of weight modules with finite weight multiplicities. As a main application of the method we reduce the problems of finding a g_ 0 -composition series and a character formula for all <b>simple</b> <b>weight</b> modules to the same problems for <b>simple</b> highest <b>weight</b> modules. In this way, using results of Serganova we obtain a character formula for all <b>simple</b> <b>weight</b> W(n) -modules and all simple atypical nonsingular s l (m| 1) -modules.

We reduce classification of <b>simple</b> <b>weight</b> modules over weak generalized Weyl algebras to description of the dynamics of the action of the above mentioned endomorphism on the set of maximal ideals.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that adding obesity gene feedback (FTO) to <b>simple</b> <b>weight</b> control advice at a life stage with raised risk of weight gain (university) increases readiness to control weight. METHODS: Individually randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of: (i) <b>simple</b> <b>weight</b> control advice plus FTO feedback (FA) and (ii) <b>simple</b> <b>weight</b> control advice only (AO) on readiness to engage with weight control. Differences in stage of change by genotype and differential weight control behaviors were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1, 016 participants randomized, only 279 completed follow-up, yielding 90 % power to detect a small effect for readiness to control weight. As predicted, FA participants {{were more likely to}} be in the contemplation stage than AO participants (P = 0. 023). Participants receiving higher-risk genetic results were at a higher stage of change than controls (P = 0. 003), with a trend toward a higher stage of change than those getting lower-risk results (P = 0. 051). Lower-risk results did not decrease weight control intentions compared with controls (P = 0. 55). There were no group differences in adherence to recommended weight control behaviors (P = 0. 87). CONCLUSIONS: Adding FTO feedback to weight control advice enhanced readiness to control weight, without evidence for genetic determinism, but had no more effect on behavior than weight control advice alone...|$|R
