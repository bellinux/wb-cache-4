40|$|A {{postulated}} {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) {{shall be}} analyzed {{to assure the}} safety of a research reactor. The analysis of such accident could be performed using best estimate thermal-hydraulic codes, such as RELAP 5. This study focuses on analysis of LOCA in TRIGA- 2000 due to pipe and beam tube break. The objective is to understand the effect of break size and the actuating time of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) on the accident consequences and to assess the safety of the reactor. The analysis is performed using RELAP/SCDAPSIM codes. Three different break size and actuating time were studied. The results confirmed that the larger break size, the faster coolant blow down. But, the <b>siphon</b> <b>break</b> holes could prevent the core from risk of dry out due to siphoning effect in case of pipe break. In case of beam tube rupture, the ECCS is able to delay the fuel temperature increased where the late actuation of the ECCS could delay longer. It could be concluded that the safety of the reactor is kept during LOCA throughout the duration time studied. However, to assure the integrity of the fuel for the long term, the cooling system after ECCS last should be considered.   Keywords: safety analysis, LOCA, TRIGA, RELAP 5   STUDI PARAMETRIK LOCA DI TRIGA- 2000 MENGGUNAKAN RELAP 5 /SCDAP. Kecelakaan kehilangan air pendingin (LOCA) harus dianalisis untuk menjamin keselamatan suatu reaktor riset. Analisis LOCA dapat dilakukan menggunakan perhitungan best-estimate seperti RELAP 5. Penelitian ini menekankan pada analisis LOCA di TRIGA- 2000 akibat pecahnya pipa dan tabung berkas. Tujuan penelitian adalah memahami efek ukuran kebocoran dan waktu aktuasi sistem pendingin teras darurat (ECCS) pada sekuensi kejadian dan mengkaji keselamatan reaktor. Analisis dilakukan menggunakan program perhitungan RELAP/SCDAPSIM. Tiga ukuran kebocoran dan waktu aktuasi ECCS berbeda dipilih sebagai parameter dalam studi ini.   Hasil perhitungan mengonfirmasi bahwa semakin besar ukuran kebocoran, semakin cepat pengosongan tangki reaktor. Lubang siphon breaker dapat mencegah air terkuras dalam hal kebocoran pada pipa. Sedang dalam hal kebocoran pada beam tube, ECCS mampu memperlambat kenaikan temperatur bahan bakar. Dari studi ini dapat disimpulkan bahwa keselamatan reaktor dapat terjaga pada kejadian LOCA, namun pendinginan jangka panjang perlu dipertimbangkan untuk menjaga integritas bahan bakar.

40|$|To {{ensure the}} safety of {{research}} reactors, the water level must be maintained above the required height. When a pipe ruptures, the siphon phenomenon causes continuous loss of coolant until the hydraulic head is removed. To protect the reactor core from this kind of accident, a siphon breaker has been suggested as a passive safety device. This study mainly focused on two variables: the size of the pipe rupture and the timing of air entrainment. In this study, the size of the pipe rupture was increased to the guillotine break case. There was a region in which a larger pipe rupture did not need a larger siphon breaker, and the water flow rate was related {{to the size of the}} pipe rupture and affected the residual water quantity. The timing of air entrainment was predicted to influence residual water level. However, the residual water level was not affected by the timing of air entrainment. The experimental cases, which showed the characteristic of partical sweep-out mode in the separation of <b>siphon</b> <b>breaking</b> phenomenon [2], showed almost same trend of physical properties...|$|R
40|$|The master´s thesis {{focuses on}} the {{behavior}} of the siphon turbine during unsteady flow. There are two possible conditions. The first condition involves commissioning the turbine. In this situation turbine works like a pump. In the second case, it includes shutting down the turbine by aerating the <b>siphon</b> and thereby <b>breaking</b> the water column. This thesis deals with the second case, where the results of the experiment and the mathematical model are compared...|$|R
50|$|The Encyclopædia Britannica {{currently}} {{describes a}} siphon as:Siphon, also spelled syphon, instrument, {{usually in the}} form of a tube bent to form two legs of unequal length, for conveying liquid over the edge of a vessel and delivering it at a lower level. Siphons may be of any size. The action depends upon the influence of gravity (not, as sometimes thought, on the difference in atmospheric pressure; a siphon will work in a vacuum) and upon the cohesive forces that prevent the columns of liquid in the legs of the <b>siphon</b> from <b>breaking</b> under their own weight. At sea level, water can be lifted a little more than 10 metres (33 feet) by a siphon.In civil engineering, pipelines called inverted siphons are used to carry sewage or stormwater under streams, highway cuts, or other depressions in the ground. In an inverted siphon the liquid completely fills the pipe and flows under pressure, as opposed to the open-channel gravity flow that occurs in most sanitary or storm sewers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} was {{the study of}} a fuel injection system in continuous combustor. Air atomizing nozzle is developed to good efficiency injection and used low air pressure (68. 95 - 275. 79 kPa) to assist the atomizing nozzle. Refined palm oil and automotive diesel oil were the fuels for the experiment for the system of atomization. The atomizer was designed {{in a manner that}} air could flow through the small nozzle. Consequently, the low-pressure airflow could induce fuel by <b>siphoning</b> and <b>break</b> oil into small fine droplets that were delivered through the outlet. The aim of design and develop a continuous combustor is emphasized on simplicity for construction, inexpensive, good stability and reduce import fuel for continuous combustor. Material for combustor chamber is stainless steel in order to avoid oxidation at high combustion temperature. The results showed practical combustion performance using refined palm oil as fuel with ultra-low CO and HC emissions less than 206 ppm and 7 ppm. Another main advantage is a clean combustion, as no sulfur content in the fuel. As a result, the combustor performance testing was evaluated with refined palm oil and LPG. By regulating atomizing air pressure between 68. 9995 - 275. 79 kPa (10 - 40 psi, Siphon height 0. 45 m) and regulating LPG pressure of 6. 8 kPa (1 psi), result showed that 0. 0001167 - 0. 00019936 kg/s of fuel consumption, hot gas produced from combustion was in the range of 308 - 4980 C depending on oxidizing air mass flow regulated between 0. 0695 - 0. 1067 kg/s. The LPG mass flow was regulated 0. 000489 kg/s in order to sustain the combustion stability...|$|R
