40|$|Carbon dioxide {{capturing}} {{from the}} flue gas of power stations {{is an effective}} way to mitigate the global warming. In order to predict the performance from startup to stable operation in CO absorption process, a multi-field synergy model was developed based on CO capture process in a packed column by means of monoethanolamine (MEA). The model suggests that the integral diffusion-reaction coefficient {{plays an important role in}} the diffusion, fluid flow, heat transfer and chemical reaction processes. The influences of the fluid flow, heat transfer and chemical reaction can be justified using corresponding synergy numbers, quantifying multi-field interactive dynamic characteristics of the CO capture process. The simulation shows a good agreement compared with data in the literature. The results show that the packing Reynolds number can be used as a criterion to choose the proper packing. The less the Reynolds number is, the more efficient the reaction absorption is. The average synergy number F would be decreased by 20 % with 6 K temperature drop and be descended by 7 % with the 2. 5 % solvent weight percentage increment, which improved the efficiency of CO capture by about 5 % and 14 %, and lowered the energy consumption by about 5 %. The average synergy number F would be decreased by about 8 % with the 0. 062 mol/molMEA lean solvent loading increment, which improved the efficiency by about 15 % and lowered the energy consumption by 5 %. After comparing with CMR- 2, Raschig rings, Berl saddles and Pall rings, the 33 % less average synergy number F of the CMR- 2 packing with about 5 % drop in energy consumption yields the highest efficiency of 71 %, which is 10 % higher than that of the Berl <b>saddle</b> <b>packing.</b> The results indicate that the proposed multi-field synergy model is {{an effective way to}} intensify the capture process as a guideline with the priority of precision and simplicity...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} girth construction and tension on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange during supramaximal treadmill exercise in horses. Methods Six healthy detrained Thoroughbred horses were exercised on a treadmill inclined at 10 % at 110 % VO(2) max. Horses were instrumented for respiratory mechanics and gas exchange studies, and data were recorded during incremental exercise tests. The animals were exercised for 2 min at 40 % VO(2) max, and samples and measurements were collected at 1 min 45 sec. After 2 min, speed was increased to that estimated at 110 % VO(2) max and data was collected at 45 sec, 90 sec and every 30 sec thereafter at this speed until the horses fatigued. Horses were run on three occasions with the same racing saddle and <b>saddle</b> <b>packing</b> but using two different girths, either an elastic girth: (EG) or a standard canvas girth (SCG) which is nonelastic. A run with 5 kg tension applied to a standard canvas girth was the control for each horse, with additional runs at 15 kg using either the standard canvas girth or using the elastic girth, The runs were randomised and tensions applied were measured at end exhalation whilst at rest. Results Increasing girth tension was not associated with changes in respiratory mechanical or gas exchange properties. Although girths tightened to 15 kg tension had short run to fatigue times this was not found to be significantly different to girths set at 5 kg resting tension. Girth tensions declined at end exhalation in horses nearing fatigue. Conclusions Loss in performance associated with high girth tensions is not due to alteration of respiratory mechanics. Loss in performance may be related to inspiratory muscles working at suboptimal lengths due to thoracic compression or compression of musculature around the chest. However, these changes are not reflected in altered respiratory mechanical or gas exchange properties measured during tidal breathing during supramaximal exercise. Other factors may hasten the onset of fatigue when horses exercise with tight girths and further studies are required to determine why excessively tight girths affect performance...|$|E

OBJECTIVES • To develop a peduncle style tag and tag deployment system as a means of attaching medium to long-term tags to free swimming whales. Two different systems are currently under development: 1) a pole deployed peduncle <b>saddle</b> <b>pack</b> tag for mid-sized whales 2) a net gun deployed towed telemetry buoy for large whales • To demonstrate the potential of the peduncle style tag as a benign medium to long-term, noninvasive tag attachment platform either through field trials or in a captive animal setting. APPROACH Peduncle <b>saddle</b> <b>pack</b> tag A padded harness will fit around the tail stock of the whale at the narrowest portion of the peduncle just before the fluke insertion point. To deploy the belt, a cantilevered pole mounted on the bow of a small inflatable will drop a spring loaded armature on the caudal terminus of the whale (Figure 1). Once triggered, the armature’s sickle shaped arms will close, latching a buckle under the whale’s belly. As the arms lift away, the elasticized belt is cinched to snugly secure the semi-rigid saddle housing the tag electronics to the dorsal ridge of the peduncle.
