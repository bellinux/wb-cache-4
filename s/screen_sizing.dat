5000|$|Two Sandvik hybrid rolls crushers {{perform the}} primary and {{secondary}} crushing duties at gaps of approximately 60 and 40 mm respectively. These crushers were preferred over jaw crushers as they should cope better with the high clay content of the ore {{in the early years}} of operation. The secondary crusher product is conveyed into a Sepro scrubber where the material is washed to remove fines sticking to the coarser material. The majority of material from the scrubber reports to a double-deck <b>screen,</b> <b>sizing</b> at 9 and 4 mm. Oversize material (>9 mm) material from the scrubber and this screen is conveyed to two Sandvik cone crushers with a closed size setting of 12 - 15 mm, before returning onto the scrubber screen. Material between 9 and 4 mm in size reports to the DMS circuit. The undersize from the scrubber screen (<4 mm) is pumped onto a second screen where it is sized at 0.5 mm. The oversize for this screen makes up further DMS feed, and the undersize from this screen (< 0.5mm) reports to a large holding tank that stores feed for the gravity circuit.|$|E
40|$|Reports {{from the}} 2000 and 2001 seed corn crop {{indicated}} quality problems after the seed was sized, conditioned and then planted. These problems were not {{predicted by the}} traditional measures of warm and cold germination. We suspect that damage to the seed, especially that of newer, more fragile hybrids, was occurring in the sizing of the corn seed, and that a different sizing method would result in less damage. A seed corn sizing method utilizing a flat <b>screen</b> <b>sizing</b> system was compared to conventional round cylinder precision graders, using production sized machines operating at their rated capacities. Test results showed the flat <b>screen</b> <b>sizing</b> method caused less damage to the seed, {{as measured by the}} fast green dye test, than did cylinder sizing. There were no significant trends between the two in terms of warm and cold germination. This may explain why warm and cold germination tests did not predict quality problems when the seed was planted—seed damaged in the commonly used cylinder graders was more susceptible to conditions that affected actual field germination...|$|E
40|$|Performance of two product screens (137 Sc- 16 / 17) {{constantly}} flooding at UG 2 plant were assessed. Root {{causes for}} the flooding were investigated {{as well as}} a benchmarking with the performance of non-flooding screens performance. Samples for the screens 137 Sc- 16 / 17 feed and oversize were collected for three days, and prepared according to plant standards for sample preparations in order to obtain the particle size distribution (PSD). The first PSD results of the feed were given to Barcandyle which is mechanical engineering experts for <b>screen</b> <b>sizing</b> and their findings were used in this project for optimization purposes. The PSDs of the screens undersize, oversize and feed were used to draw cumulative percent passing and these graphs were used with the effective formula in order to determine screen performances. It was observed that 137 SC- 17 was more efficient than 137 SC- 16 and also that the major cause of flooding was due to the woodchips blinding the screen panels. From these findings the aperture size of 137 SC- 16 was changed from 0. 63 mm to 0. 8 mm. The screens still flood during spikes time due insufficient picking points for wood at UG 2 plant...|$|E
40|$|Biomass size {{reduction}} {{is the first}} step for biofuel production from cellulosic biomass through biochemical pathway, and it is usually performed on a mill with screen installed to control the size of the produced particles. The absence of in-depth knowledge about the effects of <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> throughout the biochemical conversion of cellulosic biomass makes it difficult to choose the <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> to conduct biomass {{size reduction}} to minimize the energy consumption on mills, maximize the cellulose recovery rate after pretreatment, and maximize the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency. The objective of this work is to address this issue by generating new knowledge on the effects of <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> in these three processes: size reduction, pretreatment, and enzymatic hydrolysis in conversion of big bluestem biomass for biofuel production. Four <b>screen</b> <b>sizes</b> used in this study were 1, 2, 4, and 8 [*]mm. It was found that using a larger <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> saved energy in biomass size reduction on a knife mill.

40|$|With recent {{advances}} in mobile technologies and the growing ubiquity of wireless network accessibility, online information search tasks are now being conducted on mobile devices with {{a broad range of}} screen form factors. <b>Screen</b> <b>size</b> is particularly variable among devices, though its impact on search efficiency and quality is unknown. This study investigates the relationship between device <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> and users' information search efficiency and quality. Thirty-six participants were tested in a variety of closed informational search tasks on three <b>screen</b> <b>sizes</b> corresponding to the Apple iPhone, iPad, and Macbook Air (13 "). Although it was hypothesized that small <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> would detrimentally impact web search performance, analysis of results shows that informational search tasks were not significantly affected by <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> for measures of time on task, answer correctness, or perceived confidence or effort.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} to televised thin and average size models on body dissatisfaction and actual food intake were examined. Normal weight female students (N= 104) were exposed to a 30 -min movie clip featuring beautiful girls. Half of them viewed the movie clip in normal <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> (4 : 3) {{and the other half}} viewed the same movie clip in broad <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> (16 : 9), in which the body size of the actresses was slightly stretched breadthways. Actual food intake while watching and body dissatisfaction afterwards was examined. Additionally, restrained eating was assessed as a possible moderating variable. Two interaction effects were found between <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> and restrained eating on body dissatisfaction and actual food intake. Restrained eaters tended to feel worse and eat less in the average size condition compared to the thin model condition, whereas unrestrained eaters felt worse and ate less in the thin model condition compared to the average size condition. So, body size of televised images affected body dissatisfaction and food intake, differentially for restrained and unrestrained eaters. The <b>screen</b> <b>sizes</b> used correspond with widely used <b>screen</b> <b>sizes</b> nowadays enhancing the practical relevance of the study, since <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> might affect body dissatisfaction and food intake in daily life as well...|$|R

5000|$|Field of view (FOV) - Humans have an FOV {{of around}} 180°, but most HMDs offer {{far less than}} this. Typically, a greater field of view results in {{a greater sense of}} {{immersion}} and better situational awareness. Most people do not have a good feel for what a particular quoted FOV would look like (e.g., 25°) so often manufacturers will quote an apparent <b>screen</b> <b>size.</b> Most people sit about 60 cm away from their monitors and have quite a good feel about <b>screen</b> <b>sizes</b> at that distance. To convert the manufacturer's apparent <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> to a desktop monitor position, divide the <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> by the distance in feet, then multiply by 2. Consumer-level HMDs typically offer a FOV of about 30-40° whereas professional HMDs offer a field of view of 60° to 150°.|$|R

A two-factor, between-subjects design was implemented, in which 40 older adults aged from 55 to 88 years were equally assigned to two <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> groups and required to perform a set of self-management tasks. The results showed that <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> had no effect on either the use perfor-mance or perceptions of the system, and that computer experience had significant effects on the former but no effect on the latter. Older adults without computer experience tended to perceive the large tablet screen system as more useful.

Its findings suggest the need to determine an optimal <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> for consumer health infor-mation technologies, and highlight the importance of computer experience in usability studies.
