The buyer (i.e. the issuer) should treat the invoice as an account payable, and the seller should treat it as an account receivable. If there is tax on the sale, e.g. VAT or GST, then buyer and seller may need to adjust their tax accounts in accordance with tax legislation.|$|E
40|$|The {{progress}} {{of the world economy}} in the last decades brought the deletion of the small and medium sized enterprises {{and the rise of the}} bigger ones in order to satisfy the consumers as much as possible. These businesses face another giant problem which is to hold enough capital, that means the merchant who has to buy big quantities of many types of goods would need an enourmous capital and the problem of the producer is having to sell his products to as many as possible retailers. The solution of these problems appear to be sending on consignement or collection on sale - so no- body would have capital insufficiency pressure. The next problem on behalf of the producer is to watch the sale of the goods for inventory control and also for cash inflow expectation. The last solution here becomes the <b>Self-Billing</b> in English or Autofacturation in French or Selbstfakturierung in German which means the buyer issues bill of the goods sold himself on behalf of the producer and send one copy to the producer. this application is not valid in turkey yet but we believe it will take its place among rules and legislations soon. </div...|$|E

En stor del av de produktivitetsförbättringar som initierats inom olika sektorer har drivits av investeringar i informationsteknologi (IT) i syfte att förbättra informationsflödet och effektivisera försörjningskedjor. Inom byggbranschen har dock utvecklingen gått långsammare än i andra branscher. Inköpt {{material}} och tjänster inom den svenska byggindustrin står för cirka 75 procent av de totala kostnaderna hos företagen. Därmed finns det en stor potential inom byggbranschen gällande implementering och utveckling av IT-lösningar för att stödja inköpsprocessens aktiviteter. Inom byggbranschen i Sverige har processen vid inköp av anläggningstransporter och entreprenadmaskiner uppmärksammats som utmanande vad gäller digitalisering. Det beror bland annat på stora skillnader i både storlek och IT-mognad bland leverantörerna samt diskontinuiteten i projekten där inköpen av tjänsterna sker. Syftet med studien har därmed varit att undersöka hur processen vid inköp av anläggningstransporter och entreprenadmaskiner kan effektiviseras genom digitalisering av informationsflödet. Studien har utförts som en fallstudie vid Skanska Sverige AB:s centrala inköpsavdelning. Studerad inköpsprocess avser processtegen ramavtal, projektavtal, leveransplan, avrop, bekräftelse av avrop, följesedel, bekräftelse av följesedel samt fakturering. Studien innefattar identifiering och utvärdering av möjliga alternativ för digitalisering genom att studera aktuell forskning inom ämnet i kombination med undersökning av pågående praktiskt arbete rörande ett digitalt informationsflöde vid inköp. Baserat på tidigare forskning, empiri och analys har studien resulterat i ett ramverk för en integrerad inköpsprocess där varje aktivitet kopplas samman genom systemstöd, vilket ligger till grund för rekommendationerna till fallstudieföretaget och liknande företag i branschen för att uppnå en mer integrerad och effektiv inköpsprocess för anläggningstransporter och entreprenadmaskiner. Rekommendationerna sammanfattas i följande fem punkter. Skapa och strukturera processer och förankra dem i hela verksamheten Digitalisera genom att samla intern {{information i}} form av master data i affärssystem Implementera ett integrerat systemstöd för det operativa inköpet Förenkla fakturahantering i försörjningskedjan i form av självfakturering Implementera en strategisk, digital helhetslösning med bevarande av mänsklig kontakt Studien visar att det vid initiering av digitala arbetssätt och processer är viktigt att ta i beaktning att viss flexibilitet förloras, därtill är det av stor vikt att inte digitalisera enskilda frågor utan istället utgå från ett långsiktigt helhetsperspektiv. Digitalisering kan medföra en eliminering av icke-värdeskapande aktiviteter i form av dubbelarbete, pappershantering samt sena kontroller i processen. Insamling, lagring och hantering av information i digitala system möjliggör därtill förbättringsarbeten genom detaljerade analyser. Att implementera en strategisk, digital helhetslösning för informationsflödet i inköpsprocessen för anläggningstransporter och entreprenadmaskiner kommer att ta tid, men på långsikt kan initiering av master data, operativa stödsystem och självfakturering generera ett mer funktionellt och säkert informationsflöde.  Purchasing is a strategic function within today's businesses and has, together with supply chain management, had an increased impact on organizations' competitiveness and profitability. Many of the productivity improvements initiated in different sectors {{have been driven}} by investments in Information Technology (IT) aimed at improving information flow and streamlining supply chains. However, the development has been slower {{in the construction industry}} compared to other industries. Purchased materials and services in the Swedish construction industry account for about 75 percent of the total costs within the companies. Consequently, there is a great potential in the construction industry regarding the implementation and development of IT solutions to support the purchasing process. In the Swedish construction industry, the purchasing process of transports and machines for construction sites has been highlighted as challenging in terms of digitization. This is due to large differences in both size and IT maturity among suppliers, as well as the discontinuity of the projects where the purchase of the services takes place. The {{purpose of this study is}} therefore to investigate how the procurement process of transports and machines for construction sites can be streamlined through the digitization of the information flow and has been conducted as a case study at the central purchasing department at Skanska Sweden AB. In this study, the purchasing process refers to eight process steps; framework agreement, project agreement, delivery plan, suborder, confirmation of suborder, attendance note, confirmation of attendance and invoicing. The study involves identifying and evaluating possible options for digitization by studying current research in the subject in combination with ongoing practical work regarding a digital information flow in purchasing. Based on previous research, empirical and analytical studies, this study resulted in a framework for an integrated procurement process where each activity is linked through digital systems. To achieve a more integrated and efficient procurement process of transports and machines for construction sites the recommendations for the case study company, and similar companies in the industry, are as follows. Create and structure processes and spread the way of working throughout the business Digitize by collecting internal master data in business systems Implement an integrated system support for the operational purchase Simplify invoice handling in the supply chain by using <b>self-billing</b> invoices Implement a strategic, digital holistic solution with the preservation of human contact The study concludes that when initiating digital working methods and processes, it is important to consider that flexibility is partially lost, and it is important not to digitize individual questions, but rather from a long-term holistic perspective. Furthermore, digitization can lead to the elimination of non-value added activities in the form of duplication, analogue document handling, and controls late in the process. Collecting, storing and managing information in digital systems enables identification of potential improvements through detailed analysis. Implementing a strategic, digital overall solution for the information flow in the procurement process for transports and machines at construction sites will take time, but in the long term, initialization of master data, operational systems and <b>self-billing</b> can generate a more functional and secure information flow. ...|$|E

The project began in about 1988 when Wilson approached Waits. The story is based on a German folktale called Der Freischütz, which had previously been made into an opera by Carl Maria von Weber. It premiered at Hamburg's Thalia Theatre on 31 March 1990, and was performed at Paris's Théâtre du Châtelet on 9 October 1990. November Theatre produced its world English-language premiere in 1998 at the Edmonton International Fringe Festival in Canada. Det Norske Teatret in Oslo staged a Norwegian (Nynorsk) version in 1998, with Lasse Kolsrud as Pegleg. Only the dialogue was translated, the songs were performed in English.|$|R
50|$|In Munevar’s study, they {{compared}} self vs {{other conditions}} in which personality trait adjectives were rated in terms of Self vs Best Friend, Self vs Bill Gates, and Best Friend vs Bill Gates. He used a blocked-design fMRI paradigm, where non-personality and personality trait adjectives were rated {{as to whether they}} applied to themselves or other. The four hypotheses were as follows:(1) Self conditions would show a different pattern of brain activation from those shown by Best Friend (i.e., close other) and Bill Gates (i.e., far other) conditions; (2) our data should exhibit a fair degree of distributive performance by the brain in responding to these attribution tasks; and (3) the resulting patterns of activation should show some overlap with structures normally involved in preparedness to action (motion). In addition, (4) the Best Friend condition would also differ from the Bill Gates condition.The study found that several areas of the brain were active when doing the tasks related to ‘Self’ and Best Friend. In support of the first hypothesis (1), there was very significant differential activation in BA 31 (covering part of posterior cingulate gyrus and the medial parietal), and the substantia nigra. There was significant activity in the right and left portions of BA 23, and the caudate tail. In a lesser degree, there was some activity in the BA 10 and the thalamus. There was also greater activation in BA 24, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex, in <b>Self-Bill</b> Gates condition compared to the Best Friend-Bill Gates condition. With these results, there is different brain patterns shown by Best Friend and Bill Gate conditions. The contrasting results found also support the second hypothesis (2), and indicate {{that a large number of}} distributive structures throughout the brain are used when doing a self-attribution task.|$|R
