Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every <b>seven</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be recognisable as a new series.|$|E
5|$|William faced several {{challenges}} on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: the {{evidence indicates that}} he was either <b>seven</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> old at the time. He enjoyed {{the support of his}} great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as the king of France, Henry I, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy. The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and conditions in Normandy quickly descended into chaos.|$|E

The spacing between the LAGs decreases significantly towards the outer surface, indicating that growth was slowing, {{but the lack of}} the external fundamental system (a series of tightly-spaced LAGs) indicates that growth had not yet ceased. This is consistent with the unfused sutures between the centra and neural spines in the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and the unfused sutures between the sacral centra and their corresponding ribs.

50|$|The Vatican Barberini manuscript, made in 1620 for Peiresc, {{who had the}} Carolingian Codex Luxemburgensis on {{long-term}} loan, is clearly the most faithful. After Peiresc's death in 1637 the manuscript disappeared. However some folios had already been lost from the Codex Luxemburgensis before Peiresc received it, and other copies have some of these. The suggestion of Carl Nordenfalk that the Codex Luxemburgensis copied by Peiresc was actually the Roman original has not been accepted. Peiresc himself thought the manuscript was <b>seven</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> hundred <b>years</b> old when he had it, and, though Mabillon had not yet published his De re diplomatica (1681), the first systematic work of paleography, most scholars, following Meyer Schapiro, believe Peiresc {{would have been able}} to make a correct judgement on its age.

25|$|Perhaps Osler's {{greatest}} {{influence on}} medicine was {{to insist that}} students learn from seeing and talking to patients {{and the establishment of}} the medical residency. The latter idea spread across the English-speaking world and remains in place today in most teaching hospitals. Through this system, doctors in training make up much of a teaching hospital's medical staff. The success of his residency system depended, in large part, on its pyramidal structure with many interns, fewer assistant residents and a single chief resident, who originally occupied that position for years. While at Hopkins, Osler established the full-time, sleep-in residency system whereby staff physicians lived in the administration building of the hospital. As established, the residency was open-ended, and long tenure was the rule. Doctors spent as long as <b>seven</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> as residents, during which time they led a restricted, almost monastic life.|$|E

They reached Arundel on the River Arun after two days, from where the boat was sent back to Midhurst by train. Another account of a similar journey made in 1914 by Eleanor Barnes and a friend appeared in As the Water Flows, first published in 1920, which described canoe journeys on the rivers of southern England made by her over a period of <b>seven</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years.</b> The warrant of abandonment was obtained jointly by the estates at Petworth and Cowdray after an Oxford undergraduate called Roger Sellman pointed out that the river was still officially a right of way, and that anyone could therefore offer to pay the appropriate tolls to use a boat on it, and expect the owners to rebuild the locks. The powers of the Railway & Canal Traffic Act 1888 were invoked to declare that the navigation was no longer necessary, and despite objections from the River Arun Catchment Board and a canoe club, the warrant was granted on 15 April 1936.
