40|$|A permit truck which {{exceeds the}} {{predefined}} limit of 108 kips {{is defined as}} a <b>superload</b> in Indiana. These trucks can cause adverse long term effects on the performance of a bridge in addition to the possibility of causing immediate damage. Bridges with steel and prestressed concrete (PC) girders, selected from an extensive database, were analyzed and instrumented. Detailed finite element models were developed using the structural analysis programs SAP 2000 and ANSYS. Furthermore, a prestressed concrete bridge and a steel bridge were instrumented using more than 50 sensors each. Strains and deflections were measured during a live load test, and each bridge was monitored for more than six months. Capacities of the investigated bridges were calculated and compared with the demands generated by the <b>superload</b> trucks. A simple and accurate structural analysis technique, called the spring analogy method, was developed to provide an effective evaluation tool to fill the gap between beam line analysis and complicated three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA). ^ Analysis of the steel and PC bridges showed that typical <b>superload</b> trucks up to a gross vehicle weight of 500 kips are not expected to cause any damage or impair long term performance of the investigated bridges. Serviceability limit states of the PC bridges controlled the rating, and the bridges had adequate strength to accommodate all superloads included in the database. However, strength limit states controlled the rating of steel bridges. Long term monitoring of a continuous and a simple span bridge indicated that strains comparable to those of a 366 -kip <b>superload</b> truck can be generated by regular truck traffic. The field measurements also showed that the in-service behavior was different than the design assumptions. Fixity due to integral abutments, effectiveness of the continuity joint in the continuous PC bridge and contribution of the secondary members lead to {{a significant difference between the}} expected and the anticipated behavior. Furthermore, the AASHTO (2004) girder distribution factor equation was found to be conservative for the investigated bridges. Use of a more accurate method such as FEA or the spring analogy method is recommended for the evaluation of bridges traversed by superloads. ...|$|E

We evaluate potential gains in terms of miss rate and bandwidth and find {{that in many cases}} optimal <b>superloading</b> can noticeably reduce the miss rate without appreciably increasing bandwidth. Then we examine how this performance potential might be realized. We examine the effectiveness of a dynamic online algorithm and of static analysis (profiling) for <b>superloading</b> and compare these to next-line prefetching.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present offline {{algorithms}} {{for determining the}} optimal sequence of loads, <b>superloads</b> and bypasses for direct-mapped caches. We evaluate potential gains in terms of miss rate and bandwidth and find {{that in many cases}} optimal <b>superloading</b> can noticeably reduce the miss rate without appreciably increasing bandwidth. We also present an online algorithm for determining the sequence of loads and <b>superloads.</b> This algorithm operates by monitoring the reuse and conflicts of cache lines. Experimental results show comparable improvements to the optimal algorithm in terms of miss rates. 1 Introduction Since their introduction over thirty years ago, caches have become ubiquitous as components of the memory hierarchy. All modern microprocessors have on-chip, or level one, instruction and data caches and a large majority of these level one caches are backed up by second level caches. Caches have been successful because programs exhibit locality: spatial locality, i. e., the tendency [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Built in 1958, the US- 41 White River Bridge is a two-girder, riveted steel {{structure}} located in Hazelton, IN. The bridge {{is comprised of}} two, sixteen span superstructures sharing a common substructure. Each superstructure also contains four pin and hanger expansion joint assemblies. Over a period from August 2009 to August 2010 a series of nearly one hundred super-heavy loads ranging in weight from 200, 000 lbs to up over 1, 000, 000 lbs crossed the northbound superstructure of the bridge. The loads were moved to support {{the construction of a}} new power plant facility located in Edwardsport, IN. It was unknown what effect this number of super-heavy loading events, over a relatively short period, would have on the long-term performance of the US- 41 White River Bridge. Therefore, long-term remote monitoring was used to quantify any negative effects due to the series of <b>superloads.</b> Five primary tasks were undertaken as part of this study: 1. Perform controlled load testing to gain insight on the typical behavior of the bridge. 2. Monitor the effect of individual <b>superloads</b> on the bridge structure to detect any notable damage. 3. Perform an in-depth fracture evaluation. 4. Evaluate the effects of multiple super-heavy loading events on the bridge. 5. Collect stress range histograms to be used as part of a fatigue life evaluation. The results of this study confirmed the US- 41 White River Bridge is an excellent structure. The series of <b>superloads</b> had negligible long-term effects. Low material toughness was found during the material testing; however, based on the analysis performed, fracture is of little concern. Also, from the stress range histograms produced during the long-term monitoring, sufficient remaining fatigue life was calculated for all critical details. Thus, based on these results, only two actions items were suggested: 1.) Perform an in-depth inspection of the pin and hanger assemblies; and 2.) Lubricate all pin and hanger expansion joints...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Prediction {{method for}} {{undrained}} shear behaviour of unsaturated soils {{is discussed in}} this paper. Based on Original Cam Clay model, authors have proposed constitutive model for unsaturated soils {{that the effect of}} water content is incorporated into <b>superloading</b> surface concept. Firstly, stress path of constant volume shear test is formulated under constant void ratio condition. And relationship between water content, dry density and constant volume shear strength is also derived. Secondary, calculation method of undrained shear tests is studied. In the case of unsaturated specimen, volume of the specimen changes with shear deformation and stress paths depend on initial degree of saturation. The calculation results described the tendency of test results qualitatively by considering the change in effective confining pressure in undrained condition and water retention curve. ...|$|R
40|$|Combined {{wave and}} current loading {{is a very}} common and {{important}} situation for sandy seabeds. The dynamic seabed response under combined these loadings, including the change of excess pore water pressure and the stress, is of great significance to the coastal structures design and construction In this paper, based on two-phase u-p theory for saturated soil, a new constitutive model, which is developed from the concept of <b>superloading</b> and sub-loading, is proposed to analyze the dynamic responds in a sandy seabed under the combined wave and current loadings. Firstly, a poro-elastoplastic model for a sandy seabed is established. The seabed soils parameters are obtained from the un-drained triaxial cyclic loading tests. The mechanics of oscillatory excess pore water pressure and residual excess pore pressure due to waves/currents are discussed and the liquefaction depth which changes correspondingly is obtained. A comparison between the dynamic responds of elastic and elatoplastic sandy seabeds to waves/currents loading is presented. Then, a parametric study is carried out to investigate the effects of currents on the pore pressures and liquefaction. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|This study {{employed}} a modified elastoplastic constitutive model that can systematically describe the monotonic and cyclic mechanical behaviors of typical marine soils combining the subloading, normal, and <b>superloading</b> yield surfaces, in the seismic response analysis of three-dimensional (3 D) marine site. New evolution equations for stress-induced anisotropy {{development and the}} change in the overconsolidation of soils were proposed. This model can describe the unified behaviour of unsaturated soil and saturated soil using independent state variables and can uniquely describe the multiple mechanical properties of soils under general stress states, without changing the parameter values using the transform stress method. An effective stress-based, fully coupled, explicit finite elementâ€“finite difference method was established based on this model and three-phase field theory. A finite deformation analysis was presented by introducing the Green-Naghdi rate tensor. The simulation and analysis indicated that the proposed method was sufficient for simulating the seismic disaster process of 3 D marine sites. The results suggested that the ground motion intensity would increase due to the local uneven complex topography and site effect and also provided the temporal and spatial distribution of landslide and collapse at the specific location of the marine site...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTechnological {{advances}} and increasingly complex and dynamic application behavior argue for revisiting mechanisms that adapt logical cache block size to application characteristics. This approach to bridging the processor/memory performance gap {{has been studied}} before, but mostly via trace-driven simulation, looking only at L 1 caches. Given changes in hardware/software technology, we revisit the general approach: we propose a transparent, phase-adaptive, low-complexity mechanism for L 2 <b>superloading</b> and evaluate it on a full-system simulator for 23 SPEC CPU 2000 codes. Targeting L 2 benefits instruction and data fetches. We investigate cache blocks of 32 - 512 B, confirming that no fixed size performs well for all applications: differences range from 5 - 49 % between best and worst fixed block sizes. Our scheme obtains performance similar to the per application best static block size. In a few cases, we minimally decrease performance compared to the best static size, but best size varies per application, and rarely matches real hardware. We generally improve performance over best static choices by up to 10 %. Phase adaptability particularly benefits multiprogrammed workloads with conflicting locality characteristics, yielding performance gains of 5 - 20 %. Our approach also outperforms next-line and delta prefetching...|$|R
