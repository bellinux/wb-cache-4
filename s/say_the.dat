Other explanations <b>say</b> <b>the</b> light comes from a ghost train from the 1800s. The students' investigation showed that the light comes from headlights of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the nine}} figures depicted, five are looking {{directly}} {{out at the}} royal couple or the viewer.
