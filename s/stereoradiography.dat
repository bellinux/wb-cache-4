40|$|Introduction: In {{addition}} to conventional radiography, several other {{techniques such as}} <b>stereoradiography</b> have so far been proposed to determine the position of impacted maxillary canines. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the diagnostic value of panoramic radiography and <b>stereoradiography</b> for determining the position of impacted maxillary canines. Materials and Methods: This was a prognostic, cross sectional study. A total of 30 impacted maxillary canines in 23 patients candidated for surgery were included. Four well coordinated observers separately determined the position of impacted maxillary canines using both panoramic radiography and <b>stereoradiography.</b> In the next phase, the exact position of impacted canines were determined through surgical exploration. Mc-Nemar and kappa index were applied for statistical data analysis. (α = 0. 05). Results: The rate of correct diagnosis in <b>stereoradiography</b> and conventional radiography was 93. 35 % and 60. 82 % respectively which demonstrated a statistically significant difference. With each method, there were no significant differences among observers. Sensitivity and specificity with <b>stereoradiography</b> were calculated 91. 98 % and 94. 78 % respectively. With conventional radiography however these values dropped to 49. 90 % and 74. 11 % respectively. Conclusion: <b>Stereoradiography</b> seems quite reliable for determining the position of impacted maxillary canines. On the contrary, conventional radiography per se does not look precise enogh to determin the position of impacted maxillary canines.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionIn {{degenerative}} adult spinal deformity (ASD), sagittal malalignment and rotatory subluxation (RS) {{correlate with}} clinical symptomatology. RS {{is defined as}} axial rotation with lateral listhesis. <b>Stereoradiography,</b> recently developed for medical applications, provides full-body standing radiographs and 3 D reconstruction of the spine, with low radiation dose. Hypothesis 3 D <b>stereoradiography</b> improves analysis of RS and of its relations with transverse plane and spinopelvic parameters and clinical impact. Material and methodsOne hundred and thirty adults with lumbar ASD and full-spine EOS® radiographs (EOS Imaging, Paris, France) were included. Spinopelvic sagittal parameters and lateral listhesis in the coronal plane were measured. The transverse plane study parameters were: apical axial vertebral rotation (apex AVR), axial intervertebral rotation (AIR) and torsion index (TI). Two groups were compared: with RS (lateral listhesis> 5 mm) and without RS (without lateral listhesis exceeding 5 mm: non-RS). Correlations between radiologic and clinical data were assessed. ResultsRS patients were significantly older, with larger Cobb angle (37. 4 ° vs. 26. 6 °, P= 0. 0001), more severe sagittal deformity, and greater apex AVR and TI (respectively: 22. 9 ° vs. 11. 3 °, P 10 ° without visible RS on 2 D radiographs. RS patients reported significantly more frequent low back pain and radiculalgia. DiscussionIn this EOS® study, ASD patients with RS had greater coronal curvature and sagittal and transverse deformity, as well as greater pain. Further transverse plane analysis could allow earlier diagnosis and prognosis to guide management. Level of evidence 4, retrospective study...|$|E

30|$|The cadaver fixture and {{fixation}} had {{to allow}} for <b>stereoradiography</b> and therefore only a small area of the ilium {{could be used to}} ensure that the fixation did not block the x-rays. At end range FADIR the mean pre- and postoperative hip flexion angles were measured to be 80.8 and 82.4 ° with RSA, while we anticipated to reach 90 ° clinical flexion during testing. This may also be attributed to the use of cadaveric hemipelvises which made it more difficult to estimate the exact flexion angle during the experiment. Yet, due to the variation in pelvic tilt and the variation between patients this may also be a challenge in clinical studies. However, reproducibility to reach the same flexion position pre- and post-operative was good with a mean difference of − 1.57 °.|$|E

40|$|<b>Stereoradiography</b> with a base {{shift of}} the source of {{illumination}} was used to produce pairs of radiographs to be measured by stereophotogrammetric techniques. The direction ofshift was parallel with the longitudinal axis ofthe body, so that each radiograph in the stereopair could be used for other clinical purposes. A base shift of 10 centimetres with a distance of 100 centimetres between the focus and the film gave acceptable values ofstereoscopic parallax. The radiographs were measured using a Hilger and Watts medical stereometer. This method was checked with test specimens, namely an osteotomised pelvis in which one acetabulum could be rotated and an osteotomised femur in which the whole upper portion could be rotated against the shaft. Measurements made on the acetabulum and its radiographs showed a correlation coefficient of 0. 9838 over the range 0 to 30 degrees of anteversion, with a mean error + 2. 54 degrees and a standard deviation of ± 1. 52 degrees (n = 21). For the femoral neck, over the range from 10 degrees ofretroversion to 80 degrees ofanteversion, the correlation coefficient was 0. 9979, the mean error + 2. 46 and the standard deviation ± 1. 48 degrees (n = 30).

40|$|Introduction: Posterior spinal fixators are {{subjected}} to many load cycles after implantation due to walking, and failure events are continuously reported. To avoid this issue and evaluate preclinically the mechanical reliability of fixators a vertebrectomy (ASTM F 1717 standard) and a physiological anterior support (ISO 12189) models are available. The aim {{of the study is}} to assess the international standards for the preclinical evaluation of posterior spinal fixators and to propose improvements. Materials and methods: Several anatomical/biomechanical parameters useful to describe the anatomy of the functional spine units were considered. Their value depending on the spinal level was obtained from literature or from direct measurements on biplanar <b>stereoradiographies.</b> Numerical models describing experimental setups were used to study the contribution of each parameter on the stress on the implant. The worst case condition was also determined. Results: Vertebrectomy condition may guarantee high safety of the implant once implanted in an average patient from a physiological population.

The authors wish to acknowledge Dr. Sophie Lacoste for her technical support and John McCamley for his contribution to the refinement of the manuscriptWhen using skin markers and stereophotogrammetry for movement analysis, bone pose estimation may be performed using multi-body optimization {{with the intent of}} reducing the effect of soft tissue artefacts. When the joint of interest is the knee, improvement of this approach requires defining subject-specific relevant kinematic constraints. The aim of this work was to provide these constraints in the form of plausible values for the distances between origin and insertion of the main ligaments (ligament lengths), during loaded healthy knee flexion, taking into account the indeterminacies associated with landmark identification during anatomical calibration. Ligament attachment sites were identified through virtual palpation on digital bone templates. Attachments sites were estimated for six knee specimens by matching the femur and tibia templates to low-dose <b>stereoradiography</b> images. Movement data were obtained using stereophotogrammetry and pin markers. Relevant ligament lengths for the anterior and posterior cruciate, lateral collateral, and deep and superficial bundles of the medial collateral ligaments (ACL, PCL, LCL, MCLdeep, MCLsup) were calculated. The effect of landmark identification variability was evaluated performing a Monte Carlo simulation on the coordinates of the origin-insertion centroids. The ACL and LCL lengths were found to decrease, and the MCLdeep length to increase significantly during flexion, while variations in PCL and MCLsup length was concealed by the experimental indeterminacy. An analytical model is given that provides subject-specific plausible ligament length variations as functions of the knee flexion angle and that can be incorporated in a multi-body optimization procedure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionLower limb torsion varies {{substantially}} among {{healthy children}} during growth. Values {{reported in the}} literature to date have been obtained using semi-quantitative clinical or 2 D measurement methods. Quantitative 3 D measurement would help determine the physiological range of lower limb torsion. Low-dose <b>stereoradiography</b> with 3 D reconstruction provides a good alternative. Its use increases in pediatrics because of radiation minimization. Previous studies have shown accurate and reproducible results of lower limbs reconstruction in adults and children but the torsional parameters haven’t been measured yet. The present study reports the values of lower limb segmental torsion and its course during growth in a cohort of healthy children and young adults using the EOS low-dose biplanar X-ray. HypothesisEOS 3 D reconstruction is an accurate and reproducible method to measure the torsional parameters in children. Materials and methodsFemoral torsion (FT) and tibial torsion (TT) were studied on 114 volunteers (228 lower limbs) from 6 to 30 years of age divided by age into 5 groups. The EOS™ acquisitions were obtained in subjects standing with their feet offset. ResultsMean FT decreased during growth, passing from 21. 6 ° to 18 °, whereas mean TT increased from 26. 8 ° to 34. 7 °. There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 extreme age groups, but no difference was found between any other age groups. The ICC for intra-observer reproducibility was 0. 96 and 0. 95 for FT and TT for the first operator, and 0. 79 and 0. 83 for the second operator respectively. The ICC for inter-observer reproducibility was 0. 84 and 0. 82 respectively. DiscussionThe course of lower limb segmental torsion observed was consistent with literature reports based upon clinical and 2 D measurements. 3 D reconstruction of EOS low-dose biplanar imaging appears to be a safe and reliable tool for lower limbs measurements, especially for investigating lower limb segmental torsion in children and adults.

40|$|The EOS <b>stereoradiography</b> {{system has}} shown to provide {{reliable}} varus/valgus (VV) {{measurements of the}} lower limb in 2 D (VV 2 D) and 3 D (VV 3 D) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Validity of these measurements has not been investigated yet, therefore {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine validity of EOS VV 2 D and VV 3 D. EOS images were made of a lower limb phantom containing a knee prosthesis, while varying VV angle from 15 ° varus to 15 ° valgus and flexion angle from 0 ° to 20 °, and changing rotation from 20 ° internal to 20 ° external rotation. Differences between the actual VV position of the lower limb phantom and its position as measured on EOS 2 D and 3 D images were investigated. Rotation, flexion or VV angle alone had no major impact on VV 2 D or VV 3 D. Combination of VV angle and rotation with full extension did not show major differences in VV 2 D measurements either. Combination of flexion and rotation with a neutral VV angle showed variation of up to 7. 4 ° for VV 2 D; maximum variation for VV 3 D was only 1. 5 °. A combination of the three variables showed an even greater distortion of VV 2 D, while VV 3 D stayed relatively constant. Maximum measurement difference between preset VV angle and VV 2 D was 9. 8 °, while the difference with VV 3 D was only 1. 9 °. The largest differences between the preset VV angle and VV 2 D were found when installing the leg in extreme angles, for example 15 ° valgus, 20 ° flexion and 20 ° internal rotation. After TKA, EOS VV 3 D were more valid than VV 2 D, indicating that 3 D measurements compensate for malpositioning during acquisition. Caution is warranted when measuring VV angle on a conventional radiograph of a knee with a flexion contracture, varus or valgus angle and/or rotation of the knee joint during acquisition...|$|E
