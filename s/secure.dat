Four styles of attachment {{have been identified in}} adults: <b>secure,</b> anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: <b>secure,</b> insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} {{remainder}} of Theobald's life he was occupied with ecclesiastical affairs in his diocese, as well as attending the royal court when Henry was in England. In January 1155 Theobald helped to <b>secure</b> the Chancellorship for his protégé, Thomas Becket, an action that Barlow speculates happened because Theobald hoped to <b>secure</b> more influence with the king through Becket. If this was his hope, Barlow notes {{that it did not}} materialise. Although the king and the archbishop occasionally clashed when their interests conflicted, both appear to have wished to minimise the disputes and were willing to compromise to <b>secure</b> good relations. As an example, when Pope Adrian IV died in September 1159, two rival claimants for the papal throne emerged. King Henry, following the custom of his grandfather Henry I, forbade the bishops from recognising either claimant. Eventually, after Henry weighed the political factors, he recognised Pope Alexander III, and it was only then that Theobald also recognised Alexander as pope.|$|E

25|$|<b>Secured</b> and {{unsecured}} creditors {{constitute the}} creditor body. Both <b>secured</b> and unsecured creditors {{are ahead of}} shareholders as noted earlier. A <b>secured</b> creditor is a creditor, who has a priority claim on an asset or assets of a company. A lien on the specific asset or assets places the <b>secured</b> creditor's claim ahead of the unsecured creditor. Once a <b>secured</b> creditor is satisfied, the unsecured creditor is then the next priority. This is again the normal order of priority in a bankruptcy.|$|R
25|$|In {{situations}} where the liquidation value of the assets exceeds a <b>secured</b> creditor's lien, the assignee is not normally required to obtain the consent of a <b>secured</b> creditor or any other creditor prior to the assignment process. Cooperation of the <b>secured</b> creditor may however affect the assignee's ability to liquidate an asset. An assignee in practice may obtain {{the consent of the}} <b>secured</b> creditors in advance of the assignment to ensure that the assignee can liquidate the asset or assets in a timely manner without a <b>secured</b> party stopping or holding up the assignment process. <b>Secured</b> party consent in this case is optional, not necessary.|$|R

40|$|We use {{a unique}} dataset {{to analyze the}} {{contract}} renegotiation between a debtor and its <b>secured</b> bank creditors during Belgian court-supervised reorganization. We find that <b>secured</b> banks with higher collateralization succeed in renegotiating higher debt repayments during the court-supervised post-confirmation stage. There is also mild evidence that <b>secured</b> bank creditors renegotiate higher loan repayments during the court-supervised post-confirmation stage if the debtor’s assets are more redeployable. The proceeds of asset sales are used to generously repay <b>secured</b> banks {{and there is some}} evidence that <b>secured</b> banks push for those sales. Our findings are consistent with theory suggesting that <b>secured</b> creditors prefer liquidation above court-supervised reorganization.
