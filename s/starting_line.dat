Shortly {{after leaving the}} <b>starting</b> <b>line,</b> racers follow the frozen Yukon River north out of town. Crossing onto the Takhini River, mushers follow it north to the Klondike-era Overland Trail. Racers take the trail to Braeburn Lodge, the first checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

5000|$|A 3,000 metres steeplechase {{is defined}} in the rulebook as having 28 {{barriers}} and 7 water jumps. A 2,000 meters steeplechase has 18 barriers and 5 water jumps. Since the water jump is never on the track oval, a steeplechase [...] "course" [...] is never a perfect 400 metres lap. Instead the water jump is placed inside the turn, shortening the lap, or outside the turn, lengthening the lap. The <b>start</b> <b>line</b> moves from conventional starting areas in order {{to compensate for the}} different length of lap. When the water jump is inside, the 3,000 <b>start</b> <b>line</b> is on the backstretch (relative to the steeplechase finish). When the water jump is outside, the 3,000 <b>start</b> <b>line</b> is on the home stretch. The 2,000 <b>start</b> <b>line</b> reverses that pattern and uses 5/7 the amount of compensation.|$|R

She has written about drag racing in National Dragster, AutoWeek, and Christian Motorsports magazines. Eddie has a daughter named Sabrina and a son named Dustin.|$|E
5000|$|Port-tack approach: This {{starting}} {{technique was}} created to allow skippers take advantage of 'holes' in the <b>start</b> <b>line.</b> Every short course race starts with a windward leg. Each vessel is wind-powered and vessels to the windward of each other will block the 'clean air.' As a result, many of the racers will group {{on one end of}} the <b>start</b> <b>line</b> trying to outmaneuver each other for clean air. By taking a port-tack approach, the rogue skipper breaks away from the pack and sails down the <b>start</b> <b>line</b> on a port tack. Using a similar timing technique to reaching out and reaching in, the port-tack approach will require your crew to sail back up the <b>start</b> <b>line</b> and cross at the midline as the horn sounds. This will allow you to sail with clean air at a quicker speed to start the race.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the fall}} of the Raevsky redoubt did not have much meaning. The Russian troops {{successfully}} moved to the rear without being destroyed (despite suffering heavy losses). So, in spite of losing some areas in the battlefield, the Russian formation was prevented from collapsing. On the French side, the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and, after that, Napoleon himself ordered his troops to retreat to the <b>starting</b> <b>line.</b> The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{set up in}} a 4–1–3–2 {{formation}} with Terry partnering Ricardo Carvalho in defence. Claude Makélélé played {{behind a}} midfield three made up of Lampard, Ballack and Essien. By contrast Arsenal lined up in a 4–4–2 formation; Abou Diaby and Theo Walcott were positioned either side of central midfielders Cesc Fàbregas and Denílson and provided width. Arsenal's <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> up – averaging 21 years – was the youngest to play in a major English cup final. Before the match commenced, the national anthem was sung by Juliette Pochin.|$|E
5|$|John Thompson was in {{the midst}} of his tenth season as head coach of the Georgetown Hoyas as the team entered the National Championship game. Before the season, Thompson made {{headlines}} when he signed top recruit, Patrick Ewing over several other top name schools, along with Tony Jones, Ralph Dalton, Elvado Smith, and Bill Martin. Georgetown was named by some voters as the number one team in the nation in the preseason polls due to its highly touted recruiting class. The Hoyas' <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> up was: Eric Smith, Eric Floyd, and Fred Brown as guards, Mike Hancock in the forward position, and Ewing at center.|$|E

5|$|Kisnorbo scored {{his first}} goal for Leeds against Millwall {{on his return}} to the {{starting}} lineup after missing the previous game against Norwich City having picked up an illness on international duty. His international call-ups along with other internationals at Leeds resulted in games against Swindon Town and Bristol Rovers being postponed. Kisnorbo missed the games against Kettering Town, Oldham Athletic and local rivals Huddersfield Town through an injury he picked up in training. He had not recovered from injury {{to be able to have}} a part in the squad in the FA Cup replay to Kettering. Instead, the Australia international returned to the Leeds <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> up against Brentford.|$|E
5|$|Runners {{start the}} race from a {{standing}} position along a curved <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> and after hearing the starter's pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100m of the race. This rule was introduced {{to reduce the amount}} of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.|$|E
5|$|The North Carolina Tar Heels were {{coached by}} Frank McGuire, {{who was in}} his fifth season as {{head coach of the}} Tar Heels. His {{offensive}} philosophy was centered around passing before shooting. McGuire's <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> up and most of the roster consisted of players primarily from around the New York area. Tommy Kearns and Pete Brennan were two offensive specialists. Center Joe Quigg provided a solid presence in the paint and grabbed almost nine rebounds per game. Guard Bob Cunningham was one of the teams best defensive players. The team was led by Lennie Rosenbluth who averaged almost twentyeight points a game and served as the team's clutch performer.|$|E

40|$|The J 2 X Gas Generator engine {{design has}} a spin <b>start</b> <b>line</b> {{connected}} {{near to the}} turbine inlet vanes. This line provides helium during engine startup to begin turbomachinery operation. The spin <b>start</b> <b>line</b> also acts as an acoustic side branch which alters the chamber's acoustic modes. The side branch effectively creates 'split modes' in the chamber longitudinal modes, in particular below the first longitudinal mode and within the frequency range associated with the injection-coupled response of the Gas Generator. Interaction between the spin start-modified chamber acoustics and the injection-driven response can create a higher system response than without the spin start attached to the chamber. This work reviews the acoustic effects of the spin <b>start</b> <b>line</b> as seen throughout the workhorse gas generator test program. A simple impedance model of the spin <b>start</b> <b>line</b> is reviewed. Tests were run with no initial spin start gas existing in the line, {{as well as being}} initially filled with nitrogen gas. Tests were also run with varying spin <b>start</b> <b>line</b> lengths from 0 " to 40 ". Acoustic impedance changes due to different spin start gas constituents and line lengths are shown. Collected thermocouple and static pressure data in the spin <b>start</b> <b>line</b> was used to help estimate the fluid properties along the line length. The side branch impedance model was coupled to a chamber impedance model to show the effects on the overall chamber response. Predictions of the spin start acoustic behavior for helium operation are shown and compared against available data...|$|R
5|$|Three {{shows of}} the band's 24-date {{headlining}} US tour with Moneen, Senses Fail, and The Beautiful Mistake had sold out prior to even having released a single, {{with much of}} the buzz surrounding the band being produced by just word-of-mouth, touring and Internet message boards. Deja Entendus success also earned them tours alongside New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Dashboard Confessional, and Blink-182. The band went on to headline The Bamboozle festival with My Chemical Romance, Alkaline Trio, Thrice, The <b>Starting</b> <b>Line,</b> Fall Out Boy, The Bouncing Souls, Straylight Run and Flogging Molly. They also made their second trip to the UK in 2004, their first as the headline act, the tour completely sold out.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts won the 250cc Grand Prix, Sheene {{claimed the}} {{victory in the}} 500cc Venezuelan Grand Prix while Roberts' Yamaha {{suffered}} a mechanical failure on the <b>starting</b> <b>line.</b> In the second round at the Spanish Grand Prix, Roberts was leading the race by eight seconds when his throttle stuck, forcing him to settle for second place behind fellow American Pat Hennen. Roberts then won his first-ever 500cc Grand Prix with a win in Austria, quickly followed by two more victories in France and Italy, along with two second-place finishes in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, Roberts crashed during practice for the 250cc race, sustaining a concussion and a thumb injury. Shaken up by the accident, he could do no better than seventh place in the 500cc race. Sheene had come down with a debilitating virus at the Venezuelan round, but a string of podium finishes and a victory at the Swedish Grand Prix combined with Roberts' failure to score any points in the Finnish Grand Prix, allowed him to close the points gap.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, Lafontaine {{ordered a}} retreat and Guderian finally got heavy {{artillery}} from the Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment. The 88mm dual role artillery guns and the heavier Panzer III and IVs reached {{the area of}} the battle. By this time, the French 7th Tank Battalion had been wiped out and the 213th Infantry Regiment had been devastated. Only 10 French tanks, out of 40, remained. In the two pitched battles the 7th Tank Battalion fought that day they lost 10 from 13. Delays on the right flank meant the 205th Infantry Regiment and 4th Tank Battalion did not reach their <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> until 10:45, by which time the battle on the left wing had been lost and further attacks on the right would have made little sense. The 1st Panzer Division's victory parade was held in Chemery at 12:00, but it was cut short when the Luftwaffe bombed the square by mistake inflicting a few casualties.|$|E
