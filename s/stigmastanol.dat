Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) deficient mice were divided into the following treatment groups: protonated NSAS 1. 4 % (w/w), untreated control and 2 % (w/w) <b>stigmastanol</b> mixed with high-cholesterol/high-fat diet.

40|$|Consumption {{of plant}} sterols or stanols (collectively {{referred}} to as phytosterols) and their esters results in decreased lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol, which is associated with decreased atherosclerotic risk. The mechanisms by which phytosterols impart their effects, however, are incompletely characterized. The objective {{of the present study}} is to determine if pancreatic cholesterol esterase (PCE; EC 3. 1. 1. 13), the enzyme primarily responsible for cholesterol ester hydrolysis in the digestive tract, is capable of hydrolyzing various phytosterol esters and to compare the rates of sterol ester hydrolysis in vitro. We found that PCE hydrolyzes palmitate, oleate and stearate esters of cholesterol, stigmasterol, <b>stigmastanol</b> and sitosterol. Furthermore, we found that the rate of hydrolysis was dependent on both the sterol and the fatty acid moieties in the following order of rates of hydrolysis: cholesterol 3 ̆e (sitosterol = <b>stigmastanol)</b> 3 ̆e stigmasterol; oleate 3 ̆e (palmitate = stearate). The addition of free phytosterols to the system did not change hydrolytic activity of PCE, while addition of palmitate, oleate or stearate increased activity. Thus, PCE may play an important but discriminatory role in vivo in the liberation of free phytosterols to compete with cholesterol for micellar solubilization and absorption...|$|E

40|$|Cholesterol, <b>stigmastanol,</b> and stigmastanyl-phosphorylcholine (ST-PC) were {{incorporated}} into model membranes composed of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC) or 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DOPC). POPC and ST-PC were deuterated at the lipid headgroup, DOPC at the cis-double bonds. The influence of the three sterols on the motion and conformation of the lipid headgroups and the hydrocarbon chains was monitored with 2 H- and 31 P-NMR. All three sterols were freely miscible with the lipid matrix in concentrations of up to 50 mol% without inducing phase separations or nonbilayer structures. However, the molecules exert quite different effects on the phospholipid bilayer. Cholesterol and <b>stigmastanol</b> are largely buried in the hydrocarbon part of the membrane, distinctly restricting the flexing motions of the fatty acyl chains whereas the conformation of the phospholipid headgroups is little affected. In contrast, ST-PC is anchored with its headgroup in the layer of phospholipid dipoles, preventing an extensive penetration of the sterol ring into the hydrocarbon layer. Hence ST-PC has almost {{no effect on the}} hydrocarbon chains but induces a characteristic conformational change of the phospholipid headgroups. The 2 H- and 31 P-NMR spectra of mixed phospholipid/ST-PC membranes further demonstrate that the PC headgroup of ST-PC has a similar orientation as the surrounding phosphatidylcholine headgroups. For both types of molecules the -P-N+ dipole is essentially parallel to the membrane surface. Addition of ST-PC induces a small rotation of the POPC headgroup towards the water phase...|$|E

The resulting LUVs displayed a very limited passive permeability consistent with the high sterol concentration. In addition, the stability of these PA/sterol self-assembled bilayers was also found to be pH-sensitive, therefore, potentially useful as nanovectors. By examining different sterols, we could establish some correlations between the structure of these bilayers and their permeability properties.

40|$|Cholesterol {{absorption}} {{takes place}} at the intestine. Prior to absorption, and due to its low aqueous solubility, cholesterol must be solubilized in bile salts (BS). Cholesterol is an important molecule for several functions from structural to hormonal. However, excess of cholesterol is implicated in several diseases, namely atherosclerosis and gallstone disease. The understanding of the mechanism beneath cholesterol absorption is relevant for the effectiveness of strategies to decrease cholesterol intake from the intestinal lumen. In this work, focus was given to understand some of the principles related to cholesterol solubilization by BS as well as the interaction of BS with model membranes. First we explored the cholesterol solubilization by glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and glycocholic acid (GCA) in micelles of single, binary and ternary mixtures, as these are the most prevalent BS at intestinal lumen. Results showed that single micelles of the most hydrophobic BS (GDCA) presented the highest cholesterol solubilization, followed by micelles of GCDCA and of GCA. The 3 compositions of binary micelles, GCA/GCDCA (50 : 50), GCA/GDCA (50 : 50) and GCDCA/GDCA (50 : 50), and the ternary mixture composed of GCA/GCDCA/GDCA (40 / 40 / 20) presented lower solubilization than the simple micelles of GDCA but higher than GCDCA micelles. The results from this study suggest that BS mixtures present at duodenum are optimized neither for the highest nor for the lowest solubility of cholesterol; instead the solubilization capacity can be understood as a tradeoff between cholesterol supply to membranes and cholesterol excretion. The results showed a linear correlation between cholesterol solubilization by BS micelles and the total concentration of cholesterol, until a plateau be reached, indicating the cholesterol saturation index (CSI). Moreover, the sterol occupancy per micelle differs on the BS, being 1 to simple micelles of GDCA and inferior to the ones of GCDCA and GCA. The interpretation of these results leads to the understanding of solubilization of cholesterol by BS micelles as a partition phenomena rather than a binding event to an available place at the micelle. Solubilization is higher or lower depending on the partition of the molecule considered to the micelle. Once the solubility of this molecule is attained no further solubilization of this molecule will occur however, {{this does not mean that}} micelle doesn’t maintain solubility capacity for other molecules. The understanding of the solubilization phenomena by the micelles in the presence of several co-solutes can give important information on strategies to decrease cholesterol solubilization and absorption. Pursuing this objective, the effect of stigmasterol and <b>stigmastanol</b> (phytosterols), palmitic acid (saturated fatty acid), oleic acid (unsaturated fatty acid) and α-tocopherol (vitamin) on the solubilization of cholesterol by the BS micelles was addressed. The highest effect in the decrease of cholesterol solubility was observed in the presence of phytosterols, followed by the α-tocopherol and very small effect of oleic acid. Phytosterols were solubilized in BS micelles until their limit of solubilization was attainded, while α-tocopherol and oleic acid were soluble in the range of concentration used. For phytosterols, once reached their limit of solubilization at micelle, increasing their concentration resulted in a decrease of cholesterol solubilization in the case of stigmasterol, while no effect in the case of <b>stigmastanol.</b> This suggests that <b>stigmastanol,</b> α-tocopherol and oleic acid exhibit a co-solubilization mechanism, while stigmasterol exhibits both co-solubilization and co-precipitation. Unlikely, the presence of palmitic acid in the micelles as co-solute enhance cholesterol solubility. Looking at the absorption phenomena we addressed the partition of several BS to model membranes. From the results, it was clear that the most hydrophobic BS partitioned more to POPC and to PC/SpM/Chol (1 : 1 : 1) membranes than the most hydrophilic. Also partition to this latter membrane was lower that to POPC. Qualitative data was obtained for translocation in POPC membranes, showing higher values for the most hydrophilic BS, both in conjugated and non conjugated BS. The translocation of BS into POPC/SpM/Chol membranes showed to be faster for both BS measured (DCA and CDCA). The enthalpy of partition showed a negative value for the partition of BS to liquid disordered phase, like in the case of POPC, and showed a positive enthalpy of partition for the membranes of POPC/SpM/Chol. The establishment of the driving rules in the process of solubilization and partition to membranes can give an important clue on a better understanding of difusion process at the intestine.

The method is based on the separation of the three marker compounds on a C 8 column (Phenomenex Luna, 5 microm, 150 mmx 4. 6 mm i. d.) using methanol:water (95 : 5 v/v) as the mobile phase, and a flow rate of 1 ml/min to separate all the marker compounds within 12 min. Cholesterol (50 microg/ml) was used as internal standard and methanol as the extraction solvent. The ELSD response parameters were optimised and the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were calculated to be 2 and 5 microg/ml, respectively, which is more sensitive than obtained by photo diode array detection (5 and 7 microg/ml).

40|$|Plant sterols (PS) are minor lipid {{components}} of plants, {{which may have}} potential health benefits, mainly based in their cholesterol-lowering effect. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the composition and content of PS in plant-based foods commonly consumed in Spain and to estimate the PS intake in the Spanish diet. For this purpose, the determination of PS content, using a modern methodology to measure free, esterified, and glycosidic sterol forms, was done. Second, an estimation of the intake of PS, using the Spanish National Food Consumption data, was made. The daily intake per person of PS-campesterol, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and stigmastanol-in the Spanish diet was estimated at 276 mg, the largest component being β-sitosterol (79. 7 %). Other unknown compounds, tentatively identified as PS, may constitute a considerable potential intake (99 mg). When the daily PS intake among European diets was compared in terms of campesterol, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and <b>stigmastanol,</b> the PS intake in the Spanish diet was in the same range of other countries such as Finland (15. 7 % higher) or The Netherlands (equal). However, some qualitative differences in the PS sources were detected, that is, the predominant brown bread and vegetable fat consumption in the northern diets versus the white bread and vegetable oil consumption in the Spanish diet. These differences may help to provide a link between the consumption of PS and healthy effects of the diet. © 2006 American Chemical Society. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|An {{antibody}} reactive with cholesterol sulphate (CS) {{was characterized}} in human sera by ELISA, erythrocyte and liposome absorption. This antibody was found evenly distributed between the IgA and IgM classes, and whilst this {{was present at}} low titres in the serum of 16 % of healthy individuals studied, it was significantly elevated in 78 % of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected subjects. No association was found between antibody levels {{and the degree of}} myocardial damage. No significant difference in immunoreactivity was found between healthy and chagasic subjects using dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and pregnenolone sulphate and cholesterol, ergosterol, lanosterol, <b>stigmastanol,</b> β-stigmasterol, pregnenolone, prednisolone and dehydroepiandrosterone as antigens, suggesting that in chagasic sera the whole sterol molecule is important for optimal antibody binding. CS-reactive antibodies were easily purified by absorption either with CS-bearing liposomes or with dextran sulphate gel and further elution with 1. 5 m NaCl. The optimal pH of CS–antibody interaction was 4. 0 with 85 % binding at pH 7. 0. Polylysine strongly decreased the binding of these antibodies to the corresponding antigen. Furthermore, these antibodies were strongly absorbed by rabbit and guinea pig erythrocyte but not by rat or human erythrocyte. In contrast with anti-sulphatide antibodies, no significant increase in CS-reactive antibodies was found in dilated cardiomyopathies. Whilst CS itself was not detected in T. cruzi lipid extracts, there is an unidentified sulphated sterol, which migrates close to standard CS and which strongly binds chagasic but not control sera. This latter sterol might be acting in chagasic patients as a powerful antigen, triggering specific autoantibody production...|$|E
40|$|Background: Plant sterols in {{vegetable}} foods might prevent colorectal cancer. Objective: The {{objective was}} to study plant sterol intakes in relation to colorectal cancer risk in an epidemiologic study. Design: The study was performed {{within the framework of}} the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer in 120852 subjects who completed a baseline questionnaire in 1986. After 6. 3 y of follow-up, 620 colon and 344 rectal cancer cases were detected. A case-cohort approach was used to calculate con-founder -adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and their 95 % CIs for quintiles of plant sterol intake. Results: The total mean (±SD) intake of campesterol, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, campestanol, and β-sitostanol was 285 ± 97 mg/d. Major contributors to plant sterol intake were bread (38 %), vegetable fats (26 %), and fruit and vegetables (21 %). For men, there was no clear association between intake of any of the plant sterols and colon cancer risk when age, smoking, alcohol use, family history of colorectal cancer, education level, and cholecystectomy were controlled for. Adjustment for energy did not alter the result. For rectal cancer, adjustment for energy resulted in positive associations between risk and campesterol and stigmasterol intakes. For women, there was no clear association between intake of any of the plant sterols and colorectal cancer risk. Conclusion: A high dietary intake of plant sterols was not associated with a lower risk of colon and rectal cancers in the Nethelands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer.

40|$|Abstract: Ethnopharmacological relevance: Buddleja globosa, {{known as}} "matico", is {{employed}} in Chile for wound healing. Aim of the study: To validate the traditional {{use of the}} crude drug through in vivo and in vitro evaluation of the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antioxidant properties of its extracts. Materials and methods: Sequential hexane, dichloromethane, methanol and total methanol extracts were studied using bioguided fractionation. The following activities were investigated: analgesic (writhing test), oral and topic anti-inflammatory (paw- and ear-induced edema), free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl, DPPH, superoxide anion, lipid peroxidation and xanthine oxidase inhibition). Sodium naproxen, nimesulide, indomethacin were used as reference drugs for in vivo, quercetin and allopurinol for in vitro assays. Results: A mixture of alpha- and beta-amyrins was isolated from the hexane extract that showed 41. 2 % of analgesic effect at 600 mg/kg, inhibited by 47. 7 and 79. 0 % the arachidonic acid (AA) and 12 -deoxyphorbol- 13 -decanoate (TPA) -induced inflammation at 3 mg/ 20 mu L/ear, respectively. A mixture of beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, stigmastenol, <b>stigmastanol</b> and campesterol was isolated from the fraction CD 4 -N and beta-sitosterol-glycoside from the fraction CD 5 -N, reducing TPA-induced inflammation by 78. 2 and 83. 7 % at 1 mg/ 20 mu L/ear, respectively. The fraction CD 4 -N at 300 mg/kg also showed analgesic activity (38. 7 %). The methanol extract at 600 mg/kg per os showed anti-inflammatory effect (61. 4 %), topic anti-inflammatory (56. 7 % on TPA) and analgesic activity (38. 5 %). Verbascoside and luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside were the major components of the methanol extract; apigenin 7 -O-glucoside was also detected. Inhibition of superoxide anion, lipoperoxidation, and DPPH bleaching effect {{was found in the}} methanol serial and global extracts.

40|$|MSc (Environmental Sciences), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Faecal {{indicator}} bacteria {{have traditionally}} {{been used in the}} detection of faecal pollution in water, but due to concerns about the lack of reliability of these indicators, alternative methods have been developed. One of which is the detection of sterols present in human and animal excreta via GC-MS analysis of water in this study. The Szűcs method was used to detect six target sterols (coprostanol, cholesterol, dehydrocholesterol, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, and <b>stigmastanol)</b> in environmental water samples. An initial study was done by analysing raw sewage and effluent (human faecal sterol biomarkers) and water samples were spiked with excreta from cattle, chickens, horses, pigs, and sheep to determine faecal sterol fingerprints. The method was evaluated for quantitation and differences between the water samples from each species. Following liquid-liquid extraction, silylation and derivatization, samples were analysed by GC-MS. Standard curve assays were linear up to 160 ng and the limit for quantification was 20 ng. The human faecal sterol biomarker was coprostanol, while herbivore profiles were dominated by terrestrial sterol biomarkers (stigmasterol and <b>stigmastanol).</b> Sterol fingerprints and differences in concentrations of sterols between various animals and between animals and humans occurred, providing the opportunity to determine whether faecal pollution was from humans or from animals. The method proved sensitive enough to evaluate faecal contamination in environmental water. Groundwater was collected from bore-holes and surface water samples were collected from the Baberspan Inland Lake. Physico-chemical parameters analysed indicated that pH for surface water samples was above 6. 9. The total dissolved solids (TDS) in groundwater indicated that the water was not suitable for human consumption, but could be used for livestock watering. Surface water electrical conductivity (EC) and inorganic nitrates was too high to be used for irrigational purposes. Nitrates in groundwater were too high to be consumed by humans. In groundwater, the total coliform target water quality range (TWQR) was exceeded at 53 % of sites analysed and faecal coliform TWQR were exceeded at 77 % sites. Surface water samples complied with TWQR with regards to faecal coliforms for full contact recreational activities and livestock watering. The TWQR for E. coli, with regards to full contact recreational activities, was within a safe range for surface water. Faecal streptococci were found in 85 % of groundwater sampling sites. And surface water faecal streptococci counts exceeded the TWQR for full contact recreational activities. There is no TWQR for faecal sterols in water, but concentrations of cholesterol and coprostanol was found at three of the groundwater sites analysed. This indicates faecal contamination from possible animal and human origin. Surface water samples analysed showed that the Harts River water is clean and free of faecal sterols, while the water analysed from the inflow, hotel and outflow, cholesterol eluted, which showed faecal contamination, possibly from animals. Faecal sterol markers could be detected in groundwater and surface water, adding an extra dimension to determining the quality of water systems. An optimization and sensitivity study of the method was done on waste water treatment plant (WWTP) raw sewage and effluent. The WWTP sample analysed form Potchefstroom and Carletonville WWTP yielded all six target sterols in the raw sewage water samples, but no sterols eluted in the effluent samples. The raw sewage water sample taken from the Fochville WWTP yielded all six target sterols as well, however, the effluent yielded an unknown compound as well as cholesterol. An alternative study was done where the effluent sample volume was increased. By increasing the volume of water, one can possibly increase the amount (“load”) of sterols extracted and analysed, resulting in a higher abundance of target sterols. By using the target qualifier ions of the six target sterols, and the GC-TOF/MS software, the target sterols could still be qualitatively determined. Optimal volume for raw sewage is 300 ml water sample as this is enough to yield all 6 target sterols. For optimum water quality monitoring via faecal sterol analysis of effluent and other environmental samples, at least 1 L sample volume needs to be collected and analysed. The methods described here {{can be applied to the}} analysis of environmental water samples. The technical advantages also make it suitable for routine environmental monitoring of faecal pollution.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{economic}} development in Malaysia, environmental pollution {{has become a major}} concern, particularly pollution by organic contaminants. Monitoring their temporal and spatial distribution resulted in a large and complicated datasets. It is therefore necessary to apply chemometric techniques to the dataset in order to extract meaningful information and identify the possible sources of these organic contaminants. In this study, the distribution of 13 organic contaminants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), sterols, pesticides (chlorpyrifos), and phenol) in nine monitoring sites along Langat River Basin were monitored from February 2012 to January 2013 on a monthly basis. The analysis of these organic contaminants from surface water was extracted using tandem solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed using various chromatographic techniques. The datasets were subjected to chemometric techniques namely hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis (HACA), discriminant analysis (DA), principal component analysis (PCA) and the factor analysis (FA), to evaluate of possible contamination sources and compared to the inventory of local activities provided by Department of Environmental (DOE), Malaysia. Evaluation on the temporal distribution of these organic contaminants showed that significant variation of PAHs, sterols and phenol during wet weather season (November to April) could be due to dilution factor whereby greater amount of water discharged into the river and intense rainfall could erode the topsoil and carry the accumulated contaminants by surface runoff. By applying HACA, the selected sampling sites were grouped into three clusters which can be correlated to the level of contamination (low, moderate and high contamination sites). Using DA, the contaminants in Langat River could be divided into three sources: domestic sewage/urban discharges, industrial activities and socio-economic activities based on the local activities identified by the Department of Environment (DOE), Malaysia. Forward and backward stepwise DA was able to discriminate two and five organic contaminants variables, respectively, from the original 13 selected variables. The five significant variables identified using backward stepwise DA were fluorene, pyrene, <b>stigmastanol,</b> stigmasterol and phenol. PCA and FA (varimax functionality) were used to identify the possible sources of each organic contaminant based on the inventory of local activities. Five principal components were obtained with 66. 5...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{content of}} total lipids and fatty-acid methyl esters (FAMEs) {{identified}} by GC MS analysis was followed during composting of date palm waste (DPW) alone or mixed with couch-grass clippings (DPGC). The DPGC compost contained more fats and FAMEs (FAs) {{than did the}} DPW compost. Total lipid content decreased during both composting processes with an increase {{towards the end of}} DPW composting. The initial fatty acid composition in both composts showed that the DPGC mixture was richer in microbial biomass than the DPW compost. The lignocellulose nature of the date palm substrate probably obstructed the proliferation and development of a broad category of microbial biomass. The appearance of a series of odd-numbered carbon and branched FAMEs was recorded only toward the end of DPW composting. This confirms the low level of biodegradation of date palm substrate rich in substrates that presented difficult access to micro-organisms, as confirmed by a slower degradation. DPW compost required longer to reach similar maturity to DPGC that of the mixture. Calculating the relationship between the various bacterial groups showed that bacteria strongly prevailed over fungi during both DPW and DPGC composting. The follow-up of these ratios in both composts showed that the stabilization phase was not complete in DPGC compost, but that it reached a very advanced stage during DPGC composting after the 8 -month trial. An increase in G(+) /G(-) and G(+) /fungus ratios toward the end of DPW composting indicated that composting had just started in the DPW. The variations in the levels of the different steroid compounds identified in the two composts showed that dehydration was stronger in the DPGC mixture than in DPW. An increase of the level of <b>stigmastanol</b> acetate (24 -ethylcholestanol), methyl cholestadiene (campestadienes), and cholestanol acetate (cholestanol) in DPGC compost suggests the stimulation of microbial organisms and/or micro-fauna capable of performing the hydrogenation of the corresponding sterols. This microbial activity fluctuated during DPW composting following the bioavailability of substrate that was steadily degraded. The appearance of stigmastadienone toward the end of DPW composting confirmed that composting had just started after the full 8 months...|$|E
40|$|Tomie bay is {{the region}} of the warm Tsushima current, and its sediments are very rich in {{calcareous}} remains. Eight sediment samples having CaCO 3 concentrations ranging from 58. 3 % to 92. 9 % were assembled into the 3 groups by means of mud (%), CaCO 3 (%) and C/N ratio. These groups are fine sands from offshore, muddy fine sands from the mid bay and very fine sands from the inner bay. The calcareous sediments were analyzed for n-alkanes, n-alcohols, sterols and fatty acids. The concentrations of these compounds are less than one tenth those in the muddy sediments from Omura and Imari Bays. Distributions of n-alkanes exhibit slight odd carbon-number predominances in the C 14 -C 35 ranges. A major peak at C 29 or C 31 and a minor peak C 17 are characteristic of autochthonous and allochtonous natural inputs, respectively. Sands from inner bay show a maximum at C 17 or C 21. These sediments exhibit the humps which are related to oil-pollution. Distribution of n-alcohols ranging from C 14 to C 32 show the high even carbon-number predominances and a maximum at C 22 or C 24 which is indicative of an origin from higher plants. The secondary peak at C 16 is characteristic of allochtonous natural inputs. The sand from St. 8 at inner bay shows a maximum at C 16. A total of 12 different 4 -methyl-sterols, which are thought to be characteristic of dinoflagellate input, were identified and account for 14 % to 33 % of the 4 - methyl-and 4 -desmethyl-sterols. Dinosterol is the most abundant compound accounting for 31 % to 44 % of the 4 -methyl-sterols. A predominance of dinosterol is shown in the muddy fine sands from mid bay. A total of 21 different 4 -des- methyl-sterols are identified. The predominant compounds are 22 -dehydrocholesterol, cholesterol, cholestanol, brassicasteol, β-sitosterol and <b>stigmastanol</b> accounting for 71 % of 4 -desmethyl-sterols. The sands from inner bay are rich in cholesterol which is generally attributed to zooplankton or other marine fauna, and show the low ratio of stanols to stenols. Fatty acids consist of saturatesd fatty acids, mono- adn poly-unsaturated fatty acids and branched fatty acids. The sands from the inner bay are rich in C 16 : 1, C 20 : 4, C 20 : 5. The presence of these unsaturated fatty acids implies that the lipids represent the original biological input to the sediment and that the lipids have not undergone extensive degradation or alteration. The muddy sands from mid bay contained large amounts of branched fatty acids such as iso-C 15, iso-C 17, anteiso-C 15,and anteiso-C 17 which are usually taken as bacterial indicators...|$|E
40|$|In {{order for}} a {{medicinal}} product to produce a consistent and reliable therapeutic response, {{it is essential that}} the final composition of the product is invariable and that the active ingredient/s is/are present in appropriate, non-toxic amounts. However, due to the complexity involved in the standardization of natural products, quality control (QC) criteria and procedures for the registration and market approval of such products are conspicuously absent in most countries around the world. African Potato (AP) is of great medical interest and this particular plant has gained tremendous popularity following the endorsement by the South African Minister of Health as a remedy for HIV/ AIDS patients. Very little information has appeared in the literature to describe methods for the quantitative analysis of hypoxoside, an important component in AP. It has also been claimed that sterols and sterolins present in AP are responsible for its medicinal property but is yet to be proven scientifically. To-date, no QC methods have been reported for the simultaneous quantitative analysis of the combination, β- sitosterol (BSS) / stigmasterol (STG) / <b>stigmastanol</b> (STN), purported to be present in preparations containing AP. The effect of concomitant administration of AP and other herbal medicines on the safety and efficacy of conventional medicines has not yet been fully determined. Amongst the objectives {{of this study was to}} develop and validate quantitative analytical methods that are suitable for the assay and quality control of plant material, extracts and commercial formulations containing AP. Hypoxoside was isolated from AP and characterized for use as a reference standard for the quality control of AP products and a stability-indicating HPLC/ UV assay method for the quantitative determination of hypoxoside was developed. In addition, a quantitative capillary zone electrophoretic (CZE) method was developed to determine hypoxoside, specifically for its advantages over HPLC. A HPLC method was also developed and validated for the quantitative analysis of BSS, STG and STN in commercially available oral dosage forms containing AP material or extracts thereof. The antioxidant activity of an aqueous extract of lyophilized corms of AP along with hypoxoside and rooperol were investigated. In comparison with the AP extracts and also with hypoxoside, rooperol showed significant antioxidant activity. The capacity of AP, (extracts, formulations, hypoxoside and rooperol as well as sterols to inhibit in vitro metabolism of drug substrates by human cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes such as CYP 3 A 4, 3 A 5 and CYP 19 were investigated. Samples were also assessed for their effect on drug transport proteins such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Various extracts of AP, AP formulations, stigmasterol and the norlignans, in particular the aglycone rooperol, exhibited inhibitory effects on CYP 3 A 4, 3 A 5 and CYP 19 mediated metabolism. These results suggest that concurrent therapy with AP and other medicines, in particular antiretroviral drugs, can have important implications for safety and efficacy. Large discrepancies in marker content between AP products were found. Dissolution testing of AP products was investigated as a QC tool and the results also revealed inconsistencies between different AP products...|$|E
