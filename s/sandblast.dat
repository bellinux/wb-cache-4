40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{purposes}} of this study were to characterize enamel surfaces treated with <b>sandblasting,</b> acid etching, or <b>sandblasting</b> followed by acid etching for bonding of orthodontic adhesives and to evaluate the enamel-adhesive interfaces. METHODS: Buccal premolar surfaces were <b>sandblasted,</b> acid etched, <b>sandblasted</b> and subsequently acid etched, or left intact. For 2 treatments (acid etching and <b>sandblasting</b> plus acid etching), orthodontic brackets were bonded for resin infiltration assessment. Surface roughness and enamel loss were evaluated by optical profilometry, and surface morphology and elemental composition were examined by low-vacuum scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive x-ray analysis, whereas interfacial resin infiltration was assessed by high-vacuum scanning electron microscopy. Differences were statistically analyzed by 1 -way analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison tests or t tests (α = 0. 05). RESULTS: The <b>sandblasted</b> and sandblasted-plus-acid-etched groups showed higher surface roughness values than the acid-etched group. <b>Sandblasting</b> plus acid etching removed more enamel than did <b>sandblasting</b> or acid etching alone. <b>Sandblasting</b> plus acid etching demonstrated a more uniform type I etching pattern, without alumina particles implanted in the enamel, unlike <b>sandblasting.</b> No difference was found in the extent of resin infiltration between the bonded acid-etched and sandblasted-plus-acid-etched groups, although the latter showed improved infiltration characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Sandblasting-plus-acid-etching treatment creates a rough enamel surface, typical of type I etching, with the greatest extent of enamel loss, free of alumina interferences, demonstrating the same extent of resin infiltration as acid etching, but exhibiting improved infiltration quality...|$|R

40|$|Fe-based {{materials}} {{are of interest}} for use in biodegradable implants. However, their corrosion rate in the biological environment may be too slow for the targeted applications. In this work, <b>sandblasting</b> is applied as a successful surface treatment for increasing the degradation rate of pure iron in simulated body fluid. Two <b>sandblasting</b> surfaces with different roughness present various surface morphologies but similar degradation products. Electrochemistry tests revealed that <b>sandblasted</b> samples have a higher corrosion rate {{compared to that of}} bare iron, and even more noteworthy, the degradation rate of <b>sandblasted</b> samples remains significantly higher during long-term immersion tests. On the basis of our experimental results, the most plausible reasons behind the fast degradation rate are the special properties of <b>sandblasted</b> surfaces, including the change of surface composition (for the early stage), high roughness (occluded surface sites), and high density of dislocations. Furthermore, the cytocompatibility was studied on <b>sandblasting</b> surfaces using human osteoblast-like cells (MG- 63) by indirect and direct contact methods.

This study aims to compare the surface microstructure following different surface treatments of feldspathic porcelain. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This in-vitro study was conducted on 72 porcelain discs randomly divided into 12 groups (n= 6). In 9 groups, feldspathic surfaces were subjected to <b>sandblasting</b> at 2, 3 or 4 bar pressure for 5, 10 or 15 seconds with 50 μm alumina particles at a 5 mm distance. In group 10, 9. 5 % hydrofluoric acid (HF) gel was applied for 120 seconds. In group 11, specimens were <b>sandblasted</b> at 3 bar pressure for 10 seconds and then conditioned with HF.

40|$|<b>Sandblasting</b> {{particles}} {{which remain}} on the surfaces of dental restorations are removed prior to cementation.

We hypothesize that ultrasonic cleaning of bonding surfaces, which were pretreated with <b>sandblasting,</b> may affect adhesive strength of a resin luting material to dental restorative materials. We therefore observed adhesive strength of resin luting material to aluminum oxide was greater than those to zirconia ceramic and cobalt-chromium alloy beforehand. To measure the shear bond strengths of resin luting material to zirconia ceramic and cobalt-chromium alloy, forty specimens of each restorative material were prepared. Bonding surfaces were polished with silicon abrasive paper and then treated with <b>sandblasting.</b> For each restorative material, 40 <b>sandblasted</b> specimens were equally divided into two groups: ultrasonic cleaning (USC) group and non-ultrasonic cleaning (NUSC) group. After resin luting material was polymerized on bonding surface, shear test was performed to evaluate effect of ultrasonic cleaning of bonding surfaces pretreated with <b>sandblasting</b> on bond strength. For both zirconia ceramic and cobalt-chromium alloy, NUSC group showed significantly higher shear bond strength than USC group.

After the preparation of slices the correspondent enamel loss was measured microscopically using the computer programm “Discus”: (1) 7, 10 µm ± 1, 25 µm, (2) 43, 22 µm ± 17, 66 µm, (3) 96, 32 µm ± 36, 57 µm, (4) 121, 17 µm ± 14, 94 µm, (5) 184, 31 µm ± 36, 17 µm. The <b>sandblasting</b> followed by acid etching groups had significantly higher enamel abrasion values when compared to the acid etching group.

In the second part of this study a Zwick testing machine was used to determine tensile bond strengths between the enamel and the fixed brackets after a 24 h immersion in water at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/sec. The 2 groups were as follows: (A) 30 sec acid etched, (B) 5 sec <b>sandblasted</b> + acid etched. The results showed that the bond strength of group A was 3, 9 MPa ± 1, 12 MPa and the group that was <b>sandblasted</b> followed by acid etched was 4, 49 MPa ± 1, 26 MPa. The statistical analysis documented that the pre-treatment with aluminium oxide does not effect significantly higher tensile bond strength.
