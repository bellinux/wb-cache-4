50|$|An economical, {{environmentally}} {{benign and}} fast synthesis methodology for gold nanoparticles using block copolymer {{has been developed}} by Sakai et al. In this synthesis methodology, block copolymer plays the dual role of a reducing agent {{as well as a}} stabilizing agent. The formation of gold nanoparticles comprises three main steps: reduction of gold <b>salt</b> <b>ion</b> by block copolymers in the solution and formation of gold clusters, adsorption of block copolymers on gold clusters and further reduction of gold salt ions on the surfaces of these gold clusters for the growth of gold particles in steps, and finally its stabilization by block copolymers. But this method usually has a limited-yield (nanoparticle concentration), which does not increase with the increase in the gold salt concentration. Recently, Ray et al. demonstrated that the presence of an additional reductant (trisodium citrate) in 1:1 mole ratio with gold salt enhances the yield by manyfold at ambient conditions and room temperature.|$|E

On the base of the data obtained, reasons of the growth of <b>salt</b> <b>ions</b> `overlimiting' mass transfer in electrodialysis desalination channels with intermembrane distance and different NaCl solution concentration were analysed. It is shown that the role of gravitational convection may be important in desalination channels with a quite great intermembrane distance and electrolyte solution concentration. In this case a <b>salt</b> <b>ions</b> concentration at a membrane¿solution interface does not decrease to values sufficient for promoting the H+ and OH¿ generation and electroconvection. In desalination channels with small intermembrane distances, when treating dilute solutions, the salt concentration at the membrane surface reaches very small values.

50|$|Most hemocyanins bind {{with oxygen}} non-cooperatively and are roughly one-fourth as {{efficient}} as hemoglobin at transporting oxygen per amount of blood. Hemoglobin binds oxygen cooperatively due to steric conformation changes in the protein complex, which increases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen when partially oxygenated. In some hemocyanins of horseshoe crabs and some other species of arthropods, cooperative binding is observed, with Hill coefficients of 1.6 - 3.0. Hill coefficients vary depending on species and laboratory measurement settings. Hemoglobin, for comparison, has a Hill coefficient of usually 2.8 - 3.0. In these cases of cooperative binding hemocyanin was arranged in protein sub-complexes of 6 subunits (hexamer) each with one oxygen binding site; binding of oxygen on one unit in the complex would increase the affinity of the neighboring units. Each hexamer complex was arranged {{together to form a}} larger complex of dozens of hexamers. In one study, cooperative binding was found to be dependent on hexamers being arranged together in the larger complex, suggesting cooperative binding between hexamers. Hemocyanin oxygen-binding profile is also affected by dissolved <b>salt</b> <b>ion</b> levels and pH.|$|E
50|$|Adélie {{penguins}} {{are faced}} with extreme osmotic conditions, as their frozen habitats offer little fresh water. Such desert conditions means {{that the vast majority}} of the available water is highly saline, causing the diets of Adélie penguins to be highly saline. They manage to circumvent this problem by eating krill with internal concentrations of salt at the lower end of their possible concentrations, helping to lower the amount of ingested salts. The salt load imposed by this sort of diet is still relatively heavy, and can create complications when considering the less tolerant chicks. Adult Adélie penguins feed their chicks by regurgitating the predigested krill, which can impose a heavy salt load on the chicks. Adults address this problem by altering the ion concentrations while the food is still being held in their stomachs. By removing a portion of the sodium and potassium ions, adult Adélie penguins protect their chicks from heavy salt loads. Adélie penguins also manage their salt loads by concentrating cloacal fluids to a much higher degree than most other birds are capable of. This ability is present regardless of ontogeny in Adélie penguins, meaning that both adults and juveniles are capable of extreme levels of <b>salt</b> <b>ion</b> concentration. However, chicks do possess a greater ability to concentrate chloride ions in their cloacal fluids.|$|E
40|$|The <b>salt</b> <b>ion</b> fluxes across {{commercial}} bipolar membranes (BPMs) {{result in}} the salt contamination of the produced acids or bases especially at increased product concentrations. Often, bipolar membrane electrodialysis can only be applied when these fluxes are reduced.

The model is extended to relate the limiting current density to the experimentally determined properties of the separate membrane layers. A direct dependence has been found for the <b>salt</b> <b>ion</b> fluxes across the bipolar membrane on {{the square of the}} solution concentration and the effective salt diffusion coefficient. Further, the <b>salt</b> <b>ion</b> transport is inversely dependent on the fixed charge density and the thickness of the layers.

Because of the different mode of sampling the absolute conductivity values are different; the saline solutions obtained by immersion of the poultices reach much higher values (up to 2800 µs cm− 1) than those of the drill dust (up to 430 µs cm− 1). The poultices have a contact area to the stone surface of approx. 13.7  cm 2 while the stone powder derives from a drilling area of c. 0.79  cm 2. Thus, the absolute amount of available <b>salt</b> <b>ions</b> is much higher for the PPP method.

In our simulations, we used a coarse-grained representation of polyelectrolyte chains, counterions and <b>salt</b> <b>ions.</b> During simulation runs, we alternate Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulation steps. Monte Carlo steps were used to perform small ion exchange between simulation box containing <b>salt</b> <b>ions</b> (<b>salt</b> reservoir) and simulation box with polyelectrolyte chains, counterions and <b>salt</b> <b>ions</b> (polyelectrolyte solution). This allowed us to model Donnan equilibrium and partitioning of salt and counterions across membrane impermeable to polyelectrolyte chains.

The fraction of the condensed (osmotically inactive) counterions first increases with decreases in the solution ionic strength then it saturates.

The thickness of one, the other, or both ion-permeable layers of a bipolar membrane is increased.

40|$|ABSTRACT Salting-out of {{proteins}} was discov-ered {{in the nineteenth}} century and is widely used for protein separation and crystallization. It is gen-erally believed that salting-out occurs because at high concentrations salts and the protein compete for solvation water. Debye and Kirkwood suggested ideas for explaining salting-out (Debeye and Mac-Aulay, Physik Z; 1925; 131 : 22 – 29; Kirkwood, In: Pro-teins, amino acids and peptides as ions and dipolar ions. New York: Reinhold; 1943. p 586 – 622). How-ever, a quantitative theory has not been developed, and such a theory is presented here. It is built on Kirkwood’s idea that a <b>salt</b> <b>ion</b> has a repulsive interactionwith an image charge inside a lowdielec-tric cavity. Explicit treatment is given for the effect of other salt ions on the interaction between a <b>salt</b> <b>ion</b> and its image charge. When combined with the Debye-Hückel effect of salts on the solvation energy of protein charges (i. e., salting-in), the characteris-tic curve of protein solubility versus salt concentra-tion is obtained. The theory yields a direct link between the salting-out effect and surface tension and is able to provide rationalizations for the effects of salt on the folding stability of several proteins...|$|E

The NIa protease exhibits an unusual optimum proteolytic activity at about 16 degrees C. In {{order to understand}} the origin of the low-temperature optimum activity, the effects of temperature and <b>salt</b> <b>ions</b> on the catalytic activity and the structure of the NIa protease have been investigated. The analysis of the temperature dependence of k(cat) and K-m revealed that K-m decreases more drastically than k(cat) as temperature decreases. The thermodynamic analysis showed that the decrease of K-m is driven entropically, suggesting a possibility that the substrate binding might need a large entropy cost. The secondary structure of the NIa protease was significantly perturbed at temperatures between 20 and 40 degrees C and the protease was unfolded at very low concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride with a transition midpoint of 0. 8 M. These results suggest that the NIa protease is highly flexible in structure. Interestingly, <b>salt</b> <b>ions</b> including NaCl, KCl, CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 stimulated the proteolytic activity by 2 - 6 -fold and increased the optimum temperature to 20 - 25 degrees C.

The <b>salt</b> <b>ions</b> promoted the structural rigidity as evidenced in the higher resistance to the heat-induced unfolding {{in the presence of the}} <b>salt</b> <b>ions.</b> The increase in rigidity may lead to the lowering of K-m possibly by reducing the entropic cost for substrate binding.

It has been generally observed that the deposits in such industrial systems consist mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), which has inverse solubility characteristics.

Counterions and <b>salt</b> <b>ions</b> are taken into account explicitly, and charge-charge interactions are described by the Coulomb potential. By varying the charge interaction strength and salt concentration, we characterize the swelling of the polyelectrolytes and the charge distribution. In particular, we determine the amount of trapped mobile charges inside the microgel and the Debye screening length. Moreover, we analyze the polymer extension theoretically in terms of the tension blob model taking into account counterions and <b>salt</b> <b>ions</b> implicitly by the Debye–Hückel model. Our studies reveal a strong dependence of the amount of ions absorbed in the interior of the microgel on the electrostatic interaction strength, which is related to the degree of the gel swelling. This implies a dependence of the inverse Debye screening length κ on the ion concentration; we find a power-law increase of κ with the Coulomb interaction strength with the exponent 3 / 5 for a salt-free microgel and an exponent 1 / 2 for moderate salt concentrations. Additionally, the radial dependence of polymer conformations and ion distributions is addresse...|$|R
