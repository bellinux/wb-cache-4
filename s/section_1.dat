5|$|Although Hancock won Georgia's {{popular vote}} easily, {{there was an}} {{irregularity}} in that state’s electoral votes. According to Article II, <b>Section</b> <b>1,</b> clause 3 of the Constitution, “The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.” In 1792, Congress had set the date for the Electoral College {{to vote on the}} first Wednesday in December, which in 1880 fell on December 1. However, Georgia’s electors failed to cast their ballots on December 1, instead voting on the following Wednesday, December 8. Congress chose to count Georgia's vote in the official tally anyway; had they not done so, Hancock’s electoral vote would have been 144, not 155.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the restructuring, in 2006 the LCR consortium consisted of engineering consultants and construction firms Arup, Bechtel, Halcrow and Systra (which form Rail Link Engineering (RLE)); transport operators National Express and SNCF (which operates the Eurostar (UK) share of the Eurostar service with the National Railway Company of Belgium and British Airways); electricity company EDF; and UBS Investment Bank. On completion of <b>section</b> <b>1</b> by RLE, the line was handed over to Union Railways (South), which then handed it over to London & Continental Stations and Property (LCSP), the long-term owners of the line. Once section 2 of the line had been completed it was handed over to Union Railways (North), which handed it over to LCSP. The entire line, including St Pancras, is managed, operated and maintained by Network Rail (CTRL).|$|E
5|$|Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act {{specifies}} that offences under <b>section</b> <b>1,</b> {{where the}} destruction or damage {{is caused by}} fire, shall be charged as arson. It would seem that courts adopt a purposive view {{in relation to the}} lawful excuse defence in relation to arson, as in R v. Hunt (1977). The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed an honest belief in that by doing this, he had a lawful excuse within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|E

5|$|Sections 21–23 {{cover the}} review of agents and the {{liability}} of trustees for agents actions. Section 21 identifies that review and liability occurs when the trustees appoints agents, nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument. Section 22 provides a duty on trustees who delegate their powers, with the duty consisting of three elements. Firstly, trustees are required {{to make sure that}} agent is suitable for the job he is employed to do. Secondly, they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it. Thirdly, trustees are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it. Section 23 establishes trustees' liability for the actions of agents; a trustee is liable for negligence if he violates the general duty of care set out in <b>Section</b> <b>1,</b> but not otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The Attorney General of West Virginia is {{the chief}} legal advisor to the West Virginia state {{government}} and is the state's chief law enforcement officer. The office was created by Article VII, <b>Section</b> <b>1</b> of the first Constitution of West Virginia in 1863. Under the current state constitution (1872), {{the attorney general is}} an executive department-level state constitutional officer, along with the governor, secretary of state, auditor, treasurer, and commissioner of agriculture. The attorney general is the ex officio reporter of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. The constitution further specifies that the attorney general shall reside in the seat of state government, Charleston, during their term of office. In Charleston, they are to maintain public records, books, and papers pertaining to their office, and perform all duties prescribed by state law. As of 2012, the attorney general receives a salary of $95,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe {{rules of conduct}} {{to be applied to}} particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in <b>section</b> <b>1.</b> In view of the scope of that broad declaration and {{of the nature of the}} few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E
