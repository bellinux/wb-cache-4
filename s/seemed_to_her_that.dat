2500|$|This Thielvar {{had a son}} called Hafthi. And Hafthi's {{wife was}} called Whitestar. Those two {{were the first to}} settle on Gotland. The first night they slept {{together}} she dreamt that three snakes were coiled in her lap. And it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> they slid out of her lap. She told this dream to her husband Hafthi. He interpreted it thus: ...|$|E
60|$|Still he stood, and it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> her father's gaze pierced to {{her secret}} soul.|$|E
60|$|Margaret {{looked across}} the table curiously. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> her friend had turned a little paler.|$|E
60|$|This time it did <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{she could}} detect a slight ring of excitement.|$|R
60|$|Farfrae <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> assure <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{he would}} not, by taking her hand.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to find out what}} had happened, she looks for other people with binoculars. The only other person she can see is a man who <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be frozen still. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> a tragedy killed all living creatures {{on the other side of}} the wall. She is entirely alone, {{protected}} and trapped by the invisible wall in equal measure.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her {{steadily}} and it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> his eyes were on fire with evil things.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked into}} her eyes almost fearfully, but it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> his own held a first glimmer of hope.|$|E
60|$|Her jaw fell. She caught {{more than}} an admonition in his words. It almost <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he was threatening.|$|E
60|$|The girl laughed gaily as she answered, though {{something}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{this was}} more than play.|$|R
60|$|Elspeth {{discovered}} that guns cost fourpence, and dominoes threepence halfpenny; it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> Tommy was defrauding {{her of a}} halfpenny.|$|R
6000|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> natural <b>that</b> {{he should}} be {{thinking}} only of himself, but with the subtlest defensive instinct, she put forward her own tragedy: ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he did so}} she {{had started}} to her feet, listening. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> there was someone near them.|$|E
60|$|She {{gave him}} a glance. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{whatever}} it was, his presence would help her to bear it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ralph Denham said that?" [...] said Katharine, with {{considerable}} indignation. In {{order to have}} produced such suffering in Mary, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he must have behaved with extreme callousness. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he had discarded the friendship, when it suited his convenience to do so, with some falsely philosophical theory which made his conduct all the worse. She was going on to express herself thus, had not Mary at once interrupted her.|$|E
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>that</b> {{a ton of}} chains {{fell from}} his limbs. He did not say a word; he was happy beyond the power of speech.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never," [...] she said, with a shudder. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> then <b>that</b> {{marriage}} was so fearful {{a thing that}} certainly she could never venture upon it again.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce looked {{with wonder}} at an easel which stood outside another door {{a little further}} on. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> strange <b>that</b> <b>her</b> son should live in such a place.|$|R
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> his frame {{had become}} tenser, his tone harder. The grip {{of his fingers}} was still upon her wrist.|$|E
60|$|So {{she took}} the gourd and drank to the last drop, for it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she had never tasted {{anything}} so delicious.|$|E
60|$|Ruth got up quickly. She {{was glad}} to get away, for it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> in another minute she would break down altogether.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{kissing her}} grandmother, Barbara resumed her seat, {{and looked at}} Courtier. 'Sitting three' as they were, he was {{touching}} <b>her,</b> and it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> somehow <b>that</b> he did not mind.|$|R
6000|$|A sudden {{perception}} of delicacy, {{the thought that}} he should have spoken before her failure at the Conservatoire had made her feel her helplessness, brought a slight color to his cheek. Would it not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he was taking an unfair advantage of her misfortune? Yet it would be so easy now to slip a loving arm around her waist, while he could work for her and protect her with the other. THE OTHER! His eye fell on his empty sleeve. Ah, he had forgotten that! He had but ONE arm! ...|$|R
60|$|Like most {{literary}} {{people who}} put their friends into books, she is very modest, and it never <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> strike <b>her</b> <b>that</b> I would {{come all this way}} <b>to</b> see <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{nothing of}} this was real, but all some horrid dream. A clap of thunder made her cover her ears.|$|E
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{it was she}} {{that they}} were {{laughing}} at, pointing her out to one another, jeering at her, reviling her, threatening her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is Mr. Nicholas?" [...] she asked. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Fillmore was {{the only}} {{possible}} source of information. [...] "Did you say he was out?" ...|$|E
60|$|Francesca, with Spartan stoicism, {{continued}} to wear an ingratiating smile, though {{the character of}} the deaf adder <b>that</b> stoppeth <b>her</b> ear and will not hearken, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at <b>that</b> moment a beautiful one.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{worse than}} might be expected, Jacob. I have spoken <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> told her who I am, and why I came here. Naturally enough, she is sore at present, and {{considers}} that I have been deceiving her, {{which is true}} enough. At first she denied nothing, but afterwards fired up, and for the present regards me as an enemy; but I believe it will all come right. She is angry now because it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> I have been taking her in for my own purposes, but I think that when she thinks it over calmly she will do what I want.' ...|$|R
60|$|Madam {{raised her}} voice in saying this, and nodded significantly; but a mild snore {{from the other room}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> assure <b>her</b> <b>that</b> it was a waste of shot to fire in that direction.|$|R
60|$|He moved {{a little}} uneasily. All {{the time she}} was {{watching}} him. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she could read the thoughts which were stirring in his brain.|$|E
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she {{was very}} much alone now. She was marooned on a desert island of froth and laughter. Everything that mattered she had lost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] replied Jane. And {{she found}} it strangely {{embarrassing}} to meet the child's gaze. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Fay's violet eyes looked through her with piercing wisdom.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Pasmer willingly assented to {{its being}} much better, out of pure complaisance, though the {{ceilings}} were {{low and the}} windows small, {{and it did not}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the Franklin stove and the aesthetic papering and painting of young Mavering's room brought it up to the level of those others that she had seen. But with her habit of saying some friendly lying thing, no matter what her impressions were, she exclaimed; [...] "Oh, how cosy!" [...] and glad of the word, she went about from one to another, asking, [...] "Isn't this cosy?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was quite}} willing to accept them, and she strove hard to {{understand}} them. It certainly did <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> when <b>her</b> money was borrowed somebody must have known that the promised security would not be forthcoming; but perhaps that somebody was old Rubb, whom, as {{she did not know}} him, she was quite ready to regard as the villain in the play that was being acted. Her own money, too, was a thing of the past. That fault, if fault there had been, was condoned; and she was angry with herself in that she now thought of it again.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked down}} on the terrace; as she looked the figure of George Emerson appeared, walking swiftly. And {{at the sight of}} him {{something}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she had found the key <b>to</b> <b>her</b> gloom.|$|R
