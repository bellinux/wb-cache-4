5000|$|As Ledfoot McConnell {{developed}} his own music style, the [...] "Gothic Blues", between 2004 and 2007. This new style {{could not be}} defined by any existing music genre, so he invented a name for it. It {{is characterized by the}} unique artist's appearance: black clothes, shiny white hair, silver jewelry and a body full of tattoos - many of which designed by the artist himself. He sings with expressive and strong voice, plays the 12-string mostly in Bb minor tuning with porcelain slide and <b>steel</b> <b>finger</b> picks. Extra heavy strings contribute to a unique, strong sound. Frequently Ledfoot adds some extra rhythm with his stomp box. Lyrics and melody are often dark and atmospheric and describe the blues and worries of modern time human beings.|$|E

60|$|The man {{was still}} kneeling, bent almost double in agony, before the cooking pot. His back was toward the ape-man. Swiftly and noiselessly Tarzan {{approached}} him.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the wear, under varying conditions of load and speed, of an annealed <b>steel</b> <b>finger</b> held against a rotating hardened steel sleeve. Measurement of the wear was made by weight and volume change of the finger, whereas measurement of the transfer to the sleeve was made by its increase in weight or, on separate runs, by its increase in radioactivity. The atmosphere was dry air. The purpose of this work was to inspect an elementary wear process and accompanying transfer of metal under simple controlled conditions with a view to separating out the various component processes which are collectively known as wear. By this process it is hoped to determine more of the "why" of wear. This was done by a previously accomplished radioactive technique and also by a corroborative weight change technique.

40|$|Introduction: Cleaning {{and shaping}} {{of the root}} canal system with an {{efficient}} and safe technique are the major goals of root canal treatment. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the conventional root canal preparation technique by hand instruments and Gates Glidden drills with ProTaper Universal Rotary system on the root susceptibility to vertical fracture. Methods: Thirty extracted human mandibular premolars were randomly assigned to two groups. In group I, apical preparation was performed with k-files up to # 40 utilizing step back technique and coronal flaring was done with Gates Glidden drills. In group II, ProTaper Universal Rotary instruments were used up to the file F 4. All teeth were obturated with lateral compaction technique using gutta-percha and AH 26 sealer. A simulated periodontal ligament was fabricated, and the teeth were mounted. A stainless <b>steel</b> <b>finger</b> spreader # 35 was mounted in an Instron testing machine and the necessary load to cause a root fracture was inserted and recorded. The obtained data were analyzed statistically using T-test. Results: The force required to fracture was significantly lower for the roots prepared by ProTaper instruments in comparison with the specimens prepared by hand instruments and Gates Glidden drills (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Canal preparation with ProTaper rotary instruments can make the roots more susceptible to vertical fracture than traditional instrumentation with k-files and Gates Glidden drills...|$|E

60|$|Rokoff {{assumed a}} truculent air, {{attempting}} by bravado {{to show how}} little he feared Tarzan's threats. An instant later he felt the ape-man's <b>steel</b> <b>fingers</b> at his throat, and Paulvitch, who attempted to dodge them and reach the door, was lifted completely off the floor, and hurled senseless into a corner. When Rokoff commenced to blacken about the face Tarzan released his hold and shoved the fellow back into his chair. After a moment of coughing Rokoff sat sullenly glaring at the man standing opposite him. Presently Paulvitch came to himself, and limped painfully back to his chair at Tarzan's command.|$|R
60|$|The presumptuous one {{who would}} have had the glory of first laying arresting hands upon the blasphemous impersonator rushed forward with outstretched hand to seize the ape-man. Instead it was he who was seized; seized by <b>steel</b> <b>fingers</b> that snapped him up as though he had been a dummy of straw, grasped him by one leg and the harness at his back and raised him with giant arms high above the altar. Close at his heels were others ready to seize the ape-man and drag him down, and beyond the altar was Lu-don with drawn knife {{advancing}} toward him.|$|R
60|$|Rokoff's {{attitude}} was so distinctly {{filled with the}} threat of physical violence that the ape-man paused for an instant just behind the trio, instinctively sensing an atmosphere of danger. Scarcely had he hesitated ere the man seized the woman roughly by the wrist, twisting it as though to wring a promise from her through torture. What would have happened next had Rokoff had his way we may only conjecture, since he did not have his way at all. Instead, <b>steel</b> <b>fingers</b> gripped his shoulder, and he was swung unceremoniously around, to meet the cold gray eyes of the stranger who had thwarted him on the previous day.|$|R

Ken and Chuck return to retrieve a file Ken accidentally left at the apartment only to find themselves facing the killer, who was overpowering Kelly. Chuck, Ken and Kelly prove to be too much for the killer, who after knocking out Kelly and using his <b>steel</b> <b>fingers</b> to incapacitate Ken, escapes by jumping out of a window onto a garbage truck.|$|R
60|$|Like a {{beast of}} prey, grim and terrible, Tarzan {{crouched}} in the shadows beside the tent. What thoughts passed through that savage mind? Who may say? No outward sign of passion was revealed by {{the expression of the}} handsome face; the cold, gray eyes denoted only intense watchfulness. Presently the soldier Tarzan had heard first rose and with a parting word turned away. He passed within ten feet of the ape-man and continued on toward the rear of the camp. Tarzan followed and in the shadows of a clump of bushes overtook his quarry. There was no sound as the man beast sprang upon the back of his prey and bore it to the ground for <b>steel</b> <b>fingers</b> closed simultaneously upon the soldier's throat, effectually stifling any outcry. By the neck Tarzan dragged his victim well into the concealment of the bushes.|$|R

5000|$|At a local gym in New York City, heavyweight boxing {{champion}} Eddie Cunningham {{is finishing}} his workout for the night. He hears a noise {{and looks around}} when {{he turns to the}} ring. A mysterious man dressed in black sporting a mask tells Eddie he fights well but he lacks the [...] "killer instinct". The masked man challenges the boxer to a fight and shows him the moon, which has a faint red color. The man sports boots with the toes and heels encased in steel and uses martial arts to fight Eddie. Initially, the two combatants seemed evenly matched, but Eddie soon finds himself overwhelmed by the man's superior fighting skills. When the man knocks Eddie outside of the ring, he unmasks himself and still pounds on Eddie despite Eddie's pleas of calling off the fight. When Eddie uses a bench to knock down the man, the man uses two <b>steel</b> <b>fingers</b> which goes through the bench and stabs Eddie in the chest. He hoists a dead Eddie in the air and declares victory.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to design and {{evaluate}} a trapping system that would reduce populations of common carp within water bodies in conjunction with establishment of native aquatic macrophytes founder colonies. A pond study and field study were conducted. A pond study was performed at the Lewisville Aquatic Ecosystem Research Facility, located in Lewisville, Texas, followed by a field study within a constructed wetland located in southern Dallas, Texas. For the pond study, twelve funnel traps were constructed (four reps of each type: control, dual-walled and ring cage). Two anti-escape devices were tested with funnels including <b>steel</b> <b>fingers</b> and hinged flaps. Ring cage and dual-walled treatments were planted using native pondweeds, while controls were left unplanted (additional bait and a drift fence scenarios were also tested). Common carp were introduced into the study pond. Chi-square statistical analyses were utilized and showed ring cage treatments using fingers as well as the use of a drift fence to be most effective. Following completion of the pond study, the two most effective treatments (controls and ring cages) were tested within the Dallas, Texas wetland; no carp were caught during the field test...|$|R

Instantly he was at work upon the bonds with his strong teeth, but ever a wary eye was upon In-tan, the warrior of Kor-ul-lul. The last knot had been loosened and Tarzan's hands were free when In-tan turned to cast an appraising eye upon his ward. He saw that the prisoner's position was changed--he no longer lay upon his back as they had left him, but upon his side and his hands were drawn up against his face. In-tan came closer and bent down. The bonds seemed very loose upon the prisoner's wrists. He extended his hand to examine them with his fingers and instantly the two hands leaped from their bonds--one to seize his own wrist, the other his throat. So unexpected the catlike attack that In-tan had not even time to cry out before <b>steel</b> <b>fingers</b> silenced him. The creature pulled him suddenly forward so that he lost his balance and rolled over upon the prisoner and to the floor beyond to stop with Tarzan upon his breast. In-tan struggled to release himself--struggled to draw his knife; but Tarzan found it before him. The Waz-don's tail leaped to the other's throat, encircling it--he too could choke; but his own knife, {{in the hands of}} his antagonist, severed the beloved member close to its root.|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of miniaturized, {{externally}} heated graphitization reaction furnace, the microconventional furnace (MCF), was constructed following our development of the laser heated furnace (LHF). The MCF is comprised of a gas reactor, a cold finger cooling system, and a compact resistive heater, which can raise {{the temperature of the}} hot finger to 850 °C. The gas reactor is provided with three integrated valves to connect with the hydrogen/vacuum manifold, to isolate the reactor, and to connect with sample vessels. We made two types of MCF: the type 1 furnace (volume of 0. 9 mL), with an integral stainless <b>steel</b> cold <b>finger,</b> and the type 2 furnace (volume from 1. 3 to 10 mL), with a changeable glass cold finger. The MCF is designed for above atmospheric pressure (up to 2500 mbar) operation to decrease the overall graphitization time and improve the carbon yield. The MCF provides an effective solution for producing graphite from carbon dioxide (CO 2) sample gas from 5 to 2000 µg of carbon with only 0. 083 μg of 100 pMC extraneous carbon added. Cross-contamination tests show that the MCFs have no memory effect from previous samples...|$|R
40|$|Using Episcopic Differential Interference Contrast (EDIC) microscopy, {{this study}} has {{investigated}} the potential reapplication of prote ina ceouscontami napotential reapplication of proteinaceous contamination onto surgical instruments following a washer-disinfector cycle through the handling of staff within the clean room. The deposition of 0. 51 ng/mm 2 of protein onto surgical grade stainless <b>steel</b> by one <b>finger</b> print alone has been demonstrated. Moreover, using a previously described contamination index, a 5 to 10 -fold increase in protein present on surgical instruments was noted following handling by clean-room staff under current departmental practices, relative to instruments handled by staff wearing gloves. While unlikely to pose a direct risk to patient health, subsequent sterilisation will fix protein to an instrument surface thereby decreasing the effectiveness of further decontamination cycles. Current guidelines make no recommendations surrounding the use of gloves by staff working within the clean room. However {{it is clear that}} this matter must be reviewed to limit the unnecessary transference of protein to surgical instruments...|$|R
50|$|The dholki (Hindi/Urdu: pipe or tube) {{is often}} a bit {{narrower}} in diameter and uses tabla-style syahi masala on its treble skin. This instrument {{is also known as}} the naal. Its treble skin is stitched onto an iron ring, similarly to East Asian Janggu or Shime-daiko drums, which tenses the head before it is fitted. The bass skin often has the same structure as in ordinary dholak, being fitted on to a bamboo ring, but sometimes they have a kinar and pleated Gajra, as seen in tabla, to withstand the extra tension. Sri Lankan dholkis have high quality skins with syahi on both sides, producing a sound like a very high-pitched tabla and using a simplified tabla <b>fingering.</b> <b>Steel</b> tuning rings are not used - instead, wooden pegs are twisted to create a very high tension. The heads are created with triple stitching to withstand tension. Similar dholkis are in use in Maharashtra and elsewhere. Heavy hardwood dholaks are said to produce better sound than those carved of cheap unseasoned sapwood.|$|R
