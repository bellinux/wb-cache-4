25|$|In some areas, {{emergency}} responders {{are provided}} with specialized equipment, such as a Mobile Infrared Transmitter, which allows emergency response vehicles, particularly fire-fighting apparatus, to have high-priority travel by having the lights along their route change to green. The technology behind these methods has evolved, from panels at the fire department (which could trigger and control green lights for certain major corridors) to optical systems (which the individual fire apparatus can be equipped with to communicate directly with receivers on the <b>signal</b> <b>head).</b> In other areas, public transport buses have special equipment to get green lights.|$|E
25|$|This scheme, on {{the face}} of it, was a fairly {{standard}} colour light system, with each stop signal (which could show red or green) having an attendant repeater signal (showing red, yellow or green – the red used only for when the two stop signals on either side were also red). What made the scheme unusual was the provision of an automatic 'calling on' facility. The stop signals had an additional <b>signal</b> <b>head</b> ('marker light') that featured a red aspect plus a miniature yellow aspect. This marker light was mounted part way up the post. On repeater signals, the marker light was offset to the left-hand side of the post to indicate that the 'stop and proceed' rule applied. Junction stop signals were provided with two main signal heads, one mounted higher than the other. Splitting distant signals had three main heads, the centre one mounted higher than the other two.|$|E
25|$|Space {{neuroscience}} is {{the scientific}} study of the central nervous system (CNS) functions during spaceflight. Living systems can integrate the inputs from the senses to navigate in their environment and to coordinate posture, locomotion, and eye movements. Gravity has a fundamental role in controlling these functions. In weightlessness during spaceflight, integrating the sensory inputs and coordinating motor responses is harder to do because gravity is no longer sensed during free-fall. For example, the otolith organs of the vestibular system no longer <b>signal</b> <b>head</b> tilt relative to gravity when standing. However, they can still sense head translation during body motion. Ambiguities and changes in how the gravitational input is processed can lead to potential errors in perception, which affects spatial orientation and mental representation. Dysfunctions of the vestibular system are common during and immediately after spaceflight, such as space motion sickness in orbit and balance disorders after return to Earth.|$|E

50|$|In the {{configuration}} {{commonly known as}} Dallas phasing {{that began in the}} Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, the five-light left turn <b>signal</b> <b>head</b> is used in a different manner than standard signals of this type. The left turn <b>signal</b> <b>head</b> operates independently from the signals for straight through traffic. This allows permissive turning even when straight through traffic is shown a red light, avoiding yellow trap. Louvers are fitted over the green and yellow balls of the left turn <b>signal</b> <b>head</b> to prevent driver confusion. The left turn <b>signal</b> <b>head</b> is also accompanied by a sign indicating its special use.|$|E
50|$|In 1989 the box {{was taken}} out of use, with the <b>signal</b> <b>heads</b> being removed and the token {{instrument}} from Tan-y-Bwlch, and the although trap points (from Minffordd) were installed at the Tan-y-Bwlch end of the loop, they were never commissioned. During this period, the ground frame was only usable as a refuge siding, and {{it was not possible to}} cross passenger trains.|$|R

5000|$|Absolute - Absolute {{signals are}} usually {{connected}} to an interlocking {{controlled by a}} block operator or train dispatcher. Their most restrictive aspect is [...] "Stop" [...] and trains cannot pass them at Stop unless they obtain special authority.

40|$|There are {{different}} {{factors that affect}} driver’s behaviour at an urban signalized intersection. Complementary countdown <b>signal</b> <b>heads</b> {{can be used to}} inform the driver about the traffic light phase status. In the research presented in this paper, we explored how a countdown signal affects the driver’s reaction. We focused on the analysis of red/amber, red and amber running violations. We also observed and measured traffic flow start-up lost time and headway per cycle. Measurements took place in Ljubljana at a four-way intersection where two countdown <b>signal</b> <b>heads</b> are installed that face different directions. We used the “on-off-on” approach, using video surveillance and detection technology. According to the results of the investigative questionnaire, more than 84 % of the surveyed drivers expressed positive opinion about the device. Analyses of field-test results have shown that the red and/or amber running violation rate is higher when the device is turned off. The results of the paper suggest that the countdown device had very little effect on the capacity of an urban signalized intersection...|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. {{state of}} Massachusetts allows an unusual {{indication}} variation for pedestrian movement. At signalized intersections without separate pedestrian <b>signal</b> <b>heads,</b> the traffic <b>signals</b> may {{be programmed to}} turn red in all directions, followed by a steady display of yellow lights simultaneously with the red indications. During this red-plus-yellow indication, the intersection is closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrians may cross, usually in whatever direction they choose (this {{is known as a}} [...] "Barnes dance").|$|R
50|$|Permissive {{signals are}} {{indicated}} by a circular 'P' plate offset below the <b>signal</b> <b>head</b> and Absolute by a square 'A' plate directly below the <b>signal</b> <b>head.</b> As with three-position signalling, dwarf (low speed) signals are always absolute. An 'A' plate in New South Wales or Victoria means the signal is automatic {{and therefore a}} Permissive signal, which is again a source of conflicting meaning between the differing signalling systems.|$|E
50|$|The <b>signal</b> <b>head</b> is {{the portion}} of a colour light signal which {{displays}} the aspects. To display {{a larger number of}} indications, a single signal might have multiple signal heads. Some systems used a single head coupled with auxiliary lights to modify the basic aspect.|$|E
50|$|The first beacon in {{the area}} was an open coal fire set on <b>Signal</b> <b>Head,</b> {{with a range of}} 7 km. This was changed in 1821 to a large metal device burning oil, which was visible for 12 km, but shortly reverted to coal as the oil system was not reliable.|$|E

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is implementing Safetran's PTC as part of the need to upgrade the two largest commuter rail lines in the United States to increase locomotive speeds, provide additional train stations, and address the growing number of commuters.|$|R
25|$|Drivers at intersections with all-way {{stop control}} or traffic signals need the least sight distance. At all-way stops, drivers {{need to be}} able to see {{vehicles}} stopped at other approaches. At signals, drivers approaching the intersections need to see the <b>signal</b> <b>heads.</b> In jurisdictions that allow right turn on red, drivers in the right lane stop control need the same sight distance as two-way stop control. Although not needed during normal operations, additional sight distance should be provided for signal malfunctions and power outages.|$|R
25|$|Interlockings {{are places}} where tracks are {{connected}} by switches and where routes may conflict. They are arranged in a specific way, with switches and signals that prevent conflicting movements once one route is set up. Interlocking signals are fixed signals within an interlocking, containing two separate red-yellow-green <b>signal</b> <b>heads</b> and often other indications. A home signal is defined as an interlocking signal {{at the entrance to}} a route or block to control trains entering that route or block. These terms are used interchangeably, as most interlockings only have one controlled signal on each track.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a single}} track is involved, the signal is {{normally}} {{mounted on a}} post or [...] "mast" [...] which displays the arm or <b>signal</b> <b>head</b> at some height above the track, {{in order to allow}} it to be seen at a distance. The signal is normally placed on the engine driver's side of the track.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{era when}} intersections were often {{controlled}} by a single traffic <b>signal</b> <b>head,</b> many signals were installed on pedestals in the centers of intersections. Often referred to as [...] "dummy lights," [...] these installations often replaced beacons or [...] "mushrooms" [...] that denoted the centers of intersections and separated opposing traffic, with the infrastructure used for the beacons and mushrooms serving the new [...] "stop and go" [...] type signals.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not until}} the {{discovery}} of coal by Lt. John Shortland in 1797, that the island was viewed as having any significance. In 1804, <b>Signal</b> <b>Head</b> was the first place in Newcastle that any form of navigational aid was established. Originally a coal burning light, it was changed over to oil in 1821 {{for a short period of}} time but was reverted to coal as the oil system was not reliable.|$|E
5000|$|Automatic - Automatic {{signals are}} governed by logic {{connected}} through electrical track circuits which detect the presence of trains or obstructions automatically. Automatic signals are permissive with their most restrictive aspect {{being one of the}} [...] "Restricted Proceed" [...] variety. Trains can pass an automatic signal displaying [...] "Restricted Proceed" [...] without any outside permission. Automatic signals are typically recognized by having an attached number plate and in older practice, having multiple <b>signal</b> <b>heads</b> offset from each other on the mast (i.e., {{on opposite sides of the}} mast).|$|R

5000|$|The {{signal from}} the guitar (usually {{one of the main}} guitars [...] "EVO" [...] or [...] "FLO III") goes into either the Morley Bad Horsie or Dunlop 95q wah pedal. From there, it goes {{directly}} into the Ibanez Jemini twin distortion pedal, and then to the Digitech Whammy DT. From the output of the Whammy, the <b>signal</b> <b>heads</b> into the input of the Carvin Legacy amplifier head. Out of the effects loop of the Legacy, the <b>signal</b> <b>heads</b> directly into the Axe-Fx II XL, where it is split into stereo and the effects are applied (and controlled via the MFC-101 foot controller). Out of the output of the Axe-Fx, one signal is sent back to the original Legacy head return, and a second is sent to a second Carvin Legacy head return, bypassing the preamp stage completely and acting as a slave power amp. Vai utilizes his stereo setup on effects like delay, where he sets up two separate delay times (one slower and one faster) and allows them to alternate back and forth. The signal is then sent from the amp to the 4x12 Carvin Legacy speaker cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Vai uses AKG microphones to mic his amps, and uses a separate Carvin power amp to power a direct guitar monitor cabinet instead of relying on the PA.|$|R
50|$|Behind the <b>signal</b> <b>head</b> {{is placed}} a dark backing or target, which helps improve signal {{visibility}} in bright ambient lighting. Target designs vary, but are usually round or oval, {{depending on the}} layout of the signal lamps. For each type of signal there are usually a range of target dimensions that can be chosen by the individual railroad company. As dwarf signals are not designed to be seen from long distances, they are not generally equipped with targets.|$|E
5000|$|PATCO {{trains are}} governed by a Pulse code cab {{signaling}} system which transmits signal codes to the trains via the running rails. Wayside signals are located only at interlockings and consist of two lamps on a single <b>signal</b> <b>head,</b> one lunar white, the other red. There are three typical signal indications, Red for [...] "Stop", Lunar for [...] "proceed under cab signals on main route" [...] and flashing lunar for [...] "proceed under cab signals on diverging route".|$|E
5000|$|After the {{accident}} Jeffrey said he remembered SP77/X38 as yellow over white (actually an impossible aspect for that signal) therefore {{he must have}} either [...] "misremembered" [...] it at the time, or else have been fooled by some reflection off the <b>signal</b> <b>head</b> into thinking {{he had seen the}} usual yellow over green over white. In any case, he believed that grade timing was in use and so approached signal SP71 at the same speed as he would normally drive on this section.|$|E

25|$|The fast lines {{north of}} Harrow and all lines north of Rickmansworth are signalled with LUL signalling, but using four-aspect Network Rail <b>signal</b> <b>heads.</b> The upper two lights are a two-aspect stop signal {{displaying}} either a green or red aspect, the lower two lights a repeater signal {{for the next}} stop signal ahead showing a green or yellow aspect, or no aspect when the stop signal shows a red aspect. Thus they are effectively four-light three-aspect signals with green/red/green/yellow lights from the top, danger being a single red light, caution the top green light over a yellow light, and clear two green lights.|$|R
50|$|Some jurisdictions use special {{small blue}} {{lights on the}} reverse of <b>signal</b> <b>heads</b> to {{indicate}} a red light lit on that head. They are used to communicate {{the presence of a}} red signal to police so they can view the situation without having to traverse the intersection. Other jurisdictions simply drill a small hole in the red signal visor to allow police to see the status of the signal from a wide angle (but not directly opposite the signal). In France, the back of the red lights are sometimes designed with a red cross to indicate that the light is red.|$|R
