The three make camp and sleep through the night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it {{would do the same}} to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it.|$|E

She agrees to tell Homer who <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> winner will be, but she fears that she may be so distraught that she subconsciously wants Homer to lose his bet, leading her to a cryptic prediction: if she still loves Homer, Washington will win; if she does not, Buffalo. As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. Homer becomes happy and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves Homer, in which she agrees. Homer cancels his bowling date with Barney and—on the Sunday after the Super Bowl—makes good on his promise to go hiking with Lisa.|$|E

Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to stare at the blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is [...] "the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell ourselves that this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [...] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program."

2500|$|In this book, hooks {{combines}} {{her personal}} life experiences, along with philosophical and psychological ideas, to shape her thesis and discuss her main concepts. She criticizes {{the way in which}} love is used in today's society. To further explain, how we use the word without much meaning, when referring to how much we like or enjoy our favorite ice cream, color, or game. Hooks is very disturbed by the fact that our culture has lost the true meaning of love, and believes it is because we have no shared definition. For this reason, the first chapter of her book primarily focuses on what <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> definition of love is, which she explains includes components such as care, affection, trust, respect, honesty, communication, and commitment. She proposes that if we all came to the agreement that love is a verb rather than a noun, then we would all be happier. Hooks believes love is more of an interactive process. It is not about what we just feel, but more about what we do. She states, [...] "So many people think that it's enough to say what they feel, even if their actions do not correspond to what they are feeling" [...] ("A Chat"). Bell hooks strongly clarifies why society needs to adopt a universal definition of love.|$|E

Through his company Nauticos he extensively searched a [...] quadrant {{north and west}} of Howland Island during two deep-sea sonar expeditions (2002 and 2006, total cost $4.5million) and found nothing.
