40|$|During {{the last}} decade, Tissue Velocity Imaging (TVI) {{established}} as a routine diagnostic tool in human medicine. Nowadays it is used in small animal medicine with increasing importance. Primary studies adumbrate a utilizability of TVI in horses as well. The objective {{of this study was}} to test TVI <b>section</b> <b>planes</b> according to the 16 segment-modell of the American Society of Echocardiography to their adaptability on horses. Therefore 12 horses with no clinical signs after clinical and conventional echocardiographic examination have been investigated by coloured and pulsed-wave TVI in the equine clinic of the Free Universtity of Berlin. Coloured TVI was performed on 6, pulsed-wave TVI on 5 measuring points of the left ventricle. In addition 22 horses were examed with the same modus operandi. 11 of these 22 patients showed a at least moderate insufficiency of the aortic valve. 9 of the 11 horses showed a dilatation of the left heart chamber, 1 with an accessory enlarged left atrium. The other 11 horses exhibited an at least moderate insufficiency of the mitral valve with a dilatated left atrium in 7 patients. The measurements enfolded 4 complete heart cycles that have been saved digital as cineloops. The myocardial systolic peak velocity was measured off-line in each cycle. The identification of the adequate velocity graph was secured with a revolving ECG. The assignability of the TVI <b>section</b> <b>planes</b> used in human medicine to horses is possible. The measurement of the radial myocardial velocity succeeded in all positions scheduled therefore in humans. A reliable determination of longitudinal myocardial deformation is not possible in horses. In addition to the measured section plane, differences occurred among the groups. The horses with aortic valve insufficiency showed a significant increase of systolic peak velocity in all <b>section</b> <b>planes</b> and examination modes along the interventricular septum. On the other hand, the examination of horses with mitral valve insufficiency did only show patrial significant differences in myocardial systolic peak velocities compared to horses with no clinical findings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, five {{kinds of}} power {{ultrasonic}} transducers with different <b>section</b> <b>plane</b> positions are designed and {{the shapes of}} the transducers are straight. The different <b>section</b> <b>plane</b> position changes with the length l 2 of front cover. That is to say, the longer l 2 is, the more front the position of the section is. The experiment indicates the great influence of the <b>section</b> <b>plane</b> position on the transducer performance. With the increase of the length of the front cover, the dynamic resistance reduces gradually, and the resonance frequency and the anti-resonance frequency also reduce. Under this condition, the anti-resonance frequency declines more sharply, and the mechanical quality factor increases gradually, but the effective mechanical and electrical coupling coefficient reduces gradually. The transducer has different measure targets in different situations. Therefore, different parameters may be primordially considered to be designed according to the actual use of the transducer in this paper. This provides the reference for manufacture and use of transducers...|$|R

Methods: Here, 17 cases of otosclerosis and 22 cases of ossicular chain deformity were selected. All patients had normal external ear canals, intact tympanic membranes, conductive hearing loss, type A tympanograms, and negative Gelle's tests. The respective radiological reports of the status of the ossicles via 3 protocols were compared to surgical findings. The quantitative assessments of the representation of different segments of the ossicular chain were based on a 3 -point scoring system. Results: MPR and CTVR imaging both showed the integrity of whole ossicular chain well. MPR and CTVR imaging were found to be superior to <b>section</b> <b>planes</b> with respect to showing the superstructure of the stapes and malformations (P >  0. 05). Conclusion: CTVR and MPR imaging were found to be better able to show the whole ossicular chain in the conductive hearing loss with normal tympanic membranes.

The runtime on a standard PC is about 0. 02 s which indicates that the extension to 3 D volume data should be feasible. ...|$|E

40|$|The Cavalieri method allows to {{estimate}} the volume of a compact object from area measurements in equidistant parallel planar sections. However, the spacing and thickness of sections can be quite irregular in applications. Recent publications have thus focused {{on the effect of}} random variability in section spacing, showing that the classical Cavalieri estimator is still unbiased when the stack of parallel planes is stationary, but that the existing variance approximations must be adjusted. The present paper considers the special situation, where the distances between consecutive <b>section</b> <b>planes</b> can be measured and thus where Cavalieri’s estimator can be replaced by a quadrature rule with randomized sampling points.

Its relationship to the symmetry Oh of the three-dimensional subspace F∗x which is orthogonal to the translation Tx is clarified. From the general symmetry operations of form spaces F for N points in En, it is deduced that F must display an n-axial symmetry (for three points in E 2, a biaxial symmetry had already been found).
