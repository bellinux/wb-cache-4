In the 1800s mechanical crimpers were invented {{to shape the}} ribbons. Finger-like crimpers simulated the curl originally put into the candy by hand. A candy maker made the candy, another spun off a ribbon and fed it into a crimper which was then turned by hand. Finally, the curly ribbon was cut with scissors as it came down a <b>small</b> <b>conveyor.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} {{different}} component of conveyor pulley (shell, end disk, hub, and shaft) failure and the stresses generated on them are discussed. The basic {{idea is to}} present the state of work about the conveyor pulley design analysis. The outer diameter of conveyor pulley to shaft diameter {{is a measure of}} the flexible nature of the end disc. This ratio was approximately 6 to 8 by Leo J Laughlin [1]. If the ratio of outer diameter of conveyor pulley to shaft diameter <b>smaller,</b> then <b>conveyor</b> pulley end disc will tend to be rigid. If the ratio of outer diameter of conveyor pulley to shaft diameter larger then conveyor pulley end disc will tend to be flexible. So conveyor pulley diameter to shaft diameter ratio in the range of five to eight then their stresses were fairly low. The paper was mainly focused on the improvement in the design and dimension of conveyor pulley which helpful for computational level. I...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{seated in}} the [...] "logs", riders are taken up a {{conveyor}} belt lift hill. Part of the hill loops underneath of {{another part of the}} ride. At the top, the log takes a small drop and takes a sharp turn. Unlike most log flumes, Le Scoot stays high in the air, held by large poles. When passing by treetops, the chute the ride is in expands (although rails keep the log on-track) to give the illusion the log is in a pond. A <b>small</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt then brings the log up a few feet to avoid log collisions, and takes a steep, tall drop. Next, due to the backfiring currents of the previous drop, rapids form. After passing more rails, the log takes a small turn and near a sawmill narrowly dodged by the nearby Alpengeist roller coaster. A safety recording is played in the sawmill, warning riders to [...] "remain seated". Once in the sawmill, another <b>small</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt takes the logs up a few feet to, again, avoid collisions. The log then takes its largest, most notable plunge over a large pool of water. A last, small hill drains excess water from the ride's chute and takes the logs on a sharp turn extremely close to Alpengeist's track. A pendulum is used on high-business days to separate logs into to different waiting lines, and brings riders back to the boarding cabin.|$|E
50|$|Riders {{begin by}} {{climbing}} 65 {{feet to the}} top of the Blastenhoff tower. Two-passenger rafts are brought {{to the top of}} the tower on a conveyor belt. After passengers board and once the blocking systems indicates the channel ahead is clear, a <b>small</b> <b>conveyor</b> rolls the raft forward into the first drop — the ride's largest. At the bottom of the drop, water jets propel the raft uphill into a small dip and then another short uphill section. The raft then enters an enclosed tube section and travels 190 degrees back the other direction. This section features two drops and two uphill blasts followed by a right turn in an enclosed tube. Upon exiting the tube the raft drops downhill, turns right again then drops downhill a second time. Another uphill blast leads to a downhill section then the final uphill blast sends the rafts into an enclosed tube with a right turn helix followed by a left turn then a final small drop into the splash pool.|$|E
50|$|Up to 16 guests would board a Research Probe vessel {{which would}} begin a slow journey towards the smaller {{of the two}} volcanoes. Throughout the ride, {{pre-recorded}} audio of the Coast Guard was played through the boat's speakers. At the entry riders would go up a <b>small</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt hill into the volcano. The boat would then descend the hill and splashdown in the main show building. After flowing around a corner, the boat would rapidly accelerate down a long passage. The water would cause the boat to decelerate with a splash. The ride continued with the boat flowing slowly around several show scenes which include various special effects including Pepper's Ghost which allowed a spaceship to seemingly disappear. The boat would {{come to a halt}} at what seemed like a dead end with a television screen in front. Through the use of a turntable, the boat was turned away from the screen. A set of doors open behind the boat before it began to travel backwards into another room. Here, several special effects were used to simulate the flooding of a building. The boat was then turned towards the main conveyor lift hill. It would rise towards {{to the top of the}} volcano where fireballs were shot. The boat would then descend the final drop and exits via the second, larger volcano.|$|E
40|$|This thesis project aims {{to improve}} {{operational}} engineering {{processes in the}} automation industry. The engineering operations at FlexLink are responsible for designing customized conveyor solutions according to customer specifications. FlexLink is expecting significant growth during {{the next five years}} and is in need of increased capacity. During the past they have experienced difficulties in growing without investing corresponding resources. In other words, they could only grow at a linear rate. Therefore, FlexLink desires to increase the productivity of their operations in order to achieve larger output with the same amount of input, thus allowing exponential growth. Several improvement projects were initiated within the global Lean Six Sigma (LSS) program deployed at the company, with the purpose of facilitating the future growth plans. This thesis was one of the initiated LSS projects and had its focus on investigating smaller engineering projects where the outcome is a simple conveyor system design. In addition to the overall capacity and productivity problem, FlexLink had received indications that they are too expensive in the category of <b>smaller</b> <b>conveyor</b> systems and thus less competitive in this area. The company desired {{to reduce the amount of}} manual engineering work in the engineering projects as much as possible by automating process steps, as a means to become more competitive in delivering simple conveyor solutions. The thesis project was performed according to the DMAIC framework known from Six Sigma, in combination with the corporate group guidelines for LSS projects. The process of small engineering projects was investigated in order to both identify waste in the process and explore the possibility of automating process steps. The result was identification of over 6000 engineering hours/year of waste in the process, as well as concrete improvement recommendations with 1. 5 MSEK in annual savings by automating process steps into the already existing IT tools. Furthermore, a new productivity KPI was introduced in order to monitor and measure the performance of future improvement projects. The KPI was tested on historical data, which showed that FlexLink had indeed not been able to increase productivity during the past two years...|$|R
50|$|A {{discontinuous}} conveyor {{also called}} a reciprocating elevator, lifts the product on to a platform using a platform, roller conveyor or belt conveyor and then moves the platform with {{the product to}} another level. Because of the cycle time required for input and output as well as lifting/lowering movements, such a conveyor can only be used for <b>smaller</b> capacities. Continuous <b>conveyors</b> {{are more suitable for}} bigger capacities. There are two important solutions which can be used for this group. It is possible to choose a spiral conveyor or a continuous product lift. Both solutions are able to handle several products at a time.|$|R
50|$|The exposed drum shafts {{are used}} to install and fix the drum motor into the {{conveyor}} frame and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal belt tension of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for <b>small</b> light duty <b>conveyors</b> and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high belt tension.|$|R

The idea behind this project is to reduce the utilization of human energy especially in manufacturing industry. The project involves of development pick and place system a using ABB IRB 1400 industrial robot. In this project, the IRB 1400 robot was program to perform pick and place task. The robot was equipped with robotic sensor to detect the work pieces. Using the ABB robot’s Rapid software, the program was downloaded to the robot controller, S 4 Cplus. By teaching the robot points with the Teach Pendants, we can execute the ABB robot program sequences. In the manufacturing system, conveyor work as a method of work part delivery. Model of <b>small</b> <b>conveyor</b> was constructed to delivery the work pieces from the incoming part. The sensors were mounted to the conveyor, which is to sense the incoming material and also to control the operation of the conveyor motor.

40|$|The current Project {{consists}} on {{the implementation}} of an automation training panel for the electronics and automation engineering students at ESPOL University, with the purpose to provide a didactic tool so that the power electronics laboratory’s students could develop any other applications using the equipment and electrical machinery currently available at the laboratory. Also, an auger filling system, consisting of a <b>small</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt and a hopper, was automated as a demonstrative application for the panel. This training panel was designed to have a HMI and a PLC with its digital inputs and outputs wired to terminals on its front face. The same digital inputs on the front face, are represented as two position switches in case it {{is needed to simulate}} an external signal, and the digital outputs have pilot lights that work as state indicators. The same principle was applied to the PLC’s analog inputs and outputs, using a variable DC voltage power source to simulate an external signal if desired. The actuators of the filling system were two AC servomotors with their respective AC drives. The control of the devices was made through a PROFIBUS link between the PLC and the drives...|$|E
40|$|A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (NIOSH) {{mine fire}} {{detection}} re-search project was undertaken to evaluate multiple mine fire sensor types for nuisance alarm discrimination. The response of multiple fire sensor types to three small coal fire and three <b>small</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt {{fires in the}} presence of diesel emissions was evaluated in NIOSH 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) Safety Re-search Coal Mine (SRCM). An array of fire sensors which included an optical and ionization smoke sensor, a chemical cell CO sensor, and Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) sensors, was used to sample the diesel engine and fire source emissions. The mine fire detection experiments demonstrated the ability of a MOS sensor with a bimodal response to NOx and products-of-combustion (POC) to respond to the onset of smoldering combustion {{in the presence of}} CO and POC particulates from a diesel locomotive. As part of an in-mine evaluation in an operating coal mine, the MOS NOx responsive sensor and an ionization smoke sensor was demonstrated as a method to discriminate diesel emissions and cross-interference of H 2 on a CO chemical cell fire sensor at a battery charging station. The reinforcement of mine fire sensor information with the use of multiple sensor types, such as an MOS sensor and ionization and optical smoke sensors, is shown to be important for nuisance alarm discrimination and early mine fire detection...|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the process}} of how an informal information becomes a rumor. It is possible only in a certain situation. It is called rumor situation. It has two main conditions: right place where people can share informal information; and a wish to get additional information about a person, an event or a phenomenon interesting for an individual. Information presentation is conceived {{as a process of}} three stages. First stage – pre–interaction stage: a conveyor contacts the talker and clears up his preferences. Second stage – presentation of information (content of rumor). In this stage special attention is paid to: 1) rumors “quality” which influences its acceptability and  2) tactics of rumor information presentation. There are five criteria of rumor quality: Information should be presented as special communication and confidence value; Information should not contradict the objective and obvious heart of the matter; Information should be presented in understandable and popular forrm; Information should raise a wish to find out more details and particularities; Information should be characteristic. On the ground of above-mentioned criteria it is possible to valuate acceptability of rumor to information receiver who sometimes turns to be especially finicky and critical user. In order to clear these obstacles two fold tactics is used. First, criticism towards presented information should be neutralized using active and passive ways of rumor offering. Second, interest of a receiver should be stimulated proportionally and information presented considering a receiver’s psychological type. Third stage – “exit” from a rumor: rumor unlike other forms of communication has no accomplished mechanism because is permanently “renewed”. Usually rumor dies when a person ends it voluntarily. However, it is not simply to end the game of a rumor. All the participants of rumor cycle (conveyor – receiver – conveyor) do not want or, in other words, are afraid to exit first. This disinclination is related to three circumstances. First, with exit he reduces his possibilities {{to find out more about}} a person or an event interesting to him, i. e. to satisfy his curiosity. Second, he does not feel safe because he himself may become “the third”, i. e. object of rumors. Third, with exit from the rumor cycle he challenges common everyday communication where a rumor is an integral part. Rejection of such communication may grow into social isolation. That is precisely the thing of an individual fears. It is true to say that a rumor is a particular communicative game and an individual is inveigled into it by society. No wonder all people despite their social position, profession and living place are bigger or <b>smaller</b> rumor <b>conveyors</b> (creators) and receivers.  </p...|$|R
