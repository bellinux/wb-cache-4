40|$|Winter {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} rapid dehydration and cracking of teat tissue, thus increasing mastitis risks. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the teat end health and <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> performance of two experimental heptanoic acid based teat dips vs the commercial product Remain Gold ® using a split udder design during the winter season under best management winter milking practices. The experimental heptanoic acid teat dips KX- 6185 and KX- 6186 showed similar teat end health and teat <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> to Remain Gold under winter conditions. Marked changes in teat end scores were measured over time and over periods as short as days. On the other hand, product treatment comparisons frequently showed parallel trends in score averages. This illustrates the importance of a split udder design to evaluate <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> performance. The split udder design minimizes the risk of experimental bias due to cow and environmental factors. Most reported teat skin studies rely on comparing teat dips in separate cow groups with little consideration to group balancing even though factors such as hyperkeratosis is known to be affected by cow age and lactation stage. This study illustrates the high risk of traditional design skin toleration studies inaccurately attributing effects to teat dips...|$|R
30|$|The INCI list {{indicates}} the possible functions in cosmetic products. Some natural substances are ‘antiseborrheic’[*], ‘emollient’[*], ‘keratolytic’[*], ‘refreshing’[*], ‘skin conditioning’[*], ‘skin protecting’[*], ‘smoothing’[*], ‘soothing’[*], ‘solvent’[*], or ‘tonic’. Only one ‘colorant’ (Beta vulgaris/Beta vulgaris extract) and one ‘hair dye’ (Lawsonia inermis extract, {{which is the}} extract of the henna plant) is among them. Some are ‘antimicrobials’[*], {{but no one has}} the function ‘preservative’ (Note: There are many non-natural compounds listed in the INCI with the function ‘preservative’, e.g. benzylalcohol or benzylparaben.). For Usnea barbata extract, the function ‘deodorant’ and for ten other natural substances, e.g. Citrus aurantium bergamia oil, Mentha viridis oil¸ Prunus amygdalus amara oil, Ruta graveolens oil, and Sambucus nigra oil, ‘masking’ was the only function indicated. Some natural substances are ‘deodorant’ or ‘masking’ in addition to other functions, e.g. ‘tonic’. Other cosmetic ingredients used due to their odor are listed in the INCI list part II ‘Perfume and aromatic raw materials’ [15] and not in the INCI list analyzed here. It was found that some substances with different INCI names, different origins, obviously different chemical compositions, and also different functions in a product were itemized with identical EC and CAS numbers in the INCI list, e.g. Avena sativa bran extract (abrasive), Avena sativa extract (emollient), and Avena sativa meal extract (soothing), all three with the CAS 84012 - 26 - 0 and the EC 281 - 672 - 4, or Citrus aurantium dulcis flower oil (astringent and tonic), Citrus aurantium dulcis flower water (<b>skin</b> <b>conditioning),</b> Citrus aurantium dulcis peel cera (emollient and <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning),</b> Citrus aurantium dulcis peel extract (emollient, <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning),</b> and Citrus aurantium dulcis seed extract (<b>skin</b> <b>conditioning),</b> all five with the CAS 8028 - 48 - 6 and the EC 232 - 433 - 8.|$|R
