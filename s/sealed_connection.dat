50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel <b>seal.</b> Face <b>seal</b> <b>connections</b> are similar to the DIN regulator <b>connection</b> <b>seal,</b> and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with handed thread, and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|R

During assembly, a flare nut is used to secure the flared tubing's tapered end to the also tapered fitting, producing a pressure-resistant, leak-tight <b>seal.</b> Flared <b>connections</b> offer a high degree of long-term reliability and for this reason are often used in mission-critical and inaccessible locations.|$|R

50|$|This {{system has}} the {{advantage}} of being able to be tightened mechanically before being sealed. Most threaded systems, such as NPT, have a seal provided by a taper in the thread, so it is difficult to orient both ends of the hose, pipe or tube so that it is not twisted. In the o-ring boss system, this problem is eliminated because the threads do not <b>seal</b> the <b>connection</b> and therefore can be rotated at least a full revolution before they are sealed while maintaining a proper mechanical connection. The orientation problem could also be solved with a suitable union.|$|R

50|$|A {{problem with}} all the {{aforementioned}} cables, when passing current, is that electrolytic corrosion can occur in the connections unless moisture and air are excluded.

The second proposal, by the American Channel Master company (now owned by Andrews corp.) at least as early as 1999, was to apply silicone grease to the wires making connection. The third proposal was to fit a self-sealing plug to the cable. All of these methods are reasonably successful if implemented correctly.|$|R

The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep (EWP) which is typically at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accommodate the filler weld metal. The most common pipe thread in North America is the National Pipe Thread (NPT) or the Dryseal (NPTF) version.

30|$|Similarly to casing material, casing {{connections}} have {{to withstand}} high thermally induced loads. Due to extremely high thermally induced cyclic stresses, {{it is believed}} that both conventional API buttress and premium casing couplings will experience failure in wells investigating supercritical resources. Extensive research is currently being carried out within the frameworks of GeoWell and DEEPEGS project focused on the development of flexible couplings for high-enthalpy geothermal wells (Kaldal et al. 2016). This new solution will allow for axial movement of casing strings (as bends are not possible in a vertical wellbore) to avoid coupling rupture due to periods of heating (thermal expansion) and cooling (high tensile forces due to contraction of steel) during maintenance work and should avoid generating stresses above yield strength of the casing material and reducing likelihood of casing collapse. During running casing, couplings will be in open mode. While heating up, the casing material will expand allowing for each coupling to expand freely downwards via a slip-joint and closing the system before reaching the expected temperatures, with enough residual axial force to <b>seal</b> the <b>connection.</b>|$|R

Experiments on single-lap joints were carried out to determine the influence of parameters, specific for renovation, on the shear strength. The material of the substrate (modern construction steel/ 19 th century mild steel), its surface roughness (obtained by grit blasting) and its treatment (application of zinc-phosphate epoxy paint) were tested. All substrates were bonded with an MS polymer adhesive. The experiments demonstrated that a variation in surface roughness has a small effect on the average shear strength, which is positive for the renovation practice. However, the time period between grit blasting and bonding/applying a paint layer seemed crucial...|$|R
50|$|The wire in a {{voice coil}} is usually made of copper, though aluminum—and, rarely, silver—may be used. The {{advantage}} of aluminum is its light weight, which reduces the moving mass compared to copper. This raises the resonant frequency of the speaker and increases its efficiency.

Voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular, rectangular, or hexagonal, giving varying amounts of wire volume coverage in the magnetic gap space. The coil is oriented co-axially inside the gap; it moves back and forth within a small circular volume (a hole, slot, or groove) in the magnetic structure. The gap establishes a concentrated magnetic field between the two poles of a permanent magnet; the outside of the gap being one pole, and the center post (called the pole piece) being the other. The pole piece and backplate are often a single piece, called the poleplate or yoke.|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of composite materials in engineering applications has observed a rapid {{increase over the}} last few decades. The U. S. Navy currently has an objective to enhance its future naval capabilities by developing hull-forms with advanced materials, including composites. Speed can be increased by reduction in weight and by incorporating innovative shaping of the hull-form, which can potentially be achieved with composites. Any naval vessel using composite materials for structural components will require hybrid connections of some sort, where composite sections are joined to metallic sub-structures. Joints are critical regions in the design of hybrid systems, as failures typically occur at joints and interfaces and rarely within the bulk of the structure. Accordingly, this effort presents the development of a watertight, hybrid composite/metal bolted joint, for cases where the panels are removable. An experimental study was conducted to quantify the performance of numerous hybrid joints with various geometries, loaded in flexure.

According to what mentioned above, {{it would be necessary}} to make an investigation on the effect of drag and/or torque on buckling of tubular inside horizontal wellbore (the so-called torque-drag-buckling relationship), the study depends mainly on conducting experimental tests and develop Finite Element Model, and utilize the results to predict the tubular behavior under different circumstances of torque and drag, also these results were compared and verified with some of theoretical approaches. Results obtained from this study indicates that torsion load had a little effect on buckling of tubular in horizontal section, this effect increase with decrease in pipe stiffness. Helical buckling tends to increase highly drag force, and thus eliminates transmission of axial load to the bit.
