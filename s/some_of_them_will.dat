5|$|The {{mating system}} of {{pinnipeds}} varies from extreme polygyny to serial monogamy. Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, {{and the remaining}} 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with {{them as well as}} defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, and those that are tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> even fast. If a male leaves the beach to feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance. Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur—all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber. Larger males also likely enjoy access to feeding grounds that smaller ones are unable to access due to their lower thermoregulatory ability and decreased energy stores. In some instances, only the largest males are able to reach the furthest deepest foraging grounds where they enjoy maximum energetic yields that are unavailable to smaller males and females.|$|E
25|$|The Myanmar Army {{announced}} on 15 November 2016 that 69 Rohingya insurgents and 17 security forces (10 policemen, 7 soldiers) {{had been killed}} in recent clashes in northern Rakhine State, bringing the death toll to 134 (102 insurgents and 32 security forces). It was also announced that 234 people suspected of being connected to the attack were arrested. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> later be sentenced to death for their involvement in the 9 October's attacks.|$|E
25|$|It {{is a fine}} {{thing that}} a man astride two wheels can, in a six-day race, {{distance}} a hound, horse, or a locomotive. It confirms the assumption, no longer much contested, that the human animal is superior to the other animals. But this undisputed thing is being said in too solemn and painful way at Madison Square Garden. An athletic contest in which participants 'go queer' in their heads, and strain their powers until their faces become hideous with the tortures that rack them, is not sport. It is brutality. Days and weeks of recuperation {{will be needed to}} put the Garden racers in condition, and it is likely that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> never recover from the strain.|$|E

25|$|Early on the day, Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley {{also spent}} some time working to {{successfully}} repair the door that gives the crew access to the LiOH canisters. Mission Specialist Magnus spent {{about an hour and}} a half in the morning taking microbial air samples on various locations in the space station. The collected samples will be returned for study and further analysis. Magnus also worked the Japanese Experiment Module Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS). Mission Specialist Walheim along with station crew member Mike Fossum continued work with spacewalking equipment in the Quest airlock. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> be left on the station, and will be utilized during an upcoming Russian spacewalks on 3 August 2011. Hurley working with station crew member Ron Garan stored some of the cargo in Atlantis's middeck to be returned. Since no astronaut was riding in the mid-deck, on the way back, it was expected to be fully packed with 1564 pounds of cargo. Among cargo brought to the space station, 2281 pounds were also in the mid-deck.|$|E
2500|$|On September 24, 2007, the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior {{announced}} it would file criminal charges against the Blackwater staff involved in the shooting, although {{it is unclear how}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> be brought to trial. A senior aide to al-Maliki said that three of the Blackwater guards were Iraqis and could be subject to prosecution. The aide also said that the Iraqi government was pushing for an apology, compensation for victims or their families and for the guards involved in the shooting to be held [...] "accountable".|$|E
2500|$|Seungsahn {{also held}} unorthodox views on Zen {{practice}} in Western culture, and {{was open to}} the idea of his dharma heirs starting their own schools as he had done, Dae Gak and George Bowman (Bomun) being two examples. Seung Sahn is quoted as having said, [...] "As more Zen Masters appear, their individual styles will emerge. Perhaps <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> make their own schools. So maybe, slowly, this Korean style will disappear and be replaced by an American style or American styles. But the main line does not change."

6000|$|At {{that moment}} {{there had been}} a check,--as there is {{generally}} after a short spurt, when fox, hounds, and horsemen get off together, and not always in the order in which they have been placed here.
