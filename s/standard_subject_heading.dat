40|$|The medical {{literature}} {{has grown to}} an unmanageable size, {{and we need to}} develop information systems that provide better accessibil-ity. An internal medicine residency program is an ideal setting for developing a system in which articles are screened for usefulness in clinical decision making and organized to be rapidly accessible and relatively inexpensive to use. In our residency training program, we use clinical problem-solving, journal club article review, and teach-ing conference preparation to generate appropriate articles from PAPERCHASE (MEDLINE) database searches. With the chief resident supervising the process, articles are then selected and organized in a computerized article file. The software program, Reference Manager (Research Information Systems, Inc., Encini-tas, California), stores article citations and supports searches using <b>standard,</b> medical <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> vocabulary key words. In an 18 -month period, residents have collected more than 1800 refer-ences appropriate to clinical decision making and have established an article file that is now used daily as a medical information source...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{teaching}} {{is determined by}} a host of factors, not least of which is the educational guidance given to the teacher. This guidance should come about through an effecctively designed support structure initiated by the school principal as part of his management strategy. Very little has been written on this topic, particularly with reference to primary schools. In the past, geography teachers were trained, appointed to a school and expected to get on with their teaching. However, present-day teachers, in order to be effective educators, require in-service training. This should occur In a variety of ways and on a continuous basis, because {{teaching is}} an on-going business and not a job to be learned once and for always. This thesis investigates the organisational structures that exist for the teaching of geography in selected medium and large primary schools in the Eastern Cape. The author found that principals used either a <b>subject</b> <b>head</b> or <b>standard</b> head model. In large primary schools a <b>subject</b> <b>head</b> model was preferred i. e. a specialist geography teacher was responslble for developing the <b>subject</b> vertically from <b>standard</b> 2 to 5. The opposite was true in medium-sized schools. Principals of these schools preferred to delegate responsibility to a standard head. It was the duty ot the standard head, usually a generalist teacher without specific training in geography, to develop geography horizontally among, for example, all the standard 3 pupils. The role played by key members of a primary schools' instructional leadership team, namely the principal, <b>subject</b> <b>head,</b> and the <b>standard</b> head are examined in detail. The author offers justification why geography should be included In the primary curriculum. It is his contention that geography contributes to a child's general education, develops basic geographical skills, extends general mental abilities and fosters positive attitudes towards other people with whom he shares this world. A management model is proposed for principals, flexible enough for application in all schools. It is designed to ensure that teachers continue growing professionaIIy within the structure of a small group. There is no best way to organise the teaching of geography because each school has its own unique resources which should be optimally utilised in order to bring about learning. The professional development of geography teachers is possible because someone competent in geographical education should assume leadership of the qroup. This will enable ideas to be shared, plans made and strategies implemented in an eftort to improve teacher-competence through an efficiently organised geography department. In the final chapter conclusions are drawn and a recommendatlon is made for primary school principals to Implement an organlsatlonal model for the teaching of geography. A choice may be made from three models, namely a <b>standard</b> <b>head,</b> <b>subject</b> <b>head</b> or a comblnation of both models. It Is within the parameters of one of these structures that the subject can be properly managed, for example, field-trips planned, teaching aids purchased, envlronmental educatlon programmes designed, teaching strategies discussed and examinat(ons set. Thls view is supported by Cawood and GIbbon's (1980) empirical evidence. They found that good educatlonal leadership fosters effective teaching in schools...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cross-coupled}} stimuli on the semicircular canals are {{shown to be}} influenced by the position of the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> with respect to gravity and the axis of rotation, but not by the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> position relative to the trunk. Seventeen healthy <b>subjects</b> made <b>head</b> yaw movements out of the horizontal plane while lying on a horizontal platform (MIT short radius centrifuge) rotating at 23 rpm about an earth-vertical axis. The subjects reported the magnitude and duration of the illusory pitch or roll sensations elicited by the cross-coupled rotational stimuli acting on the semicircular canals. The results suggest an influence of head position relative to gravity. The magnitude estimation is higher and the sensation decays more slowly when the head's final position is toward nose-up (gravity in the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> x-z-plane) compared to when the head is turned toward the side (gravity in the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> y-z-plane). The results are discussed with respect to artificial gravity in space and the possible role of pre-adaptation to cross-coupled angular accelerations on earth...|$|R
40|$|IFLA Principles Underlying <b>Subject</b> <b>Heading</b> Languages were {{published}} in 1995 and translated into Slovene in 2002. They try to recover the theory of indexing languages from an analysis of <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> languages {{that are used in}} libraries around the world. These guidelines are illustrated with examples from Splošni slovenski geslovnik (Slovene General Subject Headings, Sears List of Subject Headings, and Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). Studies on the use of LCSH by users of library catalogs were reviewed to determine weaknesses of the IFLA Principles. Changes were suggested,which would make subject retrieval easier for users. The reviewed <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> languages reflect the needs of traditional librarians and card catalogs. These often conflict with user needs, characteristics of online catalogs and modern librarians. <b>Subject</b> <b>heading</b> languages could be improved if we would take into account the vast knowledge of user behavior and capabilities of information technology. For a better subject access to library materials, we also need to understand the processes of subject analysis and subject description...|$|R

40|$|The Master's {{thesis is}} focused on the Polythematic Structured <b>Subject</b> <b>Heading</b> System, an {{indexing}} language created at the State Technical Library and used for document indexing and retrieval both in this library and in other institutions. The objective of the thesis is to evaluate the history of the <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> system and suggest ways how it can be further developed. First of all the history of the <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> system is described, both in the context of indexing and classification of documents in the State Technical Library and trends in knowledge organization in general. Then the current situation of the system is analyzed both from the formal and factual point of view. Tools used for the maintenance and presentation of the system are highlighted. The thesis also includes the description of relevant processes and suggests ways how to optimize the processes. Updating, maintenance and marketing are especially emphasized. The possibilities to use modern information and communication technologies for the further development of the <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> system are described in detail. Authority files, markup languages and on-line library catalogues are included in the analysis. A draft of a new development policy for the system and new maintenance and indexing rules are also part of the thesis...|$|R
