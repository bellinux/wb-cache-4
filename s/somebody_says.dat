In {{one of his last}} interviews, Steiger said: [...] "What is the greatest thing an artist in any profession can give to a person?—that would be a constructive, warm memory. Because that gets into your brain and therefore into your life, so to speak. And that's it, when <b>somebody</b> <b>says</b> to me 'I'll never forget', that's worth more to me than five Academy Awards, I'm in that person's life".|$|E

2500|$|Top-ranked LSU {{defeated}} sixth-ranked, rival Ole Miss, 14–0 {{in a game}} {{dominated by}} defense and penalties. 68,000 fans packed Tiger Stadium to watch the Tigers win their first game against the Rebels since 1950. Ole Miss was LSU's most bitter rival at the time, and fans who heard and read about the Chinese Bandits and Billy Cannon wanted to see them first-hand. [...] "It's not a rivalry because <b>somebody</b> <b>says</b> it is," [...] said Cannon, [...] "or because you've been playing against a team for a long time. It's a rivalry when two good teams meet and either one could walk out the winner. This was a rivalry." [...] Banners were strung around the LSU campus with the words [...] "Go to Hell, Ole Miss." [...] Later, a plane dropped leaflets on campus that read [...] "Go to Hell, LSU." [...] Some thought Dietzel was responsible, hoping to fire up his team for the game, but he denied responsibility.|$|E

6000|$|I {{listened in}} {{speechless}} astonishment. Was he ironically expressing his contempt for old families?

60|$|I {{had formed}} my {{estimate}} of Miss Jillgall, and {{had put it}} in writing for my own satisfaction, {{at least an hour}} before my father found himself at liberty to speak to me. I don't agree with him in distrusting first impressions; and I had proposed to put my opinion to the test, by referring to what I had written about his cousin at a later time. However, after what he had said to me, I felt bound in filial duty to take the pages out of my book, and to let two days pass before I presumed to enjoy the luxury of hating Miss Jillgall. On one thing I am determined: Eunice shall not form a hasty opinion, either. She shall undergo the same severe discipline of self-restraint to which her sister is obliged to submit. Let us be just, as <b>somebody</b> <b>says,</b> before we are generous. No more for to-day.|$|E
6000|$|Let us now finally {{consider}} what the honest Eugenists do mean, {{since it has}} become increasingly evident that they cannot mean what they say. Unfortunately, the obstacles to any explanation of this are such as to insist on a circuitous approach. The tendency of all that is printed and much that is spoken to-day is to be, in the only true sense, behind the times. It is because it is always in a hurry that it is always too late. Give an ordinary man a day to write an article, and he will remember the things he has really heard latest; and may even, in the last glory of the sunset, begin to think of what he thinks himself. Give him an hour to write it, and he will think of the nearest text-book on the topic, and make the best mosaic he may out of classical quotations and old authorities. Give him ten minutes to write it and he will run screaming for refuge to the old nursery where he learnt his stalest proverbs, or the old school where he learnt his stalest politics. The quicker goes the journalist the slower go his thoughts. The result is the newspaper of our time, which every day can be delivered earlier and earlier, and which, every day, is less worth delivering at all. The poor panting critic falls farther and farther behind the motor-car of modern fact. Fifty years ago he was barely fifteen years behind the times. Fifteen years ago he was not more than fifty years behind the times. Just now he is rather {{more than a hundred years}} behind the times: and the proof of it is that the things he says, though manifest nonsense about our society to-day, really were true about our society some hundred and thirty years ago. The best instance of his belated state is his perpetual assertion that the supernatural is less and less believed. It is a perfectly true and realistic account--of the eighteenth century. It is the worst possible account of this age of psychics and spirit-healers and fakirs and fashionable fortune-tellers. In fact, I generally reply in eighteenth century language to this eighteenth century illusion. If <b>somebody</b> <b>says</b> to me, [...] "The creeds are crumbling," [...] I reply, [...] "And the King of Prussia, who is himself a Freethinker, is certainly capturing Silesia from the Catholic Empress." [...] If <b>somebody</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Miracles must be reconsidered in the light of rational experience," [...] I answer affably, [...] "But I hope that our enlightened leader, Hébert, will not insist on guillotining that poor French queen." [...] If <b>somebody</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "We must watch for the rise of some new religion which can commend itself to reason," [...] I reply, [...] "But how much more necessary is it to watch for the rise of some military adventurer who may destroy the Republic: and, to my mind, that young Major Bonaparte has rather a restless air." [...] It is only in such language from the Age of Reason that we can answer such things. The age we live in is something more than an age of superstition--it is an age of innumerable superstitions. But it is only with one example of this that I am concerned here.|$|E
