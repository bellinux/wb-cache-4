Obravnava s pomensko-izraznimi primitivi povezuje seme kot po-mensko primitivne oz. nedeljive enote in se pri tem omejuje na možnost izrazitve oz. slovarske verbalizacije valenčnih semov z valenčnimi primitivi. The paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} how to identify certain kinds of semantic-expressional primitives in Slovene. These are units of language with which we can explain semantically and expressionally all or most of the vocabulary of the language. The discussion deals with <b>semantemes</b> as semantic primitives or irreducible units and in so doing is restricted to the possibility of expressing or provid-ing a dictionary realisation of valency <b>semantemes</b> using valency primitives. The {{purpose of this paper is}} thus to present above all those verbs that, as the most basic semantic-expressional units, in particular for dictionary explanations, can be called valency primitives. When putting together a valency dictionary of verbs and in particu-lar when selecting semantic base verbs for a dictionary account of the valency of verb entries, the selection of appropriate base valency verbs or valency verbal primitives is o...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a brief {{research for the}} features that distinguish the dynamic infinitives from the declarative infinitives, {{in order to determine}} whether they are different types of verb-phrase complementation. Differences are found in the <b>semantemes</b> of the main predicates, the semantic relation of the main predicate and the infinitive, the capability of the infinitive to express tense and mood and the syntactic structure of the infinitive phrase/clause. The conclusion is that they are different types of infinitive complementation. The dynamic infinitive is a nomen actionis representing the verbal action taken as an abstract content and it may, given a certain context, have either a virtual or a factual (contextual) sense. The declarative infinitive, on the contrary, is the predicate of a subordinate clause and it has similar grammatical values to those of the personal verb forms in other subordinate clauses...|$|R

In this paper, we present a thesaurus system, referred to as TheSys, {{which can be used}} as a tool for users to build thesauri according to their own requirements. It is our goal to design a comprehensive thesaurus building tool which can be used in any field of specialty rather than targeting for a particular specialty field. People can use our system to build an electronic thesaurus in any specialty field required for a specific application. We propose a thesaurus model, referred to as the thesaurus frame, which uses weighted links, to represent semantic relationships among concepts and terms. Our approach is to use a set of controlled terms, referred to as <b>semantemes,</b> to build the thesaurus frame. This approach can effectively reduce the size of the t [...] ...|$|R

The basis of the work is a previous confirmation: " the act of hearing music is always accompanied by inconsciousness graphical sketches that mind and intellect exercise on imaginary spaces". In a first part of the research were stablished sonological basis of <b>semantemes</b> of strong emotion type, and of new semantic unities with graphic-space-time relationships, based on language and related to communication. Here the goal is the search of persuasion phenomenon at discourse, i. e. the study of eloquence in eletroacoustic music. Then the paper ends concluding comments on the pertinency of the study, with the identification of rhetoric figures of speech in the electroacoustic musical context. Keywords: Rethoric and persuasion. Musical semantic. Electroacoustic music. Este trabalho dá seguimento às pesquisas do autor no domínio da linguagem da música eletroacústica. A base do trabalho está na constatação prévia de que "o ato de ouvir música está sempre acompanhado de grafismos inconscientes que a mente e o intelecto praticam em espaços imaginários". Em uma primeira etapa da pesquisa foram estabelecidas as bases sonológicas de semantemas do tipo emoção forte e de novas unidades semânticas de conotação gráfico-espacial-temporal baseadas em recursos de linguagem voltados à comunicação. Aqui o objetivo voltou-se à busca do fenômeno da persuasão do discurso, ou seja, ao estudo da eloqüência na música eletroacústica. Concluiu-se da pertinência do estudo, através da identificação, no contexto musical eletroacústico, de figuras de linguagem próprias da Retórica. Palavras-chave: Retórica e persuasão.

40|$|This {{paper has}} the {{following}} organization. In Sections 2 and 3 we summarize the basic {{notions of the}} functional generative framework, and {{the principles of the}} TFA-based approach to modelling salience in monologues, respectively. Section 4 overviews some characteristics of the dialogue which require a modification of the TFA-based approach. Subsequently, we introduce the modified version of the TFA-based approach in Sections 5 and 6. Section 7 comprises our final remarks and suggestions for future research. 2. The initial framework We work within the Praguian framework of Functional Generative Description (FGD) (cf. Sgall 1967, Sgall et al. 1986). FGD works with several levels of representation of the sentence, ranging from the phonemic (graphemic) level which represents the external shape of a sentence, to the tectogrammatic level which represents its linguistic meaning. The representation of a sentence at the tectogrammatic level (TR) consists of nodes, corresponding to semantemes, carrying complex labels encoding various kinds of information. The TR has three further ingredients: the structural relations between semantemes (reflecting their dependency and coordination relationships), the scale of communicative dynamism (reflecting "deep word order") and the distinction between contextual boundness and non-boundness for each <b>semanteme</b> (reflecting its position in the linguistic patterning of the opposition between "given" and "new"...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper puts {{forward a}} novel method of {{automatically}} generating elements which {{is necessary for}} building sharing ontology database and studies the uncertainty problems. A concept called sharing ontology is proposed which {{is defined as a}} bridge of all kinds of spatial information systems involving domain spatial data acquiring, updating, transferring, storing, processing, analyzing, information extracting, knowledge discovering and Geo-services. By establishing the spatial information sharing ontology database, we can provide for the users an integrated spatial information service and application platform based on the <b>semanteme,</b> and then link all spatial information service platforms on internet at the semantic level, so as to provide a feasible way of semantic-based spatial information sharing and interoperability. Through data mining based on the remote sensing images and GIS database, we can build the sharing ontology database automatically, which achieves semantic sharing of isomerous spatial information. Some innovative ideas of the research work are as follows:(1) Putting the uncertainty problem about features extracted form remote sensing images up to a height of information theory and exploring the consolidate mathematics expression between information quantity and uncertainty about features mined from remote sensing images. (2) Building the sharing ontology database by combining remote sensing and GIS spatial data, and establishing the feasibility in practice for the construction of the sharing ontology database. (3) Establishing the stability foundation for the precise semantic sharing between isomerous spatial information systems...|$|E
40|$|Do nominal {{cases have}} meaning? 'That is the question. ' Over {{the last hundred}} years it has been asked and {{answered}} many times—in the negative {{as well as in the}} positive sense; cf. a clear resume in Wierzbicka 1980 : xviii-xix. However, after a series of studies by Wierzbicka (for instance, 1980 and 1988 : 391 - 461), where a precise description of the meanings of several nominal cases in Russian and Polish is presented, there is no more doubt: yes, in principle, nominal cases do have meaning. Nevertheless, many specific questions remain; among other things, I would like to achieve more clarity in the following respects: • What does the expression to have meaning mean, especially when speaking of a nominal case? • Do all nominal cases in all languages have meaning? • Does a nominal case that has a meaning in language L always have it, i. e., have it in all of its uses? I will try to shed more light on the problem by adhering to a precise theoretical framework: the Meaning-Text theory. I will use, without any explanations or justifications, the following postulates and concepts: 1) A text, in particular a sentence, is produced starting from its semantic representation. I take for granted the general architecture of the Meaning-Text linguistic model, with the standard levels of lin-guistic representation and the division of labor between Semantic, Syntactic, and Morphological mo-dules, which describe the transition between the representations of adjacent levels. All of the argumen-tation is done in the Meaning-to-Text direction. 2) The following descriptive concepts are taken for granted: Semantic-Structure [= SemS], Deep-Syntactic Structure [= DSyntS], Surface-Syntactic Structure [= SSyntS], and Deep-Morphological Structure [= DMorphS] of the sentence; Communicative Structures on the Sem-, DSynt- and SSynt-levels [= Sem-CommS, DSynt-CommS, and SSynt-CommS]; Government Pattern [= GP], specified in the dictionary entry of a lexical unit; Lexical Function [= LF]; <b>semanteme</b> [= semantic unit] and grammeme [= inflectional value, such as SINGULAR or PRESENT [TENSE]); and, of course, the main character of this paper: (nominal) case. 1 A particular nominal case of language L, i. e., fo...|$|E
