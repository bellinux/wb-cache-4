Aerosol mass, black carbon, water soluble ions concentration as well as total aluminum, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, sodium and titanium concentration were determined. Mean annual PM 10 mass concentration ranged from 18 to 38 µg m- 3, without violation of the Brazilian air quality standards. For fine and coarse modes, between 70 and 90 % of the measured mass was apportioned to relatively few sources, soil dust accounts for 37 - 63 % of the coarse mode mass.

40|$|Brazil {{plays an}} {{important}} role with regard to the emission of aerosols into the atmosphere. Ecosystems such as the Amazonian tropical forest and Brazilian Cerrado are undergoing sweeping changes. These human activities promote an increase in the levels of gases and particles emitted into the atmosphere. To determine how these activities have affected the emission of coarse and fine particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2. 5), atmospheric aerosol samples were collected continuously from June 2004 to April 2005 in the Cuiaba Basin of south-central Mato Grosso, Brazil. Aerosols were <b>sampled</b> using stacked <b>filter</b> <b>units.</b> <b>Filters</b> were analysed for particulate mass, black carbon and for concentrations of seventeen elements by Particle Induced X-Ray Emission. The results revealed that Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti and Fe were the major components detected in PM 2. 5 and PM 10. The high enrichment factors observed in PM 2. 5 and PM 10 suggest that anthropogenic activities were the predominant source for elements such as Cu, Zn and Pb. These data indicate that most of the aerosols measured in the Cuiaba Basin originate from land conversion and biomass burning. These patterns are similar to those observed in other Cerrado and Amazonian forest areas that are undergoing rapid and spatially extensive land-cover change...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was the semi-quantitative evaluation {{of the influence of}} the concentrations of fine and coarse particulate matter (PM 2. 5 and PM 10) and black carbon (BC) on the organic compound concentrations in the atmosphere of Caxias do Sul, a city in Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil. The collection of the samples was carried out between August of 2006 and January of 2007. The periodic replacement of the cartridges and <b>sampling</b> <b>filters</b> was performed every other day (48 h sampling). An active sampler was used for the collection of the inorganic particulate matter, that means, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 were <b>sampled</b> using stacked <b>filter</b> <b>units</b> that collect fine (d < 2. 5 μm) and coarse (2. 5 μm < d < 10 μm) particulate matter. The organic material was collected by a previously treated cotton cartridge.

The air was forced to pass through the two samplers by a vacuum pump. The inorganic particulate matter was characterized by gravimetry and reflectance. The tentative identification of the organic compounds was obtained by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). The preliminary results suggest an inverse relation among the PM 10 concentration and the amounts of some organic compounds like 1 H-indene, neridol and ethylphthalate. On the other hand, the maximum quantity of eburnamonine was detected at the same time as the maximum concentrations of BC. No correlations were found between the PM 2. 5 concentrations and the amounts of organic compounds, in the samples studied. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{multimedia}} stream filtering scenario, there usually exist many filtering {{rules that}} specify the filtering objectives and many <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> that estimate the filtering rules. A filtering rule may connect to several different <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> and a <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> may connect to several different filtering rules. An open problem {{in such a}} filtering scenario is how to order the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> in an optimal sequence so as to decrease the filtering cost. Existing methods {{are based on a}} greedy strategy which orders the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> according to three factors of the <b>filtering</b> <b>units,</b> i. e., the selectivity, popularity, and cost. Although all these methods reported good results, there is still one important problem that hasn’t been addressed yet. The selectivity factor is set empirically, which is unable to adaptively adjust with stream passing by. Under these observations, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive ordering framework (AOF) which executes an adaptive ordering strategy. In AOF, all the temporal filtering results are preserved in each sliding window. Accordingly, the selectivity can adjust automatically and thus all the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> can be ordered with respect to the adapted selectivity. Experiments on both synthetic and real life multimedia streams demonstrate that our AOF method outperforms other simple filtering methods.

40|$|Many {{digital signal}} {{processing}} applications require linear phase filtering. For applications that require narrow-band linear phase <b>filtering,</b> frequency <b>sampling</b> <b>filters</b> can implement linear phase filters more efficiently than the commonly used direct convolution filter.

40|$|A simple {{mechanism}} {{to increase the}} utilization of a small trace cache, and simultaneously reduce its power consumption, is presented in this paper. The mechanism uses selective storage of traces (filtering) {{that is based on}} a new concept in computer architecture: random <b>sampling.</b> The <b>sampling</b> <b>filter</b> exploits the &quot;hot/cold trace&quot; principle, which divides the population of traces into two groups. The first group contains &quot;hot traces &quot; that are executed many times from the trace cache and contribute the majority of committed instructions. The second group contains &quot;cold traces &quot; that are rarely executed, but are responsible for the majority of writes to an unfiltered cache. The <b>sampling</b> <b>filter</b> selects traces without any prior knowledge of their quality. However, as most writes to the cache are of &quot;cold traces &quot; it statistically filters out those traces, reducing cache turnover and eventually leading to higher quality traces residing in the cache. In contrast with previously proposed filters, which perform bookkeeping for all traces in the program, the <b>sampling</b> <b>filter</b> can be implemented with minimal hardware. Results show that the <b>sampling</b> <b>filter</b> can increase the number of hits per build (utilization) by a factor of 38, reduce the miss rate by 20 % and improve the performance-power efficiency by 15 %. Further improvements can be obtained by extensions to the basic sampling filter: allowing &quot;hot traces &quot; to bypass the <b>sampling</b> <b>filter,</b> combining of <b>sampling</b> together with previously proposed filters, and changing the replacement policy in the trace cache.

40|$|A {{frequency}} <b>sampling</b> <b>filter</b> {{which is}} a finite impulse response digital filter uses a recursive structure that requires exact pole zero cancellation on the unit circle. When implemented with digital technology, errors due to finite length registers and finite precision arithmetic can prevent exact pole zero cancellation making the filter unstable. To guarantee stability, the poles and zeros on the unit circle are moved to {{a circle of radius}} r where 0 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c 1. Most frequency <b>sampling</b> <b>filter</b> design techniques determine optimal frequency responses for r = 1 and then chose a value of r, 0 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c 1, near to 1 so that the filter 2 ̆ 7 s frequency response does not differ significantly.
