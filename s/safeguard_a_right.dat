5000|$|The majority, however, {{observed}} that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel could be violated {{even in the absence}} of a Fifth Amendment violation. To <b>safeguard</b> <b>a</b> criminal defendant's <b>right</b> to <b>a</b> fair trial, counsel must be present at the critical stages of the prosecution. [...] The Court disputed the Government's characterization of the lineup as a preliminary stage, like the analysis of fingerprints, where counsel is not required.|$|R
50|$|In 1933, Lawson {{founded the}} New Negro Alliance (NNA) in Washington, D.C., along with John A. Davis Sr. and M. Franklin Thorne, to combat white-owned {{businesses}} in black neighborhoods {{that would not}} hire black employees. The NNA instituted a then-radical Don't Buy Where You Can't Work campaign, and organized or threatened boycotts against white-owned businesses. In response, some businesses arranged for an injunction to stop the picketing. Lawson, the lead attorney, with assistance by Thurgood Marshall, fought back - {{all the way to}} the United States Supreme Court in New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co. (1938) that <b>safeguarded</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to boycott. This became a landmark case in the struggle by African Americans against discriminatory hiring practices, and Don't Buy Where You Can't Work groups multiplied throughout the nation. The NNA estimated that by 1940, the group had secured 5,106 jobs for blacks because businesses could not afford to lose sales during the Great Depression. In 1934, Lawson encouraged National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) special counsel Charles Houston to authorize Thurgood Marshall to file the case of Murray v. Maryland (1935) to challenge University of Maryland School of Law laws requiring racial segregation in its colleges. Marshall won the case, and Donald Murray was admitted to the university's law school.|$|R
50|$|The UN UN Refugee Convention and its Protocol {{regulate}} {{the right of}} persons to seek international protection. Children enjoy special <b>safeguards</b> and have <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to have their asylum application examined individually. Child-specific grounds of persecution {{need to be considered}} irrespective of whether the child applies alone or together with a parent or caregiver. The European Union Member States have re-elaborated these standards for the EU context and have adopted a series of Directives regulating the qualification and reception conditions of asylum seekers in the EU as well as asylum procedures and matters of return.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of further restrictions {{of abortion rights}} smolder on the horizon, but currently remain at bay. After Whole Woman’s Health, a Trump appointed nominee will likely swing the Court toward a 5 ‑ 4 majority in favor of upholding current abortion law. Justices Breyer, Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan voted to reaffirm Casey’s “undue burden” standard <b>safeguarding</b> <b>a</b> woman’s fundamental <b>right</b> to <b>an</b> abortion. Thomas, Alito, and Roberts were the three Justices to dissent to the opinion. If all the current justices were {{to remain on the}} bench until after the next president is elected, the potential threat to abortion rights should remain dormant even if Justice Gorsuch were to side with the dissent...|$|R
40|$|Although the U. S. Supreme Court {{in recent}} years has reaffirmed the {{substantive}} force of the Tenth Amendment, it has not resolved the fundamental question of who has standing to raise claims under the Amendment. The Court’s reticence on the matter has sparked a rapidly intensifying split between those U. S. courts of appeals that allow private parties to raise claims under the Tenth Amendment and those—currently the majority—that allow only states to raise Tenth Amendment claims. This Note argues that circuit courts denying private parties standing erroneously rely on dicta from the Supreme Court’s 1939 decision in Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. Tennessee Valley Authority, and that other Supreme Court precedent implicitly recognizes private party Tenth Amendment standing. Because recent Supreme Court Tenth Amendment jurisprudence, along with the history and text of the Tenth Amendment, indicate that the Amendment <b>safeguards</b> <b>an</b> individual <b>right,</b> this Note concludes that private parties should be able to assert Tenth Amendment claims whenever they demonstrate distinct, personal harm and satisfy other traditional standing requirements...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} role of EU {{institutions}} {{in the process of}} developing and changing EU data protection rules. In the wake of 9 / 11, the large-scale processing of data for security purposes became a priority for law enforcement authorities throughout Europe—and the <b>safeguarding</b> of <b>an</b> individual’s <b>right</b> to data protection a key concern for all those defending a rights-based approach. Security-oriented actors and those defending data protection interests have struggled to find compromise in the EU institutions, meaning that the core of the policy is still to be settled. Since the Treaty of Lisbon and the inclusion of data protection as <b>a</b> fundamental <b>right,</b> the necessity to solve the tension between large-scale data processing for security purposes and the right of individuals to data protection has become more pressing...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to obtain}} a patient's consent for his {{health care is a}} {{principle}} set out in the Italian Constitution, which <b>safeguards</b> <b>a</b> person's <b>right</b> to health. Articles 13 and 32. 2 confirm a person's freedom and the right to make free decisions about one's medical treatment. Nobody must be obliged to any medical procedure, unless as by law enacted. The obligation to inform patients is important during the contractual phase: consent is an essential element in the professional contract governing the relationship between a physician and a patient. The former is obligated to inform the latter about his medical intervention clearly and precisely, to enable the patient to decide freely whether to undergo a medical procedure. At this point, it is also essential {{to obtain a}} patient's consent for those treatments that although they are carried out in a correct and careful way, could damage a person's physical integrity. The failure to obtain consent could give rise to a burden of responsibility on behalf of the clinician. A central venous catheterization in hemodialysis (HD) is a common procedure performed during routine nephrological treatments. Our signed informed consent form prior to introducing a central venous catheter is thought to satisfy requirements provided for in current regulations to give correct information...|$|R
5000|$|On 19 June 1990 the ECJ court (as [...] "full court" [...] of 11 justices) en banc {{gave its}} ruling, rephrasing the {{question}} posed as [...] "whether a national court which, {{in a case}} before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule". Following the Advocate-General's opinion, the ECJ held that a national court, in fact, {{has a duty to}} grant interim relief to safeguard alleged Community rights of individuals until the decision of the ECJ on the interpretation of Community law is available, and where a rule of national law would deny such relief, to set aside that rule. The basis of such a duty lies in the nature and object of directly effective Community law rights which are intended to be fully effective throughout the EU, and where, in order to <b>safeguard</b> such <b>a</b> <b>right,</b> it is necessary to grant interim measures, a national court must do so. This is especially true where a national court is awaiting a clarification or interpretation of the right claimed by the ECJ.|$|R
5000|$|Proponents of ISDS {{argue that}} governments retain their {{regulatory}} ability, if the agreements in question specify that regulations protecting health, the environment, labour rights {{and human rights}} are allowed. The Office of the United States Trade Representative challenges the notion that ISDS challenges [...] "the sovereign ability of governments impose any measure they wish to protect labor rights, the environment, or other issues of public welfare". The International Bar Association (IBA) mirrors these sentiments, noting that [...] "while investment treaties limit states’ ability to inflict arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, they do not limit (and, in fact, expressly <b>safeguard)</b> <b>a</b> state’s sovereign <b>right</b> to regulate {{in the public interest}} in a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory manner." [...] The White House notes that investment protections are a component of more than 3,000 trade agreements, the vast majority of which have some form of neutral arbitration. The United States is party to at least 50 such agreements, has only faced 13 ISDS cases and never lost an ISDS case.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Two {{questions}} inform this article. First, {{the question}} is examined whether <b>a</b> human <b>rights</b> approach (water as <b>a</b> human <b>right)</b> and <b>a</b> commercial approach (water as an economic good and essential service) can be reconciled. A second, and related, question is whether it really matters which approach is taken. An {{answer to this question}} will be sought by analysing whether the same or similar guarantees are being offered, in particular in the context of liberalisation and/or privatisation of drinking water services and the disconnection from water services. Also, the environmental dimension will be scrutinised. After examining similarities and parallels in both approaches, and the level of protection offered, it is concluded that it does make a difference indeed whether water is considered as an essential service or as <b>a</b> human <b>right.</b> While both concepts act as <b>a</b> <b>safeguard,</b> human <b>rights</b> may prove to be the stronger one, {{at least as far as}} State actors are concerned...|$|R

The United States is party to at least 50 such agreements, has only faced 13 ISDS cases and never lost an ISDS case. The White House asserts that the ISDS components of the TPP are an upgrade and improvement on ISDS in other trade agreements: TPP makes it absolutely clear that governments can regulate in the public interest (including with regard to health, safety and the environment); TPP includes the ability to dismiss frivolous claims quickly and award fees against the claimant to deter such suits; sham corporations will be prevented from accessing the investment protections; and arbitration proceedings under TPP will be open to the public and allow for inputs from non-parties.|$|R
