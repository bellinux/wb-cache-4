50|$|The camera can be {{attached}} {{directly to the}} kite but is usually secured to an adjustable rig suspended from the kite line {{at a distance from}} the kite. This distance reduces excessive movement being transmitted from the kite to the camera and allows the kite to be flown into higher, stable air before the camera is attached. If possible, the camera is set to a high shutter speed to reduce motion blur. Cameras using internal image stabilization features can increase the number of sharp photos. In order to take photographs that are oriented correctly with the horizon, a <b>suspension</b> <b>method</b> is used to allow the rig to automatically level itself under the kite line.|$|E

5000|$|The Chinese medical {{tradition}} of the Yuan had [...] "Four Great Schools" [...] that the Yuan inherited from the Jin dynasty. All four schools {{were based on the}} same intellectual foundation, but advocated different theoretical approaches toward medicine. Under the Mongols, the practice of Chinese medicine spread {{to other parts of the}} empire. Chinese physicians were brought along military campaigns by the Mongols as they expanded towards the west. Chinese medical techniques such as acupuncture, moxibustion, pulse diagnosis, and various herbal drugs and elixirs were transmitted westward to the Middle East and the rest of the empire. Several medical advances were made in the Yuan period. The physician Wei Yilin (1277-1347) invented a <b>suspension</b> <b>method</b> for reducing dislocated joints, which he performed using anesthetics. The Mongol physician Hu Sihui described the importance of a healthy diet in a 1330 medical treatise.|$|E
50|$|Bone {{setting is}} {{a branch of}} Mongolian {{medicine}} carried out by Bariachis, specialist bone setters. They work without medicines, as anesthetics or instruments. Instead they rely on physiotherapy to manipulate bones back to their proper position. This was done without any pain to the patient. Bariachis are laypeople, without medical training, and are born into the job, following the family tradition. They {{had the ability to}} fix any bone problem, no matter how severe or difficult. When Chinese physicians were brought into the Mongolian empire, Wei Yilin, a famous Yuan orthopedic surgeon established particular methods for setting fractures and treating shoulder, hip, and knee dislocations. He also pioneered the <b>suspension</b> <b>method</b> for joint reduction. He was not only an orthopedic surgeon but also an anesthesiologist who used various folk medicine for anesthetics during his operations. It appears that this traditional practice is in decline, and that no scientific research has been carried out into it.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Gavage {{administration}} of antidepressant drugs {{is required for}} some depressed patients with dysphagia. In the recent years, a simple <b>suspension</b> <b>method</b> has drawn increasing attention as a method that prevents changes in the stability and safety of various drugs. However, only 59 of the 354 orally administered antidepressant drugs (16. 7 %) approved in Japan by April 2013 have been examined with this method. In this study, we investigated whether 44 oral antidepressant drugs, which have not previously been tested for effi cacy through gavage, could be adapted to the simple <b>suspension</b> <b>method.</b> Materials and Methods: Adaptability of antidepressants to the simple <b>suspension</b> <b>method</b> was assessed by incubating at room temperature a drug in 20 mL of warm water (at 55 °C) in a 30 mL-syringe for 5 and 10 min. The ability of the decayed drugs {{to pass through the}} tubing was also examined. Results: Most of the 44 oral antidepressant drugs tested could be adapted to the simple <b>suspension</b> <b>method.</b> Unexpectedly, fl uvoxamine maleate tablets, milnacipran hydrochloride tablets, and Cymbalta ® capsules required 10 min or longer to decay.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the carcass <b>suspension</b> <b>method</b> concerning quality of sheep meat. Ten discard ewes were used, with approximately 62 kg of body weight. After slaughtering, flaying, evisceration and removal of head and paws, carcasses were longitudinally divided into two parts. Alternated sides of half carcasses were hanged by the tendon of the gastrocnemius (Treatment 1 - T 1) and by the pelvic bone (Treatment 2 - T 2) in cold store for a 24 -hour period. Subsequently, the Semimembranosus muscle was removed from all half carcasses for meat quality analyses. The Semimembranosus muscles from the carcasses hanged by the pelvis <b>suspension</b> <b>method</b> presented higher softness than the same muscles from the carcasses hanged by the tendon of the gastrocnemius, with values of 1. 99 kgf. cm- 2 and 3. 15 kgf. cm- 2, respectively.

And the changes of the DPN diaphorase, TPN diaphorase, succinic dehydrogenase (SD) and α-glycero-phosphate dehydrogenase (αGD) of the ascites tumor cells were cytochemically examined in the smear method and <b>suspension</b> <b>method.</b> 1) In general, moderate morphological changes of the tumor cells by these anti-tumor agents were observed, and the changes of the stainability of the oxidative enzymes were often observed. 2) After nitromin administration. no change of the stainability of the DPN diaphorase and TPN diaphorase in the smear method and slight increase of their stainability in the <b>suspension</b> <b>method</b> were observed. The stainabilities of the SD and α-GD were decreased in lesser degree in both methods. 3) After colchicine administration, no change of the stainability of the DPN diaphorase and TPN diaphorase in the smear method was observed, but their stainability of all tumor cells showed a tendency down to keep same intensity. A slight decrease of the stainability of the SD and α-GD was observed in the smear method, while their stainabilities were slightly increased in the <b>suspension</b> <b>method.</b> 4) After sarkomycin administration, stainabilities of all four enzymes were decreased in certain degree in the smear method, but the DPN diaphorase and TPN diaphorase staining intensity were remarkably decreased in the suspention method and their stainabilities of all cells showed a tendency down to keep same intensity. The SD and α-GD staining intensity were also decreased slightly in the <b>suspension</b> <b>method.</b> 5) After the administration of mitomycin C, changes of the staining intensity of the DPN diaphorase and TPN diaphorase were scarcely observed in both methods.

40|$|Using the Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, the {{activities}} of the diphosphopyridine nucleotide diaphorase (DPNase), triphosphopyridine nucleotide diaphorase (TPNase), succinic dehydrogenase (SD) and α-gylcerophosphate dehydrogenase (α-GD) were cytochemically examined, and all of the cytochemical specimens were observed with the phase contrast microscope and formazanhaematoxylin counter staining. Several variations of their activities being caused by the differences of the cytochemical methods were also studied. The results were summarized as follows. 1. In the smear method, in which the ascites is smeared and dried on the object glass, thereafter reacted with the modified Wattenberg's reagents, all cells reveal relatively intense reaction but the differences of the staining intensity of each cell are scarcely noticed. 2. In the <b>suspension</b> <b>method,</b> in which ascites tumor cells are suspended and reacted with the modified Wattenberg's reagents, all cells reveal relatively weak reaction, but the marked differences of the staining intensity of each cell are observed. 3. In order to clarify the relationship between the permeability of the cell membrane and the intensity of the cytochemical reaction, the cells are treated with the benzalkonium chloride solution. This method is called the permeability increasing <b>suspension</b> <b>method,</b> which reveals a intermediate intensity of the staining between the smear method and the <b>suspension</b> <b>method.</b> Each cell shows a definite difference of the staining. 4. No significant difference is observed between the staining intensity of the <b>suspension</b> <b>method</b> and that of the ascites <b>suspension</b> <b>method</b> in which the ascites supernatant is used as the cytochemical reaction medium instead of the inorganic salts solution. 5. The cells treated with the suspension, permeability increasing suspension and ascites <b>suspension</b> <b>method</b> are able to be successively transplanted into the same strain mouse. Therefore, it may be reasonably assumed that in these three methods the cells are cytochemically reacted in the living condition. However, it is impossible to transplant the cells treated with the smear method. 6. By the observation of the staining patterns of these four methods, it may be assumed that these dehydrogenases in the cells are not always activated and the intensities of their enzymatic activities change according to their life cycle. (a) The DPNase activity remarkably increases in the end of the interphase and abruptly decreases to the lowest level at the metaphase. Then the activity gradually increases, keeping low level throughout {{the first half of the}} interphase. This enzyme is localized in the granulations of the cytoplasm and also a little in the cytoplasms of the cells with the high activity. (b) In general, the TPNase activity is slightly lower than that of the DPNase, and shows the same mode of the activity and localization as the latter. (c) The SD activity decreases to the lowest level at the metaphase and remains almost constantly low in the other phases, localizing in the mitochondria. (d) The α-GD activity is generally lower than that of the SD and nearly negative, but shows the same changes of the activity and localization as the latter. 7. When the enzymatic activity of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells is compared with that of the normal ascites cells, the DPNase and TPNase activity are remarkably high, while the SD and α-GD activity are low...|$|E

To clarify whether 3 D microspheres were enriched with CSCs, we made tumorigenicity experiments in NOD/SCID mice, soft agar cloning experiments, and detected the expression levels of cancer stem cells markers CD 44 and Ep-CAM by flow cytometry or by Western blotting. The protein expression levels of EMT markers such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin were detected by Western blotting. Results 　Compared with the parental SW 620 cells, colony formation in vitro (P< 0. 01) and tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID mice were significantly enhanced, the percentage of CD 44 -positive cells and Ep-CAM protein expression levels was significantly increased (P< 0. 01) in 3 D microspheres. The protein expression level of epithelial marker E-cadherin was obviously increased (P< 0. 01), while the protein expression levels of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin were significantly decreased (P< 0. 01).

Using the information from both types of measurements, and utilizing the three-dimensional nature of the system, it is possible to follow the intra-molecular charge motions in all three spatial directions. The derivable dipole moment changes associated with conformational transitions allow the verification of molecular dynamic models.
