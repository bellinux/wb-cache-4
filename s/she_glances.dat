500|$|It was {{announced}} on May 10, 1993 that The Who's Tommy had received eleven Tony Award nominations, tying with Kiss of the Spider Woman {{for the most}} nominations that year. Gaven received a nomination in the [...] "Best Featured Actress in a Musical" [...] category. However, {{as the result of}} an allergic reaction, she could not perform in the musical some nights. When Daryl Miller interviewed Gaven in the Los Angeles Times in 1997, he noted that [...] "this {{was one of the biggest}} disappointments of her life, and clouds cross her face for the first time in the conversation. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> across the room at the Tony citation—recognizing her nomination for best featured actress in a musical—as she describes how her throat became infected due to a reaction to the oil in a haze-making compound that designers pump onstage to enhance lighting effects. She missed a lot of performances, and an untold number of Tony voters missed her performance. She can't help but wonder how that affected the outcome." [...] At one point, Gaven's understudy Alice Ripley took her place for eight consecutive weeks while Gaven recovered. Gaven eventually had to leave The Who's Tommy some months after it opened because of her allergy. She also disliked the idea of performing in one musical for more than a year.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a view of the {{apartment}} that Lewis and Haynes shared. Books and a vase lay strewn across the floor, while Lewis weeps in the corner and Haynes watches from a distance teary-eyed. The video switches to several other shots of Lewis singing the first verse, looking morose. In a third shot, Lewis is seen standing on a rooftop against the Los Angeles skyline dressed in a dark red crop top. Then the video switches to Lewis standing in front of projected images of the memorable times of her relationship with Haynes. Lewis and Haynes are seen sat at opposite ends of the sofa looking into the distance, spliced with more scenes of Lewis on the rooftop. The couple are seen during an awkward dinner before switching to images of the couple in bed together, seemingly happy. As the chorus kicks in for the first time, the couple are seen arriving at a party, with Lewis wearing an aqua-coloured dress with a portion of her midriff revealed, meanwhile Haynes wears a plaid shirt and jeans. Initially the couple are content, embracing guests but socialising separately and avoiding contact with each other. The camera switches between these and the earlier scenes of Lewis in front of projected images and the LA skyline throughout the chorus. As Lewis sings [...] "I'm a whole lot of trouble/ We're in a whole lot of trouble", <b>she</b> <b>glances</b> over to see Haynes flirting with another girl.|$|E
2500|$|The girls' plan is leave Hanna {{waiting for}} 'Uber A' {{to arrive at}} Lost Woods Resort, while Aria and the boys are out hiding, but when Hanna goes missing they find out that 'Uber A' used a secret passage and kidnapped her. Looking over footage from cameras outside, they all are shocked to see what looks to be Mrs. D, asking {{themselves}} how this is possible. At Alison's house, [...] "Wilden" [...] rips off his mask revealing himself to be Elliott, and Mary Drake, who is revealed to be Jessica's twin, joins him. They succeeded in committing Alison, and with Ali hospitalized, he has her money and the house as her husband, which is their revenge {{for what happened to}} Charlotte, as {{he was in love with}} her and Mary always felt an attachment as her birth mother. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> at a photograph of Charlotte and says it is what she would've wanted. In the last scene, we see Hanna's unconscious body being dragged by 'Uber A' in the church's bell tower.|$|E
6000|$|Winterbourne was {{watching}} the young girl; at this question his attention quickened. She stood there, smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons; <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> at Winterbourne. Then, while <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> and smiled, <b>she</b> answered, without a shade of hesitation, [...] "Mr. Giovanelli--the beautiful Giovanelli." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at the shapeless heap, and shuddered. Agravaine nodded.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{across the}} room at him, half curiously, half scornfully.|$|R
2500|$|Miu, who {{initially}} goes {{there to help}} Yuuri, sees a vision on the mountain of her mother. Later venturing there on her own, she learns that she was born from Miku and her dead brother Mafuyu. Miku had gone to see her brother one last time, and is either saved from the mountain's power by Miu or goes into the afterlife to be with Mafuyu. Ren, while helping Yuuri and Miu, regularly crosses paths with Shiragiku and learns that recurring dreams he has been having are the inherited memories of his ancestor Asou. Depending on his actions, he either unites or breaks up with Ouse as Asou's present-day avatar, or puts Shiragiku to rest {{and returns to the}} living world. Yuuri's search through the mountain leads to her encountering many of the powerful ghosts and using her Camera Obscura to lay them to rest. Learning of Ouse's history, she heads to a final confrontation with her. Depending on where <b>she</b> <b>glances</b> Ouse, two endings play out: in the [...] "Bad" [...] ending, Yuuri commits suicide with Ouse and the curse goes on claiming more victims. In the [...] "Good" [...] ending, Yuuri glances Ouse freeing her from her duty as a Maiden of Black Water, allowing her and the other spirits {{to move on to the}} Afterlife through the purified Dark Sun, while Yuuri returns to the world of the living with Hisoka by her side. If the player choose [...] "Good" [...] ending. The post-credit scene is shown Rui wake up with Ren in front of her and tell her he will be never leave her ever again. Rui then smiling and returning sleep.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glances</b> at {{the face}} of the {{approaching}} man. They maintain a bashful silence until he has passed.|$|E
6000|$|... (<b>She</b> <b>glances</b> {{round her}} at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated faceneck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{once more}} over her {{shoulder}} toward the village--perhaps beyond.|$|R
60|$|Then Miss Kinnaird laughed {{softly as}} <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> at her attire.|$|R
60|$|And Dahlia {{was in the}} drawing-room. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> up at my entrance.|$|R
6000|$|The widow laughs heartily and really. She {{places a}} {{handkerchief}} over her mouth. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> at her brother {{with a pair}} of eyes full of knowing mischief. [...] "Ah, dear James," [...] she says, [...] "you don't {{know what it is to}} have a mother's feelings." ...|$|E
60|$|ZOE: Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to {{the piano}} and bangs chords on it with crossed arms) The cat's ramble through the slag. (<b>She</b> <b>glances</b> back) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.|$|E
60|$|Fanny, after {{following}} a few steps, stops and thinks. Ernest has entered with the wood. He is piling {{it in the}} basket by the fire. His entrance decides her. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> {{through the open door}} of the dressing-room, then flies across to the desk, seats herself, and begins feverishly to write a telegram.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{about and}} noted the orator. Doubtless she divined the situation.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at him entreatingly; the sarcasm was too bitter, too unendurable.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at him, a {{question}} in her eyes, then looked away.|$|R
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH, rises, {{and goes}} to the large mirror to wipe away her tears. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> at Mr. Richards, who does not move. She sits down in a seat nearer him than the chair she has left. After some faint murmurs and hesitations, she asks, [...] "Will you please tell me why you went out just now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|My girl she's airy, she's buxom and gay; [...] Her {{breath is}} {{as sweet as}} the {{blossoms}} in May; [...] A touch of her lips it ravishes quite: [...] She's always good natur'd, good humour'd, and free; [...] She dances, <b>she</b> <b>glances,</b> she smiles upon me; [...] I never am happy when out of her sight.|$|E
6000|$|Roberts, at whom <b>she</b> <b>glances</b> with misgiving as {{she runs}} out, holding the parcels {{on his knees}} with both elbows and one hand, and contriving {{with the help of}} his chin to get his {{magazine}} open again: [...] "No, no; I won't, my dear." [...] He loses himself in his reading, while people come and go restlessly. A gentleman finally drops into the seat beside him, and contemplates his absorption with friendly amusement.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at his worn {{clothing}} and soiled white necktie, and smiled.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at me {{swiftly and}} surely; {{and shook her}} head again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at {{the little}} Yale key which hung from her bracelet.|$|R
6000|$|MURRAY (quickly). No. Please don't go yet. Sit down. Please do. (<b>She</b> <b>glances</b> at him irresolutely, then resumes her chair.) They'll {{give you}} your diet of milk and shoo you off to bed on that {{freezing}} porch soon enough, don't worry. I'll {{see to it that}} you don't fracture any rules. (Hitching his chair nearer hers--impulsively.) In all charity to me you've got to stick awhile. I haven't had a chance to really talk to a soul for a week. You found what I said a while ago hard to believe, didn't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|A curious {{group as}} they sit {{staring into the}} fire. Juno and Juno's {{daughter}} Bess, brindles both, with their underhanging lower jaws, and their black noses and wrinkled faces, and Jack Simpson, now six years old, sitting between them, as grave and as immovable as his supporters. One dog is {{on either side of}} him and his arms are thrown round their broad backs. Mrs. Haden is laying the table for her husband's return; <b>she</b> <b>glances</b> occasionally at the quiet group in front of the fire, and mutters to herself: [...] "I never did see such a child in all my born days." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Lady: [...] "Yes, I see." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> at {{the rear}} of the shop, where the floor is {{littered}} with the leaves and petals of flowers, and sprays of fern and evergreen. A woman, followed by a belated smell of breakfast, which gradually mingles with the odor of the plants, comes out of a door there, and begins to gather the larger fragments into her apron. The lady turns again, and looks at the jars and vases of cut flowers in the window, and on the counter. [...] "What I can't understand is how you know just the quantity of flowers to buy every day. You must often lose a good deal." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> at {{the porch}} against {{which a man}} was still leaning.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{down at her}} high-necked {{gown and}} avoided Helen's anxious eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{towards the}} opened windows, and he closed them at once.|$|R
6000|$|I am gazing round me, {{with the}} horror {{that the place}} inspires, when Goblin {{clutches}} me by the wrist, and lays, not her skinny finger, but the handle of a key, upon her lip. She invites me, with a jerk, to follow her. I do so. She leads me out into a room adjoining--a rugged room, with a funnel-shaped, contracting roof, open at the top, to the bright day. I ask her what it is. She folds her arms, leers hideously, and stares. I ask again. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> round, to see that all the little company are there; sits down upon a mound of stones; throws up her arms, and yells out, like a fiend, 'La Salle de la Question!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The Lady, {{catching}} it from him, and then, after {{a glance}} at it, starting back with a shriek: [...] "Ah-h-h! How terrible! But it can't be! Oh, I don't know what to think--It is the most dreadful thing that ever--It's impossible!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> at the paper again, and breaks into a hysterical laugh: [...] "Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha! Why, this is the address that I wrote out for that young gentleman's flowers! You have made a terrible mistake, Mr. Eichenlaub--you have almost killed me. I thought--I thought that woman was sending her funeral flowers to--to"--She holds {{her hand over her}} heart, and sinks into the chair beside the counter, where she lets fall the paper. [...] "You have almost killed me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Squinting in mock shame <b>she</b> <b>glances</b> with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, {{pulling her}} slip {{free of the}} poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and, gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several {{overcoats}} and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{up at him}} and waited. Arnold, however, {{had stopped}} short.|$|R
60|$|She {{was silent}} for several moments. Then <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> at him curiously.|$|R
60|$|Hilda {{burst into}} a fit of {{laughter}} as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> at the postscript.|$|R
