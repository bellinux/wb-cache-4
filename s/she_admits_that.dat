5|$|Lillete Dubey as Mrs. Kapoor, widowed {{mother of}} Sonny. <b>She</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> Sonny {{is not her}} {{favourite}} son, and wants him to move back with her to Delhi for an arranged marriage, not to Sunaina.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Arroway is {{put into}} a {{position}} that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which <b>she</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|Cane enters Erica's saloon, where Polk {{has been}} telling her that she has overextended herself by buying {{property}} along a proposed railroad track. Cane confronts Polk until Erica requests he stop. Erica reveals that Rose is the woman whom she paid Cane to kill; however, if the proposed railroad track is a success, <b>she</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> Rose {{may not have to}} die.|$|E

5|$|In {{the present}} day, Karman has {{returned}} to Pegaten to a warm reception. Marni, although <b>she</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> she still loves Karman, insists that she will stay with her new husband; Haji Bakir, Karman's uncle, and Karman's mother have likewise forgiven him. Tini and Haji Bakir's grandson Jabir are betrothed as planned, and, when the villagers renovate the dilapidated mosque, Karman makes the cupola. He receives much praise for his work and finds {{a sense of belonging}} in the mosque.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{check into}} a motel, where a cow crashes {{through the roof}} of Mulder's room. After the incident, a tearful Sheila confesses that the cow might have been her fault. <b>She</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> she's {{experienced}} a strange history of weather-related phenomena, and believes that she can unconsciously control the weather. Mulder assures her otherwise. During the conversation, Hardt overhears that Mootz was drunk {{the night of the}} accident, and is relieved. Immediately, Mootz's rain powers seem to disappear.|$|E
5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during a nationally televised interview, <b>she</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims {{was the result of}} the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue into political support that becomes critical to the Underwoods' ascension to the Oval Office.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) {{asks for}} Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) help in {{adopting}} a baby, {{as the local}} adoption agency requires a reference letter from an employer. Andy promises to read her application letter, but tells the camera crew he will only sign it if <b>she</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> she is a horrible person in it. However, Andy is unaware that Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is using her own painful past as a non-adopted orphan to help Nellie with the process. When Andy coldly rejects Nellie's letter (which Erin helped her write), Nellie accepts his decision, but Andy is stunned to hear Erin crying sadly over the failure. He finally adds some mildly snarky but complimentary lines to her letter and signs onto it as a reference, leaving Nellie overjoyed.|$|E
5|$|With one day {{left before}} {{his meeting with}} Lipnick to discuss the movie, Barton phones Audrey and begs her for assistance. She visits him at the Earle, and after <b>she</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> she wrote most of Mayhew's scripts, they {{apparently}} have sex; Barton later confesses to Charlie they did so. When Barton awakens the next morning, he, again, hears {{the sound of the}} mosquito, finds it on Audrey's back, and slaps it dead. When Audrey does not respond, Barton turns her onto her side only to find that she has been violently murdered. He has no memory of the night's events. Horrified, he summons Charlie and asks for help. Charlie is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Barton to avoid contacting the police. After a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Barton tries writing again and is interrupted by Charlie, who announces he is going to New York for several days. Charlie leaves a package with Barton and asks him to watch it.|$|E
5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. <b>She</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> this may be Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, {{there is no clear}} distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E

5|$|Mercy {{learns that}} she {{can stay in the}} UK but feels guilty about the deception, so decides to go back to Nigeria anyway. Fatboy loses his market stall but gets a job selling cars for Max Branning (Jake Wood). He discovers Mercy is leaving, so tries to stop her from leaving but is unable to, and they say an {{emotional}} goodbye. Fatboy is distraught over his loss, and eventually decides to move in with Dot. He helps Dot to track down her half sister Rose Cotton (Polly Perkins) and helps Whitney when her former pimp, Rob Grayson (Jody Latham) tracks her down. Fatboy feels put out when Rose and Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) both move in with Dot. Mercy's sister Faith Olubunmi (Modupe Adeyeye) then arrives in Walford to tell Fatboy that Mercy has had their marriage annulled. Fatboy starts a relationship with Faith (as seen in series 3 of EastEnders: E20) but it soon ends. Following this, Fatboy develops feelings for his friend Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), though Whitney is involved with Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline). When Whitney and Tyler's relationship breaks down, Fatboy admits his feelings for Whitney and the pair start a relationship. Fatboy buys a car for Whitney, but she is initially angry, saying she doesn't want to be owned. However, Whitney relents and accepts the gift. Fatboy notices that Tyler continues to want Whitney, and so warns him off. However, after Whitney gets angry at Lucy (now Hetti Bywater) for dancing with Fatboy, Lucy convinces Tyler to talk to her. They accidentally get locked in a bathroom and Fatboy assumes Whitney has cheated on him, so ends the relationship. Fatboy later visits Tyler, who shows Fatboy that the bathroom door sticks, and Tyler says that he is happy for Fatboy and Whitney as a couple. However, Whitney soon feels smothered by Fatboy's affection, and when he is about to take Whitney away on holiday, she refuses, and when they kiss she says it is like kissing a friend. <b>She</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> she wants Tyler, and Fatboy is heartbroken. He later punches Tyler. He then becomes a regular DJ at R, and gets a job at the local fast food restaurant, McKlunkies. However, he is sacked when he stands up to his manager, Nico Papadopoulos (Aykut Hilmi) after taking advice from Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). Alfie feels bad so offers Fatboy a job at The Queen Victoria public house, collecting glasses.|$|E

25|$|The Ten Commandments {{were meant}} {{exclusively}} for Jewish males. Michael Coogan noticed {{that according to}} their text, the wives are the property of their man, marriage meaning transfer of property (from father to husband), and women are less valuable than real estate, being mentioned after real estate. Adultery is violating the property right of a man. Coogan's book was criticized by Phyllis Trible because of not noticing that patriarchy was not decreed, but only described by God, patriarchy being specific to people after the fall. <b>She</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> Paul the Apostle made the same mistake as Coogan.|$|E

25|$|Later, Asagiri gets mad at {{him because}} he also gave one to Lady Shimoni and gives the {{bracelet}} back to Ukyo saying she don't want it. He asks her why she hates him so much and <b>she</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> she loved him {{and that he was}} kind to every else. He then kisses her on the lips and promises to give Asagiri a moonstone necklace for their wedding. Before he gets killed by Enju, he presents her with the necklace. Being a snow spirit like Asagiri, he also had the power of snow. Soul Symbol: Purity.|$|E
25|$|After Hope's escape, Wolverine accompanies {{her to the}} Blue Area of the Moon. She {{promises}} to let Wolverine kill her if she is unable to control the Phoenix Force; her only request is that she gets the chance to control it. However, Wolverine betrays her by summoning the Avengers. The Phoenix Force begins to bond with Hope, at which point <b>she</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> she cannot contain it. She asks Wolverine to kill her, but he is prevented from doing so by Cyclops. Eventually, the Phoenix Force possesses the X-Men present on the moon, who then return to Earth, leaving Wolverine and the Avengers injured on the Blue Area of the Moon.|$|E
25|$|In the sub plot, Roderick's rape of Florinda {{leads to}} Count Julian, her father, turning against Roderick and aiding the Moors. However, Florinda feels that she {{possibly}} misled Roderick and caused the incident. She confesses these feelings to Roderick who {{at that time}} was using the disguise of Father Maccabee. In her confession, <b>she</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> they kissed and promised to meet again because she was passionately in love with him. However, she decided that her actions were wrong because he was married and she determined that she would become a nun. When she met with Roderick later, he tells her that he wants to leave his wife. In turn, she reveals that she wanted to become a nun, which leads to a fight and, without any description or explanation, she was taken.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Conrad {{appears to}} Nicholas and apologizes, {{claiming}} that he, too, {{has come under}} attack by CRS. With {{no one else to}} turn to, Nicholas finds Christine's home. He soon discovers that she is a CRS employee and that her apartment was staged. Christine tells Nicholas that they are being watched. Nicholas attacks a camera, and armed CRS troops begin to swarm the house and fire upon them. Nicholas and Christine are forced to flee. Christine tells Nicholas that CRS has drained his financial accounts by using the psychological tests to guess his passwords. In a panic, Nicholas calls his bank and gives a verification code to check his account balance—zero. Just as he begins to trust Christine, he realizes she has drugged him. As he loses consciousness, <b>she</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> she is actually part of the scam and that he made a fatal mistake by giving up his verification code.|$|E
25|$|A grieving Anita {{arrives at}} Maria's apartment. As Tony leaves, he tells Maria {{to meet him}} at Doc's so they can run away to the country. In spite of her {{attempts}} to conceal it, Anita sees that Tony has been with Maria, and launches an angry tirade against him ("A Boy Like That"). Maria counters by telling Anita how powerful love is ("I Have a Love"), and Anita realizes that Maria loves Tony as much as she had loved Bernardo. <b>She</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. Lt. Schrank arrives to question Maria about her brother's death, and Anita agrees to go to Doc's to tell Tony to wait. Unfortunately, the Jets, who have found Tony, have congregated at Doc's, and they taunt Anita with racist slurs and eventually simulate rape. Doc arrives and stops them. Anita is furious, and in anger spitefully delivers the wrong message, telling the Jets that Chino has shot Maria dead.|$|E
25|$|In {{the issues}} of Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps serving as preludes to the Blackest Night event, the Star Sapphires {{continue}} to make preparations for the predicted conflict. After undergoing treatment within a violet conversion crystal, Fatality emerges as a newly transformed Star Sapphire. Her first thoughts upon being released are to seek out John Stewart (a Green Lantern she'd been trying to kill for causing the destruction of her home planet). Upon finding him, however, she saves him from Agent Orange's attacking Orange Lantern constructs, demonstrating that {{they are unable to}} absorb constructs made from violet light. <b>She</b> <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> revenge is no longer her goal, and that she has other plans. In the following issue, she reveals that she's attracted to Stewart, may have always been, and the Star Sapphire has given her the ability to finally absolve herself of her survivor's guilt. After Fatality's successful conversion, Miri and Queen Aga'po observe that Kryb appears to be crying inside of her crystal (seemingly distraught over being separated from the children she kept imprisoned on her back). Queen Aga'po remarks that it is a sign the treatment is working.|$|E
