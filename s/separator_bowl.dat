5000|$|Chamber bowl {{is another}} {{competitive}} process {{due to its}} ability to process feed with low solid contents also effective classification of solids. Chamber <b>bowl</b> <b>separators</b> are solid <b>bowl</b> centrifuges with cylindrical inserts with increasing in diameter to form multiple chambers. They are used to separate solids in low contents from liquid and long retention time in the centrifuge makes the separated solids very compact state.|$|R

The system uses parallel structure, a rice separator, a dish <b>separator</b> and <b>bowl</b> conveyor and two conveyor belts. The paper selects the programmable controller (PLC) as control unit to control the corresponding food supply lines parallel movement according to the signal from the selected dishes. Selected dishes, connected to the switchboard and send a signal to PLC, transmission the amount of data of meal card. Users could use the interface to choose food type and quantity, PLC could complete the task. The paper explains the details how the mechanic part and PLC control process...|$|R
