40|$|This {{investigation}} analyzes eleven movies made in Mexico {{about the}} 1910 Revolution and identifies contradictory elements {{that allow the}} films to portray and propagate conservative social and political structures while championing the revolutionary movement and its non-conservative ideals. By endorsing heroic patriarchal figures and structures, reinforcing machismo, and simplifying the ideals and reasons for fighting held by historical figures, the films manage to establish conservative practices while celebrating the revolutionary movement. What follows is {{a detailed analysis of}} a number of movies made throughout a fifty year timeline (1934 ? 1973). These include El compadre Mendoza (1934), El tesoro de Pancho Villa (1935), V?monos con Pancho Villa (1936), Los de abajo (1940), Flor silvestre (1943), Si Adelita <b>se</b> <b>fuera</b> con otro (1948), As? era Pancho Villa (1957), La Cucaracha (1959), La soldadera (1967), Caballo prieto azabache (La tumba de Villa) (1968), and Reed, M?xico insurgente (1973). While all three techniques mentioned above do not appear in every movie, at least two of these contradictory methods are visible in each. The consistent reappearance of these techniques creates questions regarding the various social and political reasons for which these contradictions continue to be incorporated into the movie and the reasons for their continued acceptance by the culture. A possible future project that will help to answer these questions is discussed in the conclusion...|$|R

5000|$|With {{the arrival}} of the 1980s, de La Iglesia {{explored}} the theme of urban insecurity in his film Miedo <b>a</b> <b>salir</b> de noche (Fear to go out at Night) (1980) and he mixed sex, politics and violence in La mujer del ministro (The Minister’s wife) (1981). [...] De la Iglesias subsequent films, written in collaboration with Gonzalo Goicoechea, were centered in social problems such as juvenile delinquency and drug addiction in films like: Navajeros (Knifers) (1980), Colegas (Pals) (1982), El pico (The Needle) (1983) and El pico 2 (The Needle 2) (1984). These films made an effort to connect with a popular audience in a direct and unpretentious style. His formula for success involved young non-professional actors, topical themes, a modest budget, and usually on location shooting. In the period between the last years of the 1970s and the early 1980s de la Iglesia was one of Spains most commercial successful film directors, by contrast film critics were usually harsh in the appreciation of his work. El pico became the directors biggest success at the box office.|$|R

5000|$|Salir {{received}} its name, from the [...] "disappearance" [...] of {{the daughter of}} the Moorish alcalde Aben-Fabilla, so a legend suggests, who escaped when he saw his castle being threatened by the army of Afonso III. But, before fleeing, the alcalde buried all his gold, thinking that he could retrieve it later. When the Christians took the castle, they discovered it was empty, except for the beautiful daughter of the alcade who prayed with fervor, and who had preferred to stay in the castle and die <b>a</b> <b>salir.</b> From <b>a</b> nearby mountain, Aben-Fabilia saw his captive daughter {{in the hands of the}} Christians and with his right hand made a sign of the Star of David, uttering some mysterious words. At that moment, while the knight Gonçalo Peres was talking to the girl, she was transformed into a statue of rock. The news of the enchanted Moor permeated the castle. But, one day the statue disappeared. The memory of the strange event became linked to Salir, whose towns folk named the village in honour of the courageous youth. The legend concludes with the reflection that, on certain nights, the enchanted statue appears in the Castle.|$|R

40|$|Para conocer las diferencias de género en los usos del tiempo y la {{relevancia}} que la profesión tiene en el empleo del tiempo diario de mujeres y hombres se hizo un estudio descriptivo de corte transversal. La muestra estuvo conformada por 927 mujeres y 929 hombres de la población general española de edades comprendidas entre 21 y 65 años y diferentes características sociodemográficas.

The study revealed that women are engaged longer than men in daily domestic work, household maintenance, child care and nursing while men spend more daily time in socializing, resting and other activities described as satisfying; these differences were statistically significant (p <. 05). Analysis of variance showed an interaction between gender and profession in time spent on housework, home maintenance, child care and study. Women with higher professional qualifications dedicated more of their daily time to study and less to household chores and child care than those with less qualified jobs.

40|$|To risk {{going out}} at night, to enter {{unauthorized}} areas, run fast, {{have the ability}} to climb and jump, get dirty with spray can paint, to clash with the police, feel the adrenaline or being away from home for several hours during the night are basic requirements to create graffiti, graphic expression we currently see {{on the streets of the}} world’s largest cities. Such characteristics are generally associated with male attitudes, which suggest that only men are the authors,although there is evidence of female participation from its origins in New York in the late 1960 ’s. My research explore the meanings of ‘being a woman’ in a cultural practice that has been naturalized as a male-dominated field, making women’s participation practically invisible, hindering their capacity to produce worthy cultural objects for the graffiti scene in Mexico. In this article I present some findings that invite us to think about what is behind graffiti made by women. Arriesgarse <b>a</b> <b>salir</b> de noche, entrar en zonas no autorizadas, correr rápido, tener habilidad para trepar, saltar; ensuciarse con el aerosol, enfrentar a la policía, sentir adrenalina o ausentarse de casa por varias horas durante la noche son condiciones básicas en la práctica del graffiti, expresión gráfica que actualmente vemos en las calles de casi todas las principales ciudades del mundo. Tales características al asociarse con lo masculino, hacen pensar que son hombres exclusivamente sus autores aunque existan indicios de participación femenina desde sus orígenes en el Nueva York de finales de la década de 1960. Mi investigación explora los significados del “ser mujer” en una práctica cultural que al ser naturalizada como masculina, invisibiliza la participación de las mujeres y dificulta su capacidad de producir objetos culturales válidos para el ámbito del graffiti en México. Presento en este artículo algunos hallazgos que invitan a pensar lo que hay detrás de un graffiti hecho por mujeres. ...|$|R
