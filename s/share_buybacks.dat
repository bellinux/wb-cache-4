This paper studies the CAR surrounding <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> event over a sampling period from 2006 until 2009 for companies listed in FBM Top 100 index. The result shows that cumulative abnormal return subsequent a <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> event is 0. 26 % and 0. 53 % for CAR (0, 2) and CAR (0, 20) respectively that signifies positive share price performance after <b>share</b> <b>buyback.</b> This paper also reaffirmed that <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> are performed when share price is underperforming the market, where the CAR (- 21,- 1) is recorded at - 0. 44 %.

Further, the regression result reports on the existence of positive effect of accretive <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> on <b>share</b> price return.

Bhargava (2013) reports that stock options exercised by top executives increase future share repurchases by US firms.

40|$|M. B. A. A <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> {{scheme is}} a {{situation}} where a company buys back its shares from shareholders and then cancels them or creates treasury shares. The Companies Act, 1973 (Act 61 of 1973), previously limited the {{reduction in the number of}} shares to preference shares which could only be redeemed by a transfer of the equal amount to the capital redemption reserve fund, a non-distributable reserve in order to maintain the capital levels. Section 85 of the Companies Act now allows a company to buy back its ordinary shares and cancel them without replacing them with a capital redemption reserve fund. The only requirement is that the company must prove that they will be liquid and solvent after undertaking such a <b>share</b> <b>buyback.</b> This has far-reaching consequences for the creditors who rely on the capital maintenance rule as the only protection afforded to them should the company go bankrupt. The reduction in the number of shares after the <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> also creates problems. Firstly, the company's operating capabilities can be reduced, damaging the remaining and future shareholders and secondly, the company's earnings per share (EPS) can improve without any improvement in the actual performance. This tends to make the Annual Financial Statements (AFS) unreliable as the users still rely on the EPS for an indication of whether the company is growing or not. Companies use a <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> for various other reasons, the most important of which being that they want to distribute excess cash back to shareholders. Some of these companies, however, go back to the lending houses to borrow money to finance their current operations immediately after the <b>share</b> <b>buyback.</b> It is imperative to investigate the real reason why companies undertake a <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> and what effect this has on the profitability and the earnings per share of listed companies in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Purpose â Due to {{insufficient}} disclosure on {{open market}} share repurchases in the USA, {{at any given}} point in time, outside shareholders {{have no knowledge of}} whether their firm is executing open market share repurchase trades. It is hypothesized that such information disparity between outside shareholders and insiders of a repurchasing firm creates asymmetric opportunities for insiders to time their sell trades in a period when the firm is engaged in buyback trading of its own shares. Insiders have an incentive to sell when the firm is in the market supporting the price by repurchasing its shares. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine this hypothesis (insider timing hypothesis) by investigating insiders' trading activities during the periods of corporate <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> trading. Design/methodology/approach â Multiple regression analyses are used to explore relations among trades by insiders, corporate <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> trades, and a number of other control variables. Findings â This study finds evidence that insiders do increase the net number of shares sold in a fiscal quarter when the firm is in the market engaged in <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> trading. Originality/value â This study suggests the possibility of insiders' opportunistic trading behavior during the periods of corporate open market <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> trading.

In addition, we find that large and widely held firms that conduct subsequent buyback programs and have a past buyback completion reputation exhibit higher completion rates. Finally, we assess whether other CEO characteristics affect buyback completion rates and find that firms with senior CEOs who hold external directorships and have a longer tenure as CEO {{are more likely to}} complete the buyback programs.

5000|$|Paul Krugman {{wrote in}} 2015 that: [...] "Economists {{struggling}} {{to make sense of}} economic polarization are, increasingly, talking not about technology but about power." [...] This market power hypothesis basically asserts that market power has concentrated in monopolies and oligopolies that enable unusual amounts of income ("rents") to be transferred from the many consumers to relatively few owners. This hypothesis is consistent with higher corporate profits without a commensurate rise in investment, as firms facing less competition choose to pass a greater share of their profits to shareholders (such as through <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> and dividends) rather than re-invest in the business to ward off competitors. One cause of this concentration of market power was the rightward shift in American politics toward more conservative policies since 1980, as politics plays a big role in how market power can be exercised. Policies that removed barriers to monopoly and oligopoly included anti-union laws, reduced anti-trust activity, deregulation (or failure to regulate) non-depository banking, contract laws that favored creditors over debtors, etc. Further, rising wealth concentration can be used to purchase political influence, creating a feedback loop.|$|E

The growth of groups or chains of companies, which make the true economic entity rather than the company itself, where we get a whole complex of companies operating togetherâthat factor has still further divorced management from ownership.

The main prevalent hypothesis amongst scholars and practitioners is that <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> can substitute for dividend payouts as a means for companies to return capital to shareholders, possibly with a tax benefit to shareholders. This so-called substitution hypothesis is shown both theoretically and empirically to be a fallacy as <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> may significantly affect the value to shareholders. This is important because <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> are now substantially larger than dividend payouts in the aggregate, possibly {{as a result of the}} substitution hypothesis commonly believed to be valid. The paper also makes contributions to other areas of finance theory, including a new heuristic for selecting a discount rate for use in valuation, and a new method for estimating the long-term rate of return that can be expected from a stock market index. The theory is also applied to several case studies from the real world. 1 If you find any parts difficult to understand, or if you encounter any errors, be it logical, mathematical, spelling, grammatical or otherwise, please mark the document and e-mail it to: Magnus (at) Hvass-Labs (dot) Org...|$|E
