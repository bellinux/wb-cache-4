Later that morning, MFR downgraded the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> a severe tropical storm. By April 15, MFR downgraded the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> a tropical depression. That very day, the JTWC reported that winds of Helisaonia had fallen below hurricane-force. During the morning hours of April 17, the JTWC downgraded Helisaonina into a depression. Shortly thereafter, MFR stopped monitoring the system. After re-curving just east of Madagascar, Helisanonina dissipated according to the JTWC on April 18. While the storm was weakening, it passed close to Rodrigues without causing any known impact.|$|E

5|$|Moving very {{steadily}} southwest, {{the storm}} gradually intensified. Early on February 15, the JTWC announced that that system had intensified into a tropical storm. After intensifying slightly (based on JTWC data) that evening, the storm briefly weakened overnight, only to re-intensify the next morning. On February16, Favio turned southwest {{in response to}} a large subtropical ridge. Despite low wind shear, Favio remained a moderate tropical storm for several days; however, on February18, MFR announced that Favio had intensified into a severe tropical storm. Subsequently, the storm turned west as the ridge merged with another one centered over South Africa. Two days later, the agency then upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> cyclone status. At 0000UTC that day, on February19, the JTWC upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> a Category1 hurricane-equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) though not much additional intensification was predicted.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Abby {{originated}} {{from an area}} of enhanced convective activity southeast of Guam on July31. While moving south of Guam, the area failed to organized significantly until August3, when thunderstorm activity increased in coverage. Based on this, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued at 2300UTC. Initially, the system struggled to develop a closed atmospheric circulation. However, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the system early on August5 {{and was able to}} locate a closed surface circulation. Based on this, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> a tropical depression. Following an increase in organization, both agencies upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Thad {{originated}} from an active monsoon trough several hundred {{miles east of}} the Philippines in mid-August1981. On August10, a weak surface circulation was first noted on satellite imagery. At that time, the center was embedded within the monsoon trough. Within five days, the system developed outflow. Midday on August15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first classified the system. Based on data from Hurricane Hunters, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 1800UTC on August15. Situated south of a subtropical ridge, the cyclone was located within a favorable environment for further development. Early on August16, the JMA upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> a tropical storm. Following an increase in organization, the JTWC upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Depression 15 that day.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Favio {{originated}} from {{a zone of}} disturbed weather that was first classified by the Météo-France office on Réunion (MFR) at 1200 UTC February11, 2007. Twelve hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on the system. Midday on February12, MFR upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> a tropical disturbance and noted that its rating at that time on the Dvorak technique was 2.0.|$|E
5|$|Early on November 20, the JTWC {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed. Shortly thereafter, MFR {{reported that}} a tropical disturbance had formed. The low moved west-southwest while gradually deepening. Late on November 20, MFR upgraded the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> a moderate tropical storm. The storm failed to intensify further as it had moved onshore northern Madagascar. By November 21, MFR estimated that the storm weakened back into a disturbance. After emerging into the Mozambique Channel, Anety reportedly re-intensified back to moderate tropical storm status. While making its closest approach to the African mainland, the storm resumed weakening while turning back southeast. On November 23, both agencies stopped monitoring the system.|$|E
5|$|Late on November14, Podul made {{landfall}} {{in southeastern}} Vietnam near Phan Rang–Tháp Chàm and quickly weakened into a tropical depression. The JTWC assessed the circulation was dissipating near the coast, and the JMA declared Podul dissipated at 1200UTC on November15. Operationally, the agency tracked the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> the Gulf of Thailand, and the Thai Meteorological Department tracked Podul to near the Malay Peninsula on November16, before ceasing advisories on the storm. The remnants later redeveloped into Cyclonic Storm Helen in the Bay of Bengal, which later struck southeastern India on November22 before dissipating.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric <b>system</b> <b>into</b> France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet {{one month after the}} metre became the sole legal unit of measure, they only had 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and the high level of illiteracy made the metric system unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Although he was {{not part}} of Nintendo at the time, Iwata {{assisted}} in the development of Pokémon Gold and Silver, which were released for the Game Boy Color in November1999, by creating a set of compression tools utilized for graphics in the games. While working as a go-between for Game Freak and Nintendo, he aided in the programming of Pokémon Stadium for the Nintendo 64 by reading the original coding in Pokémon Red and Green and porting the battle <b>system</b> <b>into</b> the new game in just one week. According to Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president of The Pokemon Company, Iwata was instrumental in bringing Pokémon to Western markets. While being president of HAL, he developed the plan for localization after reviewing the code for Red/Green, which was then completed by Teruki Murakawa, with the Western releases coming two years after their Japanese release. Additionally, he assisted Masahiro Sakurai in the development of Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64.|$|E
5|$|Although the low {{initially}} exhibited features {{typical of}} a monsoon trough, surface observations suggested that surface pressures {{in the vicinity of}} the low began to fall on September4. Consequently, the TFCA was re-issued at 10:00UTC. Eight hours later, Dvorak intensity estimates for the storm reached T2.0/, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the <b>system</b> <b>into</b> a tropical depression, although post-storm analysis from the agency indicated that the system attained tropical depression status at 00:00UTC on September4 and tropical storm intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 06:00UTC on September5, the JMA followed suit and classified Gerald as a tropical storm. Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Neneng. The JTWC initially expected Gerald to re-curve east of the Philippines; however, the storm's circulation remained quite shallow and embedded within the monsoon trough, causing Gerald to meander. The JMA upgraded Gerald into severe tropical storm during the evening hours of September5.|$|E
