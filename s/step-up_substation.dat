40|$|International {{audience}} Future {{offshore wind}} farms {{are expected to}} be placed further away from shore, which will give rise to more employment of HVDC transmission. However, HVDC transmission requires a bulky and expensive power conversion substation at offshore as well as a dedicated supporting platform. Potential elimination of the platform and centralized conversion station leads to great cost savings. Recent proposals of pure dc series offshore wind farms are due to this motivation. The series connection of the wind turbines enables to establish the HVDC transmission voltage level with no extra voltage <b>step-up</b> <b>substation,</b> which makes it attractive for distant large wind farm. However, as series connected in one cluster, wind turbines are not possible to operate independently. Severe wind variation imposes overvoltage on the wind turbines and may provoke a cascade of failures of other series connected units. This paper describes the operating behaviour of dc series offshore wind farm as well as correspondent control strategies in both sound and fault conditions. A simulation of the dc series wind farm is carried out and validates the feasibility of the proposed control strategy. DC series offshore wind farms with proposed control imply competitive economic advantages of future integration of remote energy generation. </p...|$|E
40|$|This conference {{paper is}} closed access until 30 th September 2018. The main {{task of the}} “relay” {{protection}} system is to provide trip commands in case of faults and to prevent {{the operation of the}} electrical equipment in dangerous modes. The set of the protection functions and the system structure {{have an impact on the}} reliability and respectively dependability of the protected structure. In some smaller node-point electrical facilities like <b>step-up</b> <b>substations</b> for PVPPs and wind-farms, the set of protection functions required by the respective regulations can be limited. The multifunctional features of new generations of Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and the options to use IEC 61850 based communication, protection and automation, provide opportunities for improvement of the busbar protection system...|$|R
