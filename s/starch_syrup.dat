40|$|Carbohydrates in food {{occur as}} natural {{constituents}} or are added as ingredients or additives. The most important endogenous carbohydrates in food are starch, depolymerized starch, sucrose, lactose, glucose, fructose and sorbitol (digestible) and carbohydrates such as raffinose, stachyose, resistant starch, pectin, cellulose, hemicelluloses including pentosans, fructans, chitin, and seaweed polysaccharides (indigestible). Carbohydrates added to food are often derived from raw materials, e. g. sucrose, polyols, lactose, oligosaccharides, starch and pectins or {{they appear in}} plants not usually consumed as food like exudate gums, seed gums or algal polysaccharides.

40|$|This {{new book}} meets {{the need for}} a comprehensive, {{up-to-date}} review of wheat chemistry, processing and uses. It provides the reader with extensive new information on wheat components that will be useful in better commercial utilization of wheat and the formulation of new and upgraded wheat-based food products. The book serves as a one-volume information resource for all those involved in the research, development, formulation, and evaluation of wheat-based food products. Wheat continues {{to be one of the}} world&# 039;s most important grains, especially as a food, where the unique properties of its products can be utilized to advantage. It provides an excellent example of a natural product from which a wide range of useful by-products can be made. This book discusses the components of the wheat kernel, which provide interesting examples of study of carbohydrate and protein chemistry, as well as lipids, minerals and vitamins. This book should serve as a useful reference for the cereal chemist, as well as chemists and food technologists in those industries in which by-products of flour are used, e. g., the confectionery industry in which modified <b>starches</b> and <b>starch</b> <b>syrups</b> are used. In addition, nutritionists, dieticians, and many kinds of researchers will find chapters of interest. Particular attention is given to particle-size determinations, an important area in food processing, and to the role of wheat proteins in gluten intolerance and wheat allergy.... Both the milling of wheat and flour quality are discussed in order to give the reader an idea of the distribution of the major components and the importance of proper size reduction. The book also has a chapter on wet milling of wheat flour... and chapters on the properties and uses of wheat <b>starch,</b> <b>starch</b> <b>syrups,</b> and chemically modified wheat starch...|$|R
40|$|Fig fruits were {{subjected}} to osmotic dehydration by means of five different sugar syrups, in order to check the aptitude of the species {{to this kind of}} processing. Osmotic dehydration was carried out at 25 °C and at atmospheric pressure on whole fig fruits of the local cultivar Verde. Processing lasted 24 h and the following dehydrating syrups were used: sucrose, glucose, fructose and two commercial hydrolysed corn <b>starch</b> <b>syrups,</b> Frudex 70 and Glicosa. At fixed intervals (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h) appropriate determinations were done on fruit pulp, in order to calculate weight loss, water loss, solid gain and normalised solid content. Results obtained with no doubt indicate that whole fig fruits show a low aptitude to be osmo-dehydrated, probably for their morphology and anatomy and for processing conditions used in this trial...|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} <b>starch</b> <b>syrups</b> {{available on}} the Polish market for winter feeding of bees were evaluated for two consecutive beekeeping seasons (2012 / 2013 and 2013 / 2014). Sugar syrup and inverted sucrose syrup were used as the control. Winter feeding was conducted at two times: earlier {{and later in the}} season. After supplementation of winter feeding was stopped, we measured colony strength (number of combs covered by bees) and brood area. After overwintering (spring 2013 and 2014), we estimated the influence of these foods on: bee mortality during overwintering (number of dead bees in winter debris), food consumption, colony strength and brood area in spring (two measurements in three-week intervals), development dynamics and honey yield from spring flow. An analysis of the results for the parameters assessed before overwintering, after its end and during spring development did not show significant differences between bee colonies fed with different types of food. No relevant difficulties concerning food crystallisation were encountered. The analysed syrups turned out to be as suitable for winter feeding of bees as sugar and inverted sucrose syrups...|$|R

40|$|The pasting and gel textural {{properties}} of corn <b>starch</b> in <b>syrup</b> at different concentrations were investigated by Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) and Texture profile analysis (TPA) tests. The {{results showed that}} the pasting temperatures of corn starch greatly increased, especially at higher sugar concentration. Increasing concentration of syrup caused an increase in peak, trough and final viscosity of corn starch. Peak viscosity and the disintegration rate of starch increased in the following order: fructose syrup. maltose syrup. glucose syrup. Increasing syrup concentration to 13 %, 25 % and 50 % resulted in a lower retrogradation rate than the control. When the maltose syrup concentration increased to 50 %, the retrogradation rate decreased to 14. 30 % from 33. 38 %. The highest hardness was observed when the syrup concentration was 25 %. There was a particular low hardness when the concentration of syrup was 50 %. The springiness of <b>starch</b> gels in <b>syrup</b> was similar at different concentrations...|$|R
50|$|Two {{methods are}} used to convert the {{starches}} to sugars. The traditional method is to take glutinous rice mixed with malt and let the natural enzymatic process take place, converting the <b>starch</b> to <b>syrup.</b> The second and more common method uses potatoes or sweet potatoes as the starch source, and added acid, such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acids. If done by the first method, the final product, known as mugi mizuame (麦水飴), is considered more flavorful than the potato version.|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} mass {{asymmetry}} in the fission of uranium {{at a low}} excitation energy is clarified by a trajectory analysis of the Langevin equation. The positions of the peaks in the mass distribution of fission fragments are mainly determined by fission saddle points originating from the shell correction energy.

We found that a random vibration in the oblate direction of fissioning fragments {{is essential for the}} fission process. According to this picture, fission does not occur with continuous stretching in the prolate direction, similarly to that observed in <b>starch</b> <b>syrup.</b> This is expected to lead to a new viewpoint of fission dynamics and the splitting mechanism.

The two fundamental kinds of honey were evaluated, i. e. blossom and honeydew honey. Each type of honey was represented by 20 samples.
