40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{short-term}} effects of public <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> on individual <b>smoking</b> behavior. In 2007 and 2008, state-level <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> were gradually introduced {{in all of}} Germany's sixteen federal states. We exploit this variation in the timing of state bans to identify the effect that smoke-free policies had on individuals' smoking propensity and smoking intensity. Using rich longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, our difference-in-differences estimates show that the introduction of smoke-free legislation in Germany did not change average smoking behavior within the population. However, our estimates also point to important heterogeneous effects. Groups that go out more often, and hence are more exposed to the constraints of public <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> in everyday life, did adjust their smoking behavior. Specifically, we find that young, unmarried individuals, and those living in urban areas are groups that are both less likely to smoke and smoke less intensively following the introduction of public <b>smoking</b> <b>bans.</b> Furthermore, effects on individual smoking habits proved stronger in states that had more strict <b>smoking</b> <b>bans.</b> Public <b>smoking</b> <b>bans,</b> therefore, have important health benefits {{over and above the}} reduction in exposure of non-smokers to second-hand smoke that is their immediate and prime objective.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} that smoking rates are higher and smoking cessation rates are lower in patients with mental disorders than in the general population. Despite the harmful effects of smoking, implementing total <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> in mental health hospitals is difficult. We investigate the status of <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> and the barriers to the implementation of total <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> in Japanese mental health hospitals. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was administered to the directors of 1242 Japanese mental health hospitals in March 2013. RESULTS: Forty-nine percent (n = 612) of the hospital directors responded. Of these, 24 % implemented total <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> and 14 % limited the bans to hospital buildings. In 66 and 68 % of the remaining hospitals, smoking rooms were located in open and closed wards, respectively, and completely separate from nonsmoking areas. Hospitals that had not implemented total <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> were concerned that introducing a total ban would exacerbate patients' psychiatric symptoms (46 %) or increase the incidence of surreptitious smoking (65 %). However, of the hospitals that had implemented total <b>smoking</b> <b>bans,</b> only 2 and 30 % identified "aggravation of psychiatric symptoms" and "increased surreptitious smoking" as disadvantages, respectively. The other concerns regarding the implementation of total <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> were staff opposition (21 %) and incidence of smoking around hospital grounds (46 %). These concerns were overcome by educating staff about smoking and cleaning the area around the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: There are some barriers to implementing total <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> in Japanese mental health hospitals. However, our study indicates that implementation of total <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> in mental health hospitals was minimally problematic and that barriers to the implementation of <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> could be overcome. As the current number of hospitals that have implemented total <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> is low in Japan, more hospitals should introduce total <b>smoking</b> <b>bans.</b> 博士（医学）・乙第 1376 号・平成 28 年 3 月 15 日Copyright © 2015 Hashimoto et al.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{on the effects of}} public <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> on <b>smoking</b> behaviour presents conflicting results and there is limited evidence on their impact on active smoking. This paper evaluates the impact of <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> on active <b>smoking</b> using data from the British Household Panel Survey and exploiting the policy experiment provided by the differential timing of the introduction of the bans in Scotland and England. We assess the short-term impact of the <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> by employing a series of flexible difference-in-differences fixed effects panel data models. We find that the introduction of the public <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> in England and Scotland had limited short-run effects on both smoking prevalence and the total level of smoking. Although we identify significant differences in trends in smoking consumption across the survey period by population sub-groups, we find insufficient evidence to conclude that these were affected by the introduction of the <b>smoking</b> <b>bans.</b> These results challenge those found in the public health literature but are in line with the most recent strand of economic literature indicating that there is no firm evidence on the effects of <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> on <b>smoking...</b>|$|R
40|$|Indoor <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> {{in public}} places is usually held as a simple and {{straightforward}} example of {{the application of the}} harm principle in public health. However, implementing indoor <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> in mental health centres is difficult because of the potential neurological and social benefits of smoking for persons with schizophrenia, as suggested by some empirical studies. In this article, the ethical challenges related to <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> in mental health centres as justified by the harm principle are explored. Particular attention is given to the case of R v. Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust. The article concludes by arguing that the possible benefits of smoking for persons with schizophrenia creates a rightful interest that cannot be ignored even if one applies the harm principle to protect others from the negative effects of second-hand smoke. Applying the harm principle in the case of <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> in mental health centres requires protecting the interest of persons with schizophrenia to smoke via the value of reciprocity. Indoor <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> {{in public places}} have become so ubiquitous in North America and the UK that it seems as if they have always existed and are uncontroversial for politicians and the general public alike.

5|$|In mid-2000, SFI, {{the owner}} of the Litten Tree bar chain, {{announced}} a £31.6 million takeover of Slug and Lettuce, paid for in shares, and McKenzie left the chain in order to pursue new challenges. By this time the chain had 32 outlets. According to analysts, the chain was too small and had too much debt to survive alone. SFI refurbished a number of their existing pubs under the Slug and Lettuce concept, and by 2004 the chain had 56 outlets. In 2005, SFI attempted to reposition the chain as an upmarket place to eat, in anticipation of the forthcoming <b>smoking</b> <b>ban.</b> In June 2005 SFI went into administration, and sold 98 of its 150 outlets to the Laurel Pub Company, controlled by Robert Tchenguiz, for £80 million. In 2008 Laurel itself collapsed, and the Slug chain became a part of the Bay Restaurant Group, later Town & City Pub Company. The chain has withdrawn from a number of locations, including Glasgow and Cardiff, leaving it with only one location in Scotland, and no presence in Wales. In 2010, Town & City began to refurbish the outlets, switching from a brown colour scheme to aubergine and updating upholstery and lighting.

40|$|A large {{literature}} {{has sought to}} determine whether <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> help or hinder restaurants. Much of the literature improperly specifies its econometric equations and thus mistakenly infers causality. Examining the relationship between restaurant <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> and restaurant revenues in 267 California communities, we reach two main conclusions. First, California's municipal restaurant <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> are endogenous in a critical way-restaurant sales growth (or something correlated with restaurant sales growth) appears to cause restaurant bans, not vice versa. Consequently, failure to control properly for trends can produce spurious "evidence" of causation. Second, ban heterogeneity (e. g., state versus local) can be exploited to sort out-or rule out-causal effects. In other words, pooling data and treating <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> implemented at different levels as homogenous (as many studies do) ignores {{an important source of}} information and is likely to lead to erroneous conclusions. Our analysis holds lessons for the many studies that have examined the arguably more important question of how <b>smoking</b> <b>bans</b> affect <b>smoking</b> rates.
