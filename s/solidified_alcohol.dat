2500|$|Attack {{training}} {{took place}} on ground marked to show the German defences and officers of flanking battalions attended training sessions to ensure that plans were compatible. A scale model of the ridge was built by the IX Corps Chief Engineer on the Scherpenberg Hill between Locre and La Clytte, with boards around the edges for about a company of men to examine the model together. To assist with communication a message map was devised with the map {{on one side and}} a form on the other containing a list of the information needed by the recipient to act on it. Supply dumps for the 36th, 16th and 19th divisions were established at Lindenhoek crossroads and on the Lindenhoek–Neuve Eglise road and beyond these was an advanced dump a brigade dump and one for each of the six attacking battalions. A pack-transport system and [...] packs for carriers were issued, along with plans to carry up a hot meal to the front line on the midnight before the attack. Oranges, Oxo cubes, chewing-gum and lime juice were issued to each man and every fourth man had a tin of <b>solidified</b> <b>alcohol</b> for cooking.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the right}} flank, the field {{artillery}} of IX Corps was {{to sweep the}} Menin road, Gheluvelt and the Scherriabeek valley. North of the Reutelbeek, the German shell-hole positions and emplacements would be bombarded and two machine-gun barrages were to be fired on Polderhoek Spur and {{the north side of}} the château. Stokes mortars and five of the new Newton 6-inch medium trench mortars, were to fire gas bombs at positions in Juniper Wood. To surprise the defenders, the attack was to be in daylight, to try to catch the Germans as they sheltered from the regular morning bombardment. The attack was to begin with the [...] "routine" [...] bombardment as smoke and gas bombardments blanketed the Gheluvelt and Becelaere spurs. The château was only [...] away, German outposts were even closer and to make sure that the outposts were hit, the artillery barrage was planned to begin very close to the New Zealand positions. For deception, a few Lewis gunners and snipers were to hold the New Zealand front line, stay below the parapets and keep quiet. The attacking battalions were to assemble in the support trenches, where greatcoats were to be left behind; each soldier was to carry only his fighting equipment, a waterproof, leather jerkin, a mess tin with a soup square and a tin of <b>solidified</b> <b>alcohol.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After {{three weeks}} work, {{positions}} in the front line had been improved and a frost made the ground harder, until a thaw made the ground even worse than before. The 51st Division stores obtained enough gumboots for a brigade of infantry but many {{were lost in the}} mud as men struggled to get free. The division wore highland kilts, which left the top of the leg bare underneath and the edges of the boots chafed the skin and caused septic sores, until [...] of trousers were issued. Wearing the boots and standing for long periods made men's feet swell, to the point that walking became almost impossible. Buses were brought up to Pozières to collect soldiers, as they straggled back from the front line during a relief. Food containers proved too heavy to carry [...] into the front line and had to be replaced by [...] "Tommy Cookers", cans of <b>solidified</b> <b>alcohol</b> with which soldiers could heat tins of food. Quartermasters improvised large numbers of extra cookers, so that the troops in the line could eat hot food when they pleased but the improvements made little difference to sickness wastage. The division began to relieve battalions after [...] with [...] rest before and after each period in the line. On 11 December, the front of the division was reduced to two battalions, with the front of each battalion area being held by a company and two Lewis-gun crews. The strength of companies had declined to [...] so few and thinly spread, that a stray German soldier taken prisoner near a brigade headquarters, had seen no sign of British troops until he was captured. In December and January, casualties due to enemy action were [...] fewer than those due to the weather and illness; the division was relieved by the 2nd Division on 12 January.|$|E
50|$|The {{method was}} tested on 96% spirit vodka. In this method, melted wax (stearic acid) is stirred, and the {{alcoholic}} drink is poured in. The solution dissipates, and becomes drops containing alcohol and wax. The drops that <b>solidify</b> constitute <b>alcohol</b> powder.|$|R
60|$|From {{the mysterious}} rounded {{back of his}} car Milt Daggett drew a tiny stove, to be heated by a can of <b>solidified</b> <b>alcohol,</b> a frying pan that was rather large for dolls but rather small for square-fingered hands, a jar of bacon, eggs in a bag, a coffee pot, a can of {{condensed}} milk, and a litter of unsorted tin plates and china cups. While, by his request, Claire scoured the plates and cups, he made bacon and eggs and coffee, the little stove {{in the bottom of}} his car sheltered by the cook's bending over it. The smell of food made Claire forgiving toward {{the fact that she was}} wet through; that the rain continued to drizzle down her neck.|$|E
5000|$|... "Tommy cooker" [...] was a {{nickname}} for a British soldier's portable stove, which was fuelled by something {{referred to as}} <b>solidified</b> <b>alcohol,</b> making it smokeless but very inefficient. Today's soldier is nicknamed (within the Army) [...] "Tom", and the British Army magazine Soldier features a cartoon strip character called Tom.|$|E
50|$|A Tommy cooker was a compact, {{portable}} stove, fuelled {{by something}} {{referred to as}} <b>solidified</b> <b>alcohol</b> which was issued to British troops (Tommies) in World War I. It was notoriously ineffective; one soldier complained that it took two hours to boil half a pint of water. A variety of commercial or improvised alternatives were in use.|$|E

The division wore highland kilts, which left the top of the leg bare underneath and the edges of the boots chafed the skin and caused septic sores, until 6,000 pairs of trousers were issued. Wearing the boots and standing for long periods made men's feet swell, to the point that walking became almost impossible.

Quartermasters improvised large numbers of extra cookers, so that the troops in the line could eat hot food when they pleased but the improvements made little difference to sickness wastage. The division began to relieve battalions after 48 hours, with 24 hours rest before and after each period in the line. On 11 December, the front of the division was reduced to two battalions, with the front of each battalion area being held by a company and two Lewis-gun crews. The strength of companies had declined to 50-60 men, so few and thinly spread, that a stray German soldier taken prisoner near a brigade headquarters, had seen no sign of British troops until he was captured. In December and January, casualties due to enemy action were 439, far fewer than those due to the weather and illness; the division was relieved by the 2nd Division on 12 January.|$|E
