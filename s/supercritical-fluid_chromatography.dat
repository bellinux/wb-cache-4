25|$|The {{mobile phase}} is the phase that moves in a {{definite}} direction. It {{may be a}} liquid (LC and Capillary Electrochromatography (CEC)), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (<b>supercritical-fluid</b> <b>chromatography,</b> SFC). The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of HPLC the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or a polar solvent such as methanol in reverse phase chromatography and the sample being separated. The mobile phase moves through the chromatography column (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated.|$|E

40|$|A photoionisation {{detector}} (PID) was coupled to packed-capillary liquid and <b>supercritical-fluid</b> <b>chromatography</b> to study its performance. Several mobile phases were tested {{to evaluate the}} potential of liquid chromatography with photoionisation detection, LC-PID. The behaviour of the PID was {{not as good as}} in gas chromatography (GC), due to the absorption of photons by the mobile phase vapour. Therefore, the minimum detection limits (MDLs) were high compared to those in GC-PID, being at the low nanogram level for, e. g., ketones, aldehydes and amides. Coupling of the PID with <b>supercritical-fluid</b> <b>chromatography</b> (SFC) using modified carbon dioxide gave more satisfactory results. For aromatic compounds like phenanthrene and pyrene MDLs were found to be 12 and 20 pg, respectively. These values were almost the same as found in GC-PID. Separation and detection of aliphatic C 4 -Q 3 carboxylic acids and some organosulphur/phosphorus pesticides (disulfoton, ethion and sulfotepp) showed the possibility to detect several classes of compounds at the low nanogram level using methanol-modified carbon dioxide. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Retention parameters in gas chromatography﻿The paper presents {{a revision of}} terms in the IUPAC "Nomenclature for Chromatography", Pure and Applied Chemistry, 65, 819 - 872, 1993. The terms revised pertain to hold-up volumes in gas, liquid, and <b>supercritical-fluid</b> <b>chromatography,</b> {{as well as to}} basic retention parameters, especially in gas chromatography. A number of related and derived definitions are described, including definitions of the terms "chromatographic process" and "chromatographic phase system". A number of the original terms were found to be misleading or superfluous, including such terms as corrected retention time, net retention time, total retention volume (time), and specific retention volume at 0 °C, and their use is strongly discouragedPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{modifiers}} on the mobile-phase and the stationary-phase properties in packed-column <b>supercritical-fluid</b> <b>chromatography</b> were studied. Modifiers, may affect retention and improve peak shapes and efficiencies, be-cause of (i) increased mobile-phase polarity, (ii) increased mobile-phase density, (iii) stationary-phase d activation, and (iv) increased solvation or {{swelling of the}} stationary phase. In this paper these four parameters are evaluated and evidence to establish their relative importance is considered. The introduction of a modifier {{can lead to a}} substantial increase in the density of the mobile phase. The reliability of several methods for calculating the critical properties and densities of binary fluids is investigated. The Chueh and Prausnitz method gives the most accurate results for the calculation of the critical properties. The Lee and Kesler equation of state yields accurate density estimates. Adsorption isotherms have been measured on several stationary phases for packed-column SFC. These data suggest that stationary-phase d activation i...|$|E

The Chueh and Prausnitz method gives the most accurate results for the calculation of the critical properties. The Lee and Kesler equation of state yields accurate density estimates. Adsorption isotherms have been measured on several stationary phases for packed-column SFC. These data suggest that stationary-phase deactivation is the most important effect of adding modifiers. Adsorption data on different stationary phases {{can also be used to}} judge their applicability. Relevant indicators are the maximum amount of modifier that can be adsorbed on the surface (saturation level) and the initial steepness of the isotherm (surface activity). The latter parameter can be related more closely to the peak shape observed in the absence of modifiers. All silica-based materials studied so far give rise to broad and highly asymmetrical peaks for certain classes of polar solutes. Different silica-based materials appear to differ in degree of activity, but the kind of interactions are the same. On a polystyrene-divinylbenzene stationary phase the mobile-phase modication effect could be studied without the interference of active sites...|$|E
