Assuming the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU as the star radius, the inner shell would extend roughly 50 to 150 stellar radii (~300 to 800AU) with the outer one as far as 250 stellar radii (~1400AU). The Sun's heliopause is estimated at about 100 AU, so the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> this outer shell would be almost fourteen times the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{survival}} of pathogenic and nonpathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strains and of the nonpathogenic species Pantoea agglomerans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Methylobacterium organophilum were compared in the phyllosphere of bean. In general, the plant pathogens survived better than the nonpathogens on leaves under environmental stress. The <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the total leaf-associated populations of the pathogenic P. syringae strains were greater than the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the total leaf-associated populations of the nonpathogens under dry conditions but not under moist conditions. In these studies the surface sterilants hydrogen peroxide and UV irradiation were used to differentiate cells that were fully exposed on the surface from nonexposed cells that were in “protected sites” that were inaccessible to these agents. In general, the population sizes in protected sites increased with time after inoculation of plants. The proportion of bacteria on leaves that were in protected sites was generally greater for pathogens than for nonpathogens and was greater under dry conditions than under moist conditions. When organisms were vacuum infiltrated into leaves, the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the nonexposed “internal” populations were greater for pathogenic P. syringae strains than for nonpathogenic P. syringae strains. The <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the populations of the nonpathogenic species failed to increase or even decreased. The <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> nonexposed populations following spray inoculation were correlated with the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> nonexposed, internal populations which developed after vacuum infiltration and incubation. While the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the populations of the pathogenic P. syringae strains increased on leaves under dry conditions, the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the populations of the nonpathogenic strains of P. syringae, P. agglomerans, and S. maltophilia decreased when the organisms were applied to plants. The <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the populations on dry leaves were also correlated with the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the nonexposed populations that developed following vacuum infiltration.

40|$|The <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> {{galaxies are}} known to be closely related with their masses, luminosities, redshifts and morphologies. However, when we fix these {{quantities}} and morphology, we still find large dispersions in the galaxy size distribution. We investigate the origin of these dispersions for red early-type galaxies, using two SDSS-based catalogs. We find that the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> faint galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) - 19. 5, where M_r is the r-band absolute magnitude, k-corrected to z = 0. 1) are affected more significantly by luminosity, while the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> bright galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) > 11. 4 or M_r < - 21. 4) are by dynamical mass. At fixed mass and luminosity, the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> low-mass galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 10. 45 and M_r ~ - 19. 8) are relatively less sensitive to their colors, color gradients and axis ratios. On the other hand, the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> intermediate-mass (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 10. 85 and M_r ~ - 20. 4) and high-mass (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 11. 25 and M_r ~ - 21. 0) galaxies significantly depend on those parameters, in the sense that larger red early-type galaxies have bluer colors, more negative color gradients (bluer outskirts) and smaller axis ratios. These results indicate that the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> intermediate- and high-mass red early-type galaxies are significantly affected by their recent minor mergers or rotations, whereas the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> low-mass red early-type galaxies are affected by some other mechanisms. Major dry mergers also seem to have influenced on the <b>size</b> growth <b>of</b> high-mass red early-type galaxies.
