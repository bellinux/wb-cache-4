50|$|John Hemmings {{had some}} {{woodworking}} signatures that help distinguish his work {{from that of}} other workers at the Monticello Joinery. They include attaching shelves to the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a <b>cupboard,</b> using a double-bead moulding {{on the front of}} shelves, and curving the moulding on bed frames.|$|R
50|$|The tank {{within this}} garret {{cupboard}} is partially supported {{over the wall}} plate making access and visibility difficult. However, at the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard</b> a wide plank-like brace can be seen extending down from the plate, presumably to the side girt (not seen), {{this was the only}} extant brace within the house.|$|R
60|$|Beth {{sat down}} and watched him, but Patsy {{remained}} standing behind her chair. West emptied all the shelves, and then after a pause took out his pocket knife and began tapping with its end the steel <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard.</b> There was no doubt he suspected {{the existence of a}} secret aperture, and Beth began to feel uneasy.|$|R
60|$|When {{her father}} slept indoors, which was seldom except in winter, he {{occupied}} {{a couch in}} the opposite corner. A rude cupboard had been built against the logs next to the fireplace. It contained supplies and utensils. Toward the center, somewhat closer to the door, stood a crude table and two benches. The cabin was dark and smelled of smoke, of the stale odors of past cooked meals, of the mustiness of dry, rotting timber. Streaks of light showed through the roof where the rough-hewn shingles had split or weathered. A strip of bacon hung upon one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard,</b> and upon the other a haunch of venison. Ellen detested the Mexican woman because she was dirty. The inside of the cabin presented the same unkempt appearance usual to it after Ellen had been away for a few days. Whatever Ellen had lost during the retrogression of the Jorths, she had kept her habits of cleanliness, and straightway upon her return she set to work.|$|R
6000|$|I gazed with disaffection at {{the little}} box which for many a day I was to call home. On the {{starboard}} was a stateroom for the captain; on the port a pair of frowsy berths, one over the other, and abutting astern upon the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> an unsavoury <b>cupboard.</b> The walls were yellow and damp, the floor black and greasy; there was a prodigious litter of straw, old newspapers, and broken packing-cases; and by way of ornament, only a glass-rack, a thermometer presented [...] "with compliments" [...] of some advertising whisky-dealer, and a swinging lamp. It was hard to foresee that, before a week was up, I should regard that cabin as cheerful, lightsome, airy, and even spacious.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Buerk voiced a Marmite advert {{in which}} spoof rescue teams rescue lost {{forgotten}} jars {{at the back}} <b>of</b> <b>cupboards</b> and fridges and despite receiving a number of complaints the advert still continues.|$|R
5000|$|Kim Schmahmann's 1993-99 Bureau of Bureaucracy, {{which is}} a [...] "wooden cabinet full <b>of</b> <b>cupboards</b> to nowhere, {{bottomless}} drawers, drawers within drawers, hidden compartments, and more, a wonderful metaphor for the labyrinthine workings of government".|$|R
25|$|Although Emma was {{not brought}} back, Nick {{felt that she}} should have, due to having {{suggested}} that Revolution's product was made out <b>of</b> <b>cupboard,</b> which was deemed {{one of the biggest}} flaws in its design as a result.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, miss, I took upon {{myself to}} do several things in the way <b>of</b> <b>cupboards,</b> and so on, that you had not ordered, but seeing {{that you wanted to}} have things {{comfortable}} I took upon {{myself to do}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well I came {{to just a}} little," [...] Graham explained, [...] "I {{found that}} I was in a sort <b>of</b> <b>cupboard</b> place, behind the lockers these fellows have for their clothes. It opens with a spring lock, and you'd never notice it, searching the room." ...|$|R
5000|$|A Hoosier cabinet (also {{known as}} a [...] "Hoosier") is a type <b>of</b> <b>cupboard</b> popular in {{the first decades of}} the 20th century. Named after the Hoosier Manufacturing Co. of New Castle, Indiana, they were also made by several other companies, most also located in Indiana.|$|R
60|$|This {{door was}} covered with green baize. It had handles but no lock; and it swung inwards, so as to allow the door <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard</b> (situated in {{the angle of the}} sitting-room wall) to open towards the bedroom freely. Teresa oiled the hinges, and the brass bolt and staple which {{protected}} the baize door on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the bedroom. That done, she looked again at her watch.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} a plain question," [...] said Turnbull, [...] "and one that deserves a plain answer. Why did the Master lock us up {{in a couple}} <b>of</b> <b>cupboards</b> like jars <b>of</b> pickles for a mortal month, and why does he now let us walk free in the garden again?" ...|$|R
50|$|On June 5, 1888, the Montevideo journal La Tribuna Popular {{reported}} the earthquake and its effects: The houses' woodwork creaked loudly, lamps swung, furniture moved and paintings fell off walls. Glassware objects broke and porcelain {{could be seen}} jolting out <b>of</b> <b>cupboards.</b> Astonished at the strong earthquake, inhabitants have had a sleepless night...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{brilliant}} winter day. White gems sparkled on {{the branches of the}} trees, and Jim was already commencing that course of romping which had, up to that date, strewn his path through life with wreck and ruin. Madge was investigating the capabilities <b>of</b> <b>cupboards</b> and larders, under the care of a small maid-of-all-work.|$|R
60|$|It was an old, old house, full <b>of</b> <b>cupboards</b> and passages. Some of {{the walls}} were four feet thick, and {{there used to be}} queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things {{disappeared}} at night--especially cheese and bacon.|$|R
60|$|Malcolm {{heard the}} sound of footsteps, and the {{crashing}} of planks as the men searched the cottages, wrenched off the doors <b>of</b> <b>cupboards,</b> and ransacked the whole place. Gradually the sound ceased, and everything became quiet. Presently he {{heard the sound}} of drums, and knew that the regiment which formed the rear guard was passing.|$|R
50|$|His most {{valuable}} infrastructure {{is the house}} of adobe, masonry, sugar cane and tiled roof, declared National Historical Heritage, which is over 250 years old, consisting of a main room, a bedroom, an area <b>of</b> <b>cupboards</b> and batteries, a kitchen and a chapel {{that served as the}} first church of Santa Ana in 1850.|$|R

60|$|The smaller {{of the two}} keys {{instantly}} {{reminded me}} <b>of</b> the <b>cupboards</b> under the bookcase. I had strangely overlooked these. A vague distrust of the locked doors a vague doubt of what they might be hiding from me, stole into my mind. I left the ladder in its place against the wall, and set myself to examine the contents <b>of</b> the <b>cupboards</b> first.|$|R
50|$|A {{parody of}} the show When Animals Attack!, with a {{voice-over}} supposedly by actor Greg Evigan (actually Mark Gatiss). The last episode of this segment, in the first series, saw The Lettuce Family attacked by a slug - technically not an insect. In the second series this was replaced by When Things Get Knocked Over, Spill, or Fall Out <b>Of</b> <b>Cupboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another night, {{the plaster}} from Henry's attic wall starts coming off, {{revealing}} two master lock dials {{to a hundred}} little locked cupboards. When they are home alone, Henry and Henrietta discover a key in one <b>of</b> the <b>cupboards</b> they have managed to open, which unlocks the door into Grandfather's bedroom. There they find a journal which has a map <b>of</b> the <b>cupboards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Around 40,000 {{books from}} the <b>cupboards</b> <b>of</b> the library got {{circulated}} among children. The <b>cupboards</b> <b>of</b> the library became empty; many cupboard locks in school libraries had to be broken.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Seal got the teacups out <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard</b> and {{set them}} on the table.|$|R
60|$|An {{ejaculation}} from my quivering throat {{brought the}} gendarme to my side. Crouching {{in the dark}} recess <b>of</b> the wall <b>cupboard</b> was Carissimo--not dead, thank goodness! but literally shaking with terror. I pulled him out as gently as I could, for he was so frightened that he growled and snapped viciously at me. I handed him to the gendarme, for by the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Carissimo I had seen something which literally froze my blood within my veins. It was Theodore's hat and coat, {{which he had been}} wearing when I chased him to this house of mystery and of ill-fame, and wrapped together with it was a rag all smeared with blood, whilst the same hideous stains were now distinctly visible on the door <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard</b> itself.|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} the lower shelf <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard</b> was still waiting to be looked over.|$|R

You may call them swells, but I think your Colonel Stubbs is a very vulgar sort of fellow. When I told him the post isn't the proper thing for such a letter, he only laughed. I suppose he doesn't know what {{is the kind of}} thing among gentlemen." ...|$|R

60|$|After Laffray and Grenoble, Lyons, {{where the}} silk-weavers of La Guillotière {{assembled}} in their thousands to demolish the barricades {{which had been}} built up on their bridge against {{the arrival of the}} Emperor, and watched his entry into their city waving kerchiefs and hats in his honour, and tricolour flags and cockades fished out <b>of</b> <b>cupboards,</b> where they had lain hidden but not forgotten for one whole year.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he caught}} sight <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard,</b> and {{something}} seemed {{to tell him that}} there was the place to look.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And a worse one,' said a virulent old {{man with}} a pitcher, 'there isn't nowhere. A harder one to work, nor a grudginer one to yield, there isn't nowhere!' This old man wore a long coat, such as we see Hogarth's Chairmen {{represented}} with, and it was of that peculiar green-pea hue without the green, which seems to come of poverty. It had also that peculiar smell <b>of</b> <b>cupboard</b> which seems to come of poverty.|$|R

It had black hair and dark eyes and a lovely pearl-and-white complexion, and when Langwidere wore it {{she knew she was}} remarkably beautiful in appearance.|$|R
