5|$|Due to Cold War disagreements, the Military <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> never {{succeeded in}} its {{intended}} purpose. Although it formally still meets every two weeks, {{it has been}} effectively inactive since 1948. Thus, article 47, and the references to it in articles 26, 45 and 46 can be deleted.|$|E
5|$|While {{the liberation}} of the Brunei area had been {{authorised}} by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, it was {{not supported by the}} British Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee.</b> The British leadership did not want the BPF to be diverted from the main theatre of operations off Japan and preferred to establish a base for the fleet in the Philippines. In response to a suggestion from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Brunei Bay could support future operations in south-east Asia, the Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> judged that it would take too long to establish facilities there, especially as Singapore might have been recaptured {{by the time they were}} complete.|$|E

5|$|In April 1940, Winston Churchill {{took control}} of the Military Co-ordination Committee, charged with {{overseeing}} all of the military services. He selected Ismay as his chief staff officer, which also gave Ismay the additional responsibility of serving on the Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee.</b> While serving under Churchill had been a life-long dream for Ismay, he was initially sceptical about the duties of his new position, which seemed unclear and poorly defined.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{also made}} {{preparations}} in late 1942 {{for the movement}} of the 9th Division back to Australia. Four large troop ships were allocated to the task, and the British Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> initially proposed to Churchill that they sail across the Indian Ocean without a protective escort. However, as the eastern Indian Ocean was within range of Japanese warships based at Singapore and Japanese submarines had occasionally attacked ships near Aden, this was judged to be unacceptably risky, especially as it was not likely that the movement of so many soldiers could be kept secret. Moreover, transporting the division without an escort would have violated the long-standing policy of assigning at least one capital ship to protect troop convoys in this region, and would not have been accepted by the Australian government. In November, the Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> decided to allocate an escort to the convoy, but did not specify what it should comprise.|$|E
5|$|COSSAC {{was charged}} with {{planning}} three operations: Operation Cockade, a deception operation to keep German forces pinned to the coast; Operation Rankin, a plan for measures {{to be taken in}} the case of a sudden German collapse; and Operation Overlord, a plan for a full-scale assault on north western Europe. Morgan and his staff worked on the Overlord plan throughout June and the first half of July 1943. He presented it to the Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> on 15 July. The plan set forth in detail the conditions under which the assault could be made, the area where a landing would be feasible, and the means by which a lodgement on the continent would be developed.|$|E

5|$|In October 1943, Cunningham became First Sea Lord of the Admiralty and Chief of the Naval Staff, {{after the}} death of Sir Dudley Pound. This {{promotion}} meant that he had to relinquish his coveted post of Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, recommending his namesake Admiral John H. D. Cunningham as his successor. In the position of First Sea Lord, and {{as a member of the}} Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>committee,</b> Cunningham was responsible for the overall strategic direction of the navy for the remainder of the war. He attended the major conferences at Cairo, Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam, at which the Allies discussed future strategy, including the invasion of Normandy and the deployment of a British fleet to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Scherger became Chairman of the Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> (COSC), {{the senior}} Australian {{military}} {{position at the}} time, in May 1961, taking over from Vice Admiral Sir Roy Dowling. Keen as ever to see a supersonic bomber replace the Canberra, he visited Britain in April 1963 to investigate progress of the TSR-2. Using back-channel sources of information, he satisfied himself that the RAF's pronouncements on the bomber's development were overly optimistic, and later that year began supporting selection of the F-111 as the aircraft best suited to supplant the Canberra.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} found on a clifftop {{immediately}} north of the village of Bruneval, which was itself twelve miles north of Le Havre, and was the most accessible German radar site that had been found so far by the British; several other installations were further inland in France, and others were {{as far away as}} Romania and Bulgaria. A request for a raid on the Bruneval site to capture a Würzburg system was passed on to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Combined Operations. Mountbatten in turn took the proposal to the Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee,</b> who approved the raid after a brief debate.|$|E

5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a threat to}} shipping, the British Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided in late August to conduct further attacks against her using Royal Air Force heavy bombers. On 15 September, a force of Avro Lancasters attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this raid she sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø {{to be used as}} an immobile coastal defence battery. Another heavy bomber attack on 29 October caused only minor damage, but in a third raid mounted on 12 November, Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized, sinking with heavy loss of life.|$|E
5|$|In July 1985, Schwarzkopf {{began an}} 11-month {{assignment}} as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans at the Pentagon. On July 1, 1986, {{he was promoted}} to lieutenant general, and was reassigned to Fort Lewis as commander of I Corps. He held this post for 14 months before returning to the Pentagon as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans in August 1987. In a second role, Schwarzkopf served as the Army's senior member on the Military <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> at the United Nations Security Council, where he began to build diplomatic skills in dealings with representatives from other countries. As a part of his duties during the posting, he sat in on arms reduction talks with leaders from the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In November 1986 the Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> and Minister for Defence Kim Beazley {{decided to}} {{transfer}} {{all of the}} RAAF's Iroquois and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time. The transfer of the RAAF's other helicopter types increased {{the cost to the}} service of operating the Chinooks, and made it more difficult to find aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF subsequently proposed transferring the Chinooks as well, but the Army was unwilling to accept them. The problems the Army was experiencing keeping the Iroquois and Black Hawk helicopters operational may have influenced this position, with the service being reluctant to take on an even more complex helicopter type.|$|E

He retired on 31 July 1961, but on 15 September 1961 he was recalled to active duty to become director of the National Security Council's Net Evaluation Subcommittee Staff at the Pentagon. He retired a second time on 30 April 1965.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{the rank}} of brigadier, after the German {{surrender}} in North Africa, Wheeler was sent to Algiers where {{he was part of the}} <b>staff</b> <b>committee</b> planning the invasion of Italy. There, he learned that the India Office had requested that the army relieve him of his duties to permit him to be appointed Director General of Archaeology in India. Although he had never been to the country, he agreed that he would take the job on the condition that he be permitted to take part in the invasion of Italy first. As intended, Wheeler and his 12th Anti-Aircraft Brigade then took part in the invasion of Sicily and then mainland Italy, where they were ordered to use their anti-aircraft guns to protect the British 10th Corps. As the Allies advanced north through Italy, Wheeler spent time in Naples and then Capri, where he met various aristocrats who had anti-fascist sympathies.|$|E
5|$|While in London, Clarke met {{many of his}} {{counterparts}} on the Western Front. He attended {{meetings of}} the Twenty Committee and Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> (which was chaired by his old commander, John Dill). The paper on deception met with approval in the establishment and {{it was decided that}} a department similar to 'A' Force should be created in London. Clarke was offered the job, reporting directly to the Chiefs of Staff and War Cabinet. He declined, citing loyalty to the Middle East, but his decision was in large part due to the greater operational freedom and status he enjoyed in North Africa. The London Controlling Section was formed and, after some disorganisation, prospered under John Bevan, with whom Clarke would later work closely.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To survey resident, joint resident/staff, {{family and}} <b>staff</b> <b>committees</b> in South Australian aged care hostels. Method: The {{managers}} of all 159 South Australian aged care hostels were surveyed concerning {{different types of}} committees, with 106 hostels participating. Results: Ninety percent of hostels had resident information meetings, 75 % had <b>staff</b> <b>committees</b> but only 65 % had resident committees and only 12 % had joint resident/staff and/or family committees. While nearly all managers thought that their hostels provided adequate means for residents to express their wishes and concerns, some also indicated that additional committees would be beneficial. Greater participation of committee members {{was the most common}} suggestion for improvement. Conclusion: There is scope for more resident, joint resident/staff and family committees in aged care hostels. There is also a need for research to determine the relative benefits of each kind of committee and their optimum combination, and to identify ways of increasing participation in such committees.

5|$|While the Japanese raid {{into the}} Indian Ocean was not successful, {{associated}} Japanese shipping movements provoked a major Allied response. In early March 1944, Allied intelligence reported that two battleships escorted by destroyers had left Singapore {{in the direction}} of Surabaya and a U.S. submarine made radar contact with two large Japanese ships in the Lombok Strait. The Australian Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> reported to the Government on 8 March that there was a possibility that these ships could have entered the Indian Ocean to attack Fremantle. In response to this report, all ground and naval defences at Fremantle were fully manned, all shipping was ordered to leave Fremantle and several RAAF squadrons were redeployed to bases in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Graham {{was forced}} to {{publicly}} defend his decision, while questions were raised about the knowledge and approval of his decision as the tactical commander {{by a number of}} senior Army officers, including then Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, the Chief of General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Thomas Daly, and the Chairman of the Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee,</b> General John Wilton, all of whom had acquiesced to its construction. Meanwhile, as DCGS Graham was second only to Daly in the daily running of the Australian Army. During this time Graham unsuccessfully sought the retention of national service following the eventual Australian withdrawal from Vietnam, arguing that it was necessary to further expand the Regular Army. He later managed the draw-down of Australian forces in Vietnam, and played a leading role in shaping the post-war Army. Graham was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Northern Command in 1973 and later Commander 1st Division. He subsequently filled the position of head of the Australian Defence Staff in London over the period 1974–76. Graham was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours. He retired in March 1977.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{retired from}} the Air Force in May 1965 after {{completing}} his term as CAS, which the government had extended for twelve months beyond its original three years. Having followed two fellow Royal Military College graduates—McCauley and Scherger—in the role, he was succeeded by another former Duntroon cadet, Alister Murdoch. Hancock's name was put forward as a successor to Scherger when the latter's term as Chairman of the Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Committee</b> completed in May 1966, but Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies preferred General Sir John Wilton for the position. Later the same year, Hancock took over as Commissioner-General for Australia at Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, following {{the sudden death of}} the previous appointee, Vice Admiral Sir Hastings Harrington. In 1975, prompted in part by the fall of Saigon in April that year, Hancock co-founded the Australia Defence Association as an independent think tank for defence matters, and chaired its Western Australian chapter. He was also active in the Royal Commonwealth Society, and published an autobiography, Challenge, in 1990. Hancock continued to fly in retirement, joining his cousin Lang, also a pilot, in promoting the Pilbara mining district. Val Hancock died in Perth on 29September 1998, and was survived by his wife and three children. He is commemorated by Sir Valston Hancock Drive at Evans Head.|$|E
50|$|On 14 May, the French Government {{requested}} {{another ten}} squadrons. This request was discussed {{first at the}} Chief of <b>Staffs</b> <b>Committee,</b> and then at War Cabinet; both decided against taking any immediate action. The Chief of <b>Staffs</b> <b>Committee</b> of 15 May discussed the matter again; accepted Air Chief Marshal Dowding's advice that sending more fighters would not achieve decisive results in France, but would leave Fighter Command too weak to defend the UK and decided against any further reinforcement. That of 16 May had {{in front of it}} a message from General Gamelin, asking for ten fighter squadrons at once - if they did not come the battle would be lost. It therefore reconsidered the matter and advised sending eight 'flights' (half-squadrons). This was discussed and agreed at War Cabinet; Churchill wanted to send more squadrons, but Sinclair advised that four squadrons was a maximum, and even this was a very serious risk, taken contrary to the advice of Dowding.|$|R
