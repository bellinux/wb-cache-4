5|$|I Can <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> Room...and There's Nobody in It! (sometimes I Can <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> Room and There's Nobody in It! {{or simply}} I Can <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> Room!) is a 1961 {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is {{a painting of}} a man looking through a peephole. It formerly held the record for highest auction price for a Lichtenstein painting.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include I Can <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I Can <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> Room... and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E
5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E

5|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story {{published}} by the Publishers Syndicate on August 6, 1961, Lichtenstein’s I Can <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil. The painting depicts a man looking {{through a hole in}} a door. His finger is extended to open a circular peephole, while simultaneously allowing the artist to present his face. The painting also uses a speech balloon.|$|E
5|$|In the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917, Chauvel's {{mission was}} similar to Rafa and Magdhaba, but on a larger scale. He enveloped the Turkish {{position}} at Gaza while the British 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division and 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division attempted to capture it. When this failed, Chetwode ordered Chauvel to attempt to capture Gaza from the rear. Chauvel successfully improvised a late afternoon assault on Gaza that captured the town despite the barriers of high cactus hedges and fierce enemy opposition, entering it after dark, only to have an out-of-touch Dobell order the mounted troops to withdraw, despite Chauvel's protests. This time his brigadiers at the front, Generals Ryrie and Chaytor, although they believed that Gaza could be held, felt compelled to obey, as they could not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> battle. All guns, including captured ones were hauled away, as were all unwounded prisoners, the wounded and even the dead. Chauvel ensured that wounded Turkish prisoners that were unfit to make the march to Deir al-Balah were each left with a full water bottle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} room, {{there is a}} statue of a man resting his elbows on a balustrade. According to legend this was a rival {{architect}} to {{the one who had}} built the pillar of angels, the architectural feat of the era, who contended that one single pillar could never support such a large vault, and he would wait to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing come crashing down.|$|E

25|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story, Lichtenstein’s I Can <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) depicts a man {{looking through a}} hole in a door. It was sold by {{collector}} Courtney Sale Ross for $43 million, double its estimate, at Christie's in New York City in 2011; the seller's husband, Steve Ross had acquired it at auction in 1988 for $2.1 million. The painting measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil.|$|E
25|$|Positioned behind home plate, {{the catcher}} can <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> field, and is {{therefore}} {{in the best position}} to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play. The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals. The calls are based on the pitcher's mechanics and strengths, as well as the batter's tendencies and weaknesses. Foul tips, bouncing balls in the dirt, and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher, necessitating the use of protective equipment. This includes a mask, chest and throat protectors, shin guards, and a heavily padded catcher's mitt.|$|E
25|$|Look, if I have a {{triangle}} in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind {{and two others}} just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makélélé, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him he can <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means {{one of the two}} other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4–4–2 can do to stop things.|$|E

25|$|His journey {{started when}} {{he studied the}} Qur'an in a literal way, and he slowly began to {{understand}} the principles lined in the religion. Then something happened to him in America to remove his doubts. He says; {{that while he was}} going to America, he was on the boat (ferry), and he saw the way the boat he was travelling in – was rocking in the huge sea – all under the control of Allah without it sinking or capsizing. At that point he realized the power of Allah. He said Iman (belief) entered into his heart due to this. His second scenario was in San Francisco, when he went on top of a mountain, and he could <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of creation in front of him, and he realized the beauty and harmony that existed amongst the creation as a whole. He said that, the sweetness of Iman hit him.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} years of the García {{government}} gave new hope to the people of Peru, with rising employment, production, and wages suggesting a clear turn for the better after so many years of increasing difficulties. It was hence doubly tragic to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> process unravel so quickly, once things started going wrong again. The first sign of trouble came, as it often had, from the balance of payments. The economic boom naturally raised imports swiftly, by 76 percent between 1985 and 1987. But the real exchange rate was allowed to fall by 10 percent in 1986 and by a further 9 percent in 1987. The boom pulled potential export supply into the domestic market, and the fall in the real exchange rate reduced incentives to earn foreign exchange. Exports fell slightly in 1985 and remained below that level through 1987. The external current account went from a surplus of US$127 million in 1985 to deficits of nearly US$1.1 billion in 1986 and nearly US$1.5 billion in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Jack's {{old friend}} is J.J. Wickham, {{known as the}} 'Sea Ranger' due to his use of an old Russian submarine. After a lengthy {{explanation}} he takes Jack to the Second Vertex, arriving just as Wolf does. Switchblade attempts to sabotage the mission by dropping the Second pillar into the bottomless abyss beneath the Vertex before it is inlaid, dooming the world and depriving the Americans of its reward, 'Heat' (believed to be a limitless power-source). However, Jack swings across the pit at the last moment, catches the pillar, and manages to place it in the Vertex just before Switchblade drops himself and Jack into the abyss. Wickham and the Adamsons escape, with Horus diving into the abyss after Jack. Wolf leaves with the Second Pillar, leaving Alby, who was brought with them, alone at the Vertex. Zoe, Sky Monster, Lily and Wizard, on board the Halicarnassus on an airfield in Botswana, had been in phone contact with Jack to help him avoid the traps at the Vertex and <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing happen on the videophone. The surviving team members realize they must face the placing {{of the last four}} pillars and the arrival of the Dark Sun, three months away, without Jack.|$|E

She {{continues}} by a couple's mutual love for each other, [...] "I <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> in your eyes / It's like I've known you all my life / We just feel so right". Platten stated that the song's lyrics revolve around finding positivity and optimism in everyday situations.|$|E
500|$|The work is {{an example}} of Lichtenstein's {{presentation}} of the uncertainty of the one-eyed perspective. It {{is considered to be a}} work on the subject of [...] "focal vision and blindness", and it is a prominent example of the theme running through Lichtenstein's art relating to vision. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both the circular peephole and the circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. Monocularity is funnelled through the primitive peephole apparatus that almost mimics a camera lens. In some senses, monocularity of this work is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. In addition, the work is considered to be closely related to his later work, Image Duplicator (1963), which is regarded as a correction of I Can <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> Room! with its glaring and aggressive binocularity. The monocularity of I Can <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> Room! should be viewed as a concentrated form of monocularity, such as [...] "the common experience of closing one eye in order to fix an object in the gaze", but a subordinated form of monocularity that is enhanced by technology.|$|E

500|$|Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation both {{praised the}} story, with Famitsu saying it [...] "vividly portrays {{the fact that}} this is a deep, intense Final Fantasy experience, {{something}} beyond just a side story". Gaming website PlayStation LifeStyle's Heath Hindman was impressed by the darker presentation, calling it [...] "powerful and well done throughout", and was impressed with the characters despite some awkward introductory scenes. Erren Van Duine, writing for RPG Site, said that fans would appreciate the scale of the narrative, and praised the handling of the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos. She did note that some plot points seemed only included for the sake of convenience, and that the ending forced a second playthrough to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé first {{considered}} {{the idea of}} creating a [...] "visual album" [...] in June 2013, when only three or four songs had been completed. Explaining her motivation, she said she would often connect images, childhood memories, emotions and fantasies to songs she {{was in the midst of}} composing, and that she [...] "wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head as that's what makes it mine". She highlighted the [...] "immersive experience" [...] of Michael Jackson's Thriller (1982) as the principal influence for creating a body work that would mean [...] "people would hear things differently and [...] actually be able to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> vision of the album".|$|E
500|$|The picture teases {{the viewer}} who {{is given the}} feeling that he is in a dark room being viewed by the main subject of the {{painting}} who is a man that peeks {{through a hole in the}} door. The narrative element of the image, which included a speech bubble that presents the caption [...] "I Can <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> Room and There's Nobody in It", clarifies that the man can not see anything in the room although he has a good look at it. The work is a satirical reference to abstraction because it can be imagined as a monochrome canvas that is affected by an actor that has inserted his finger as well as a narrative that also violates this imagining. This finger is also regarded as phallic.|$|E
