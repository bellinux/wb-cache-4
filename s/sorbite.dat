40|$|Recently, {{high carbon}} steel tends to be widely used for machine and {{construction}} parts. The structure of these {{high carbon steel}}s is pearlite when used as rolled or as forged. However, it is usually used as tough <b>sorbite</b> or sorbitic pearlite structures made by heat treatment. The welding of high carbon steel is less useful because of its high carbon equivalent, but is sometimes needed in actual cases. In this paper, {{the relationship between the}} impact property and the structure of high carbon steel was first investigated using two materials. The first one is S 58 C whose structures are pearlite and <b>sorbite.</b> Heat treatment is a usual one as the high temperature heat treatment simulating heat affected zone. The second is the parts of welded rail joints, whose structures are also pearlite and <b>sorbite.</b> Secondly, the effect of structure on fatigue property was studied with respect to the above-mentioned sobite structure of S 58 C and two structures of the welded rail joint. The main results obtained are as follows. (1) In both properties, the <b>sorbite</b> structure made by heat treatment or welding is superior to the pearlite structure, and in each of the two structures the finer structure shows better properties. (2) In case of being changed into pearlite structure after heat treatment or welding, both properties of <b>sorbite</b> structure before heat treatment or welding are better than those of pearlite structure before heat treatment or welding. (3) In the case of heat treatments from 1373 K to 1573 K corresponding to the simulating high temperature heat affected zone, the grain size in the bond and its neighborhood of welding ioints is made coarser, and consequently both properties are deteriorated. (4) Finally, the impact property increases as the grain size becomes finer and the hardness lowers: On the other hand, the fatigue property does not depend largely on the grain size but depend on the hardness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the CTOD test, {{metallographic}} test is done. The effect of microstructure on CTOD of welded joints for offshore high-strength steel has been analyzed by SEM. The microstructure of different samples in a welding procedure and two different welding procedures are compared. From the microscopic point of view, {{the reasons why}} the toughness of the second group welded joints is better than the first group’s and why the toughness of the same group welded joints is different have been determined. And the main microstructure found in EQ 70 steel welded joints is the ferrite, tempered <b>sorbite</b> and a small amount of pearlite. Besides some carbide particles are on the matrix of tempered <b>sorbite.</b> The material toughness {{with a small amount of}} acicular ferrite is better. Inclusions and pores also seriously affect the toughness of welded joints. Reducing the welding heat input appropriately can refine the grain of CGHAZ and improve toughness. But hardened microstructure may occur owing to too low welding heat input...|$|E
40|$|Elevated {{temperature}} tensile {{tests have}} been conducted for several steels with different carbon content over the temperature range (700 ℃～ 800 ℃) including A_ 1 and A_ 3 transformation points. The effects of temperature, strain rate and microstructure on the superplastic formabilities have been studied and the results obtained are as follows; (1) In <b>Sorbite</b> material of the higher carbon steel, the more remarkable drop of the strength and the greater elongation are observed at the temperature just above A_ 1 point. This {{is considered to be}} superplastic phenomena due to (α+γ) microduplex structure producted by the precipitation of many fine γ particles on the eutectoid transformation. (2) The superplastic deformation is by no means uniform, but a large fraction of the total elongation is contributed by the elongation due to necking. The sustained stress {{at the bottom of the}} neck is constant during tensile test and so the creep process may take part in the deformation. (3) The <b>Sorbite</b> materials of each steels have larger strain rate sensitivity index of flow stress than the as-received materials and is considerably superior to the superplastic formability...|$|E

In this model, a mutational yielding surface and an isotropic hardening surface were defined in stress space and strain space for the description of Bauschinger effects, respectively. Then this model was used to simulate tension-compression tests of Weldox 960 steel and study the springback and reduction of thickness in cold-bending. Results obtained from the experiment and simulation show that this modified model is valid in predicting cold-bending forming and springback...|$|E

40|$|In this investigation, {{the effect}} of heat {{treatment}} on the rate of corrosion of steel was studied. The following results were summarized. (1) The corrosion rate of steel increases with increasing carbon content of annealed and quenched steel. (2) Corrosion potential of steel shifts to noble potential as corrosion rate increases then corrosion reaction of steel is cathodic control type. (3) Between 300 ℃ and 400 ℃ of tempering temperature, corrosion rate of steel increases considerably because tempering troostite appears in the structure (S 55 C).

A railroad line {{is one of the most}} important elements upon comfortability, safety, maintenance and expenses of a railroad. It is the most difficult point that we make a railroad line by weldipg as long as we can, and there is a hard problem in the welding. It is said that a rail with the <b>sorbite</b> structure, a rail with heat-treated head, has about treble as long life as a general rail with the pearlite structute, (though it also depends upon a curved radius,) but, at present, only the welding of a general rail is put to practical use. We would like to research into the welding of the rail with heat-treated head someday. But at first, by using the same materials the rail, we used the heat-treat materials as base ones which were changed into those with the same <b>sorbite</b> structure and the same hardness as the heat-treated rail. In order to synthesize the welded heat-affected zone, from the temperature of 600 ℃ to 1300 ℃, we heated and air cooled those materials every 100 ℃. We investigated the impact properties of those and also of the base materials. As a result of this, the best is that heated and air cooled at 700 ℃, and the worst is at 1300 ℃.

To {{understand}} the effects and mechanism of heat treatment to the high-pressure vessel performance, {{a series of}} different closed-shaped cavity heat treatment tests were conducted. Through tensile test, impact test, hardness test, OM and SEM test and so on, the heat treatment effects and micro mechanism of high-pressure vessel with different closed-shaped cavity were studied along the wall thickness direction. The results indicate that: with increase of volume of the closed-shaped cavity, the strength of container middle cross-section increases in the beginning and decreases afterward, the toughness falls first and then rises, and the plasticity changes little. The strength, plasticity and hardness increase gradually from inside to outside along the wall thickness direction. The hardness increases {{a little in the}} beginning, but then rises quickly when it comes close to the outer wall. After being quenched at 930 ℃ and tempered at 580 ℃, the microstructure of the vessel material is mainly tempered <b>sorbite.</b> The structure grain boundary becomes more and more blur from inside to outside of the wall. Inner wall contains a small amount of residual austenite and tempered martensite. The fracture surface is toughness one...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cold steel {{rolls and}} too many other cold work dies are chosen of low alloy steel heat treated to about 60 RC in 50 {{millimeter}} depth on surface. Troostite phase which happens in some cases in tempered martensite has lower fracture toughness, although its ductility is a little more. In Industrial practical process condition, some technological problems seldom take place, and the part might be locally heated because of the accident. This effect may cause a phase change in metallurgical structure {{on the surface of}} the cold steel rolls or dies, named Troostite. However, the parts which subjected to this problem have no mechanical defect to be detected by NDT, but these kinds of affected part may be failed in working (rolling) by fracture, spalling or cracks. So Troostite is a harmful phase for rolls and other cold work tools which cause lots of losses to the companies. The following paper is a practical industrial approach to show and follow thermal instability of roll surface and metallurgical change of the surface from <b>sorbite</b> to troostite and its failure or fracture due to any improper usage...|$|E

The microstructure, hardness and wear resistance of this material were studied. The diffusion annealing processing was conducted at 900 ℃ for 6. 5 h, and the quenching process with oil at 880 ℃ for 2 h. The temper process was conducted at 180 ℃, 220 ℃, 260 ℃ and 500 ℃ for 2 h. It {{was found that the}} WC particulates surrounding the Fe 3 C phase were distributed evenly within the matrix. The segregation was discovered in the cast and was eliminated through annealing at the cost of hardness. The quenching, annealing at 180 ℃ for 2 hrs plus air cooling induced the tempered martensite, some ferrite and few retained austenite. The microstructure changed into the tempered <b>sorbite</b> after tempering at higher temperatures.

40|$|Abstract. To {{increase}} comprehensive {{properties of}} cylinder steel, high-pressure cylinder steel 30 CrMo-M was developed {{on the basis}} of steel 30 CrMo. Tests and researches were made on factors which influence heat treatment properties, such as chemical composition, quenching temperature, and tempering temperature. The results indicated that the 30 CrMo-M steel has stable chemical composition, its strength rises with increase of carbon equivalent, and thus it has better relativity. When concentration of quenching liquid is 5 %, yield ratio of the steel can be guaranteed to be low, thus safety of cylinder is improved. Tempered between 570 ℃~ 622 ℃, the strength of the steel is increased and plasticity rises with increase of temperature. When tempered at 570 ℃, inner wall structure of cylinder contains tempering martensite, the strength is high but the plasticity is low. When tempered between 610 ℃~ 615 ℃, temper brittleness happens very easily and toughness is on the low side. The best heat treatment technology is: quenched at 930 ℃ with temperature holding for 40 minutes and quenching liquid concentration as 5 %, tempered at 580 ℃ with temperature kept for 90 minutes. The microstructure treated by this technology is tempered <b>sorbite</b> with higher strength, plasticity and toughness...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fluid {{cylinder}} as {{an important}} fracturing equipment with stable and reliable performance is commonly applied in oil and gas fields, but it fractures frequently and its working life is generally low, which has seriously affected the fracturing process efficiency. In this paper, we used the stereo microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), direct reading spectrometer, metallurgical microscope and bending fatigue testing machine to study the fatigue failure mechanism of steel E 4330 for fluid cylinder. The fracture analysis, hardness test, metallographic observation, bending fatigue test and pre-corrosion fatigue test were carried out. The result shows that the main cracking form of the fluid cylinder is fatigue cracking, the cleavage crack initiated near the intersection line and extended friable due to the corrosion and impact wear effects from the fracturing fluid and the high stress of the fluid cylinder; the fluid cylinder material E 4330 contains a variety of alloy elements, and its organization is the uniform <b>sorbite</b> which can meet the working requirements. It has been observed that the fatigue limit of the material is 607 MPa, and at a higher stress, the fatigue life would be nearly halved in the corrosive environment. As the fatigue life would greatly reduce due to the corrosion effects from the fracturing fluid, we should control the working stress and make measures for anti-corrosion...|$|E
