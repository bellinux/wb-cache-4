Considering a one-storey asymmetric plan system subjected to perpendicular bi-directional earthquake motions, the inelastic multi-dimensional strength reduction factor spectra is presented. The yield {{rule of the}} asymmetric plan system is determined by two-dimensional yield-surface plasticity function. The spectral equation is simplified by the relationship of strength reduction factors between x-direction and y-direction. The multi-dimensional spectra are analyzed based on 30 pair strong earthquake motion records for hard <b>soil</b> <b>site,</b> intermediate <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> and soft <b>soil</b> <b>site.</b> Analytic results shows that the strength reduction factor mean spectra for each <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> has its own characteristics, and the strength reduction factor spectra is affected strongly by ductility, normalized stiffness eccentricity, period and rotation frequency ratio...|$|E

40|$|Microtremor {{records have}} been used to assess seismic {{amplification}} of <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> in Hong Kong. The method is based on ratios of horizontal and vertical components of microtremor (ambient noise) records, and the ratios are often referred to as Nakamura's ratios. The peak frequency of the Nakamura's ratio correlates well with the fundamental modal frequency estimated from the site shear wave velocities which were derived by a vertical seismic profiling method or were converted from SPT data. The amplitudes of the ratios are very stable and the standard deviation of the ratios derived from a series of measurements is reasonably small. Results from rock sites show that the ratios take a value of unity at a wide frequency range when the site has no large topographical effect. The ratios are generally larger than unity if the site has topographical effect but no dominant peak appears in the ratios. Results from <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> show that a dominant peak appears at the fundamental frequency of the site and the amplitudes of the dominant peak are between 6 and 12 for mean ratios. It is plausible to take the maximum value of the ratios as the peak amplification of the soil layers (Fourier spectral ratio) at small strain motions. Results from <b>soil</b> <b>sites</b> also show that many sites on reclaimed land and land fills are likely to be susceptible to seismic amplification. The seismic amplification has possible implications for those buildings with about 20 storeys or less founded on <b>soil</b> <b>sites.</b> Site fundamental modal frequencies estimated by microtremor records have been obtained from extremely small strain motions and they are likely to change during a moderate or strong earthquake shaking.

Field drains have been identified as a fast pathway for dissolved nutrients to reach the waterways, potentially bypassing conventional buffer zones. Field wetlands, (small, unlined ponds (< 500 m 2) constructed in unproductive agricultural areas and designed to intercept runoff), are a simple and effective option for diffuse pollution mitigation, addressing both sediment-associated and dissolved pollutants. This paper describes the results of sediment and nutrient trapping from ten field wetlands built at four sites in the UK, covering a range of soil types and runoff sources. Sediment and nutrient retention in the wetlands was estimated from samples collected at the inlet and outlet of each wetland, as well as from an annual survey of the sediment retained in each wetland. Sediment masses trapped within the wetlands ranged from 0. 3 – 1 t yr- 1 at a clay <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> to 25 – 40 t yr- 1 at a sandy <b>soil</b> <b>site.</b> At the sandy site, 30 – 70 kg yr- 1 total phosphorus (TP) and 60 – 200 kg yr- 1 total nitrogen (TN) was trapped with the sediment. Rainfall was a confounding factor, with much lower rainfall at the clay site during the monitoring period. Concentrations of both particulate and dissolved nutrients were observed to decrease between the inlet and outlet of wetland systems.

Agriculture has been identified as the largest sector associated with diffuse sources of nutrients and sediment. Field wetlands have been used for mitigation of diffuse pollution in Scandinavia but there is currently little quantitative evidence of their effectiveness in the UK. Ten field wetlands have been built at four sites in the UK, covering a range of soil types, runoff sources, wetland sizes and wetland designs. The wetlands, small (< 350 m 2), unlined ponds constructed along runoff pathways, slow the connection between the pollution source and the waterways, and provide more opportunity for sediment and nutrients to settle out or be taken up by aquatic organisms. This paper describes sediment retention in all ten wetlands and nutrient retention at one highly polluted site. Sediment retention was estimated from annual surveys of the sediment build-up in each wetland. Sediment trapping rates were highest on a sandy <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> (0. 5 – 6 t ha- 1 yr- 1), compared to a silty <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> (0. 02 – 0. 4 t ha- 1 yr- 1) and a clay <b>soil</b> <b>site</b> (0. 01 – 0. 07 t ha- 1 yr- 1).
