25|$|The {{factors and}} {{processes}} {{that influence the}} rate and spatial distribution of <b>sediment</b> accretion within the salt marsh are numerous. <b>Sediment</b> deposition can occur when marsh species provide a surface for the <b>sediment</b> to adhere to, followed by deposition onto the marsh surface when the <b>sediment</b> flakes off at low tide. The amount of <b>sediment</b> adhering to salt marsh species {{is dependent on the}} type of marsh species, the proximity of the species to the <b>sediment</b> supply, the amount of plant biomass, and the elevation of the species. For example, in a study of the Eastern Chongming Island and Jiuduansha Island tidal marshes {{at the mouth of the}} Yangtze River, China, the amount of <b>sediment</b> adhering to the species Spartina alterniflora, Phragmites australis, and Scirpus mariqueter decreased with distance from the highest levels of suspended <b>sediment</b> concentrations (found at the marsh edge bordering tidal creeks or the mudflats); decreased with those species at the highest elevations, which experienced the lowest frequency and depth of tidal inundations; and increased with increasing plant biomass.

25|$|Longshore {{drift of}} <b>sediment</b> is {{important}} for distributing <b>sediment</b> along the coast, and {{is considered one of}} the most important mechanisms. The longshore drift of <b>sediment</b> can be considered both a source and a sink due to the fact that in some case it can add <b>sediment</b> to a coastline but in others transport <b>sediment</b> away from a coastline. An example of both extremes of longshore drift can be found on the Canterbury coastline in New Zealand, either side of Banks Peninsular. Both the Waimakariri River in the north and the Canterbury Bight in the south of the Banks Peninsula provide large amounts of <b>sediment</b> respectively. The difference is the <b>sediment</b> supplied by the Waimakariri River is a source for the coast's New Brighton spit due to the reversal of southern currents transporting <b>sediment</b> to the south. In contrast the Canterbury Bight has a combination of high energy environments and strong southern longshore currents that transport large amounts of <b>sediment</b> north, which can be classified as a sink, putting a deficit to the coasts sedimentary budget. As a result, there is erosion of the Canterbury Bight and a predominantly balanced New Brighton Spit.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sediments</b> are {{considered}} to be the sinks of trace metals including mercury, and acquiring trace metals from <b>sediments</b> is found to be the dominant route of trace metal uptake for many aquatic organisms. In this study, effects of geochemical and biological factors on the bioavailability of mercury (including inorganic mercury or Hg and methylated mercury or MeHg) in <b>sediments</b> were investigated. Contact time between mercury and <b>sediments</b> could decrease the mercury bioavailability through changing the mercury solid speciation. Most Hg and MeHg are associated with organic matters (OM) but not inorganic particles in oxic <b>sediments,</b> and the association could increase or decrease Hg bioavailability depending on the contact time. In anoxic <b>sediments</b> not only FeS but also FeS 2 was important in controlling the partitioning and bioavailability of Hg in anoxic <b>sediments.</b> Hg in <b>sediments</b> can be partitioned into two pools of different mobility (operationally defined) depending on Hg concentrations in <b>sediments.</b> Hg solid speciation (or geochemical fractionation) has great effects on the bioavailability of Hg in <b>sediments,</b> and could be used as predictors of Hg bioavailability. Cysteine and other thiol groups are the key binding sites of Hg and MeHg in organic matters, in <b>sediments</b> and in digestive fluids of deposit-feeders, which greatly influence the sorption and bioavailability of Hg and MeHg in <b>sediments.</b> While both free amino acids and proteins contribute to the extraction of Hg by gut juices from <b>sediments,</b> proteins are the key extraction agents for MeHg.

Mercury was demonstrated to be contained in the <b>sediments</b> in the adsorbed Hg 0 mode, predominantly in relation with organic matter. When the organic matter of the bottom <b>sediments</b> is decomposed in the course of lithification, Hg is retained in the <b>sediments</b> adsorbed on the residual organic matter, and the concentration of this element corresponds to its initial content in the bottom <b>sediments</b> during their accumulation. Mercury concentrations in lithologically distinct bottom <b>sediments</b> of Lake Baikal and its <b>sediments</b> as a whole depend on the climate. <b>Sediments</b> that were formed during warm periods of time contain more Hg than those produced during cold periods or glaciation. Periodical variations in the Hg concentrations in the bottom <b>sediments</b> of Lake Baikal reflect the variations in the contents of this element in the Earth's atmosphere in the Late Cenozoic, which were, in turn, controlled by the climatic variations on the planet and, thus, can be used for detailed reconstructions of variations in the average global temperature near the planet's surface...|$|R
