This terminology is also used with units of measurement (for example by the BIPM and NIST), where <b>a</b> <b>submultiple</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> main <b>unit</b> is <b>a</b> <b>unit,</b> named by prefixing the main unit, defined as the quotient of the main <b>unit</b> by <b>an</b> integer, mostly <b>a</b> power <b>of</b> 103.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>submultiple</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> S-band {{transmitter}} {{output frequency}} was divided equally between a linear phase modulation branch and a QPSK modulation branch. The linear modulation branch includes a multiplier {{to increase the}} carrier frequency to a level which, when combined with the carrier in the QPSK branch in an up-converter (utilizing a mixer at the input followed by a bandpass filter), produces the transmitter output frequency. This allows the QPSK modulator to operate at one-eighth of the output frequency where repeatable and precisely controlled modulation can be easily achieved. This also allows linear phase modulation at one-eighth the output frequency where low modulator deviation and good linearity can be easily maintained...|$|R

However, the very existence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> independent “circatidal” clock has been disputed, {{and it has been}} argued that tidal rhythms arise as <b>a</b> <b>submultiple</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circadian clock, operating in dual oscillators whose outputs are held in antiphase i. e., ∼ 12. 4  hr apart. ResultsWe demonstrate that the intertidal crustacean Eurydice pulchra (Leach) exhibits robust tidal cycles of swimming in parallel to circadian (24  hr) rhythms in behavioral, physiological and molecular phenotypes. Importantly, ∼ 12. 4  hr cycles of swimming are sustained in constant conditions, they can be entrained by suitable stimuli, and they are temperature compensated, thereby meeting the three criteria that define a biological clock. Unexpectedly, tidal rhythms (like circadian rhythms) are sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of Casein kinase 1, suggesting the possibility of shared clock substrates. However, cloning the canonical circadian genes of E.  pulchra to provide molecular markers of circadian timing and also reagents to disrupt it by RNAi revealed that environmental and molecular manipulations that confound circadian timing do not affect tidal timing. Thus, competent circadian timing is neither an inevitable nor necessary element of tidal timekeeping. ConclusionsWe demonstrate that tidal rhythms are driven by a dedicated circatidal pacemaker that is distinct from the circadian system of E.  pulchra, thereby resolving a long-standing debate regarding the nature of the circatidal mechanism...|$|R
