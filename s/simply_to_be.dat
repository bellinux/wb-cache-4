To qualify as a polymorphism, some kind of balance must exist between morphs underpinned by inheritance. The criterion is that {{the frequency of the}} least common morph is too high <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the result of new mutations or, as a rough guide, that it is greater than 1% (though that is far higher than any normal mutation rate for a single allele).|$|E

Meanwhile, all the other boys passed theirs, and he felt isolated. Just before the ceremony marking their departure Suzuki went to the Rinzai teacher and blurted out his answer. The master passed Suzuki; later Shunryu believed he had done it <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kind.|$|E
25|$|In 1965 R. D. Laing and {{his colleagues}} asked the Lesters {{for use of the}} Hall as a {{community}} for themselves and people in a state of psychosis. As a result Kingsley Hall became home to the Philadelphia Association {{and one of the most}} radical experiments in psychiatry. Based on the notion that psychosis, a state of reality akin to living in a waking dream, is not an illness <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> eliminated through the electric shocks favoured in the Western tradition of the time but, as in other cultures, a state of trance which could even be valued as mystical or Shamanistic, it sought to allow schizophrenic people the space to explore their madness and internal chaos. Residents (in the grip of psychosis) were often treated with kindness and respect with sincere efforts to alleviate their suffering.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Buffy the Vampire Slayer drew a large {{mainstream}} audience into fandom; greater demand allowed (even obliged, {{for the sake}} of time management) Buffy actors to charge much higher appearance fees than the Star Trek actors had. This pushed appearances {{out of the reach of}} some volunteer non-profit fan groups towards commercial event promoters. At the same time, a market for celebrity autographs emerged on eBay, which created a new source of income for actors, who began to charge money for autographs that they had previously been doing for free. This became significant enough that lesser-known actors would come to conventions without requesting any appearance fee, <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allowed to sell their own autographs (commonly on publicity photos). Today most events with actor appearances are organized by commercial promoters, though a number of fan-run conventions still exist, such as Toronto Trek and Shore Leave.|$|E

500|$|English {{also makes}} {{frequent}} use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that {{are made up of}} a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up, to ask out, to back up, to give up, to get together, to hang out, to put up with, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment). In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including , do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term [...] "phrasal verb". Instead they consider the construction <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. he {{woke up in the morning}} and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent.|$|E

500|$|Despite his contributions, his {{captaincy}} {{and coaching}} methods came under immense scrutiny {{from the press}} {{as well as other}} scholars. Engel commented that [...] "He seems like aloof to the problems that his mal-decisions are creating. I don't particularly believe that Ganguly has an 'effing knowledge how to lead his team and tries to counter-pose it with instigating limitless, confrontational behaviours within the younger members of it. [...] the time will come when such shock tactics will cease to work." [...] An article on Cricinfo Magazine pointed out his reckless behaviour. The reporter Rahul Bhattacharya said, [...] "Generally Ganguly fostered angry or reckless young men. To him 'good behaviour', a broad term espoused by the present team management, belonged in school and probably not even there. He himself had been summoned to the match referee no less than 12 times in the last decade. His approach was bound to precipitate what could possibly be termed a cultural conflict in the world of modern sport. For Ganguly, like for Arjuna Ranatunga, competitiveness involved brinksmanship rather than training. As far as they were concerned Australia were not to be aspired to. They were <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> toppled. England were not to be appeased. Victory lay precisely in their disapproval. In other words, Ganguly and Ranatunga wanted to do things their way." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer David Gerrold, {{who worked}} with the staff of The Original Series {{following}} {{his work on the}} episode [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles", described Chapel as being one of a second-tier set of characters including Uhura, Scotty and Sulu, who were not given as much exposure during the series as the main characters of Kirk, Spock and McCoy. He explained that {{she was the only one}} of the second level of characters whose motivations were explored, however, her primary focus on board the ship was <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in love with Spock. Gerrold explained that there was a need to demonstrate the [...] "aloofness" [...] of the Vulcan character, and so this resulted in a character whose love of him needed to be rebuffed, thus giving Chapel her purpose. He suggested that this caused Chapel to be disliked the fandom because [...] "Female fans saw her as a threat to their own fantasies and male fans saw her as a threat to Spock's Vulcan stoicism." [...] But added that those fans were surprised when they met Barrett at science fiction conventions, as they found her likable in person. By the time of the 2009 film Star Trek, the character had become more popular among fans, who were asking if she would appear in the new films.|$|E
500|$|Michael Westmore was {{responsible}} for taking Probert's designs for the Ferengi and creating the make-up for the actors to meet that design. In Probert's original concept, the Ferengi had ears which were pointed like a bat. There were concerns from the producers that these would appear <b>simply</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> larger versions of the already known Vulcan ears, and so Westmore was told to round off the ears {{when it came to}} producing the make-up. Other elements which were changed at the make-up stage included modifications to the nose to increase the volume of wrinkles and dropping the idea of an extended chin as Westmore thought it would save time in applying the make-up. A set of false upper teeth were also created, which were added to a single head piece and a nose piece which comprised the prosthetics for the Ferengi. Westmore was not pleased when a shot of an actor in costume was leaked without the teeth, he said [...] "I was annoyed about that photo because the make-up was incomplete. After all the work that went into it, we would have wanted our design in proper form. The photo was like a pirated version of our make-up, because none of us would ever approved it under those circumstances." [...] Michael Okuda designed a rank designation tattoo which Westmore applied to the right part of each Ferengi forehead. The symbol means [...] "Dog eat dog" [...] and was painted green as that is the colour of American dollar bills. Each bar (referred to by the production crew as a [...] "rocker") {{to the side of the}} symbol designated a rank, with more bars meaning a higher rank.|$|E
