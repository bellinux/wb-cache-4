50|$|In 2008, Traxxas {{released}} a revised Blast. New features included a new waterproof {{version of the}} Nautica ESC, a waterproof high torque <b>steering</b> <b>servo,</b> a new water sealed receiver box, a new upper hull (with a sleek enclosed cockpit replacing the old open one), Traxxas high current battery connectors, new motor labeling, and new graphics.|$|E
50|$|The Summit VXL 1/16 was {{released}} on November 1, 2010. It is a smaller version of the 1/10 scale Summit without locking diffs, LED lights and dual <b>steering</b> <b>servos.</b> It {{is powered by a}} Velineon 380 4000kv brushless motor and a VXL-3m brushless ESC. Almost all of the major components are shared with the E-Revo VXL 1/16 {{with the exception of a}} few suspension parts, wheels, tires, body and bumpers. The claimed top speed is 25-40 mph depending on whether one or two battery packs are used. Optional front and rear LED lights are available, pre-drilled holes are located in the front and rear bumpers.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Traxxas {{introduced}} {{an updated version}} of the E-Maxx (model 3905). This model featured a new extended wheelbase chassis, a new transmission skid plate, new waterproof EVX-2 16.8 volt speed control, new sealed differentials, drive shafts, pivot balls, and ball bearings, new dual waterproof <b>steering</b> <b>servos,</b> water tight receiver box, new steering linkage, redesigned bulkheads, new hex hardware, new single speed strengthened, brushless ready transmission (a two-speed transmission is available as an accessory), Revo spec slipper clutch, new battery holders, 3.8 inch mirror chrome wheels and [...] "Chevron" [...] tires, and a new body with new paint and revised graphics. Both models have a claimed top speed of 30+ MPH.|$|R
50|$|Released in {{late spring}} 2009, the E-Revo VXL 1/16 is {{essentially}} a scaled down version of the larger 1/10 scale E-Revo. The body, wheels, tires, suspension and drive components are all nearly identical in design to the 1/10 scale E-Revo, just scaled down. It {{is powered by a}} Velineon 380 4000kv brushless motor and a VXL-3m brushless ESC, both scaled down versions of the Velineon 3500kv brushless motor and VXL-3s brushless ESC used in Traxxas' 1/10 scale brushless vehicles. Some of the inevitable sacrifices inherent with the smaller scale include the lack of the optional two-speed transmission, many rubber sealed components, and dual <b>steering</b> <b>servos</b> offered on the 1/10 scale version. Claimed top speeds depend on which battery packs are used. One 7.2 v NiMH pack will reach 30 mph. Two 7.2 v NiMH packs will reach 50 mph. One 3s 11.1v lipo pack will reach 50 mph.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This work investigates {{the challenge of}} designing and implementing minimum-time trajectories for an autonomous, non-holonomic, planetary rover. The optimal trajectories were implemented at the Control and Optimization Laboratories with a TRAXXAS remote controlled vehicle modified to enable autonomous operations. These modifications include the addition of an ArduPilot controller into {{the architecture of the}} vehicle. The ArduPilot controls the inputs to the drive motor and <b>steering</b> <b>servos</b> to implement the trajectory commands generated by the trajectory optimization tool, DIDO. The challenging problem of parallel parking was used to evaluate a canonical maneuvering scenario and illustrate a procedure for motion planning {{that could be used for}} guiding a planetary rover. Three cases were evaluated with different starting points to illustrate the difficulties associated with controlling a non-holonomic vehicle. The starting points were located in front of, next to, and behind the parking space. In addition to each case, three scenarios were evaluated for complexity no cars, two cars parked with an ideal amount of space between them, and two cars parked with minimal space between them.

50|$|The Traxxas Slash was {{introduced}} in 2008 and is a two-wheel drive 1/10 scale short course electric race truck. This Traxxas model comes Ready-To-Run (RTR). The Slash shares many of its parts with the Rustler, Stampede and Bandit. Differences include a raised chassis (though {{not as high as}} the Stampede's) that is also much longer, wider and rectangular, 4.3 inch (diameter) x 1.7 inch (width) all-terrain style tires mounted on 2.2/3.0 inch wheels (now a point in short course rc trucks), though first production runs did sell with the non-sc style wheel (2.2) traxxas believed it would save on production to use the 2.2/3.0 design from the slayer, with a 12mm hex. Out-of-the-box this car features a TITAN 12 turn motor.

The claimed top speed is about 20+MPH.|$|E
25|$|The Great Eastern {{was one of}} {{the largest}} steamships of its time and {{employed}} a steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in 1866 by John McFarlane Gray. Joseph Farcot coined the word servo in 1873 to describe steam-powered <b>steering</b> systems. Hydraulic <b>servos</b> were later used to position guns. Elmer Ambrose Sperry of the Sperry Corporation designed the first autopilot in 1912. Nicolas Minorsky published a theoretical analysis of automatic ship steering in 1922 and described the PID controller.|$|R
50|$|The servo-actuated three step {{mechanical}} speed control features a resistor with a metal mounting bracket for heat dissipation, and is wired for a single 7.2V battery pack.

5000|$|Released in late 2009 the Traxxas Slash 4x4, a {{four-wheel drive}} one tenth scale short-course {{electric}} race truck and it features Traxxas' first all new one tenth scale platform since the Jato {{was introduced in}} 2005. Contrary to its name, the Slash 4x4 has almost no parts commonality with the two-wheel drive Slash, and the Slash VXL 1/16. The parts carried over from the two-wheel drive Slash to the Slash 4x4 are limited to the shocks, springs, and the rear drive shafts and axle carriers, otherwise, the Slash 4x4 is a completely new design from the ground up. Its central chassis is a semi rectangular unit molded from gray plastic featuring triangular reinforcements throughout. It also features a four-wheel independent unequal length double wishbone suspension with four oil filled coilover shocks and progressive rate springs in staggered lengths ("long" [...] up front; [...] "XXlong" [...] in back). The new suspension will also be capable of mounting front and rear sway bars (available as a Traxxas accessory). It is powered by the same [...] "Velineon 3500" [...] 10 turn 3500kV brushless motor and [...] "Velineon VXL-3S" [...] non-waterproof 320 (rated burst) amp brushless ESC as the two-wheel drive family VXL models. In February 2010 all versions of VXL systems were sold as waterproof, however the Slash 4x4 does not bear the VXL moniker like Traxxas' other Velineon powered models. The driveline design is very different than that featured on any other Traxxas model. The motor is mounted longitudinally in the M4 layout driving a spur gear that directly turns (no transmission), via a Revo spec slipper clutch, the main one piece hollow aluminum drive shaft. The drive shaft sends power {{to the front and}} rear viscous limited slip differentials, which send power to the wheels through plastic telescoping half shafts. The Slash 4x4 features a similar exterior appearance to the two-wheel drive Slash, including a similar short course style body, bumpers, nerf bars, and wheels. Other notable features include scale replica BFGoodrich Mud-Terrain T/A tires with white lettering, 2.2 inch satin chrome beadlock style [...] "SCT" [...] wheels, a new heavy duty ball bearing steering system, digital waterproof high torque <b>steering</b> <b>servo,</b> Traxxas high current connectors, 2.4Ghz radio system, and hex hardware used throughout. With the stock motor/ESC combo the claimed top speed is 35 to 65+MPH depending on the battery and gearing used. Traxxas also advertises the Castle Creations Mamba Monster Brushless system (featured on the E-Revo/E-Maxx Brushless Edition and available as a Traxxas accessory) as a direct [...] "drop in" [...] replacement for the stock Velineon system, and it is claimed to be capable of powering the Slash 4x4 to speeds in excess of 80MPH.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{aircraft}} ground handling characteristics and airport working efficiency, large handling angle and torque are requested for the nose wheel steering system of large civil aircraft. A following swivel selector valve is firstly {{designed to meet the}} demand for the hydraulic pressure commutating as soon as the dual actuator nose wheel steering mechanism passes through its dead center position. Considering the multiple objective functions of nose wheel steering mechanisms, those core design parameters are multiobjective optimized. A nose wheel <b>steering</b> electrohydraulic <b>servo</b> system with handling and antishimmy functions is designed for the steering mechanism. Then the prototypes of the steering mechanism and electrohydraulic servo system are researched to validate the design. Using the swing actuator to provide the load torque and ground excitation, the steering test bench is prepared to test the system working. The steering test and the antishimmy test are conducted to verify the functions of the system.

50|$|In 1982, Carbodies (who {{had been}} {{producing}} the FX4 for Austin and Mann & Overton) {{took over the}} cab's intellectual property rights when BL (Austin's parent company) lost interest in it; Carbodies thereafter produced it under their own name. The old Austin engine was no longer available because, during Michael Edwardes' reconstruction of British Leyland, the plant had been sold to India. Carbodies selected the Land Rover 2286 cc diesel engine in its place and also offered the similar-sized Land Rover petrol engine as an option. The new model was branded the FX4R, with R standing for Rover. The FX4R had some improvements over the previous FX4 models, including power <b>steering</b> and full <b>servo</b> brakes, but its performance and reliability were poor and the cab gained a bad reputation.|$|R

5000|$|The latest mini-z chassis {{released}} {{at the end}} of October 2009 was the MR03 chassis. The most noticeable change is using dynamic strut front suspension instead of sliding knuckle. It uses a small coreless servo motor instead of the brushed <b>servo</b> motor for <b>steering.</b> Small <b>servo</b> motor allows the batteries to be closer to the centerline of the car for lower polar moment if inertia. The modified ASF receiver board comes with a reverse delay of exactly [...]01 second, which for all practical purposes is instant. The reverse delay can be programmed back in using the optional computer interface cable. The MR-03, like the dNaNo, has an optional gyro that can be installed on the car. The gyro senses when the car is about the spin out. It corrects by reducing power to the motor or by correcting steering. The amount of throttle and steering correction from the gyro can be programmed via the ASF connector. The front end of the car has interchangeable parts to allow use of both narrow and wide AutoScale bodies. The rear end of the car uses a different t-plate design but the motor pod mounting holes are the same. This allows motor mounts from the previous generation MR-02 and MR-015 cars to work on an MR-03. The MR-03 chassis works with all currently available Kyosho Mini-Z bodies.|$|R
40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Fine Guidance System has set new {{standards}} in pointing control capability for earth orbiting spacecraft. Two precision pointing control modes are {{implemented in the}} Fine Guidance System; one being a Coarse Track Mode which employs a pseudo-quadrature detector approach and the second being a Fine Mode which uses a two axis interferometer implementation. The Coarse Track Mode was designed to maintain FGS pointing error to within 20 milli-arc seconds (rms) when guiding on a 14. 5 Mv star. The Fine Mode was designed to maintain FGS pointing error to less than 3 milli-arc seconds (rms). This paper addresses the HST FGS operating in the Coarse Track Mode. An overview of the implementation, the operation, and both the predicted and observed on orbit performance is presented. The discussion includes {{a review of the}} Fine Guidance System hardware which uses two beam <b>steering</b> Star Selector <b>servos,</b> four photon counting photomultiplier tube detectors, as well as a 24 bit microprocessor, which executes the control system firmware. Unanticipated spacecraft operational characteristics are discussed as they impact pointing performance. These include the influence of spherically aberrated star images as well as the mechanical shocks induced in the spacecraft during and following orbital day/night terminator crossings. Computer modeling of the Coarse Track Mode verifies the observed on orbit performance trends in the presence of these optical and mechanical disturbances. It is concluded that the coarse track pointing control function is performing as designed and is providing a robust pointing control capability for the Hubble Space Telescope...|$|R
