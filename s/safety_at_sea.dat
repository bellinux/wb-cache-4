5|$|The {{origin of}} the coat of arms of Póvoa de Varzim is unknown, but it {{certainly}} has local traits and symbolism. The coat of arms consists of a golden sun and a silver moon; in the middle a golden cross completed by two anchor silver arms, representing <b>safety</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> Over the cross, a ring, of which falls a golden rosary that interlaces with the anchor arms, representing faith and divine protection. The crest is made of five silver towers due to its city status. The flag is broken in blue and white. Between 1939 and 1958, a different coat of Arms and flag were used, which the population criticized; it consisted of a golden shield, covered by a red net, the sea and a black Poveiro boat; the flag was plain red. The population did not accept these new symbols and years later the old ones would be restored.|$|E

This includes all accidents with passenger ships and other large Norwegian vessels, in which people have or are assumed to have lost lives or been substantially injured. AIBN may also investigate foreign ships in cases where Norwegian jurisdiction can be applied under international law.

2500|$|The {{combination}} of disappointment about insufficient support from Sweden in the League of Nations, Swedish disrespect for Åland's demilitarised {{status in the}} 1930s, and some feelings of a shared destiny with Finland during and after World War II has changed the islanders' perception of Åland's relation to Finland from [...] "a Swedish province in Finnish possession" [...] to [...] "an autonomous part of Finland". The islanders enjoyed <b>safety</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> during World War II, as their merchant fleet sailed for both the Allied countries and Germany. Consequently, Åland shipping was not generally attacked as each side rarely knew which cargo was being carried to whom.|$|E
