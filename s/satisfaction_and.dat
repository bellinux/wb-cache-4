40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the role of {{switching}} costs in the relationship between <b>satisfaction,</b> trust, <b>and</b> commitment for a brand. Data analyzed in this study were collected via questionaires from real consumers (n= 457). Our research model emphasizes associations among switching costs, <b>satisfaction,</b> trust <b>and</b> commitment for a brand. Our study provides compelling evidence for future work to gain further insight into switching costs, <b>satisfaction,</b> trust, <b>and</b> commitment for a brand and includes several implications for management practice and future research. Switching costs have positively effect the relationships between <b>satisfaction,</b> trust <b>and</b> commitment for a brand. This empirical study provides a new approach to understand the effects of switching costs on the relationships between <b>satisfaction,</b> trust, <b>and</b> commitment for a brand...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{to promote}} {{environmentally}} appropriate behavior rely on motivation originating from 3 sources: other people, the environment, and one's self. This article examines a {{particular form of}} the latter source, intrinsic satisfactions. Nine studies are presented that investigate the multidimensional structure of intrinsic <b>satisfactions</b> <b>and</b> their relationship to reduced consumption behavior. Two categories of intrinsic <b>satisfaction,</b> labeled frugality <b>and</b> participation, are particularly well suited to encouraging such behavior. A third category, competence motivation, is explored in some detail and its dimensional structure is interpreted in terms of 3 dominant themes in the research literature. Connections between intrinsic <b>satisfactions</b> <b>and</b> such concepts as locus of control and altruism are explored, and implications for practitioners are discussed...|$|R

This paper seeks to develop a formal optimizing approach using functional estimates of the <b>satisfactions</b> <b>and</b> productivities and of the probabilities of job offers and acceptances.

40|$|Most {{adults with}} {{intellectual}} disabilities are cared for across their life-spans by their families. The processes that link long-term care-giving to the psychological functioning of family care-givers is unclear, as most research is cross-sectional, preventing {{the study of}} how care-giving demands, <b>satisfactions,</b> <b>and</b> coping strategy usage impact upon care-giver well-being. Objective: Examine the course of coping and the relationships of caregiving stressors <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> for carers of adults with an intellectual disability. Study group and methods: Four female carers were interviewed for five consecutive months, and questionnaire and interview data collected, to examine whether their appraisals of these variables changed over time. Results: Data revealed direct relationships between care-giving difficulties <b>and</b> <b>satisfactions,</b> as well as evidence that for some individuals there was development of competence in meeting the demands of care-giving as carers aged whereas for others, the demands of care-giving depleted their resources. Conclusion: These results suggest that cross-sectional studies may provide an incomplete picture and may overlook the cumulative impact of stressors, {{as well as the}} role of <b>satisfactions</b> <b>and</b> resources, upon care-givers’ well-being...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{seeks to}} examine the effects of {{workplace}} bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> with supervisor, <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with co-workers on affective commitment. Design/methodology/approach: A survey approach was used in this research. Partial least squares analyses on data from 142 full-time schoolteachers in China were used to determine whether workplace bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> with supervisor, <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with co-workers have unique effects on affective commitment. Findings: The paper reveals that workplace bullying has a significant negative correlation with affective commitment while <b>satisfaction</b> with supervisor <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with co-workers each have a significant positive correlation with affective commitment. Furthermore, workplace bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> with supervisor, <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with co-workers all have significant unique effects on affective commitment. Research limitations/implications: Limitations are the use of self-report and cross-sectional data. Future research could adopt samples from different industries, include multi-rater data, and a longitudinal research design. Various other workplace factors that may influence affective commitment could also be examined. Practical implications: The findings highlight the need for anti-bullying policies in organisations. Neither satisfaction with supervisor nor satisfaction with co-workers nullifies the negative effects of bullying on the target’s affective commitment. Preventing bullying is therefore fundamental to sustaining affective commitment. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature by providing an examination of the effects of workplace bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> with supervisor, <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with co-workers on affective commitment. To the authors’ knowledge, no workplace bullying research has been conducted previously in China...|$|R
