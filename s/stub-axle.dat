50|$|The {{coil springs}} usually bear {{on a pad}} {{alongside}} the <b>stub-axle.</b> Often the shock is colinear with the spring, to form a coilover. This location gives them a very high motion ratio compared with most suspensions, which improves their performance, and reduces their weight.|$|E
50|$|Braking was {{provided}} by a dual-circuit power assisted Lockheed and Girling system with 12-inch vented disks in front and 10-inch solid disk brakes in the rear. The rear brakes were mounted inboard and the front brakes were mounted to the <b>stub-axle</b> on the front upright, which brought {{them out of the}} wheels and into the air-stream for cooling.|$|E
50|$|The twist-beam rear {{suspension}} (also torsion-beam axle or deformable torsion beam) {{is a type}} of automobile suspension based on a large H or C shaped member. The front of the H attaches to the body via rubber bushings, and the rear of the H carries each <b>stub-axle</b> assembly, {{on each side of the}} car. The cross beam of the H holds the two trailing arms together, and provides the roll stiffness of the suspension, by twisting as the two trailing arms move vertically, relative to each other.|$|E
50|$|The fixed {{undercarriage}} had mainwheels with <b>stub-axles</b> on short, rigid duralumin tubes {{from the}} lower fuselage, giving a track of only 2.07 m. The tailskid was designed to double-up as a forward hook for transport as a trailer.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{frame is}} constructed of steel rolled formers. Ball <b>stub-axles</b> are mounted to strend girders, that make welded box construction. Power unit, {{composed of a}} diesel engine and main alternator, is mounted on parallel girders. The engine is connected to main alternator with an elastic clutch. Four traction motors (two on each bogie) are mounted with a tram system. Traction motors can be powered in series connection, parallel connection and parallel connection with field reduction of 40 to 60%.|$|R
40|$|Summary Accelerations {{produced}} at the <b>stub-axles</b> {{of a vehicle}} during passage over a road surface are a prominent source of vibrations of the vehicle. This memo describes the instrumentation of a motor car to record these accelerations, and the statistical analysis of records obtained, in terms of Amplitude Distribution, Power Spectral Density Function and Auto [...] correlation Function. Cross-correlation functions between some of the acceleration signals are included and their salient features discussed, together with {{the utility of the}} other statistical descriptions. Sugr 4 estions are made for laboratory work to increase the information to be gained from such measurements and the generality with which it can be applied...|$|R
50|$|The first {{practice}} day {{was primarily}} a duel between Jackie Stewart and the Ferrari of Chris Amon, with Stewart posting the day's best time of 1:04.27. Stewart was unable to defend his provisional pole during the second practice day due to a broken <b>stub-axle.</b> However, Graham Hill bumped Amon from the second spot, before Mario Andretti - driving at Watkins Glen {{for the first time}} - rewarded the partisan crowd by taking the pole in his Gold Leaf Lotus, 0.07 seconds under Stewart's time. This was Andretti's first ever Formula One start.|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{frame is}} constructed of steel rolled formers. Ball <b>stub-axles</b> are mounted to strend girders, that make welded box construction. A power unit, {{composed of a}} diesel engine and main generator, is mounted on parallel girders. The engine is connected to main generator with an elastic clutch. Four traction motors (two on each bogie) are mounted with a tram system. Traction motors can be powered in series connection, parallel connection and parallel connection with field reduction of 40 to 60%.Traction motors are series devices with [...] hour power. Main generator (PABOM-186a type) is a DC machine with 600 V and 367 A. Its power rating whilst working with 1500 rpm. is [...] During engine starting the main generator serves as electric starter, powered from the battery. For the purposes of lighting the locomotive and charging batteries an additional generator (Pw-114a type) is used.|$|R
