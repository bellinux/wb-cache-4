5000|$|The first {{hypodermic}} needle {{was first used}} by Dr. Alexander Wood and immediately {{efforts were made to}} improve the design. It was not until 1954, with the need for massive syringe distribution of Dr. Salk's polio vaccine, that the first disposable syringes were created. Initially made of glass, in 1961 plastic disposable syringes became available. [...] The advent of the first low dead space syringe occurred with the creation of 1-ml syringes designed specifically for the administration of insulin. Then amongst the scare of HIV and rising concern of other communicable diseases to healthcare workers the creation of safety syringes occurred in 1988. As of the last few years new designs have emerged that work on a needle that is low dead space and fits onto and transforms high dead space syringes into low dead space syringes. One design achieves this by creating a plunger that inserts itself into the syringe neck to expel as much fluid as possible from the <b>syringe</b> <b>body,</b> thus reducing the amount of space available within the neck.|$|E

40|$|A simple new {{technique}} {{to measure the}} effective dead space of the face mask with a water volumeter in infants M. G. Morris A simple {{new technique}} to measure the effective dead space of the face mask with a water volumeter in infants. M. G. Morris # ERS Journals Ltd 1999. ABSTRACT: Measuring the effective dead space (EDS) of a face mask has been difficult in infants and the appropriate volume being deducted from lung volume measurements has varied between laboratories. This study measured EDS in 16 infants (age range, 5 – 36 months) who have cystic fibrosis, undergoing lung volume measurement by N 2 washout. A thin plastic bladder, whose neck resided in the mask port, was shaped to fill a size 1 clear face mask. A water volumeter was made by inserting {{the body of a}} 20 mL plastic syringe into the neck of the bladder forming a tight seal with a snug fit against the inner surface of the mask port. The mask was placed on a horizontal surface and water was added until a level appeared in the <b>syringe</b> <b>body</b> (V 1). At end-inspiration, the mask was briefly placed on the mouth and nose of the sleeping infant, causing the water level to rise in the <b>syringe</b> <b>body</b> (V 2). The actual total dead space (V) of the mask when connected to the mouth port of the slide valve was 23 mL. EDS = V- (V 2 - V 1). Mean (95 % confidence interval (95 %CI)) EDS was 12. 4 (95 % CI 11. 2, 13. 6) mL. The smallest EDS was 8 mL since the connected ports (dead space, 8 mL) were unlikely to be penetrated by the infant’s nose or lips. EDS decreased with increasing body weight and height, but seemed to be influenced by individual facial features too. In conclusion, a reliable noninvasive volumetric technique for the routine measurement of the effective dead space in infants has been developed...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of solid}} dispersions to {{formulate}} poorly water soluble drugs {{is a growing}} field in the pharmaceutical sciences. Hot-melt extrusion is a common method for producing dispersions. However, bench-top extruders require large amounts of powder to run and are inappropriate for early formulation screens. Plastic and glass syringes are readily available in most laboratories. 250 mg of drug-polymer blend is placed in a plastic <b>syringe</b> <b>body</b> that has the tip covered with a bent needle. The syringe is heated for 5 minutes and the extrudate is pushed through the syringe. Extrudates are characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and powder x-ray diffraction. Acetaminophen, griseofulvin, indomethacin, salicylamide, and sulfamethoxazole extruded with polyvinylpyrrolidone K 12 match or exceed the performance of solvent evaporated controls. Glass syringes can be used when polymers have processing ranges above the melting point of the plastic syringes. Syringe extrusion is effectively demonstrated as a rapid process for early formulation screening...|$|E

40|$|Waste {{generation}} {{depends on}} numerous {{factors such as}} established waste management methods, type of hospital establishment, hospital specialization, proportion of reusable items employed in hospital, and proportion of patients treated on a day-care basis. This study surveyed the waste from hospital and clinics in Phitsanulok and found the average daily waste generated as general, medical and hazardous waste from all hospitals in Phitsanulok Province at 1. 751, 0. 284 and 0. 013 kg/bed respectively and at 0. 323, 0. 041 and 0. 002 kg/bed respectively from all clinics in Phitsanulok Province. Medical waste from all hospitals consisted of needles, gloves, drain tubes, cottons and gauze, napkins, plastic <b>syringes,</b> swap and <b>body</b> parts with total daily generation at 0. 452, 0. 480, 0. 390, 0. 404, 0. 018, 0. 355, 0. 004 and 0. 382 kg/bed respectively. Information about proper waste management process is needed to improve hospital waste management. Hospital waste management is an important and necessary component of environmental health protection...|$|R
40|$|Urethral {{insertion}} of foreign bodies {{is not very}} common. It {{is often associated with}} psychological problems and sexual alerts. In men due to the longer urethra this situation remains generally limited to the urethra, in women due to the short urethra foreign body can pass to the bladder. 	 40 years old, mentally retarded male patient was admitted to the emergency department with a complaint of urethrorrhagia. Physical examination revealed needle like structure in the urethra. The patient was taken into the operating room and under general anestesia by using cysto panendoscopy the foreign body has been identified as an old <b>syringe</b> needle, foreign <b>body</b> was removed with the help of forceps. Endoscopic methods should be utilized for the realization of the diagnosis and treatment of urethral foreign bodies. Foreign body in the urethra is usually encountered in patients with psychiatric disorders. 	For this reason, a detailed psychiatric evaluation is important in patients with urethral foreign bodies.
