40|$|Although {{physical}} strain {{has been}} reduced for many employees by improving workplace conditions, musculoskeletal disorders are still relevant in the working health system. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyse the effect of different <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> on the musculoskeletal system under real working conditions. This was accomplished by using measuring techniques to determine which construction characteristics of footwear could decrease physical strain on the worker. Three different types of <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> were tested at workplace by a total of 40 workers from the automotive industry. Measurements included both subjective comfort ratings and objective posture and plantar pressure distribution measurements, which were taken with the CUELA system for a collective of 20 subjects. The CUELA measurements showed significant differences in posture as well as in plantar pressure distribution. Wearing a simple <b>safety</b> <b>shoe</b> without ergonomic features led to an increase in trunk inclination, hip flexion and plantar pressure in comparison to wearing <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> with ergonomic components (i. e. cushioning). The objective measurements were correlated with the subjective comfort ratings. Based on a lack of comfort the simple <b>safety</b> <b>shoe</b> without any ergonomic features was rated worst. Up to now, the main preventive aspect of <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> has been the avoidance of injury in case of an industrial accident. This study could demonstrate an effect not only on plantar pressure but also on the posture by wearing different <b>safety</b> <b>shoes.</b> Therefore, <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> may be assumed to be a long-term preventive instrument for maintaining the health of the musculoskeletal system...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this pilot}} study was to {{determine}} how often <b>safety</b> <b>shoe</b> wearers developed problems of the locomotor system. Background: In many lines of work, employees need a well-functioning musculoskeletal system in order to do their job properly. Disorders of the locomotor system, especially in fields where employees do mainly physical work (and therefore relies heavily on their musculoskeletal system), remain an unsolved problem to this day. Back pain develops due to a number of factors. Risk factors at the workplace include standing or maintaining the same posture for long periods of time, lifting heavy objects, and vibration. There is no report in the literature on whether and to what extent <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> play a role here. Methods: The study group consisted of 218 employees (198 male, 20 female, age range 18 - 62 years) of a medium-sized printing shop who worked as printers, technical and maintenance crew, drivers or in production. All employees were required to wear <b>safety</b> <b>shoes.</b> The study was conducted as a cross-sectional questionnaire survey where employees were asked to give details regarding their person, the type of shoes worn, as well as any current and/or previous problems of the locomotor system. Data analysis was done in SPSS. Results: 86. 7 % of the study subjects wore <b>safety</b> <b>shoes.</b> Of these, 47. 1 % (n= 89) indicated problems with their shoes, mostly pinching, problems with the steel cap, poor ventilation and low quality. 63, 3 % (n= 138) of the employees complained about one or more problems with their musculoskeletal system. The commonest health problems were in the region of the spinal column (45 %, n= 98), the feet (44 %, n= 96), the knees (18. 8 %, n= 41) and the hip (6 %, n= 13). Of those employees who gave a reason for their problems (33. 5 %, n= 73), 58. 9 % (n= 43) believed that these were caused by their workplace, and 17. 8 % (n= 13) identified their shoes as part of the cause...|$|R

Therefore, the fire fighter's shoes may be only controllable origins of STFs injuries. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine if there is significant variation of slip resistance when the shoes are consecutively rubbed onto the rough steel plates (worn state). Four different brands of firefighter's shoes, all sold specifically for firefighters, and one type of <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> were tested. The firefighter's <b>shoes</b> and <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> were tested under two different wear states. The test devices used in this study were the surface roughness checker and AVIT, which was newly developed by KOSHA. The grinded outsole shows lesser COF value than fresh ones and change of COFs value also lesser than fresh ones. The maximum difference of Ra for each shoe was 0. 24 μm. The maximum difference of Rz for each shoe was 2. 79 μm. After the tests, the roughness Rz for fresh and grinded outsoles was varied respectively. Each shoes showed different trend with the number of trials, irrespective of the wear states of shoes. Of the new shoes, the boot “B 2 ” showed the highest COF and the <b>safety</b> <b>shoe</b> shows the lowest COF value among the tested footwear. Of the grinded shoes, the rank order of mean COF value calculated from two test results showed that boots “B 2 ” and “B 3 ” had a better slip resistance value than the others...|$|R

30|$|PU soles are a {{combination}} of polyol with isocyanate, although, for production {{it may also be}} necessary to apply additives, in particular catalysts and pigments. After mixing these substances, a reaction occurs which enables synthesis of the polyurethane compound. This mixture is made and then immediately subjected to injection moulding, allowing to mould a sole in the desired shape. This type of sole is characterized by its durability, high resistance to wear, light weight, abrasion-resistance, ease to pigment, good thermal insulation, good flexibility at low temperatures and excellent resistance to oils. As a thermosetting material it does not soften when exposed to heat. All these ualities allow the manufacture of good quality shoes [3].
