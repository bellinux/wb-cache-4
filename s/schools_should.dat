5|$|Maeser {{believed}} that religion {{played a key}} role in true education. He viewed each student as a child of God that had an individual capacity and potential. He thought that all <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> adhere to some religious aspect. He also argued that public high <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> be supplemented by religion classes. Maeser, however, was respectful of other religious denominations although Brigham Young Academy and Brigham Young University integrated beliefs from the LDS Church.|$|E
5|$|Before {{teaching}} at the Academy, Maeser taught at several different schools in Germany and in Utah. He tutored Brigham Young's children. Maeser incorporated the Monitorial System into his teaching philosophies and believed that students should each have responsibilities. Maeser was influenced by Pestalozzian educational theory, but also advocated that <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> include religion.|$|E
5|$|Fifty-eight bills {{about school}} {{desegregation}} were filed for consideration by the Virginia Assembly. The administration immediately entered into negotiations {{to amend the}} Stanley plan to allow parents to sue a school district to force it to accept state funds (and resegregate). The Boothe-Dalton and McCue plans were also filed. Backers of the Gray Commission plan filed 14 bills to implement the Commission's proposals, but the Gray plan's supporters said they would abandon their pupil assignment plan {{in favor of the}} Mann-Fenwick pupil assignment plan. Delegate C.W. Cleaton introduced a bill to prohibit school districts from raising private money to operate integrated schools, Senator Eugene Snydor introduced a bill to allow residents to vote on whether integrated <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> be closed and whether closed <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> be reopened as segregated, and Delegate Griffith Purcell introduced a bill to require a statewide referendum in November 1956 on whether school segregation should be state policy.|$|E

25|$|The {{debate about}} Sidis' manner of {{upbringing}} occurred {{within a larger}} discourse about {{the best way to}} educate children. Newspapers criticized Boris Sidis' child-rearing methods. Most educators of the day believed that <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> expose children to common experiences to create good citizens.

25|$|In her book, Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide, Susan K. Johnsen (2004) {{writes that}} <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> {{use a variety}} of {{measures}} of students' capability and potential when identifying gifted children. These measures may include portfolios of student work, classroom observations, achievement measures, and intelligence scores. Most educational professionals accept that no single measure can be used in isolation to accurately identify every gifted child.|$|E
25|$|The first {{full-time}} {{units of}} the Canadian militia, A and B Batteries at Kingston and Quebec, organized gunnery schools on a year-round basis in which artillery courses lasted from 3–12 months {{with the possibility of}} extension. Colonel P Robertson-Ross, adjutant general of the militia (1870–3) recommended the schools be organized as tactical brigades of three arms and that infantry and cavalry <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> also be put on a permanent basis. The Canadian government did not accept his advice.|$|E

In June 2006, Yudhoyono launched Books BOS which provides funds for the purchase of textbooks.|$|E

Wick was lost at sea, Youngstown's municipal government declared that all local factories, businesses, and <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> observe {{five minutes of}} silence at 11 a.m. on April 24, 1912, to honor the industrialist's memory. Meanwhile, the Wick family's pew at the city's First Presbyterian Church was roped off, and flags throughout the community were flown at half mast. A memorial monument was later erected for Wick at Youngstown's Oak Hill Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Senior High School will {{be offered}} free in public schools {{and there will be}} a voucher program in place for public junior high school completers as well as ESC {{beneficiaries}} of private high <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> they choose to take Senior High School in private institutions.

All grade 10 completers from a public Junior High School who wish to enroll in a private or non-DepEd Senior High School automatically get a voucher.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} presidency, Jefferson {{continued}} to be active in public affairs. He also became increasingly concerned with founding a new institution of higher learning, specifically one free of church influences, where students could specialize in many new areas not offered at other universities. Jefferson believed educating people {{was a good way}} to establish an organized society, and also felt <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> be paid for by the general public, so less wealthy people could obtain student membership as well. A letter to Joseph Priestley, in January, 1800, indicated that he had been planning the University for decades before its establishment.|$|E

25|$|Straw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education {{spokesman}} from 1987. In this role, {{he called}} on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right {{to opt out of}} the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.|$|E
25|$|Wesley himself opened {{schools at}} The Foundery in London, and Kingswood School. A Wesleyan report in 1832 {{said that for}} the church to prosper the system of Sunday <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> be {{augmented}} by day-schools with educated teachers. It was proposed in 1843 that 700 new day-schools be established within seven years. Though a steady increase was achieved, that ambitious target could not be reached, in part limited by the number of suitably qualified teachers. Most teachers came from one institution in Glasgow. The Wesleyan Education Report for 1844 called for a permanent Wesleyan teacher-training college. The result was the foundation of Westminster Training College at Horseferry Road, Westminster in 1851.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, those {{entering}} polytechnics or {{nursing and}} health technologies <b>schools,</b> <b>should</b> have some previous vocational training and preference {{will be given}} to applicants from the catchment area of the institution concerned. From the academic year 2005/2006 onwards, access rules have enforced minimum grades of 95 (out of 200) in the national access examinations for all candidates in every sector of public higher education. In practical terms, and unlike what happened in the past, the new rule meant the exclusion {{of a large number of}} applicants who otherwise would have been admitted with negative grades to the less selective courses of some public institutions, and consequently lead to a number of available places for students left vacant every year in many courses.|$|E

However, the Office of The Schools Adjudicator published its decision on March 14, 2003 that the <b>school</b> <b>should</b> be discontinued by August 31, 2004.|$|R
