40|$|The text {{focuses on}} the issues of the {{development}} and changes within scientific disciplines, in particular social sciences and special education as one of their areas. The author locates his reasoning in reference to the idea of scientific development and the concept of paradigmatic change of Thomas Kuhn, especially revealing the notion of hermeneutic disparity, which metaphorically means the lack of a common language of researchers originating from different (opposite) paradigms. Applying hermeneutic disparity in his discussion, the author <b>seeks</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> questions formulated either to the essence and quality of pedagogy as a science or to the ways it is practiced and conditioned by a researcher’s paradigmatic and methodological orientation. 337181 Studia Edukacyjn...|$|E

We applied GIS and ESDA instruments, including geographically weighted regression, which allowed us to identify the variability of regression coefficients in the geographical space. Our research indicated socio-economic factors (among others: poviats budget income, feminisation rate, unemployment rate), which, with varying force and in varying directions, affected the studied variable in specific parts of the country. The analyses were performed on the basis of statistical data on the numbers of de-registrations for residence abroad in Poland’s NUTS- 4 in three economic age groups (pre-working, working, and post-working age) for the time span from 2005 to 2013...|$|E

The theology of John Wesley had a tremendous impact on social, political and economic areas of the Eighteenth century England. It was in many ways a revolutionary theology.

With a framework of institution theory, we focused on CSR strategies that can be selected by different forms of business organizations (incumbent, start-ups, and foreign firms) in the longitudinal process. We argued that in the early phase of institutional transition, CSR relevant institutions are still in vacuum leaving social responsibilities to the firms ’ discretion. However as the market moves to more rule-based, CSR institutional pressures are also strengthened in regulative, normative and cognitive ways. Then, we draw our propositions on CSR strategic choices for incumbent, start-ups and foreign firms, respectively. By doing so, this study expanded understanding of strategic perspectives of CSR literature in academic for policy makers of emerging countries as well as practitioners of the different forms of business organizations...|$|E
