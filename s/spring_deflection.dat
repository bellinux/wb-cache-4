5000|$|Classical Brookfield viscometers {{employ the}} {{principle}} of rotational viscometry - the torque required to turn an object, such as a spindle, in a fluid indicates the viscosity of the fluid. Torque is applied through a calibrated spring to a disk or bob spindle immersed in test fluid and the <b>spring</b> <b>deflection</b> measures the viscous drag of the fluid against the spindle. [...] The amount of viscous drag {{is proportional to the}} amount of torque required to rotate the spindle, and thus to the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid. [...] In the case of non-Newtonian fluids, Brookfield viscosities measured under the same conditions (model, spindle, speed, temperature, time of test, container, and any other sample preparation procedures that may affect the behavior of the fluid) can be compared. When developing a new test method, trial and error is often necessary {{in order to determine the}} proper spindle and speeds. Successful test methods will deliver a % torque reading between 10 and 100. The rheological behavior of the test fluid can be observed using the same spindle at different speeds, but because the geometry of the fluid around a rotating bob or disk spindle in a large container does not allow a single shear rate to be assigned, proper rheometry is not feasible using this setup.|$|E
30|$|The most {{important}} property of a polymer {{is its ability}} to increase the solution’s viscosity. The polymer solution exhibits non-Newtonian behavior, and its viscosity {{is a function of the}} shear rate. The viscosity of these polymer solutions was measured using a DV-III Ultra + Brookfield rheometer. The principle of operation of the DV-III Ultra is to drive a spindle (which is immersed in the test fluid) through a calibrated spring. The viscous drag of the fluid against the spindle is measured by the <b>spring</b> <b>deflection.</b> <b>Spring</b> <b>deflection</b> is measured with a rotary transducer. The viscosity measurement range of the DV-III Ultra (in centipoise) is determined by the rotational speed of the spindle, the size and shape of the spindle, the container the spindle is rotating in, and the full-scale torque of the calibrated spring. In each measurement, the shear rate was changed, and the effect of this change on the viscosity was measured.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} design and initial results of a power-autonomous planar monopedal robot. The robot is a {{gasoline}} powered, two degree of freedom robot that runs in a circle, constrained by a boom. The robot uses hydraulic Series Elastic Actuators, force-controllable actuators which provide high force fidelity, moderate bandwidth, and low impedance. The actuators are mounted {{in the body of}} the robot, with cable drives transmitting power to the hip and knee joints of the leg. A two-stroke, gasoline engine drives a constant displacement pump which pressurizes an accumulator. Absolute position and <b>spring</b> <b>deflection</b> of each of the Series Elastic Actuators are measured using linear encoders. The <b>spring</b> <b>deflection</b> is translated into force output and compared to desired force in a closed loop force-control algorithm implemented in software. The output signal of each force controller drives high performance servo valves which control flow to each of the pistons of the actuators. In designing the robot, we used a simulation-based iterative design approach. Preliminary estimates of the robot’s physical parameters were based on past experience and used to create a physically realistic simulation model of the robot. Next, a control algorithm was implemented in simulation to produce planar hopping. Using the joint power requirements and range of motions from simulation, we worked backward specifying pulley diameter, piston diameter and stroke, hydraulic pressure and flow, servo valve flow and bandwidth, gear pump flow, and engine powe...|$|E
5000|$|The pointer shaft is held toward zero by a fine torsion spring. The torque on the cup {{increases}} {{with the speed}} of rotation of the magnet. Thus an increase in the speed of the car will twist the cup and speedometer pointer against the spring.

Given the torque on the cup is proportional to the car's speed, and the <b>spring's</b> <b>deflection</b> is proportional to the torque, the angle of the pointer is also proportional to the speed, so that equally spaced markers on the dial can be used for gaps in speed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a novel Passive Variable Stiffness Joint (pVSJ). pVSJ is the proof of concept of a passive revolute joint with controllable variable stiffness. The current design {{is intended to be}} a bench-test for future development towards applications in haptic teleoperation purposed exoskeletons. The main feature of the pVSJ is its capability of varying the stiffness with infinite range based on a simple mechanical system. Moreover, the joint can rotate freely at the zero stiffness case without any limitation. The stiffness varying mechanism consists of two torsional springs, mounted with an offset from the pVSJ rotation center and coupled with the joint shaft by an idle roller. The position of the roller between the pVSJ rotation center and the spring's center is controlled by a linear sliding actuator fitted on the chassis of the joint. The variation of the output stiffness is obtained by changing the distance from the roller-springs contact point to the joint rotation center (effective arm). If this effective arm is null, the stiffness of the joint will be zero. The stiffness increases to reach high stiffness values when the effective arm approaches its maximum value, bringing the roller close to the torsional springs' center. The experimental results matched with the physical-based modeling of the pVSJ in terms of stiffness variation curve, stiffness dependency upon the springs' elasticity, joint <b>deflection</b> and the <b>spring's</b> <b>deflection...</b>|$|R

50|$|Moving iron {{ammeters}} use a {{piece of}} iron which moves when acted upon by the electromagnetic force of a fixed coil of wire. The moving-iron meter was invented by Austrian engineer Friedrich Drexler in 1884. This type of meter responds to both direct and alternating currents (as opposed to the moving-coil ammeter, which works on direct current only). The iron element consists of a moving vane attached to a pointer, and a fixed vane, surrounded by a coil. As alternating or direct current flows through the coil and induces a magnetic field in both vanes, the vanes repel {{each other and the}} moving vane deflects against the restoring force provided by fine helical <b>springs.</b> The <b>deflection</b> of a moving iron meter is proportional to the square of the current. Consequently, such meters would normally have a non linear scale, but the iron parts are usually modified in shape to make the scale fairly linear over most of its range. Moving iron instruments indicate the RMS value of any AC waveform applied. Moving iron ammeters are commonly used to measure current in industrial frequency AC circuits.|$|R
