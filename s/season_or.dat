5|$|Frigatebirds {{typically}} breed on remote oceanic islands, {{generally in}} colonies {{of up to}} 5000 birds. Within these colonies, they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 (or rarely 100) individuals. Breeding can occur {{at any time of}} year, often prompted by commencement of the dry <b>season</b> <b>or</b> plentiful food.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that {{the storm was}} either {{too early in the}} <b>season</b> <b>or</b> not damaging enough to dedicate a significant portion of disaster funds. Consequently, disagreements between prospective donors about the extent of emergency response resulted in delayed intervention. Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{developed}} patents for {{genetically modified}} soybeans that were resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides. When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the glyphosate herbicide Roundup, the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants (weeds) would be killed.

50|$|Diapause in {{the tropics}} is often {{initiated}} in response to biotic rather than abiotic components.

Also, diapause may serve to synchronize mating <b>seasons</b> <b>or</b> reduce competition, rather than to avoid unfavourable climatic conditions.|$|R

5|$|The Games column lists {{regular season}} totals and {{excludes}} post-season play.

5|$|As {{with many}} English gardens, {{this one is}} at its best in May and June, when the magnolias are in bloom and luxurious plants, such as peonies and alliums, are flowering.

There are now many species and colours of lavender and plenty of agapanthus, crinum, nerines and day lilies, together with such rarities as a Heptacodium and an Arbutus menziesii.|$|E

5|$|Before the season, Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri {{remarked that}} Del Piero would have {{as good a}} <b>season,</b> <b>or</b> an even better one, than the {{previous}} term. In August 2008, Del Piero {{announced that he would}} try to keep playing professional football with Juventus until he turned 40. Juventus were drawn into the same Champions League group as Real Madrid, and UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg. Del Piero marked Juventus's return to the competition with a match-winning free kick to seal a home win against Zenit. On 21 October, Del Piero netted a notable goal as Juventus defeated Real Madrid 2â€“1 in Turin, scoring with a first-time, curling strike from distance, in the fifth minute of play.|$|E
5|$|Billie Jenkins is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{who appeared in}} the American television supernatural drama Charmed, which aired on the WB Television Network (The WB) from 1998 to 2006. The character was created by executive producer Brad Kern and was portrayed by Kaley Cuoco. Billie was developed in response to The WB's request for a new character, and was originally intended to expand the show {{in a new direction}} for a possible ninth <b>season</b> <b>or</b> a spin-off series. The opinions of media outlets were divided on whether she should return for a Charmed reboot or a cast reunion.|$|E
5|$|In the Islanders' inaugural season, three goaltenders {{played for}} the team: Billy Smith, Gerry Desjardins and Gerry Gray. Since then, 40 others have played {{in at least one}} regular <b>season</b> <b>or</b> playoff game. Smith stayed with the Islanders through 1989 and played in 675 regular season games and 132 playoff games, the most in the team's history. Additionally, he holds the records for most overall wins, with 304. Chico Resch has {{recorded}} the most shutouts with 25. Only fourteen have played in Islanders playoff games and of those, three have been on the roster during a Stanley Cup victory.|$|E

5|$|Male blue {{wildebeest}} become {{sexually mature}} at {{about two years}} of age while females can conceive at sixteen months if adequately nourished. Nevertheless, most females do not start to breed until a year later. The mating season, which lasts for about three weeks, coincides {{with the end of}} the rainy season. This means that the animals are in good condition, having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass growth, and the conception rate is often as high as 95%. The mating <b>season,</b> <b>or</b> rut, typically begins on the night of a full moon, suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding. At this time, testosterone production peaks in males, resulting in increased calling and territorial behaviour. The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into estrus.|$|E
5|$|Some affiliative {{behaviors}} are seasonal or gender-specific, {{such as the}} male squeal approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season. Another example is the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their anogenital scent glands to mark each other's backs, jump over one another, writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during {{the end of the}} cool, dry <b>season</b> <b>or</b> around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age allogroom, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play more frequently than adults.|$|E
5|$|The New York Islanders are a {{professional}} ice hockey team based in Brooklyn, New York, United States. They {{are members of}} the Metropolitan Division of the National Hockey League's (NHL) Eastern Conference. The Islanders franchise {{has been a part of}} the NHL since their inception in 1972, formerly playing their home games at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The Islanders now play at the Barclays Center. Nearly 500 players have played for the team for at least one regular <b>season</b> <b>or</b> playoff game, and nearly 20 have had multiple stints over the years.|$|E
