This paper presents a complete decomposition analysis of overall SEC ({{specific energy}} consumption) in China’s cement industry {{for the period}} 1990 - 2010 divided into four equal time intervals. The complete decomposition method developed by Sun is {{used to analyze the}} nature of three factors: clinker share, process structure and kiln efficiency. However, to consider the overall specific energy consumption, we also consider the impact of ancillary process. The results show that all of the four factors drive overall SEC down in the entire period, while only the factor of clinker <b>share</b> <b>drive</b> overall SEC up during the period 1995 - 2000. Moreover, based on the analysis of decomposition results, the technological improvement and structural adjustment would result in major potential for the reduction of overall SEC in the future...|$|E
40|$|Imagine a {{situation}} in which you are sent dozens of new data files, by a varying number of users, which must be processed on a daily basis. Perhaps the users are at other locations and are FTP-ing the data files to a designated “data directory. ” Perhaps the users are within your organization and are writing the data files from other operating systems to a data directory allocated via a Samba <b>share</b> <b>drive.</b> Perhaps the users are all on a shared server within your organization and are writing new data files to a data directory on the same system. Whatever the case, this scenario usually generates a lot of maintenance to the SAS program that processes the data files. When new users are added, you must modify your program to allocate and process their specific files. When users are removed, you must modify your program so that it does not attempt to allocate and process their data files. And, when a given file is not present for one reason or another, you must add logic so that your program does not abend. This paper presents a methodology of automatically processing a varying number of new data files from a data directory. The paper presents three straightforward SAS programs that make the process simple and error-free. After reading this paper, {{you should be able to}} tailor the three SAS programs to process data files in your own organization...|$|E
