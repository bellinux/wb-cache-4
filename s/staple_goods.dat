5|$|Commoners are {{estimated}} to have comprised over 90% of the population, but relatively {{little is known about}} them. Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials, and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record. Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms, and these can be identified, but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not. Such low-status dwellings can only be detected by extensive remote-sensing surveys of apparently empty terrain. The range of commoners was broad; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth, and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions. Commoners engaged in essential production activities, including that of products destined for use by the elite, such as cotton and cacao, as well as subsistence crops for their own use, and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools. Commoners took part in warfare, and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors. Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of <b>staple</b> <b>goods</b> such as maize flour and game. It is likely that hard-working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society.|$|E

Large numbers of Cornish families emigrated to mining districts in other countries {{and other parts of}} the United Kingdom; in some former mining districts as much as [...] of the young people moved out in the 20 years following the closure of the local mines. Between 1861 and 1900 at least 35% of Cornish women aged 15–24 moved to other parts of the UK, and over 26% left the country altogether. Although the male emigrants generally found work in mines in their new places of settlement, or put their mining skills to use digging tunnels for the rapidly growing railway networks, the jobs traditionally done by bal maidens, where they still existed, [...] were usually done by locally recruited men or boys, and the tradition of female Cornish mine labour died out in emigrant families.|$|E

6000|$|Besides what I {{said of the}} Four Last Things, And of the weal and woe {{that from}} them springs; An after-word still runneth in my mind, Which I shall here expose unto that wind That may it blow into that very hand That needs it. Also {{that it may be}} scann'd With {{greatest}} soberness, shall be my prayer, As well as diligence and godly care; So to present it unto public view, That only truth and peace may thence ensue. [...] My talk shall be of that amazing love Of God we read of; which, that it may prove, By its engaging arguments to save Thee, I shall lay out that poor help I have Thee to entice; that thou wouldst dearly fall In love with thy salvation, and with all That doth thereto concur, that thou mayst be As blessed as the Blessed can make thee, Not only here but in the world to come, In bliss, which, I pray God, may be thy home. [...] But first, I would advise thee to bethink Thyself, how sin hath laid thee at the brink Of hell, where thou art lulled fast asleep In Satan's arms, who also will thee keep As senseless and secure as e'er he may, Lest thou shouldst wake, and see't, and run away Unto that Jesus, whom the Father sent Into the world, for this cause and intent, That such as thou, from such a thrall as this Might'st be released, and made heir of bliss. Now that thou may'st awake, the danger fly, And so escape the death that others die, Come, let me set my trumpet to thine ear, Be willing all my message for to hear: 'Tis for thy life, O do it not refuse; Wo unto them good counsel do abuse. Thou art at present in that very case, Which argues thou art destitute of grace: For he that lies where sin hath laid him, lies Under the curse, graceless, and so he dies In body and in soul, within that range, If God his heart in mercy doth not change Before he goes the way of all the earth, Before he lose his spirit and his breath. Repentance there is none within the grave, Nor Christ, nor grace, nor mercies for to save Thee from the vengeance due unto thy sin, If now thou dost not truly close with him. [...] Thou art like him that sleepeth in the sea On broken boards, which, without guide or stay, Are driven whither winds and water will; While greedy beasts do wait to have their fill By feeding on his carcass, when he shall Turn overboard, and without mercy fall Into the jaws of such as make a prey Of those whom justice drowneth in the sea. [...] Thou art like him that snoring still doth lie Upon the bed of vain security, Whilst all about him into burning flame By fire is turned; yea, and while the frame And building where he lies consuming is, And while himself these burnings cannot miss. [...] Thou art like one that hangeth by a thread Over the mouth of hell, as one half-dead; And O, how soon this thread may broken be, Or cut by death, is yet unknown to thee! But sure it is, if all the weight of sin, And all that Satan, too, hath doing been, Or yet can do, can break this crazy thread, 'Twill not be long before, among the dead, Thou tumble do, as linked fast in chains, With them to wait in fear for future pains. [...] What shall I say? Wilt thou not yet awake? Nor yet of thy poor soul some pity take? Among the lions it hood-winked lies; O, that the Lord would open once thine eyes That thou might'st see it, then I dare say thou, As half-bereft of wits, wouldst cry out, How Shall I escape? Lord help, O! help with speed, Reach down thy hand from heav'n, for help I need, To save me from the lions, for I fear This soul of mine they will in pieces tear. [...] Come, then, and let us both expostulate The case betwixt us, till we animate And kindle in our hearts that burning love To Christ, to grace, to life, that we may move Swifter than eagles to this blessed prey; Then shall it be well with us in that day The trump shall sound, the dead made rise, and stand, Then to receive, for breach of God's command, Such thunder-claps as these, Depart from me Into hell-fire, you that the wicked be, Prepared for the devil, and for those That with him and his angels rather chose To live in filthy sin and wickedness, Whose fruit is everlasting bitterness. [...] We both are yet {{on this side of the}} grave, We also gospel-privileges have; The word, and time to pray; God give us hearts, That, like the wise man, we may act our parts, To get the pearl of price; then we shall be Like godly Mary, Peter, Paul, and we Like Jacob, too, the blessing shall obtain; While Esau rides a-hunting for the gain Of worldly pelf, which will him not avail When death or judgment shall him sore assail. [...] Now, to encourage us for to begin, Let us believe the kingdom we may win, And be possess'd thereof, if we the way Shall hit into, and then let nothing stay Or hinder us; the crown is at the end, Let's run and strive, and fly, and let's contend With greatest courage it for to obtain; 'Tis life, and peace, and everlasting gain. The gate of life, the new and living way, The promise holdeth open all the day, Which thou by Jacob's ladder must ascend, Where angels always wait, and do attend As ministers, to minister for those That do with God, and Christ, and glory close. [...] If guilt of sin still lieth at our door, Us to discourage, let us set before Our eyes a bleeding Jesus, who did die The death, and let's believe the reason why He did it, was that we might ever be From death and sin, from hell and wrath set free. Yea, let's remember for that very end It was his blessed Father did him send; That he the law of God might here fulfil, That so the mystery of his blessed will Might be revealed in the blessedness Of those that fly to Christ for righteousness. [...] Now let us argue with ourselves, then, thus That Jesus Christ our Lord came to save us, By bearing of our sins upon his back, By hanging on the cross as on a rack, While justice cut him off on every side, While smiles Divine themselves from him did hide, While earth did quake, and rocks in pieces rent, And while the sun, as veiled, did lament To see the innocent and harmless die So sore a death, so full of misery. [...] Yea, let us turn again, and say, All this He did and suffered for love of his. He brought in everlasting righteousness, That he might cover all our nakedness; He wept and wash'd his face with brinish tears That we might saved be from hellish fears; Blood was his sweat, too, in his agony, That we might live in joyful ecstasy; He apprehended was and led away, That grace to us-ward never might decay. With swords, and bills, and outrage in the night, That to the peace of heav'n we might have right. Condemned he was between two thieves to die, That we might ever in his bosom lie; Scourged with whips his precious body were, That we lashes of conscience might not fear; His head was crowned with thorns, that we might be Crowned with glory and felicity; He hanged was upon a cursed tree, That we delivered from death might be; His Father from him hides his smiles and face, That we might have them in the heavenly place; He cry'd, My God, why hast forsaken me? That we forsaken of him might not be. Into his side was thrust a bloody spear, That we the sting of death might never fear; He went into the grave after all this, That we might up to heav'n go, and have bliss. Yea, rise again he did out of the earth, And shook off from him all the chains of death; Then at his chariot wheels he captive led His foes, and trod upon the serpent's head; Riding in triumph to his Father's throne, There to possess the kingdom as his own. What say'st thou, wilt not yet unto him come? His arms are open, in his heart is room To lay thee; be not then discouraged, Although thy sins be many, great, and red; Unto thee righteousness he will impute, And with the kisses of his mouth salute Thy drooping soul, and will it so uphold, As that thy shaking conscience shall be bold To come to mercy's seat with great access, There to expostulate with that justice That burns like fiery flames against all those That do not with this blessed Jesus close; Which unto thee will do no harm, but good, Because thou hast reliance on that blood That justice saith hath given him content, For all that do unfeignedly repent Their ill-spent life, and roll upon free grace, That they within that bosom might have place, That open is to such, where they shall lie In ease, and gladness, and felicity, World without end, according to that state I have, nay, better than I, can relate. [...] If thou shalt still object, thou yet art vile, And hast a heart that will not reconcile Unto the holy law, but will rebel, Hark yet to what I shall thee farther tell. Two things are yet behind that help thee will, If God should put into thy mind that skill, So to improve them as becometh those That would with mercy and forgiveness close. First, then, let this sink down into thy heart, That Christ is not a Saviour in part, But every way so fully he is made That all of those that underneath his shade And wing would sit, and shroud their weary soul, That even Moses dare it not control, But justify it, approve of 't, and conclude No man nor angel must himself intrude With such doctrine that may oppose the same, On pain of blaspheming that holy name, Which God himself hath given unto men, To stay, to trust, to lean themselves on, when They feel themselves assaulted, and made fear Their sin will not let them in life appear. For as God made him perfect righteousness, That he his love might to the height express, And us present complete before the throne; Sanctification, too, of his own He hath prepared, in which do we stand, Complete in holiness, at his right hand. Now this sanctification is not That holiness which is in us, but that Which in the person of this Jesus is, And can inherently be only his. But is imputed to us for our good. As is his active righteousness and blood; Which is the cause, though we infirm are found, That mercy and forgiveness doth abound To us-ward, and that why we are not shent[16] And empty, and away rebuked sent, Because that all we do imperfect is. Bless God, then, for this holiness of his, And learn to look by faith on that alone, When thou seest thou hast nothing of thine own; Yea, when thy heart most willing is to do What God by his good word doth call thee to; And when thou find'st most holiness within, And greatest power over every sin, Yet then to Jesus look, and thou shalt see In him sanctification for thee, Far more complete than all that thou canst find In the most upright heart and willing mind, That ever man or angels did possess, When most filled with inherent righteousness. Besides, if thou forgettest here to live, And Satan get thee once into his sieve, He will so hide thy wheat, and show thy brun[17] That thou wilt quickly cry, I am undone. Alas, thy goodliest attainments here, Though like the fairest blossoms they appear, How quickly will they lour and decay, And be as if they all were fled away, When once the east-wind of temptations beat Upon thee, with their dry and blasting heat! Rich men will not account their treasure lies In crack'd groats and four-pence half-pennies,[18] But in those bags they have within their chests, In <b>staple</b> <b>goods,</b> which shall within their breasts Have place accordingly, because they see Their substance lieth here. But if that be But shaken, then they quickly fear, and cry, Alas, 'tis not this small and odd money, We carry in our pockets for to spend, Will make us rich, or much will stand our friend. If famine or if want do us assail, How quickly will these little pieces fail! [...] If thou be wise, consider what I say And look for all in Christ, where no decay Is like to be; then though thy present frame Be much in up-and-down, yet he the same Abideth, yea, and still at God's right hand, As thy most perfect holiness will stand. It is, I say, not like to that in thee, Now high, then low, now out, then in, but he Most perfect is, when thou art at the worst The same, the very same; I said at first, This helpeth much when thou art buffeted, And when thy graces lie in thee as dead; Then to believe they are all perfect still In Christ thy head, who hath that blessed skill, Yet to present thee by what is in him Unto his Father, one that hath no sin. Yea, this will fill thy mouth with argument Against the tempter, when he shall present Before thee all thy weakness, and shall hide From thee thy graces, that thou mayst abide Under the fretting fumes of unbelief, Which never yielded Christian man relief. Nor help thyself thou mayst against him thus: O Satan, though my heart indeed be worse Than 'twas a while ago, yet I perceive Thou shalt me not of happiness bereave, Nor yet of holiness; for by the Word I find that Jesus Christ, our blessed Lord, Is made sanctification for me In his own person, where all graces be, As water in the fountain; and that I, By means of that, have yet a sanctity, Both personal and perfect every way; And that is Christ himself, as Paul doth say. Now, though my crazy pitcher oft doth leak, By means of which my graces are so weak, And so much spent, that one I cannot find Able to stay or help my feeble mind; Yet then I look to Jesus, and see all In him that wanting is in me, and shall Again take courage, and believe he will Present me upright in his person, till He humble me for all my foolishness, And then again fill me with holiness. Now, if thou lovest inward sanctity, As all the saints do most unfeignedly, Then add, to what I have already said, Faith in the promise; and be not afraid To urge it often at the throne of grace, And to expect it in its time and place. Then he that true is, and that cannot lie, Will give it unto thee, that thou thereby Mayst serve with faith, with fear, in truth and love, That God that did at first thy spirit move To ask it to his praise, that he might be Thy God, and that he might delight in thee. If I should here particulars relate, Methinks it could not but much animate Thy heart, though very listless to inquire How thou mayst that enjoy, which all desire That love themselves and future happiness; But O, I cannot fully it express: The promise is so open and so free, In all respects, to those that humble be, That want they cannot what for them is good; But there 'tis, and confirmed is with blood, A certain sign, all those enjoy it may, That see they want it, and sincerely pray To God the Father, in that Jesus' name Who bled on purpose to confirm the same.|$|E

Though set up as part of President Nkrumah’s development plan for Ghana, the current rationale for these processors typically is that they could be a solution to the perennial “gluts” in the tomato sector. And indeed processing to reduce gluts remains a popular refrain in the media and in government pronouncements. However, since they were opened, the processors have run considerably under capacity, if at all. Over the past two decades processing has all but stopped; yields and production of fresh tomato in Ghana have stagnated and possibly fallen; while in parallel, imports of fresh tomato from Burkina Faso and tomato paste from the EU and China have increased dramatically. There are limited time-series or recent data on yields, areas, or overall production of tomato.

40|$|Self-rated {{health is}} {{demonstrated}} to vary substantially by both personal socio-economic status and national economic conditions. However, studies investigating the combined influence {{of individual and}} country level economic indicators across several countries {{in the context of}} recent global recession are limited. This paper furthers our knowledge of the effect of recession on health at both the individual and national level. Using the Life in Transition II study, which provides data from 19, 759 individuals across 26 European nations, we examine the relationship between self-rated health, personal economic experiences, and macro-economic change. Data analyses include, but are not limited to, the partial proportional odds model which permits the effect of predictors to vary across different levels of our dependent variable. Household experiences with recession, especially a loss of <b>staple</b> <b>good</b> consumption, are associated with lower self-rated health. Most individual-level experiences with recession, such as a job loss, have relatively small negative effects on perceived health; the effect of individual or household economic hardship is strongest in high income nations. Our findings also suggest that macroeconomic growth improves self-rated health in low-income nations but has no effect in high-income nations. Individuals with the greatest probability of "good" self-rated health reside in wealthy countries ($ 23, 910 to $ 50, 870 GNI per capita). Both individual and national economic variables are predictive of self-rated health. Personal and household experiences are most consequential for self-rated health in high income nations, while macroeconomic growth is most consequential in low-income nations...|$|R

40|$|Identifying growth {{poles in}} the SSA region, {{strengthening}} linkages and generating mutual benefits across African countries {{is an important}} part of the strategy to promote agriculture-led growth at the Africa-wide scale. Using agricultural trade data, this study focuses on identifying major countries that play important roles in regional agricultural trade and commodities in which African countries have a comparative advantage and where there is potential for more trade within the region. There are 10 largest traders in the regions either as large agricultural exporters or importers and they seemingly have potential to become growth poles in Africawide growth led by promoting agricultural trade. However, at the present, intra-SSA trade only plays a marginal role and that official trade data often significantly underestimate the actual trade flows between countries. In order to avoid historical bias, we focus on the potential trade opportunities by investigating whether a group of commodities in which some countries have a comparative advantage matched with the group of commodities imported by other African countries. We find that foodstuffs are among the most dynamic products in regional agricultural trade, as value of the correlation between the <b>staple</b> <b>good</b> exports and imports is high and doubles over the two observation periods, up from 0. 34 in the first period (19901995). Poor infrastructure and institutional barriers are among the major reasons constraining African countries to exploit their comparative advantage and strengthen iv their economic linkages. The model simulations show that opening the EU market is strongly in the common interest of African countries.

40|$|The {{author of}} the article {{analyzes}} the most famous Canadian theories of origin and evolution of the Canadian political culture (CPC) {{during the first half}} of the 20 th century.

The article also deals with the economic theory of the <b>staples</b> <b>goods</b> of Harold Innis, the theory of the Canadian regional political cultures of G. Horowitz, the theory of wave immigration of Nelson Wiseman. The general defect of these theories consists in the fact that their authors take into account one and only factor as the basic one for constructing the functional and structural scheme of the ideological and the political development in Canada. Besides, the last two theories about the Canadian political culture are based on the historical context and at the same time their construction’s base is represented by the ideological concepts of the American scientists –fragments” by Lous Hartz and “forming events” by Seymour Martin Lipset in the communities of the New World. According to the author, the adoption of these concepts does not only reflect the past historical events but also the current processes in Canada’s political culture. The author concludes that the Canadian political culture is the unique historical phenomenon only for Canada and he also says about that the functional-structural schemes are developed within the individual scientific disciplines. The interdisciplinary approach is necessary for studies of the Canadian political culture, and the development of the original theory is based on the use of the numerous factors of the historical-cultural development of the Canadian society...|$|R
