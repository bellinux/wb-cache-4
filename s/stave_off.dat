5|$|After scoring 39 in {{the first}} innings in the Second Test at Lord's, Macartney took 1/90, {{removing}} centurion Jack Hobbs as England took a 92-run first innings lead. He then scored 133 not out in the second innings, to help to <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> defeat. Australia were 5/194 when the match ended, and {{were it not for}} Macartney's effort could have been bowled out.|$|E
5|$|Despite Daniel's injury {{late in the}} season, the Canucks {{won their}} second {{consecutive}} Presidents' Trophy. He remained out of the lineup {{for the first three}} games of the 2012 playoffs, all of which the Canucks lost against the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Kings. Returning for Game 4, Daniel helped the Canucks <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> elimination before they were defeated the following contest. In his two games played in the series, he recorded two assists.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{continued}} to crop up. Many Chinese Malayan youths {{drafted into the}} army to <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> communist attacks fled the country; most participants were English- and not Chinese-educated. To the Malays, this indicated that the Chinese had no particular loyalty towards Malaya and justified ketuanan Melayu, heightening similar perceptions caused by the apparent racial dichotomy between those in fierce opposition to the communists and those supporting the MCP.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1998–99 season, Kartik took 23 wickets for Vijay Cricket Club in the Chennai League. He played more {{regularly}} in the 1998–99 Ranji Trophy, taking 29 wickets in seven matches at 19.3 to be the 13th highest wicket-taker. This included a 3/8 and 4/62 in an innings win over Rajasthan, and 5/84 and 5/55 in the last two matches of the campaign against Tamil Nadu and Delhi. He also added 29 and 53 with the bat against Tamil Nadu to help <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> a defeat after his team had trailed by over 200 on the first innings.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|In the 1988–89 season, Dozzell {{finished}} as the club's joint top-scorer (with John Wark and Dalian Atkinson), scoring 13 goals from 37 appearances. The {{following two}} seasons saw Dozzell {{as a regular}} starter for the team, with 18 goals from 88 appearances. His 16 goals in the 1991–92 season helped John Lyall's Ipswich win the league title and secure promotion to the newly formed Premier League. He featured regularly the following season, scoring nine goals in 52 games and helping the club <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> relegation in their first season back in the top tier of English football.|$|E

5|$|Mathias {{was elected}} to the Senate in 1968, {{unseating}} the incumbent Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier had been his roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal Republican in the Senate, and frequently clashed with the conservative wing of his party. For a few months in late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|Morehead was a {{delegate}} to the Peace Conference of 1861 and the Border States Convention that attempted to <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> the Civil War. Although he favored Kentucky's neutrality, Morehead sympathized with the South and was an open critic of the Lincoln administration. He was imprisoned for disloyalty in September 1861, although no formal charges were ever brought against him. He {{was released from prison}} in January 1862, and afterward fled to Canada, Europe, and Mexico. After the war, he returned to the United States and settled on his plantation in Greenville, Mississippi, where he died on December 21, 1868.|$|E
5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} to <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight {{as to whether}} or not he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E

5|$|Though Brian Little's {{appointment}} as manager in February 1989 {{was too late}} to <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> relegation to the Conference, he went on to lead them to successive promotions. An immediate return to the Football League as Conference champions preceded the Fourth Division title in 1990–91, but Little's departure for Leicester City was followed by relegation and a succession of short-term managers. They came close to a return to the Third Division via the play-offs in 1996; on their first visit to Wembley, against Plymouth Argyle, they were beaten by a Ronnie Mauge goal.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, Johnston {{played in the}} 1948–49 Australian season, which was purely domestic with no visiting international teams. He took a total of 32 wickets at 31.84 in nine matches. He saved his best performance for New South Wales. He took 3/47 and 5/62 and his wickets included future Test batsmen Jim Burke, Jimmy de Courcy and Jack Moroney, {{but was unable to}} <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> defeat. Apart from a 5/65 against Queensland he never took more than three wickets in an innings for the season. He also managed his highest first-class score, recording 38 against South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Violence erupted {{again in}} early May 1995. The RSK lost {{support from the}} Serbian {{government}} in Belgrade, {{partly as a result}} of international pressure. At the same time, the Croatian Operation Flash reclaimed all of the previously occupied territory in Western Slavonia. In retaliation, Serb forces attacked Zagreb with rockets, killing 7 and wounding over 200 civilians. The Yugoslav army responded to the offensive with a show of force, moving tanks towards the Croatian border, in an apparent effort to <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> a possible attack on the occupied area in Eastern Slavonia.|$|E

5|$|After their {{win over}} Manchester City, the team then went a club-record 19 games without a victory, {{eventually}} finishing the 1999–2000 season 17th, with two late wins helping <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> relegation. The 2000–01 season saw them again narrowly avoid relegation, finishing 19th overall. The 2001–02 season {{turned out to}} be the club's worst ever season at the time. With Stockport already bottom of the league, a 4–0 home defeat to Millwall saw manager Kilner sacked. Former England international Carlton Palmer was appointed in November 2001. Palmer subsequently failed to stop Stockport being relegated in 2001–02 or to build a team capable of challenging for a return the next season.|$|E
5|$|However, {{soon after}} the {{encounter}} with Cardinal Draclau, Ramza discovers that an elaborate plot was set by the Murond Glabados Church. In their desire to control Ivalice, the Church, particularly the High Priest, Marge Funeral, uses {{the legend of the}} so-called holy Zodiac Braves to gather the Zodiac Stones, and fuels the Lion War between Larg and Goltana. To <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> Ramza's interference, Draclau uses the stone to transform into a legendary Lucavi demon, and Ramza {{has no choice but to}} slay him/it. As a result, Ramza is regarded a heretic of the Church, and he is approached by the Heretic Examiner Zalmo at Lesalia Imperial Capital.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> the Civil War, Dixon participated in a {{convention}} of border states and a peace convention in Frankfort, Kentucky, both in 1861. Both conventions were unsuccessful. At {{the outset of the}} war, the Kentucky General Assembly elected six arbiters to recommend a course of action for the Commonwealth. Dixon represented the pro-Union position along with John J. Crittenden and Samuel S. Nicholas. Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin, John C. Breckinridge, and Richard Hawes represented the southern sympathizers. The arbiters met on May 11, 1861. After the pro-Union men defeated a proposal to call a sovereignty convention, the six arbiters recommended a position of neutrality, which the General Assembly adopted.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine Empire {{was in no}} {{position}} to launch any decent counter-attack or defence of these lands; by now the Ottomans had become supremely powerful. Murad I crushed an army of Serbians on 26 September 1371 at the Battle of Maritsa leading to the end of Serbian power. The Ottomans were now poised to conquer Constantinople. In an attempt to <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> defeat, John V appealed to the Pope for support offering submission to Rome in return for military support. Despite publicly confessing the Roman Catholic Faith in St. Peter's Basilica, John V received no help. John V therefore was forced to turn to reason with his enemies, the Ottomans. Murad I and John V then came to an agreement whereby Byzantium would provide regular tribute in troops and money in exchange for security.|$|E
5|$|The stories The Girl {{with the}} Mule (alternately titled The Mule Without a Bridle) and Hunbaut feature Gawain in {{beheading}} game situations. In Hunbaut, Gawain cuts off a man's head and, {{before he can}} replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle to <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> the advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include Yder, the Lancelot-Grail, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested {{to see whether or}} not he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Victoria then batted. Illingworth made 22 of his team's 144 {{after they}} fell to 6/100. They {{were forced to}} follow on, having conceded a 248-run lead in their first innings. Victoria {{had to try to}} <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> defeat and they were in trouble when Illingworth came in to bat, partnering captain Bill Lawry after wicket-keeper Ray Jordon was out with the score at 6/193. Illingworth scored his highest {{first-class}} score of 47, putting on a partnership of 87 runs with Lawry before he was dismissed with the score at 7/280. Victoria were 8/286 at the end of play, just 38 runs ahead, as the match ended in a draw.|$|E
