5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval {{of what she was}} saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.|$|E
5|$|Clark left Cambridge {{at the age}} of 18 to {{join the}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as an officer. During initial {{training}} at HMS Collingwood, near Portsmouth, Clark discovered that he was colour blind and only passed the medical examination by persuading the man <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> him to whisper the answers to him. Clark served aboard HMS Fleetwood on convoy escort operations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean before attending HMS King Alfred at Hove. Whilst there his colour blindness was discovered and he was banned from seagoing postings.|$|E

Previous Nevada governors were also interviewed and they said that they felt it was necessary that they spent most of their time in the office.|$|E
25|$|The Honda Life {{represented}} Honda's {{efforts in}} {{competing in the}} kei car segment, offering sedan, delivery van and small pick-up platforms on a shared chassis. The Life StepVan had a novel approach that, while not initially a commercial success, {{appears to be an}} influence in vehicles with the front passengers <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> the engine, a large cargo area with a flat roof and a liftgate installed in back, and utilizing a transversely installed engine with a front-wheel-drive powertrain.|$|E
25|$|Apart from Abalabandhab, Dwarkanath {{raised a}} storm within the Brahmo Samaj {{regarding}} {{the issue of}} women <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> the screen during prayer meetings. With his strong reformist views, he was obviously opposed {{to many of the}} conservative ideas not only in society but even in the Brahmo Samaj. That {{was the beginning of the}} split in the Brahmo Samaj of India, which ultimately led to the formation of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in 1878. Ganguly served several terms as secretary of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj.|$|E

25|$|Lopata's rise {{to stardom}} {{continued}} in 1956. Before the season even started, Lopata wowed fans against the Cincinnati Reds {{in an exhibition}} game by hitting a towering home run for 510 feet. On February 15, Lopata signed a new deal with the Phillies. There was talk of moving Lopata from catcher to first base on a full-time basis during spring training, but {{he spent most of}} his time at catcher for the season, <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> home plate in 100 games while playing at first in 38.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Air New Zealand in {{consultation}} with US design studio IDEO, the new Premium Economy cabin uses a 2-2-2 seating configuration. The central pair of Spaceseats are slightly angled for those travelling with a colleague or partner, and the two arm rests can form a single table for shared in-flight dining. The pairs of outboard Spaceseats on either side are angled to enhance privacy for solo flyers. The seats are built around a hard shell so the passenger in front cannot recline into {{the space of the}} person <b>sitting</b> <b>behind.</b> Instead, the seat slides forward and angles up as it reclines into the shell, similar to an armchair.|$|E
500|$|The AH-64 Apache has a four-blade {{main rotor}} and a four-blade tail rotor. The crew sits in tandem, with the pilot <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> {{and above the}} co-pilot/gunner.

The AH-64 is powered by two General Electric T700 turboshaft engines with high-mounted exhausts {{on either side of}} the fuselage. Various models of engines have been used on the Apache; those in British service use engines from Rolls-Royce. In 2004, General Electric Aviation began producing more powerful T700-GE-701D engines, rated at [...] for AH-64Ds.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not being a Mohammedan,' said Gerald. Birkin sat motionless, {{driving the}} car, quite {{unconscious}} {{of what they}} said. And Gudrun, <b>sitting</b> immediately <b>behind</b> him, felt a sort of ironic pleasure in thus exposing him.|$|R
50|$|The video {{starts with}} the camera showing a fence and umbrellas, which people are holding on a raining day. After twenty seconds of the video, it then cuts to Yulia singing the song, then having both Yulia and Lena <b>sitting</b> <b>behinds</b> the fence. While {{everyone}} {{on the other side}} of the fence look at both Yulia and Lena with ignorance (or having a lack of emotion), it then cuts to both of them banging and hitting the fence to be let out. When the second chorus engages, it shows both of the girls coming closer together, and eventually near the finishing of the second chorus, they kiss each other.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is {{that woman}} with the auburn hair and a rather {{effective}} belligerent gleam in her eyes?" [...] asked a man <b>sitting</b> just <b>behind</b> Comus; [...] "she looks {{as if she might}} have created the world in six days and destroyed it on the seventh." ...|$|R
500|$|During Amin's time in power, {{popular media}} outside of Uganda often portrayed {{him as an}} {{essentially}} comic and eccentric figure. In a 1977 assessment typical of the time, a Time magazine article described him as a [...] "killer and clown, big-hearted buffoon and strutting martinet". The comedy-variety series Saturday Night Live aired four Amin sketches between 1976–79, including {{one in which he}} was an ill-behaved houseguest in exile, and another in which he was a spokesman against venereal disease. In a Benny Hill show transmitted in January 1977, Hill portrayed Amin <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> a desk that featured a placard reading [...] "ME TARZAN, U GANDA".|$|E
500|$|Tolliver {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} worth about $1 million with the Shreveport Pirates of the Canadian Football League [...] before the 1995 season began. Early in the season, Tolliver got to compete against former teammate David Archer in the San Antonio Texans' CFL debut. He finished the season having thrown for 3,767 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. After the team folded following a 5–13 season, Tolliver was again without a team. In October 1996, Tolliver rejoined the Falcons as the third-string quarterback, this time <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> Bobby Hebert and Browning Nagle. He spent the 1996 season on the bench, and did not take a snap in a game. He was re-signed by Atlanta in April and given a one-year contract worth $325,000.|$|E
500|$|The songs [...] "Monster Mash" [...] (by Bobby [...] "Boris" [...] Pickett) and [...] "Break On Through (To the Other Side)" [...] (by The Doors) are {{featured}} in the episode. The orchestral version of Tony Bennett's [...] "Stranger in Paradise" [...] {{can be heard in}} an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. Homer's conscience, which tells him that stealing is wrong, speaks with the voice of the fictional character Droopy. During the re-enactment of the Abraham Lincoln assassination at the school pageant, Bart says [...] "Hasta la vista, Abie" [...] in reference to the film [...] The scene of Chief Wiggum <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> Krusty at an adult movie theater and Krusty thinking he is about to be arrested is a reference to Paul Reubens' arrest for masturbating at a pornographic movie theater in Sarasota, Florida.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing the {{response}}, The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote, [...] "Judging {{from the}} response from Twitter and TV pundits, it did not go well." [...] Fox News reported that the speech was [...] "widely mocked". The New York Post noted one particularly resonating statement when Beshear said, [...] "I'm a proud Democrat, but first and foremost, I'm a proud Republican, and Democrat, and mostly, American." [...] The criticism extended to Beshear's choice of backdrop [...] "people <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> him, near motionless, in a dimly lit diner" [...] – which comedian Stephen Colbert described as your [...] "normal, relatable everyday diner where everyone faces the same direction in terrified silence." [...] Emanuel Cleaver, a Democratic congressman from Missouri concluded, [...] "I don't mind saying when we make mistakes. And [...] was a mistake." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} Mara in February 1959 {{unsettled}} Bell and he experienced {{a heart attack}} later that month. He converted to Catholicism {{in the summer of}} 1959 because of the lifelong urging of his wife, Mara's death, and his enduring friendship with Rooney, a practicing Catholic. Bell was advised by his doctor to avoid going to football games, to which he quipped, [...] "I'd rather die watching football than in my bed with my boots off." [...] Bell and his children attended an Eagles game at Franklin Field on October 11, 1959. The Eagles held complimentary box seats for him and guests to watch the game, but he preferred to buy his own tickets and sit with the other fans. <b>Sitting</b> <b>behind</b> the end zone during the fourth quarter of the game, he suffered a heart attack and died later that day.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of the 3 March 1943 the Luftwaffe was active again. Cunningham {{scrambled}} too late to get contact with the GCI's contact. He climbed toward a searchlight box. The searchlights operated in a box-shape, separated by evenly spaced markers. Each fighter was given a box and flew to its allotted marker beacon. There he orbited until the lights illuminated a target, or formed a cone where he could pick up an AI contact. Soon he had a contact—a Dornier Do 217. He closed in but his cannons jammed. After <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> the Dornier for some time and trying in vain to encourage the guns to fire, the German crew suddenly woke up and dived away. Cunningham was furious. Three-quarters of the squadron got airborne but only he had seen an enemy. Unsatisfied with ground and aircrews, he used his influence in the small night-fighter community to bring in personnel from his old unit, 604, currently languishing in Cornwall. With the new VIII radar a uniform facility, Cunningham took command of a Mosquito NF.XII—the first Mosquito to have a smooth [...] "bluff" [...] nose dome over the dish antenna.|$|E

500|$|The {{tour was}} officially {{announced}} on April 28, 2014, via Jay-Z's Facebook page. Announcements shortly followed through Beyoncé's website and an official press release. Pre-sale tickets for fans {{to secure their}} seats first before the general sale were sold through Beyoncé's website and Chase credit and debit card users exclusively. A writer for Billboard noted that Chase was a surprising candidate for the official tour sponsor due to their lack {{of experience in the}} concert industry when compared to the live music sponsorship giants such as Citi and American Express. Chase allegedly scored the [...] "11th-hour" [...] deal due to previous connections with Roc Nation Sports (owned by Jay-Z) and a $4 million bid on the position. A promotional poster for the tour was revealed showing Jay-Z and Beyoncé embracing and wearing ski masks, following the criminals-on-the-lam narrative of the couple's two singles ("'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] and [...] "Part II (On the Run)"). Beyoncé also wore a similar ski mask in her 2013 video [...] "Superpower" [...] featuring Frank Ocean from her self-titled album. A second promotional poster was released on May 30, 2014, in an email to fans announcing the on sale times for certain tour dates. The poster features Beyoncé dressed in a white, short-cut wedding dress whilst <b>sitting</b> <b>behind</b> and hugging Jay-Z on a motorcycle.|$|E

5000|$|Lt. Morant's reply, as {{recorded}} by Witton, is legendary: [...] "Was it like this? No; {{it was not}} quite so handsome.
