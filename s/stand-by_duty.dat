Delegates from all member associations discussed different directives planned by the EU - Commission as: working time (<b>stand-by</b> <b>duty,</b> limits of working time); Professional Qualifications and working in other EU - member states; Falsified Medicines. Unanimously the delegates stated that it is absolutely necessary for community pharmacists to know the language spoken in the state they want to work in. Just as unanimously they refused an individual opt- out of the working time directive by employment contract.|$|E

This means that the Roman plebs had to visit the tribunes at the tribune benches to ask for their help.

40|$|By {{screening}} various sources, such as handouts, lectures, {{official and}} personal correspondence, and interviewing historical eyewitnesses, {{it was possible}} to reconstruct the history and document the importance of the Veterinary Ambulance and Diagnostic Services Schwarzenbek. Before 1989, when Germany was devided and Berlin in an insular situation separated from the Federal Republic, it seemed necessary to establish a field station of training for students studying at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Freie Universität Berlin (FUB) outside of Berlin, giving students the opportunity to experience veterinary practice with livestock. With the appointment of professor Dr. med. vet. Gerhard von Mickwitz to the chair for Pig Deseases and Forensic Veterinary Medicine the FUB called a scientist and scholar, who was willing and able to put such an idea into practice. The project was realized under the name of Tierärztliche Ambulanz Schwarzenbek (TAS) des Fachbereichs Veterinärmedizin an der Freien Universität Berlin (Veterinary Ambulance and Diagnostic Services Schwarzenbek of the Free University of Berlin). The field station was established in the city of Schwarzenbek, Schleswig-Holstein, in 1979 and maintained until 1997. Besides the insular situation of Berlin and due to the fact, that the distance from the veterinary faculties in the large cities to the clientele living in rural areas became more and more inefficient for ambulatory missions, there was another reason for establishing a field station for practical experience: students had to become familiar with the increasing importance of the new subject of “herd level veterinary medicine”. The idea of connecting herd level veterinary medicine with practice oriented teaching {{can be traced back to}} Dr. med. Christian Cothenius (1708 - 1789) practicing during the reign of Frederic II of Prussia. In newer times the professors Theodor Oppermann, Edmund Hupka and Erich Aehnelt can be considered the pioneers of practice oriented mobile veterinary services, which Gerhard von Mickwitz ultimately turned into reality by founding TAS. In 1979 the FUB purchased a rural veterinary practice in Schwarzenbek, Kreis Herzogtum (District of the Duchy of) Lauenburg in Schleswig-Holstein, which had a sufficient number of farms and thus clientele of veterinary services. Comuting to Berlin was quite easy by using the transit route across the Autobahn or the train Berlin-Hamburg. At first, staff members and students were accommodated on the tight premisis, laboratories were installed and domestic livestock purchased, which for demonstrative purposes could be brought to the faculty in Berlin. 1986 the unit moved into a new building located at Röntgenstraße 12 in the industrial district of Schwarzenbek. Besides the offices, library, pharmacy, laboratories and stables the facility offered lodgings for accommodating students and doctoral graduates, guest researchers and lecturers. The main function of TAS was training students in the field of herd level veterinary medicine. Besides practical studies and a facultative seminar entitled Einführung in das Berufsbild des Tierarztes (Schwerpunkt Nutztierhaltung) (Introduction into the nature of the veterinary profession (emphasizing livestock)), the study unit required the important one week course on “Herd level diagnostics and therapy for domestic livestock”. Because of the changes in livestock farming and increase in herd sizes, health disorders among all kinds of animal farming at herd level increased as well. As future veterinaries the students thus had to be introduced into the practice of herd level diagnostics and therapy. All in all, more than 2500 students studied this subject at TAS. The studies at TAS comprised 36 hours a week and were taught by the head of the institution and five of its assistants. This course had three parts: 1. 	four days of practices in the morning 2. 	ambulance missions 3. 	specific exercises related to selected chapters on herd level diagnostics and therapy for pigs and cattle. Interviews showed that this type of curriculum was well accepted among students and teachers. To ensure qualified training with individual animals as well as with herds and in order to introduce students to a variety of diseases and their clinical pictures and specific veterinary problem areas, the maintenance of a large veterinary practice centre with various services was required. Besides the curative practice and surgery, cattle and pig insemination was offered. Furthermore, farmers and veterinaries of the area received high end diagnostics in their daily practice at their locality by qualified personnel of TAS and in case of specific herd level problems assistance by the Diagnostic Services and at the centre with its laboratories and the pathology. The veterinary services were billed according to the Gebührenordnung für Tierärzte (schedule of veterinarian fees). These takings as well as the money for medicaments were remitted to the university. Except for the extra expenses on staff personnel due to the larger number of training hours and <b>stand-by</b> <b>duty</b> around the clock, TAS financed itsself. For many of the projects carried out, substancial third party grants and allocations (Drittmittel) were acquired. Other reimbursed services of TAS included further professional training for practicing veterinarians, farmers, workers in slaughterhouses and livestock transportation. The daily work in practice made it possible to identify animals of clinical interest for instruction and study in Berlin, transporting them together with other training material weekly to the city. The relatively small number of permanent academic staff of TAS had a variety of duties, covering various services for livestock businesses and practicing veterinarians. Besides that, they were engaged in training and research in the interdisciplinary field of herd level veterinary medicine, which required more than looking after livestock. The productivity of the scientific work done is suggested, for example, by the large number of scientific publications, invited lectures and in-service activities. Due to the steady and sound relationship TAS had built up with its clientele it opened access to a wealth of data from them and the examinations performed. This was available to the academic staff of all faculty institutes and to graduate students, who used it for research purposes and doctoral theses. The following main research areas existed: -	clinical epidemiology -	hygiene, feeding and mycotoxicosis -	homeopathy -	modern livestock farming including slaughter (concerning prevention of cruelty) At TAS 66 graduates of the veterinary sciences finished their doctoral theses and in 1995 also a thesis for habilitation was published. The studies on animal protection against cruelty during transportation and slaughtering revealed that this problem area had been neglected by research. Consequently, a special research group was installed in order to investigate and evaluate how the animals were handled during transportation and at the slaughterhouses, including anesthetization and actual slaughtering. The project was sponsored by the Erna Graff Foundation for Animal Welfare and by the European Union. Due to its research the Beratungs- und Schulungsinstitut für schonenden Umgang mit Zucht- und Schlachttieren (bsi) (consulting and training institute for gentle handling of livestock in breeding and slaughtering) was founded in 1993 and since then has been turned into a corporate association of own legal standing, existing and working independently. The end of TAS was foreseeable when Germany was reunited in 1990. For the specific situation in Berlin a drastic step towards reorganizing the university landscape followed, including a considerable cut in financing. As in East as well as in West Berlin a faculty of veterinary medicine had existed, an arrangement of unification had to be found according to the law of merger (Fusionsgesetz) of 1992. The required reduction of staff due to the merger and the expectation, that in the rural areas near Berlin similar opportunities for practice oriented training in the study of veterinary medi-cine could be reestablished, it was decided to finally close down TAS in 1997...|$|E
