The star catalog of Hipparchus (2nd century BC) included 1020 stars, and was used to assemble Ptolemy's <b>star</b> <b>catalogue.</b> Hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded nova (new star). Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Pleione {{is known}} to be a speckle binary, {{although}} its orbital parameters have yet to be fully established. In 1996 a group of Japanese and French astronomers discovered that Pleione is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 218.0 days and a large eccentricity of 0.6. The Washington Double <b>Star</b> <b>Catalogue</b> lists an angular separation between the two components of 0.2 arcsecondsan angle which equates to a distance of about 24 AU, assuming a distance of 120 parsecs.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{also made}} star catalogues, such as {{historian}} Sima Qian's (145–86 BCE) A Monograph on Celestial Officials (Tianguanshu 天官書) and Zhang Heng's 2nd-century-CE <b>star</b> <b>catalogue</b> which featured roughly 2,500 stars and 124 constellations. To create a three-dimensional representation of such observations, Astronomer Geng Shouchang (耿壽昌) provided his armillary sphere with an equatorial ring in 52 BCE. By 84 CE the elliptical ring {{was added to}} the armillary sphere, while Zhang Heng's model of 125 CE added the celestial horizon ring and meridian ring.|$|E
5000|$|The IAU is {{the only}} internationally {{recognized}} authority for assigning astronomical designations to celestial objects and surface features on them.

5|$|Uranus {{had been}} {{observed}} {{on many occasions}} before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchos, who in 128 BCE might have recorded it as a star for his <b>star</b> <b>catalogue</b> that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's Almagest. The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769, including on four consecutive nights.|$|E
5|$|Tycho Brahe, also {{credited}} with Coma's designation as a constellation, included {{it in his}} 1602 <b>star</b> <b>catalogue.</b> Brahe recorded fourteen stars in the constellation; Johannes Hevelius increased its number to twenty-one, and John Flamsteed to forty-three. Coma Berenices also appeared in Johann Bayer's 1603 Uranometria, {{and a few other}} 17th-century celestial maps followed suit. Coma Berenices and the now-obsolete Antinous are considered the first post-Ptolemaic constellations depicted on a celestial globe. With Antinous, Coma Berenices exemplified a trend in astronomy in which globe- and map-makers continued to rely on the ancients for data. This trend ended {{at the turn of the}} 16th century with observations of the southern sky and the work of Tycho Brahe.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{convention}} designates {{the cooler}} star as component Aa and its spectral type has been usually measured between G2 and K0. The hotter secondary Ab {{has been given}} various spectral types of late (cooler) F or early (warmer) G.The MK spectral types of the two stars have been measured a number of times, and they are both consistently assigned a luminosity class of III indicating a giant star. The composite spectrum appears {{to be dominated by}} the primary star due to its sharper absorption lines; the lines from the secondary are broadened and blurred by its rapid rotation. The most recent specific published types are K0III and G1III, although older values are still widely quoted such as G5IIIe + G0III from the Bright <b>Star</b> <b>Catalogue</b> or G8III + G0III by Eggen. Where the context is clear, these two components have been referred to as A and B.|$|E

25|$|Books VII and VIII {{cover the}} motions of the fixed stars, {{including}} precession of the equinoxes. They also contain a <b>star</b> <b>catalogue</b> of 1022 stars, described by their positions in the constellations. The brightest stars were marked first magnitude (m=1), while the faintest {{visible to the naked}} eye were sixth magnitude (m=6). Each numerical magnitude was twice the brightness of the following one, which is a logarithmic scale. This system is believed to have originated with Hipparchus. The stellar positions too are of Hipparchan origin, despite Ptolemy's claim to the contrary.|$|E
25|$|The Flamsteed {{designation}} 54 Piscium {{originated in}} the <b>star</b> <b>catalogue</b> of the British astronomer John Flamsteed, first published in 1712. It has an apparent magnitude of 5.86, allowing it {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye under suitable viewing conditions.The star has a classification of K0V, with the luminosity class V indicating this is a main sequence star that is generating energy at its core through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. The effective temperature of the photosphere is about 5,062K, giving it the characteristic orange hue of a K-type star.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus also {{compiled}} a <b>star</b> <b>catalogue.</b> According to Pliny the Elder, he observed a nova (new star). So that later generations could tell whether other stars came to be, perished, moved, or changed in brightness, he recorded {{the position and}} brightness of the stars. Ptolemy mentioned the catalogue in connection with Hipparchus' discovery of precession. (Precession of the equinoxes is a slow motion of {{the place of the}} equinoxes through the zodiac, caused by the shifting of the Earth's axis). Hipparchus thought it was caused by the motion of the sphere of fixed stars.|$|E

25|$|However, all {{the early}} constellations were never universally adopted, whose popular usage {{was based on}} the culture or {{individual}} nations. Defining each constellation and their assigned stars also significantly differed in size and shape, whose arbitrary boundaries often lead to confusion to where celestial objects were to be placed. Before the constellation boundaries were defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1930, they appeared as simply encircled areas of sky. Today they now follow officially accepted designated lines of Right Ascension and Declination based on those defined by Benjamin Gould in Epoch 1875.0 in his <b>star</b> <b>catalogue</b> known as Uranometria Argentina.|$|E
25|$|A {{constellation}} in {{this area}} was introduced by Isaac Habrecht II in his celestial globe in 1621, who named it Rhombus. It was replaced with a somewhat different constellation by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the eighteenth century; during his stay at the Cape of Good Hope, he named the constellation le Réticule Rhomboide to commemorate the reticle in his telescope eyepiece. The name was later Latinized to Reticulum in his <b>star</b> <b>catalogue</b> Coelum Australe Stelliferum. In 1810, the stars of Reticulum were used by William Croswell to produce the constellation Marmor Sculptile, which represented the bust of Christopher Columbus, but this did not catch on among astronomers.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the constellations}} can be simply {{divided into two}} regions; namely the {{northern}} and southern sky, whose origins are distinctly different. The northern skies have constellations that have mostly survived since Antiquity, whose common names are based on Classical Greek legends or those whose true origins have now been lost. Evidence of these constellations have survived in the form of star charts, whose oldest representation appears on the statue known as the Farnese Atlas, which has been suggested {{to be based on the}} <b>star</b> <b>catalogue</b> of the Greek astronomer, Hipparchus. Southern hemisphere constellations are more modern inventions, which were created as new constellations, or become substitutes for some ancient constellation. e.g. Argo Navis. Some southern constellations were to become obsolete or had extended names that became foreshortened to more usable forms e.g. Musca Australis became simply Musca.|$|E

Those planets, along with Fomalhaut b, were the first extrasolar planets whose orbital motion was confirmed via direct imaging. The designation HR 8799 is the star's identifier in the Bright <b>Star</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> The star is a Gamma Doradus variable: its luminosity changes because of non-radial pulsations of its surface. The star is also classified as a Lambda Boötis star, which means its surface layers are depleted in iron peak elements. This {{may be due to the}} accretion of metal-poor circumstellar gas. It is the only known star which is simultaneously a Gamma Doradus variable, a Lambda Boötis type, and a Vega-like star (a star with excess infrared emission caused by a circumstellar disk).|$|E

Using the Hipparcos <b>Star</b> <b>Catalogue</b> (HIP) data, the mean individual proper motions are −3678mas/yr or −3.678arcsec per year in right ascension and +481.84mas/yr or 0.48184arcsec per year in declination. As proper motions are cumulative, the motion of Alpha Centauri is about 6.1arcmin each century, and 61.3arcmin or 1.02° each millennium. These motions are about one-fifth and twice, respectively, the diameter of the full Moon. Using spectroscopy the mean radial velocity has been determined to be around 20km/s towards the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|Published {{after the}} death of Johannes, and with support from King Sobieski, the Prodromus Astronomiae {{consisted}} of three separate parts: a preface (labeled Prodromus), a star catalog (named Catalogus Stellarum), and an atlas of constellations (named Firmamentum Sobiescianum, sive Uranographia).Prodromus outlines the methodology and technology used in creating the <b>star</b> <b>catalogue.</b> It provides examples of the use of the sextant and quadrant by Johannes, in tandem with known positions of the sun, in calculating each stars' longitude and latitude. The written draft of the Catalogus Stellarum consists of 183 leaves, 145, alphabetized according to constellation, containing star positions. Each star had specific information recorded in columns: the reference number and magnitude found by astronomer Tycho Brahe, Johannes' own magnitude calculation, the star's longitude and latitude by both ecliptic coordinates measured by angular distances and meridian altitudes found using Johannes' quadrant, and the star's equatorial coordinates calculated using spherical trigonometry. The printed version was similar to the written draft, except the two columns describing a star's ecliptic coordinates were combined, and only the single best value for the star's latitude and longitude was given. Also, the printed version held more than 600 new stars and 12 new constellations not documented in the written draft, bringing its total to 1564. Although the observations of the catalog used nothing more than the astronomer's naked eye, the measurements were so precise as {{to be used in the}} making of celestial globes into the early 18th Century.Firmamentum Sobiescianum, while technically part of the Prodromus Astronomiae as a well, was likely published separately and in tighter circulation. Housing its own cover page and page-numbering system, the atlas consisted of two hemispheres and 54 double-page plates of 73 constellations. Both the northern and southern hemispheres were centered on an ecliptic pole, and most star locations were all based off Johannes' own observations. Those that were not, the southern polar stars, were based on a catalog and map published in 1679 by Edmond Halley.|$|E
