25|$|The {{detached}} U-boats {{were designated}} wolfpack 'Leopard', but were soon ordered {{to change course}} to close a larger convoy spotted by wolfpack 'Wolf' about 400 miles to the west. At 05:00 on 12 October, U-353 spotted an independently sailing merchant ship of 4,000 to 5,000 tons, and closed to attack, firing two torpedoes {{from a range of}} 2,000 yards. The ship promptly altered course, and the U-boat fired another torpedo from her <b>stern</b> <b>tube.</b> Two loud explosions were heard, and the ship was seen to break in two and sink. U-353 surfaced and closed at full speed, only to find U-133 already there and claiming the victory. Eventually the two captains agreed that U-353s torpedoes had forced the ship to change course into U-133s line of fire, and they agreed to share the credit. Ten minutes later another U-boat was sighted, , which claimed to have sunk two ships. The U-boats then parted company to search for the convoy.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} Likhachev's will and Konstantin's advice Posadnik left Hakodate February 20, 1861 and on March 1 reached {{the village of}} Osaki on the western coast of Asō Bay (Tatamura Bay in {{historical}} reports). Sō Yoshiyori, head of Sō clan, immediately informed the Bakufu government, however, the cautious cabinet of Andō Nobumasa delayed their response and Yoshiyori had to act on his own. Birilev, captain of Posadnik, made personal contact with Sō, exchanged courtesy gifts, and secured Yoshiyori's consent to survey the Imosaki Bay; Posadnik arrived there on April 2. The crew disembarked, raised the Russian flag, and began building temporary housing, a landing jetty and prepared to refit the ship which needed repairs to propeller and <b>stern</b> <b>tube.</b> Japanese officials tacitly agreed with de facto establishing a naval base and even assigned a team of fifteen local carpenters to help the Russians; the latter rewarded Sō with a gift of small naval cannons. Likhachev inspected the bay twice, March 27 on board Oprichnik and April 16 on board Svetlana and recorded friendly behaviour of the Japanese, however, in April the situation irreversibly changed.|$|E

Since Regulus II was cancelled in December 1958 except for test firings, the class deployed with four Regulus I missiles. They were originally ordered as sisters of , similar to the last s, but were converted to missile submarines during construction. Torpedo armament was the same as the Tangs, with six bow and two <b>stern</b> <b>tubes.</b> The <b>stern</b> <b>tubes</b> were for [...] "swim-out" [...] weapons only, such as the Mark 37 ASW homing torpedo.|$|R

500|$|Germaniawerft {{submitted}} a revised battleship design (designated Project No. 753) to the Dutch Navy on 4 March 1913, {{well before the}} Royal Commission reported back to the Government. As requested, the new design mounted its main armament in superfiring turrets. Other changes included {{an increase in the}} number of [...] guns to sixteen, a [...] faster maximum speed, different armor protection, replacement of two of the side-launching torpedo tubes with a single <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> and {{an increase in the number}} of rounds carried for each gun from 60 to 100 for the main armament and 100 to 150 for the medium guns. The new design also had a single funnel and a tripod mast that supported a director tower. Displacement was increased from 19,535 tons to 20,040 tons. Germaniawerft {{submitted a}} modified version of this design later in the year which increased the ships' displacement to 20,700 tons and substituted eight 343mm (13.5inch) L/45 guns mounted in two quadruple turrets which were better protected than the four double turrets in the Project No. 753 proposal. This design was not accepted, however.|$|E
500|$|Prien {{turned his}} {{submarine}} and attempted another shot via his <b>stern</b> <b>tube,</b> but this too missed. Reloading his bow tubes, he doubled back and fired a salvo of three torpedoes, all at Royal Oak, This {{time he was}} successful: at 01:16 all three struck the battleship in quick succession amidships and detonated. The explosions blew {{a hole in the}} armoured deck, destroying the Stokers', Boys' and Marines' messes and causing a loss of electrical power. Cordite from a magazine ignited and the ensuing fireball passed rapidly through the ship's internal spaces. Royal Oak quickly listed some 15°, sufficient to push the open starboard-side portholes below the waterline. She soon rolled further onto her side to 45°, hanging there for several minutes before disappearing beneath the surface at 01:29, 13 minutes after Prien's second strike. 833 men died with the ship, including Rear-Admiral Henry Blagrove, commander of the Second Battle Squadron. Over one hundred of the dead were Boy Seamen, not yet 18 years old, the largest ever such loss in a single Royal Navy action. [...] The admiral's wooden gig, moored alongside, was dragged down with Royal Oak.|$|E
50|$|Besides its eight torpedo tubes forward, this {{submarine}} {{class has}} {{four in the}} stern, which point rearward. All are for torpedoes of the French 550 mm diameter; while the forward tubes hold full-length torpedoes, the <b>stern</b> <b>tubes</b> only shortened ones.|$|R

50|$|Early submarines, {{when they}} carried torpedoes, were {{fitted with a}} variety of torpedo {{launching}} mechanisms in a range of locations; on the deck, in the bow or stern, amidships, with some launch mechanisms permitting the torpedo to be aimed over a wide arc. By World War 2, designs favoured multiple bow tubes and fewer or no <b>stern</b> <b>tubes.</b> Modern submarine bows are usually occupied by a large sonar array, necessitating midships tubes angled outward, while <b>stern</b> <b>tubes</b> have largely disappeared. The first French and Russian submarines carried their torpedoes externally in Drzewiecki drop collars. These were cheaper than tubes, but less reliable. Both the United Kingdom and United States experimented with external tubes in World War II. External tubes offered a cheap and easy way of increasing torpedo capacity without radical redesign, something neither had time or resources to do prior to, or early in, the war. British T class submarines carried up to 13 torpedo tubes, up to 5 of them external. America's use was mainly limited to earlier Porpoise-, Salmon-, and Sargo-class boats. Until the appearance of the Tambor, most American submarines only carried 4 bow and either 2 or 4 <b>stern</b> <b>tubes,</b> something many American submarine officers felt provided inadequate firepower. This problem was compounded by the notorious unreliability of the Mark 14 torpedo.|$|R
50|$|On ships the torpedoes are {{generally}} launched from a triple-barreled launcher by compressed air. These may be mounted on deck or below. On submarines torpedoes {{have been carried}} externally as well as internally. The latter have been launched in the past by <b>stern</b> <b>tubes</b> {{as well as by}} the more normal forward ones.|$|R

2500|$|U-338 sailed from Kiel on 23 February 1943 {{under the}} command of Kapitänleutnant Manfred Kinzel, and out into the north Atlantic where she joined the wolfpack 'Stürmer' on 11 March for an attack on Convoy SC 122. On 17 March at 03:05, U-338 fired two torpedoes at the convoy {{southeast}} of Cape Farewell, Greenland and hit and sank two British merchant ships; the 4,898 ton Kingsbury, and the 5,072 ton King Gruffydd. After a minute, two more torpedoes were fired, one of which struck the 7,886 ton Dutch merchantman Alderamin, which later sank. A single torpedo was then fired from the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> aimed at the Alderamin, but it missed and struck the 7,134 ton British merchant ship Fort Cedar Lake. The ship, badly damaged, fell behind the convoy and was sunk by [...] around noon. U-338 attacked the convoy again at 14:52 with another salvo of torpedoes, one of which hit the 4,071 ton Panama-registered American ship Granville, which broke in two amidships and sank within 15 minutes.|$|E
