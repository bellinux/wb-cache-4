5|$|However other scholars, such as Arthur Berriedale Keith, J. Burnet and A.R. Wadia, {{believe that}} the two systems {{developed}} independently. They note {{that there is no}} historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stage of development, orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in this life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} minor traces of Punic-Phoenician and Romano-Italian influence, the Delian mosaics {{generally}} {{conform to the}} major trends found in Hellenistic art. The same wealthy patrons who commissioned paintings and sculptures at Delos may have also been involved in hiring mosaic artists from abroad. Delian mosaics share certain characteristics with mosaics {{in other parts of}} the Greek world, such as Macedonian mosaics in Pella. They also share some attributes with Greek painting traditions and often employ a similar black-background technique found in red-figure pottery of the Classical period. Some of the styles and techniques used at Delos were later found in Roman art and mosaics, although contemporary Roman examples from Pompeii, for instance, reveal <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production and design of mosaics in the western versus eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the amount of homework assigned to sophomore and senior high school students of White Plains High School, White Plains, New York, during a typical school day, and to determine certain parent, teacher and student reactions and expectations relative to those assignments. The subject areas for which homework assignments were studied in detail, and upon which correlations were made, were English, mathematics, social studies, and science. Instruments, specifically developed to correlate responses from three different groups were completed by 159 parents of students involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study, 54 teachers of the four subject areas indicated above, 505 sophomores, and 408 seniors. Two hundred and eighteen student response sheets which were electronically rejected because of deviations in responding techniques, were hand scored to obtain responses to specific questions. All other response sheets were tabulated electronically. Because of an insufficient number of responses, data gathered from the parent instruments were not used for statistical analysis. Data obtained from the various instruments were applied to the chi-square test of independence to determine rejection of null hypotheses. In applying data obtained from questionnaires to the chisquare formula, eight hypotheses were rejected and five hypotheses were not rejected. There was insufficient data to allow application of this formula to one of the hypotheses; one hypothesis, therefore, remains untested. The hypotheses that were rejected are:There is no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of time that English teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There is no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of time that mathematics teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There is no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of time spent on homework between college-bound and non college-bound students. There is no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of time spent on homework between sophomore and senior populations. There is no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of time spent on homework between boy and girl populations.

There is no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of time spent on homework <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subject of science between sophomore and senior populations. The hypotheses that were not rejected are:There is no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of time that social studies teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There is no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of time that homework is worked on in school between boy and girl populations.

25|$|To combat {{loosening}} {{caused by}} polyethylene wear debris, hip manufacturers developed improved and novel {{materials for the}} acetabular liners. Ceramic heads mated with regular polyethylene liners or a ceramic liner were the first significant alternative. Metal liners to mate with a metal head were also developed.

Highly crosslinked UHMWPE {{was introduced in the}} late 1990s. The most recent data comparing the various bearing surfaces has shown no clinically significant differences in their performance. Potential early problems with each material are discussed below. Performance data after 20 or 30 years may be needed to demonstrate <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> devices. All newer materials allow use of larger diameter femoral heads. Use of larger heads significantly decreases the chance of the hip dislocating, which remains the greatest complication of the surgery.|$|E
25|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) uses antigen-coated microtitre plates for the {{detection}} of ANAs. Each well of a microtitre plate is coated with either a single antigen or multiple antigens to detect specific antibodies or to screen for ANAs, respectively. The antigens are either from cell extracts or recombinant. Blood serum is incubated in the wells of the plate and is washed out. If antibodies that bind to antigen are present then they will remain after washing. A secondary anti-human antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase. The enzyme reaction will produce a change in colour of the solution that is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to the antigen.

500|$|The American white ibis pairs up {{in spring}} and breeds in huge colonies, often with other waterbird species. Nesting begins as soon as {{suitable}} foraging and nesting habitat is available. The female selects the site, usually in {{the branches of a}} tree or shrub, which is often over water, and builds the nest, and males assist by bringing nest material. Anywhere from one to five eggs are typically laid, with two or three being the most common. The eggs are matt pale blue-green in color with brown splotches and measure [...] and weigh on average [...] Clutch sizes are usually lower in coastal colonies as compared to inland colonies, although there are no statistically <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fledging rate of both colonies.
