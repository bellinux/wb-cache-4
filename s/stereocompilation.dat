40|$|The {{problem of}} {{matching}} two scenes, one {{contained in the}} other, arises in many practical picture processing tasks including <b>stereocompilation,</b> classification of photographic data, and map matching for navigation and guidance. Because the images are not exact replicas, but rather noisy and perhaps geometrically distorted versions of the original scenes, {{it is necessary to}} develop a body of theory capable of providing answers to questions concerning effects of various types of error, and means for minimizing the effects of such errors. This paper presents a &quot;decision space &quot; approach to the problem for dealing with small amounts of noise and distortion, and a promising new technique for dealing with &quot;rubber sheet &quot; distortion...|$|E

Theoretically, this method does not require ground control points (GCP) and the Aerial Triangulation (AT), to process aerial photography into ground coordinates. Compared with the old method, this method has three main advantages: faster data processing, simple workflow and less expensive project, at the same accuracy. Direct georeferencing using two devices, GPS and IMU. GPS recording the camera coordinates (X, Y, Z), and IMU recording the camera orientation (omega, phi, kappa). Both parameters merged into Exterior Orientation (EO) parameter. This parameters required for next steps in the photogrammetric projects, such as <b>stereocompilation,</b> DSM generation, orthorectification and mosaic. Accuracy of this method was tested on topographic map project in Medan, Indonesia. Large-format digital camera Ultracam X from Vexcel is used, while the GPS / IMU is IGI AeroControl. 19 Independent Check Point (ICP) {{were used to determine}} the accuracy. Horizontal accuracy is 0. 356 meters and vertical accuracy is 0. 483 meters. Data with this accuracy can be used for 1 : 2. 500 map scale project...|$|E
