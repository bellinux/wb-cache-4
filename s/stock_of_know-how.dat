40|$|Below we {{show that}} the {{expected}} <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> {{in the absence of}} further learning is a decreasing convex function of time provided that ∆(en) is increasing in en. Omitting firm subscripts to simplify the notation, let ϕ(t) = E(et|e 0) be the expected <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> in period t assuming that the initial <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> is e 0 and that there is no further learning. Proposition A 1 If ∆(et) is constant in et, then ϕ(t) is a decreasing linear function of t. If ∆(et) is increasing in et, then ϕ(t) is a decreasing convex function of t. Proof. In the absence of further learning, qt = 0 and the evolution of the <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> is governed by the law of motion et+ 1 = et − ft. Taking expectations (conditional on et) gives us E(et+ 1 |et) = et − E(ft|et) = et − ∆(et). Since for any two random variables X and Y, EY (EX(X|Y)) = EX(X), we can take expectations (conditional on e 0) {{on both sides of the}} above equation to obtain E(et+ 1 |e 0) = E(et|e 0) − E(∆(et) |e 0). This implies ϕ(1) = e 0 − ∆(e 0), ϕ(t + 1) − ϕ(t) = −E(∆(et) |e 0), t ≥ 1. Since −E(∆(et) |e 0) 0 because the distribution of et− 1 stochastically dominates the distribution of et in the absence of further learning. Thus, ϕ(t) is a convex function of t...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} model of {{know-how}} sharing between competing firms in which each of two firms gets a stochastic innovation in its <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> in every period. Separately considering the cases when innovations are indivisible and divisible, we examine {{the nature of the}} subgame perfect sharing agreements that can obtain. We discover that both stochasticity and indivisibility undermine the ability to support sharing. Furthermore, we find that there are equilibria in which know-how sharing can be intermittent and that small innovations {{are more likely to be}} shared than large ones, when innovations are divisible but not necessarily when they are indivisible. ...|$|E
40|$|We propose an infinite-horizon quantity-setting {{differential}} {{game with}} learning spillovers and organizational forgetting {{to analyze the}} optimal management decisions affecting {{the evolution of the}} <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>know-how,</b> and, in turn, the dynamics of productive efficiency. Specifically, we study the long run impact of inter-firm knowledge diffusion on market power, i. e. the ability of a firm to raise the price above the marginal cost, and welfare. We consider two types of processes through which knowledge is acquired: (i) passive learning, or learning-by-doing, where managers do not actively invest in information and (ii) active learning, or learning-by-investing, where managers acquire new and additional information through specific investments in human capital. We show that: under (i), knowledge diffusion reduces market power; under (ii), knowledge diffusion reduces market power as long as learning spillovers are sufficiently important. From a welfare viewpoint, we also show that: under (i), knowledge diffusion is always welfare-enhancing; under (ii), weak spillovers are required in order for knowledge diffusion to be welfare-enhancing. <br /...|$|E
40|$|How does market {{structure}} affect quality innovation efforts and social welfare? This study considers three allocation mechanisms {{in a model}} of dynamic quality innovation: monopoly, duopoly, and the social planner. In this model, quality advances depend upon a <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> accumulated <b>know-how,</b> allowing for more flexible innovation strategies and direct comparisons of technology frontiers which show the largest reachable know-how stocks. When products are perfectly substitutable, the technology frontier is highest under the social planner, lower under duopoly, and lowest under monopoly. However, when products are less substitutable, a duopoly may surpass the technology frontier under the social planner along an unbalanced innovation path. Ex-ante and long-run social welfare are always highest under the social planner and lowest under monopoly. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to defend the thesis that the content <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> states is an {{accuracy}} assessable type of nonconceptual content. My argument proceeds in two stages. I argue, first, that the intellectualist distinction between types of ways of grasping the same kind of content is uninformative unless it is tied in with a distinction between kinds of contents. Second, I consider and reject the objection that, if the content <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> states is non-conceptual, it will be mysterious why attributions of knowing how create opaque contexts.

40|$|In {{daily life}} {{we not only}} speak not only of knowing facts but also <b>of</b> <b>know-how.</b> We may not only judge that someone knows {{that the stock market}} is in decline, that an {{avalanche}} is imminent or that ice is not marble but also that someone knows how to make money on the stock exchange, knows how to survive an avalanche or knows how to carve a realistic life-sized human figure from a block of marble. Ryle (1949, 26 - 60) first drew attention to analysis <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> and argued that know-how does not consist of propositional knowledge. He went on to give an analysis <b>of</b> <b>know-how.</b> Since then the analysis of propositional knowledge has largely overshadowed that <b>of</b> <b>know-how.</b> However there has been a resurgence of interest in it. For example, relatively recent proposals in philosophy of mind and ethics proceed in terms <b>of</b> <b>know-how.</b> For example, in response to Frank Jackson’s knowledge argument, David Lewis replies that knowing what an experience is like is a matter of knowing how to recognise, remember and imagine it. Hilary Putnam claims (1996, xvi) that “knowing {{the meaning of the word}} ‘gold’ or of the word ‘elm’ is not a matter of knowing that at all, but a matter of knowing how”. A more specific variant on this claim is Michael Devitt’s (1966, 173) conclusion that someone who knows the meaning of a term knows how to use it with a certain meaning but that such a person need not have ‘any propositional knowledge about what constitutes its meaning’...|$|R

30|$|The Paper {{focuses on}} the inbound {{know-how}} transfer {{for the development of}} open innovation as an approach to business management. It can be a challenging task for useful and meaningful transfer <b>of</b> external <b>know-how</b> to create value, thus the addressed research questions are: What constitutes a successful know-how transfer? How to measure performance <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> transfer? How transfer <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> should be done? Qualitative research methods – participatory action research within a specific case and application of existing theories as well as focus groups’ discussions were applied to create the study and obtain triangulation. The paper applied both inductive and deductive reasoning. The research shows that learning outcomes based approach can be used for successful <b>know-how</b> transfer. Performance <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> transfer is affected by accuracy of the stated aim (learning outcomes), applied teaching, learning and assessment methods and both internal and external environment characteristics of the stakeholders involved in the process. Both the know-how transfer performance measurements and the developed six step process model are presented in the paper. Implications and recommendations for future research are given.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Web {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{repositories}} <b>of</b> human generated <b>know-how,</b> such as step-by-step videos and instructions. This knowledge can be potentially reused in a wide variety of applications, but it cur-rently suffers from a lack of structure and isolation from related knowl-edge. To overcome these challenges we have developed a Linked Data framework which can automate the extraction <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> from exist-ing Web resources and generate links to related knowledge on the Linked Data Cloud. We have implemented our framework and used it to extract a Linked Data representation of two <b>of</b> the largest <b>know-how</b> reposi-tories on the Web. We demonstrate two possible uses of the resulting dataset <b>of</b> real-world <b>know-how.</b> Firstly, we use this dataset within a Web application to offer an integrated visualization <b>of</b> distributed <b>know-how</b> resources. Lastly, we show the potential of this dataset for inferring common sense knowledge about tasks. ...|$|R
40|$|There is an as yet {{unacknowledged}} and incomparable {{contribution to}} the philosophical debates about know-how {{to be found in}} the writings of Ludwig Wittgenstein. It is sourced in his investigations into knowledge and certainty in On Certainty, though it is not limited to these late passages. Understanding the ramifications of this putative contribution (even if one does not agree with it) highlights the extent to which (i) there is now a new range of issues pertaining to know-how which no future philosophical consideration of the topic can ignore, except on pain of failing to engage comprehensively with the subject; (ii) the topic <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> has been inappropriately marginalised by naturalized epistemology, and may well be as central to epistemology as the propositional knowledge which currently dominates epistemology???s attention; and (iii) any engagement with these potential Wittgensteinian contributions will need to be conducted in tandem with a reflection on the meta-philosophy of epistemology, since their potential impact extends to epistemology???s main methodology, i. e., naturalized reflective equilibrium. These three conclusions, together with a diagnosis of where and why all the current intellectualist accounts <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> are either internally inconsistent, or irreconcilably flawed on their own terms, provide the motivation and the opportunity for a New Epistemology <b>of</b> <b>Know-How.</b> These conclusions established, I offer one possible Wittgensteinian-orientated version of the New Epistemology <b>of</b> <b>Know-How,</b> providing the first example of a non-naturalized philosophical approach to the topic since Gilbert Ryle...|$|R
