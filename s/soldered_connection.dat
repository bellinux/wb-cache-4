50|$|With {{the rise}} of {{integrated}} circuits, reducing the absolute number of chips used represented another way to save costs. The goal of a designer {{is not just to}} make the simplest circuit, but to keep the component count down. Sometimes this results in more complicated designs with respect to the underlying digital logic but nevertheless reduces the number of components, board size, and even power consumption. A major motive for reducing component count on printed circuit boards is to reduce the manufacturing defect rate and increase reliability, as every <b>soldered</b> <b>connection</b> is a potentially bad one, so the defect and failure rates tend to increase along with the total number of component pins.|$|E

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the sphere of solder joints reliability. The {{narrower}} focus is use of lead-free solder alloy SAC 305 in the production process and parameters of its reliability. The text describes the main factors, which have the influence on the reliability of solder joints under conditions of thermal cycling. These factors also relate with choice of substrates and technological processes of preparation, which are characterized and described. Another part is devoted to estimating the reliability of soldered connections and are listed the fatigue model to estimate reliability. These fatigue models are categorized based on different physical mechanisms that operate in the soldered joints during operation. Based on the comparison of different models is selected the most appropriate model and in conjunction with simulation in ANSYS is estimated reliability.

40|$|Part 4 : Quality ManagementInternational audienceThe {{result of}} a {{computer}} tomography (CT) record is an image layer stack, which can be applied for medical diagnostic purposes, as well for virtual 3 D object representation (e. g. for a skull bone) depending on the used threshold values. Based on these representations, medical 3 D objects could be easily produced by generative manufacturing processes. The additive manufacturing of individual implants is also based {{on the use of}} CT data for the representation of the remaining bone. This knowledge was further used for the evaluation of industrial CT data. For technical applications, the industrial computer tomography becomes more and more important. Compared with devices from the medical area, industrial CT devices have a significantly higher radiation power and a much higher resolution. Thus, these data are not only suitable for the reconstruction of a 3 D model in the sense of reverse engineering, but also for the inspection of components of metal workpieces (density differences, cavities, joint connection). The known CT evaluation procedures from medical use have been qualified and further modified in the research group. The developed software solution allows the generation of free-form sections through a layer image stack e. g. to evaluate the quality of a <b>soldered</b> <b>connection</b> in a tube. This procedure is also suitable to detect and determine density differences and the detachment of individual layers of a generative produced component.

40|$|The {{accelerated}} approximate procedure {{developed and}} used herein for analysis, design and parametric optimization in electronic packaging {{is based on}} the disturbed state concept (DSC) and the hierarchical single surface (HISS) constitutive models. Over the past many years the benefits of the DSC/HISS model, compared to those of available plasticity models, have been demonstrated and validated {{for a wide range of}} materials and <b>solder</b> <b>connections.</b> When the DSC/HISS model is implemented in a two-dimensional finite element code, it is well suited for failure analyses of lead/tin <b>solder</b> <b>connections</b> under cyclic thermal and mechanical loading that are typically occur in electronic packages. Unfortunately, an analysis of a single <b>solder</b> <b>connection,</b> for approximately 4000 or more cycles, can require much effort and computer time, which may be too long to be of practical use. The accelerated approximate procedure significantly reduces the effort and the analysis time to approximately 10 to 15 minutes on a Pentium 4, 3. 2 GHz personal computer. The main emphasis of this dissertation is the use of the unified DSC model with the finite element procedure to predict the behavior of chip-substrate <b>solder</b> <b>connections.</b> The DSC code is used to validate the performance of a number of packages (144 BPGA, 313 PBGA) tested in the laboratory under thermomechanical loading. Using the accelerated approximate procedure, the effect of the variable thickness <b>solder</b> <b>connection</b> in a plane stress idealization is compared with that of the constant thickness assumption, and a three-dimensional analysis. It shows that the analysis with variable thickness (in plane stress idealization) yields improved results. The accelerated approximate procedure is then used to perform parametric design analyses of a <b>solder</b> <b>connection</b> by varying a number of important factors such as connection size, shape and misalignment. The effects of varying the DSC/HISS parameters on cycle life are also analyzed. The results of this research can be used for design, analysis and failure life prediction of <b>solder</b> <b>connections</b> in electronic packages. The accelerated approximate procedure is considered to yield improved results compared to other available modeling methods...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a soldering paste containing coated solder material particles (12) as above; (2) a soldering paste comprising particles of solder material particles enclosed in a binder (13), where the binder contains (a) metal stearate as defined above in an amount of at least 10 (preferably 20) wt. % based on the binder, (b) a solvent or dispersion medium in an amount of at least 50 wt. % and (c) other metal salts, up to 10 wt. % carboxylic acid and/or activators forming {{the remainder of the}} binder; (3) solder material {{in the form of a}} semi-finished product (specifically a wire or shaped article), where the semi-finished product is provided with a layer of solid metal stearate as defined above; (4) a support (17) with contact surfaces for electrical components (or electrical component with contact surfaces), where the contact surfaces are provided with a layer of solid metal stearate as defined above; (5) a support or electrical component with contact surfaces for a <b>soldered</b> <b>connection,</b> on which a solder deposit is formed, where the solder deposit is provided with a metal stearate layer, at least 20 (preferably at least 40) wt. % formed from metal stearate as defined above; (6) the use of a metal stearate (not necessarily as defined above) as flux for solders, where a solid layer of the metal stearate is applied to solder particles, semi-finished solder product, solder deposit on a supporting surface or component or solder connection contact surface on a supporting surface or component; and (7) the use of a metal stearate (not necessarily as defined above) as flux for solders, where the solder material consists of solder particles and a binder to which at least fatty acids and the metal stearate are added, the binder also including a dispersion medium or solvent for the metal stearate.

ADVANTAGE - The stearates of metals with relatively low thermodynamic activity towards oxygen provide metal ions with the necessary reducing effect to act as fluxes during soldering. Use of the present specific metal stearates (rather than e. g. copper stearate) reduces the amounts of conventional fluxes required, and provides resin-free soldering materials.
