The whole course of the design is summarized in the conclusion...|$|E
50|$|Before {{the coming}} of the railway, the Berkel was a major {{shipping}} route for goods from Münster to Eibergen, Borculo, and Zutphen, transported in flat-bottomed boats called Berkelzompen. In the 1950s, the Dutch stretch of the river was channelized to prevent flooding and to improve drainage. Recently old bends have been reconnected to the <b>straightened</b> <b>lengths</b> of the river.|$|R
50|$|Extreme {{floods in}} the first half of the 20th century, {{especially}} in 1929 and 1935, devastated Downtown Houston and resulted in a number of federally-funded flood control projects in the upper reaches of the watershed. The Texas Legislature created the Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) in 1937, and by the end of the 1930s, over $35 million ($ million in 2016 dollars) of federal, state, and county funds had been earmarked for an extensive drainage program. In then-rural western Harris County, the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed Barker Reservoir, completed in 1945, and Addicks Reservoir, completed in 1948. Combined, these reservoirs provide 410,000 acre-feet of runoff storage, which has largely prevented downstream flood events. Six miles of Buffalo Bayou between present-day Highway 6 and Beltway 8 was channelized during the construction of the reservoirs. Later, between 1953 and 1958, the stretch between Shepherd Drive and Sabine Street west of Downtown was also <b>straightened.</b> The <b>length</b> of bayou between these two channelized sections, which largely runs through the Memorial Villages, has remained in its natural, meandering state.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the root canal {{preparation}} ability of rotary nickel-titanium (NiTi) Hero 642 and K 3 files in curved mandibular or maxillary molars. A total of 40 extracted mandibular molars with two separate mesial canals, an apical width of approximately size ≤ 15 and a root canal curvature of 15 ‑ 30 ˚ were randomly divided into two groups and instrumented using Hero 642 (n= 20) or K 3 files (n= 20). Canal <b>straightening,</b> working <b>length,</b> transportation, cross-sectional area, minimum dentin thickness and the canal angle curvature degree were examined, and a systematic review of the literature was conducted. No statistically significant differ-ences were observed between the two groups with regard to the mean degree of straightening, mean change in working length, mean transportation, amount of dentin removed or remaining minimum dentin thickness (P> 0. 05). The canal angle curvature decreased in the two groups postoperatively. The systematic review identified six studies, and overall the two files performed similarly in the majority of categories examined. Therefore, the rotary NiTi Hero 642 and K 3 files demonstrated comparable shaping abilities and maintenance of working length...|$|R
2500|$|This is a {{mathematical}} problem of solving a triangle. [...] If a navigator {{knows how long}} the ship has sailed on the erroneous course, he can calculate its current distance from its intended course, and estimate how long it must sail back on a new bearing until it recovers its old course. [...] In the Corsica-to-Genoa example, there is an implied triangle ACD, with one side given (AC = 70 miles on actual NW course), a 45° angle at A (angle of difference between actual course NW and intended course N) and another angle of 90° at C (angle of difference between actual course NW and return course NE). [...] The challenge to the navigator is to find how long one must sail on the NE return course (the length of side CD, {{what is called the}} ritorno) and how far one has advanced on the intended course by the time one <b>straightens</b> out (the <b>length</b> of the hypotenuse AD, or what is called the total avanzo).|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{urethral}} length has {{not been}} measured in the Indian population. Even the international literature in this arena is very sparse. This paper {{is an attempt to}} develop a simple anatomical database for urethral length. Materials and Methods: Between January 2010 and April 2011, the urethral lengths of 422 adult male patients who required catheterization as part of regular treatment at our hospital, were recorded after obtaining consent from the patients and from the scientific and ethics review boards of the institution. Patients with history of prostatic or urethral abnormalities were excluded. The balloon of a sterile Foley′s catheter was inflated using 10 cc of saline. The length from the junction of the balloon to the ′Y′ junction of the Foley was measured. The catheter was then passed into the bladder and re-inflated to same volume. The penis was gently <b>straightened</b> and the <b>length</b> of the catheter outside the penis was measured till the premarked point at the ′Y′ junction. Subtracting this from the original length gave the length of the urethra. Results: The mean length of the urethra was 17. 55 + 1. 42 cm with a range between 14 and 22. 5 cm. Conclusions: Literature in which the length of the normal adult male urethra is recorded for a significant sample size is very scarce. Our data adds to basic anatomic information of the male urethra specific to the Indian population. Statistical Methods: Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. The non-linear regression analysis was employed to find the normative values of urethral length according to age class...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the role of climate change in catchments that are already under pressure of human activities one needs to study past, current and future conditions. Therefore, the catchment of the river Vecht (The Netherlands), representative for many human utilised, medium-sized lowland river catchments in this ecoregion, was chosen as case example. Canalisation of the river Vecht went along with changes in land-use and took place during three major time-intervals: ± 1895 - 1905, 1925 - 1935, and 1955 - 1965. As elsewhere in Europe, the agricultural, urban and other human uses increased and the morphological features of the streams showed degradation over the last 100 years. Most streams were <b>straightened,</b> total stream <b>length</b> was shortened (20 %), many connected side-arms got lost (40 %), {{and the number of}} oxbows decreased (38 %). There was a positive trend in temperature and precipitation observed over the last hundred years. But land-use and hydromorphology changes were independent from climate change. Six climate scenarios (two current and four for the years 2070 - 2100; SIMGRO model) showed that discharge will become somewhat more dynamic. The future low flow conditions predicted (MLR-EKOO model) macroinvertebrate assemblages that are more often found in temporary, -mesosaprobic, natural upper courses and polysaprobic, natural and canalised upper- and middle courses. This indicates slight quality deterioration. But comparing the major changes in land-use in the past that dramatically affected the stream ecosystems with these predicted small climate change induced changes justifies the conclusion that future land-use change will be of much greater importance than the effect of climate chang...|$|R
40|$|Titin (also {{known as}} connectin) is a muscle-specific giant protein found inside the sarcomere, {{spanning}} from the Z-line to the M-line. The I-band segment of titin {{is considered to}} function as a molecular spring that develops tension when sarcomeres are stretched (passive tension). Recent studies on skeletal muscle indicate {{that it is not the}} entire I-band segment of titin that behaves as a spring; some sections are inelastic and do not take part in the development of passive tension. To better understand the mechanism of passive tension development in the heart, where passive tension plays an essential role in the pumping function, we investigated titin's elastic segment in cardiac myocytes using structural and mechanical techniques. Single cardiac myocytes were stretched by various amounts and then immunolabeled and processed for electron microscopy in the stretched state. Monoclonal antibodies that recognize different titin epitopes were used, and the locations of the titin epitopes in the sarcomere were studied as a function of sarcomere length. We found that only a small region of the I-band segment of titin is elastic; its contour length is estimated at approximately 75 nm, which is only approximately 40 % of the total I-band segment of titin. Passive tension measurements indicated that the fundamental determinant of how much passive tension the heart develops is the strain of titin's elastic segment. Furthermore, we found evidence that in sarcomeres that are slack (length, approximately 1. 85 microns) the elastic titin segment is highly folded on top of itself. Based on the data, we propose a two-stage mechanism of passive tension development in the heart, in which, between sarcomere lengths of approximately 1. 85 microns and approximately 2. 0 microns, titin's elastic segment <b>straightens</b> and, at <b>lengths</b> longer than approximately 2. 0 microns, the molecular domains that make up titin's elastic segment unravel. Sarcomere shortening to lengths below slack (approximately 1. 85 microns) also results in straightening of the elastic titin segment, giving rise to a force that opposes shortening and that tends to bring sarcomeres back to their slack length...|$|R
40|$|Hierarchical {{structures}} {{developed from}} nanoscale building blocks offer {{an excellent opportunity}} to control properties on all length scales, from the molecular level up to the macroscale. Many beautiful examples in Nature have demonstrated the significance of controlling geometry and mechanics on small length scales to control function on an organism-level, shown by the strength of bones, the toughness of a mollusk 2 ̆ 7 s shell, or the gecko 2 ̆ 7 s ability to climb walls. Inspired by stunning examples in both Nature and common man-made materials and structures, we assemble polymers and inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) with well-defined surface chemistry into long ribbons and fabric-like networks with unprecedented length scales. In particular, {{we focus on the}} geometry and mechanics of these structures when released from their underlying substrate, as well as the fabrication methods to create such structures. This thesis describes four concepts in detail: (1) the development of an evaporative assembly method used to prepare polymer and NP mesoscale structures, referred to as flexible blade flow coating, (2) the spontaneous formation of helical ribbons, driven by a 2 -phase elastocapillary balance between surface tension and elasticity of an asymmetric geometry, (3) the mechanical stretching properties of NP-based helical ribbons, and (4) the deformation, shape and fluid-structure interactions of small, flexible, polymeric microhelices in viscous flow. We first describe flexible blade flow coating, a technique that enables the fabrication of polymer, NP and hybrid mesostructures spanning several length scales. By controlling the fabrication parameters, a wide range of materials can be used to create a wide range of geometries, such as ribbons and fabrics. This method relies upon controlled evaporation of a dilute solution confined between a thin polymer film and a flat substrate. By taking advantage of crosslinkable ligand chemistry and the use of a water-soluble sacrificial layer, the structures are liberated from their substrates, affording robust structures floating at the air-liquid interface or fully submerged. When fully submerged in a fluid with sufficient interfacial tension, like water, we discovered that ribbons spontaneously formed helices. By starting from a general expression that balances the elastic bending energy and surface tension of an asymmetric cross-sectional geometry, we determined that this helical formation is due to the asymmetric reduction of surface area upon bending (serving to lower the system energy). This leads ribbons to bend into helices with a preferred radius governed by both the modulus and interfacial tension, as well as ribbon thickness (R Et 2 /γ). This universal, geometry-based mechanism provides a new opportunity to create helices from any class of material, which is demonstrated by implementing metallic, ceramic and magnetic NPs, as well as homopolymers. Upon understanding the mechanics of helical formation, we examined the mechanical properties of NP-based helical ribbons. Through the use of a custom-designed mechanical measurement tool, which is capable of measuring nN forces over displacements of 100 s of microns or greater, we experimentally measured the force-displacement relationship of these helices. We show that this curve can be predicted through the elastic energy and surface-driven helical shape. Our experiments revealed massive stretchability, where helices are able stretch to their fully <b>straightened</b> contour <b>length,</b> as high as 23 times their original length. At low strains, the helices display stiffness values similar to single polymer chains or biological helices (10 - 6 N/m), and when fully stretched, display properties similar to synthetic polymer nanofibers. Motivated by small, flexible helices in fluids found in Nature, like swimming bacterial flagella, we expand our studies to examine single helices in viscous fluid flow. We fixed one end of a helix while leaving the other free, placed it into a microchannel, and applied a controlled fluid flow rate. Using PMMA as our model polymeric material, we found that the axial deformation is well-described by a nonlinear helix of finite extensibility, defined by a balance between the viscous and elastic forces. From our experiments, we describe the pitch distribution of a deformed helix in flow, as well as calculate a frictional coefficient for the helical geometry. At high flow rates, we qualitatively observed a global-to-local helical shape instability. Finally, we extend the study to show preliminary results on the deformation of NP-based helices...|$|R
