5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members of the band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought {{it was some kind of}} gang slaying.|$|E

25|$|A {{few minutes}} before the detonation, De la Penne {{informed}} Captain Morgan of the imminent explosion, {{in order to allow}} the British to evacuate the ship, but continued to refuse to disclose where the mine had been placed. The two frogmen were immediately sent back to their confinement place. Few minutes later, the mine exploded. Although hurt by the explosion, the frogmen reached the deck of the Valiant just in time to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> mines explode under the Queen Elizabeth, Sagona and Jervis.|$|E

25|$|Some {{researchers}} came to {{the conclusion}} that children growing up in these tightly knit communities tended to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> children around them as ersatz siblings and preferred to seek mates outside the community when they reached maturity. Some theorize that living amongst one another on a daily basis virtually from birth on produced an extreme version of the Westermarck effect, which diminished teenage kibbutzniks' sexual attraction to one another. Partly as a result of not finding a mate from within the kibbutz, youth often abandon kibbutz life as adults.|$|E

Near apoapse, the disc would shrink to 60 arc seconds for A, 43 arc seconds for B, being too small to resolve by naked eye. In any case, the dazzling surface brightness could make the discs harder to resolve than a similarly sized less bright object.|$|E
25|$|Stockholm and Andrea Doria were {{experiencing}} different weather conditions {{immediately prior to}} the collision. The collision occurred {{in an area of}} the northern Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Massachusetts, where heavy and intermittent fog is common. Although Andrea Doria had been engulfed in the fog for several hours, Stockholm had only recently entered the bank and was still acclimating to atmospheric conditions. The officer in charge of Stockholm incorrectly assumed that his inability to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> vessel was due to conditions other than fog, such as the other ship being a very small fishing vessel or a 'blacked-out' warship on maneuvers. He testified that he had no idea it was another passenger liner speeding through fog.|$|E

25|$|The two of {{them are}} taken {{to the edge of the}} Discworld by the ocean {{currents}} and nearly carried over, but they are caught by the Circumfence, a huge net built by the nation of Krull to catch sea life and flotsam washed in from the rest of the Discworld. They are rescued by Tethis the sea troll, a being composed of water who had fallen off the edge of his own world and onto the Discworld, where he was subsequently enslaved by the Krullians. Rincewind and Twoflower are then taken by the Krullians to their capital, where they learn that the Krullians intend to discover the sex of Great A'Tuin by launching a space capsule over the edge of the Disc, and plan to sacrifice Rincewind and Twoflower to get the god Fate to smile on the voyage, Fate insisting on their sacrifice after they caused him to lose the earlier game. Rincewind and Twoflower attempt to escape, but end up stealing the capsule, which is launched with Twoflower inside, the tourist wishing to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> worlds of the universe. Rincewind is unable to get into the capsule in time, and falls off the Disc alongside it, the Luggage following them soon after.|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Ogre was {{combined}} with another game called G.E.V. (an Ogre sequel) in a Ogre/G.E.V. box. The Ogre rules were designated as 4th edition and the G.E.V. rules were designated as 3rd edition. Ogre/G.E.V. was released {{into a single}} 5 3/8" [...] x 8 1/2" [...] box, and the rules were combined into a single 4" [...] x 7" [...] booklet. The rules were printed so that the booklet was flipped over to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> rules. Counters were in green and white (2-sided), and maps {{were the same as}} the 3rd edition maps for both Ogre and G.E.V., but printed in the same sheet. In 2000, Ogre/G.E.V. was released again and designated as 5th edition, with new cover art by Phillip Reed, sold in a VHS box, but rules still in a 4" [...] x 7", 44-page booklet and counters in black, red and white (2-sided).|$|E
500|$|Otter and Staunch both fell rapidly behind Boadicea, while Africaine pulled far ahead. By 18:20, lookouts on Africaine {{could no}} longer <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> British ships, and by 18:30, Boadicea was {{similarly}} alone. Bouvet realised the lack of cohesion in the British squadron, and also recognised that Africaine was faster than either of his ships and would soon catch them. As a result, he slowed and prepared to meet the British frigate as night fell. Corbet now found himself outnumbered and began to launch rockets and flares {{in the hope of}} attracting Rowley's attention and as the French closed with Africaine, he readied his ship for action. [...] behind, Rowley could see the flares and flashes but was powerless to intercede in the darkness. At 01:50 on 13 September, the gap had closed between Africaine and the French ships, and at 02:20 Corbet opened fire on Astrée, with Bouvet returning the fire immediately.|$|E
500|$|Friction emerged at McLaren {{over the}} race weekend. Fernando Alonso {{publicly}} criticised the power unit provided by local company Honda. When being overtaken by Max Verstappen on lap 27, Alonso yelled [...] "GP2 engine, GP2!" [...] {{on the team}} radio, comparing his power unit with those of Formula One's feeder series. Alonso elaborated after the race, saying: [...] "I feel embarrassed when I'm racing sometimes because it's frustrating when you <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> cars making mistakes, going off the racing line, getting sideways. You {{look in the mirror}} on the straight to look for them and they are already side by side with you. The deficit we have on power is like another category." [...] Team CEO Ron Dennis in turn criticised Alonso for his outspoken words, saying: [...] "It doesn't show the professionalism I would like all our drivers to show." [...] Jenson Button had expounded the problems of the power unit on team radio as well, lamenting the fact that other cars had been able to pass him into 130R corner. The row in the team, which The Daily Telegraph described as being a [...] "complete meltdown", came amidst speculation about the future of both drivers. Ron Dennis admitted publicly to not having dealt with the question of Jenson Button's role in [...] earlier, following much debate over the driver's future. However, speculation ended when Button was confirmed as a McLaren driver for 2016 just five days later. After the race, Alonso had also left his future with the team open, but made it clear a day later that he intended to end his career with the team, writing: [...] "No one should have any doubt that I have three years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team, hopefully winning everything." [...] About his comments on the team radio he said: [...] "We keep working hard. We all want to win and sometimes transmit the team radios, but it should be private chats." ...|$|E

500|$|Scholars {{have long}} noted Shakespeare's {{widespread}} use {{of light and dark}} imagery throughout the play. Caroline Spurgeon considers the theme of light as [...] "symbolic of the natural beauty of young love" [...] and later critics have expanded on this interpretation. For example, both Romeo and Juliet <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun, brighter than a torch, a jewel sparkling in the night, and a bright angel among dark clouds. Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her [...] "beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light." [...] Juliet describes Romeo as [...] "day in night" [...] and [...] "Whiter than snow upon a raven's back." [...] This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols—contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way. Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony. For example, Romeo and Juliet's love is a light {{in the midst of the}} darkness of the hate around them, but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight. This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the moral dilemma facing the two lovers: loyalty to family or loyalty to love. At the end of the story, when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow, light and dark have returned to their proper places, the outward darkness reflecting the true, inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers. All characters now recognise their folly in light of recent events, and things return to the natural order, thanks to the love and death of Romeo and Juliet. The [...] "light" [...] theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars.|$|E

However, the solution is stationary, so it might seem that an observer riding on a dust grain will not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> grains rotating about himself. However, recall that while the first frame given above (the [...] ) appears static in our chart, the Fermi–Walker derivatives show that, in fact, it is spinning with respect to gyroscopes.
