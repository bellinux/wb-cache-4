We {{compute the}} mean drag coefficient CD,ϕ at different incident angles ϕ {{for a wide}} range of Reynolds numbers (Re). We show that the <b>sine-squared</b> drag law CD,ϕ=CD,ϕ= 0 ∘+(CD,ϕ= 90 ∘−CD,ϕ= 0 ∘) sin 2 ϕ holds up to large Reynolds numbers, Re= 2000. Further, we explore the physical origin behind the <b>sine-squared</b> law, and reveal that, surprisingly, this does not occur due to linearity of flow fields. Instead, it occurs due to an interesting pattern of pressure distribution contributing to the drag at higher Re for different incident angles. The present results demonstrate that it is possible to perform just two simulations at ϕ= 0 ∘ and ϕ= 90 ∘ for a given Re and obtain particle-shape-specific CD at arbitrary incident angles. However, the model has limited applicability to flatter oblate spheroids, which do not exhibit the <b>sine-squared</b> interpolation, even for Re= 100, due to stronger wake-induced drag. Regarding lift coefficients, we find that the equivalent theoretical equation can provide a reasonable approximation, even at high Re, for prolate spheroids.

Examples of such deformed evolution operators include the entanglement Hamiltonian, and the so-called <b>sine-square</b> deformation of the CFT. Within our construction, the spectrum and the (finite-size) scaling of the level spacing of the deformed evolution operator are known exactly.

For the XY chain and the transverse field Ising chain at criticality, it is shown that the ground state of an open system with SSD is identical to that of a uniform chain with periodic boundary conditions. The same holds for the massless Dirac fermions with SSD, corresponding to the continuum limit of the gapless XY chain. For general CFTs, we find that the Hamiltonian of a system with SSD has an expression in terms of the generators of the Virasoro algebra. This allows us to show that the vacuum state is an exact eigenstate of the <b>sine-square</b> deformed Hamiltonian. Furthermore, for a restricted class of CFTs associated with affine Lie (Kac-Moody) algebras, including c= 1 Gaussian CFT, we prove that the vacuum is an exact ground state of the deformed Hamiltonian.

An explicit conservative control-volume formation makes use of a universal limiter for transient interpolation modeling of the advective transport equations. This ULTIMATE conservative difference scheme is applied to unsteady, one-dimensional scalar pure advection at constant velocity, using three critical test profiles: an isolated <b>sine-squared</b> wave, a discontinuous step, and a semi-ellipse. The goal, of course, is to devise a single robust scheme which achieves sharp monotonic resolution of the step without corrupting the other profiles. The semi-ellipse is particularly challenging because of its combination of sudden and gradual changes in gradient. The ULTIMATE strategy {{can be applied to}} explicit conservation schemes of any order of accuracy. Second-order schemes are unsatisfactory, showing steepening and clipping typical of currently popular so-called high resolution shock-capturing of TVD schemes.

This is consistent with the nuclear medium having little influence on the fragmentation process. Furthermore, there is no statistically significant increase in the value of from p+p to d+Au collisions.

40|$|Trees {{and shrubs}} in {{tropical}} Africa use the C 3 cycle as a carbon fixation pathway during photosynthesis, while grasses and sedges mostly use the C 4 cycle. Leaf-wax lipids from sedimentary archives {{such as the}} long-chain n-alkanes (e. g., n-C 27 to n-C 33) inherit carbon isotope ratios that {{are representative of the}} carbon fixation pathway. Therefore, n-alkane d 13 C values are often used to reconstruct past C 3 /C 4 composition of vegetation, assuming that the relative proportions of C 3 and C 4 leaf waxes reflect the relative proportions of C 3 and C 4 plants. We have compared the d 13 C values of n-alkanes from modern C 3 and C 4 plants with previously published values from recent lake sediments and provide a framework for estimating the fractional contribution (areal-based) of C 3 vegetation cover (f C 3) represented by these sedimentary archives. Samples were collected in Cameroon, across a latitudinal transect that accommodates a wide range of climate zones and vegetation types, as reflected in the progressive northward replacement of C 3 -dominated rain forest by C 4 -dominated savanna. The C 3 plants analysed were characterised by substantially higher abundances of n-C 29 alkanes and by substantially lower abundances of n-C 33 alkanes than the C 4 plants. Furthermore, the sedimentary d 13 C values of n-C 29 and n-C 31 alkanes from recent lake sediments in Cameroon (37. 4 & to 26. 5 &) were generally within the range of d 13 C values for C 3 plants, even when from sites where C 4 plants dominated the catchment vegetation. In such cases simple linear mixing models fail to accurately reconstruct the relative proportions of C 3 and C 4 vegetation cover when using the d 13 C values of sedimentary n-alkanes, overestimating the proportion of C 3 vegetation, likely {{as a consequence of the}} differences in plant wax production, preservation, transport, and/or deposition between C 3 and C 4 plants. We therefore tested a set of non-linear binary mixing models using d 13 C values from both C 3 and C 4 vegetation as end-members. The non-linear models included a sigmoid function (<b>sine-squared)</b> that describes small variations in the f C 3 values as the minimum and maximum d 13 C values are approached, and a hyperbolic function that takes into account the differences between C 3 and C 4 plants discussed above. Model fitting and the estimation of uncertainties were completed using the Monte Carlo algorithm and can be improved by future data addition. Models that provided the best fit with the observed d 13 C values of sedimentary n-alkanes were either hyperbolic functions or a combination of hyperbolic and <b>sine-squared</b> functions. Such non-linear models may be used to convert d 13 C measurements on sedimentary n-alkanes directly into reconstructions of C 3 vegetation cover...|$|E
40|$|Z-pinch plasma {{dynamics}} {{are largely}} {{determined by the}} current and magnetic field topology of the system. Measurement of the magnetic fields allows for the inference of the current distribution, but is in practice difficult to measure in experiments. This leads to a high dependence on numerical simulations for extracting this information, but without quality experimental data, may not be entirely reliable for this purpose. Proton deflectometry, or proton radiography, {{is a relatively new}} diagnostic developed for investigating electromagnetic fields in high energy-density plasmas since it provides data with high spatial and temporal resolution compared to traditional field diagnostics. It was developed in the laser-plasma-interaction community as a means of determining electric and magnetic field strength and orientation during laser-driven plasma experiments. In this work, the method was developed for use on Mega-Amp- scale pulsed-power-driven plasma experiments. In one configuration, a proton beam was directed radially, with respect to the z-axis of a pulsed-power-driven short- circuit load. In this setup, an azimuthally symmetric magnetic field is generated around the short-circuit load, as a current pulse, 0. 6 MA in 0 - 100 % rise-time 200 ns with an approximately <b>sine-squared</b> waveform. Scaled laboratory astrophysics experiments modeling the dynamics of universal astrophysical phenomena such as plasma jets have recently become an area of great interest. Such experiments are vital to resolving long-standing questions about the roles of various physical processes in the dynamics of such objects. The application of proton deflectometry to scaled laboratory astrophysics experiments revealed details of the current and magnetic field topology which was previously accessible only in numerical codes. One such load is the radial foil load, designed to replicate the propagation of a jet during the formation stages of a star. The data from this work was used to benchmark a resistive MHD code, Gorgon, designed to reproduce the Z-pinch experiments as well as astrophysical phenomena. The simulation results were found to agree with the experimental data, meaning that the current and magnetic field topology could be recovered from the code.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of PhysicsUwe ThummAlthough {{the latest}} and most {{powerful}} supercomputer today, Tianhe- 2 in China, can finish 33. 86 quadrillion floating-point operations per second (www. top 500. org), {{it is still a}} big challenge to simulate the simplest few-electron system - the helium atom - a threebody system with one nucleus and two electrons. Within the fixed-nucleus approximation and time-dependent close coupling (TDCC) approach, we developed software to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) accurately, implementing the finite-element discrete-variable representation (FE-DVR) scheme. The general idea of the method is to expand the wave functions in the eigenvectors of the angular momentum operator, which further transform the six-dimensional TDSE to a set of infinite two-dimensional coupled equations. Although there are infinitely many coupled equations, they can be truncated to a finite number of equations by applying selection rules and physical requirements, and solved with our current computational resources. By numerically solving the TDSE in full dimensionality, we investigate the double photoionization of helium atoms in external fields. In co-planar emission geometry with and without the presence of a comparatively weak infrared (IR) laser pulse, we discuss the double ionization (DI) dynamics of helium atoms irradiated by ultrashort pulses of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) laser light. We first investigate the degree of electronic correlation by correlated photoelectron angular distributions for two-photon double ionization (TPDI) of helium atoms in the sequential and non-sequential DI regime. We quantify sequential and non-sequential contributions to TPDI driven by an XUV pulse with central photon energy hw[subscript]xuv near the sequential DI threshold. If the spectral width of the XUV pulse is broad enough, both the sequntial (hw[subscript]xuv > 54. 4 eV) and non-sequential (hw[subscript]xuv < 54. 4 eV) channels are open. Therefore, the sequential and non-sequential DI mechanisms are difficult to distinguish. By tracking the DI asymmetry in joint photoelectron angular distributions, we introduce the forward-backward-emission asymmetry as a measure that allows the distinction of sequential and non-sequential contributions. Specifically, for hw[subscript]xuv = 50 eV pulses with a <b>sine-squared</b> temporal profile, we find that the sequential DI contribution is the largest at a pulse length of 650 as (1 as = 10 [superscript]− 18 s), due to competing temporal and spectral constraints. In addition, we validate a simple heuristic expression for the sequential DI contribution in comparison with ab initio calculations. We then investigate the influence of the laser field on the DI of helium by a single XUV pulse. For IR-laser-assisted single-XUV-photon DI our joint angular distributions show that the IR-laser field enhances back-to-back electron emission and induces a characteristic splitting in the angular distribution for electrons that are emitted symmetrically relative to the identical linear polarization directions of the XUV and IR pulse. These IR-pulse-induced changes in photoelectron angular distributions are (i) imposed by different symmetry constraints for XUV-pulse-only and laser-assisted XUV-photon DI, (ii) robust over a large range of energy sharing between the emitted electrons, and (iii) consistent with the transfer of discrete IR-photon momenta to both photoelectrons from the assisting IR-laser field. While selection-rule forbidden at equal energy sharing, for increasingly unequal energy sharing we find back-to-back emission to become more likely and to compete with symmetric emission. To obtain a high level of accuracy, accurate quantum-mechanical calculations of three Coulomb interacting particales exposed to an intense XUV and weak IR field are at the limit of current computational power. Any direct extension (such as strong laser-field intensity, elliptically-polarized field, and laser-induced DI) of our approach to more complicated systems appears to be currently out of reach. At the end of this thesis, we give suggestions on how to improve the efficiency of TDSE calculations for simulations of these complicated many-photon processes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — ClOVER is a UK funded {{experiment}} {{to be based}} in the Atacama Desert to measure the B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave background between multipoles of 20 and 1000 down to foreground limited sensitivities. One of two telescopes will operate large focal plate arrays at 150 and 225 GHz, using TES bolometers. The feeds to these bolometers utilise corrugated horns with novel features which meet with two important performance requirements: very low sidelobes, to avoid uncontrolled signal contamination and high pass filtering to control the fields presented to the Radial Probe detectors. The former is provide by a design, developed by Graham Smith in St. Andrews, to deliberately excite HE 12 higher order modes in a <b>sine-square</b> profile section of the horn, followed by an extended parallel section designed to bring the HE 12 mode into phase with the dominate HE 1 1 mode. Surprisingly wide bandwidths – at the 30...|$|R
40|$|In the {{conventional}} quantum mechanics (i. e., hermitian QM) the adia- batic theorem for systems subjected to time periodic fields holds only for bound systems {{and not for}} open ones (where ionization and dissociation take place) [D. W. Hone, R. Ketzmerik, and W. Kohn, Phys. Rev. A 56, 4045 (1997) ]. Here {{with the help of}} the (t,t') formalism combined with the complex scaling method we derive an adiabatic theorem for open systems and provide an analytical criteria for the validity of the adiabatic limit. The use of the complex scaling transformation plays a key role in our derivation. As a numerical example we apply the adiabatic theorem we derived to a 1 D model Hamiltonian of Xe atom which interacts with strong, monochromatic <b>sine-square</b> laser pulses. We show that the gener- ation of odd-order harmonics and the absence of hyper-Raman lines, even when the pulses are extremely short, can be explained {{with the help of the}} adiabatic theorem we derived...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} ground state of S = 1 / 2 Heisenberg model on the {{checkerboard}} lattice in {{a magnetic field}} by the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with the <b>sine-square</b> deformation. We obtain magnetization plateaus at M/M_ sat= 0, 1 / 4, 3 / 8, 1 / 2, and 3 / 4 where M_ sat is the saturated magnetization. The obtained 3 / 4 plateau state {{is consistent with the}} exact result, and the 1 / 2 plateau is found to have a four-spin resonating loop structure similar to the six-spin loop structure of the 1 / 3 plateau of the kagome lattice. Different four-spin loop structures are obtained in the 1 / 4 and 3 / 8 plateaus but no corresponding states exist in the kagome lattice. The 3 / 8 plateau has a unique magnetic structure of three types of four-spin local quantum states in a 4 √(2) × 2 √(2) magnetic unit cell with a 16 -fold degeneracy...|$|R
