Multicasting in datagram internetworks enables multi-party interactions among users distributed over wide areas by eliminating duplicate packets in one-to-many and many-to-many communication. It requires {{formation of a}} tree to distribute multicast data to the communicating group of members. Present multicast techniques need improvement in <b>scope</b> <b>control,</b> resource discovery mechanisms, and tree construction to efficiently support {{a large number of}} global groups with dense as well as sparse membership. We deploy a hierarchy of clustered routers with the following features to make these improvements. Each group is assigned a scope level enabling access to resources at that level when members join and permits well-defined boundaries for <b>scope</b> <b>control.</b> The list of border routers and presence of groups at any level is maintained and supplied to members by a level-specific resource discovery mechanism called a registrar. To make tree construction scalable, the border routers determine the shortest inter-cluster paths to source clusters using the available unicast routing information, facilitator aggregation of router state for all senders in a cluster. Unlike the existing approaches, administrative configuration of the hierarchy eliminates the need for locating distribution centers dynamically[URL] United States Nav...|$|E

The <b>Scope</b> <b>Control</b> process influences the factors that lead to project scope changes and control the impact of those changes, which a key issue for project success. It ensures that all requested changes and recommended corrective actions are processed and that changes are reduced or eliminated if they result in negative impact on projects. The <b>scope</b> <b>control</b> is considered from the investor’s point of view, as achieving the project goals is of primary importance for the investor. The theoretical basis for the research is Dynamic Planning and Control Methodology (“DPM”). Practical implications and adjustments are obtained, to result in an efficient system for managing changes throughout a project. Research was conducted through questionnaire and interviews. Findings include reasons for and consequences of changes {{from the point of}} view of various stakeholders in the project, as well as recommended procedures for objective and practical management of the changes. The study discusses the basic constraints: cost and time. Further research should focus on quantifying and determining the quality impact of changes and impact of the project manager’s competencies on managing changes. The recommended procedures are applicable for any building construction project, but specific goals and constraints have to be incorporated into the calculation. Furthermore, a database of projects and changes could be created to facilitate preliminary assessments of the impact of changes on future projects...|$|E

The key benefit is that parsed syntactic structures are shown to form sufficient input for semantic evaluation, eliminating the need to build distinct semantic expressions to feed semantic evaluation. To have parsed syntactic structures for SCT to evaluate we apply an existing wide-coverage syntactic parser by converting the parser output into a form SCT can receive.

40|$|Multicasting, the {{transmission}} of a packet {{to a group of}} hosts, is an important service for improving the efficiency and robustness of distributed systems and applications. Although multicast capability is available and widely used in local area networks, when those LANs are interconnected by store-and-forward routers, the multicast service is usually not offered across the resulting internetwork. To address this limitation, we specify extensions to two common internetwork routing algorithms-distance-vector routing and link-state routing-to support low-delay datagram multicasting beyond a single LAN. We also describe modifications to the single-spanning-tree routing algorithm commonly used by link-layer bridges, to reduce the costs of multicasting in large extended LANs. Finally, we discuss how the use of multicast <b>scope</b> <b>control</b> and hierarchical multicast routing allows the multicast service to scale up to large internetworks...|$|E

40|$|We {{follow the}} stack-baaed {{approach}} to query languages {{which is a}} new formal and intel-lectual paradigm for integrating querying and programming for object-oriented databases. Queries are considered generalized program-ing expressions which may be used within macroscopic imperative statements, such as creating, updating, inserting, and deleting data objects. Queries may be also used as pro-cedures ’ parameters, as well as determine the output from functional procedures (SQL-like views). The semantics, including generalized query operators (selection, projection, naviga-tion, join, quantifiers, etc.), is {{defined in terms of}} operations on two stacks. The environment stack deals with the <b>scope</b> <b>control</b> and bind-ing names. The result stack stores intermedi-ate and final query results.

According to this property, we have designed the CR implementation which can work with a common and well-known http server and database implementations. More precisely, our CR has been implemented as modules used with an Apache http server. In addition, while the channel information including the policy configuration is defined in XML format in CR, all the information are converted and stored in MySQL efficiently. Such the implementation strategy reduces the operator's maintenance cost and finally contributes to the easy deployment...|$|E

However, the main solutions in current literature lack energy efficient design to meet the severely limited energy resources in WSNs. In this paper, we propose a dual mode Interest forwarding scheme (called DMIF in short) for NDN-based WSNs. The DMIF consists of two combined forwarding modes, in which several energy efficient mechanisms including flexible mode shift, flooding <b>scope</b> <b>control,</b> broadcast storm avoidance, packet suppression, and energy weight factors are designed to save and balance the energy consumption. We extend the ndnSIM to support wireless multihop communication to validate the proposed scheme. Simulation experiments show that the DMIF outperforms the baseline schemes in terms of total energy consumption, energy equilibrium rate, and network lifetime...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} formalisms based on Linear Logic have been {{successfully}} employed for specifying concurrent systems. Nevertheless, {{there has been a}} much minor interest in providing an efficient implementation of them. An inconvenience of some of these approaches is the non-determinism generated by the resource management.
