40|$|A {{combination}} of various measures (self-report, learning outcomes and written reports) {{was employed to}} investigate 104 pre-service teachers’ competencies in <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>integration</b> after enrolling in an Instructional Technology course. The pre-service teachers engaged in a “learning technology by design” approach in which they worked in design teams to develop spreadsheet-enhanced solutions to authentic mathematical problems. Their developed competencies were reported in their evolving lesson outcomes (TPACK evidence {{in the analysis of}} lesson plan product and observed instruction) and self-reported TPACK. The learning outcome provided specific information and concrete representations of what the pre-service teachers could actually do with technology {{as a result of their}} TPACK development. The study showed that, the teachers developed and improved their competencies in technology integration as a result of strategies used in the design of the technology integration cours...|$|E
40|$|Spreadsheets contain {{valuable}} data on many topics. How-ever, spreadsheets {{are difficult}} to integrate with other data sources. Converting spreadsheet data to the relational model would allow data analysts to use relational integration tools. We propose a two-phase semiautomatic system that ex-tracts accurate relational metadata while minimizing user effort. Based on an undirected graphical model, our sys-tem enables downstream <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>integration</b> applica-tions. First, the automatic extractor uses hints from spread-sheets ’ graphical style and recovered metadata to extract the spreadsheet data as accurately as possible. Second, the interactive repair identifies similar regions in distinct spread-sheets scattered across large spreadsheet corpora, allowing a user’s single manual repair to be amortized over many possible extraction errors. Our experiments show that a hu-man can obtain the accurate extraction with just 31 % of the manual operations required by a standard classification based technique on two real-world datasets...|$|E
40|$|Spreadsheets {{contain a}} huge amount of high-value data but do not observe a {{standard}} data model and thus are difficult to integrate. A large number of data integration tools exist, but they generally can only work on relational data. Existing systems for extracting relational data from spreadsheets are too labor intensive to support ad-hoc integration tasks, in which the correct extraction target is only learned during the course of user interaction. This paper introduces a system that automatically extracts relational data from spreadsheets, thereby enabling relational <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>integration.</b> The resulting integrated relational data can be queried directly or can be translated into RDF triples. When compared to standard techniques for spreadsheet data extraction on a set of 100 random Web spreadsheets, the system reduces the amount of human labor by 72 % to 92 %. In addition to the system design, we present the results of a general survey of more than 400, 000 spreadsheets we downloaded from the Web, giving a novel view of how users organize their data in spreadsheets. 1...|$|E

40|$|The SUERC Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory has {{recently}} replaced its spreadsheet-based record keeping {{with a new}} database program, custom designed to help laboratory staff manage the high throughput of nearly 5000 cathodes in the past year. The system can accept data {{from a variety of}} sources in addition to manual entry; experimental results can be uploaded from <b>spreadsheets,</b> while <b>integration</b> with graphitisation lines means that graphite yields are automatically recorded. The system is able to pass radiocarbon results directly to OxCal 4 for calibration, with the resulting plots incorporated into the dating certificates issued to submitters. There are also benefits to submitters, with electronic sample submission both eliminating transcription errors and speeding up the logging-in process which keeps turnaround times down. For bone samples, data on collagen yields are now stored electronically and are more readily obtainable from the laboratory. The new SUERC Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory database will make a significant contribution to maintaining the high quality of results produced by the laboratory, aiding staff in tracking sample progress and monitoring quality assurance (QA) samples going through the laboratory, eliminating transcription errors and making communication easier between laboratory staff and sample submitters...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of {{spreadsheets}} in budgeting in order to explain how and why spreadsheets are used or not used in budgeting practice. Guided by modern budgeting research, budgeting is considered as a social phenomenon which requires flexibility for decision-making and integration for management control. Twenty-one interviews with business controllers in eleven leading for-profit organisations in Thailand were conducted for this study. The analysis at the activity level, led by the concept of ‘conflict’ in structuration theory (ST), reveals that spreadsheets allow a full flexibility over decision-making activities in budgeting. However, spreadsheets are not appropriate for integration in management control as there are many problems and errors associated with {{the use of}} spreadsheets. The analysis at the structural level, directed by the concept of ‘contradiction’ in ST, concludes that the weak characteristics of <b>spreadsheets</b> for <b>integration</b> are contradictory to the budgeting process which fulfils the dual roles of flexibility and integration. This study concludes that use of spreadsheets in budgeting is significant despite the availability of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and business intelligence (BI). This study explains that spreadsheets are heavily used because of (1) the lack of integration between financial and management accounting functions and (2) the fit for spreadsheets to support the flexibility in decision-making. This paper offers two contributions. First, it shows an over-reliance on spreadsheets for management accounting practice. Second, it informs academia and practitioners of the need to reduce their reliance on spreadsheets for management control functions because there are many drawbacks associated with it...|$|R
40|$|Spreadsheets {{have become}} a {{critical}} data management tool, but they lack explicit relational metadata, {{making it difficult to}} join or integrate data across multiple spreadsheets. Because spreadsheet data are widely available on a huge range of topics, a tool that allows easy <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>integration</b> would be hugely beneficial for a variety of users. We demonstrate that Senbazuru, a prototype spreadsheet database management system (SSDBMS), is able to extract relational information from spreadsheets. By doing so, it opens up opportunities for integration among spreadsheets and with other relational sources. Senbazuru allows users to search for relevant spreadsheets in a large corpus, probabilistically constructs a relational version of the data, and offers several relational operations over the resulting extracted data (including joins to other spreadsheet data). Our demonstration is available on two clients: a JavaScriptrich Web site and a touch interface on the iPad. During the demo, Senbazuru will allow VLDB participants to search spreadsheets, extract relational data from them, and apply relational operators such as select and join. 1...|$|E
