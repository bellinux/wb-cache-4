40|$|Variation {{of lower}} {{resonance}} frequency with center <b>strip</b> <b>length</b> {{is shown in}} Figure 7 (b). It is found that resonance frequency decreases with increasing width of notch (i. e. center <b>strip</b> <b>length).</b> Results of proposed method are {{similar to that of}} FDTD method. Little variation in the two results is due to approximation involved in the cavity theory that is used for equivalent circuit model. The variation of lower resonance frequency as a function of side <b>strip</b> <b>length</b> is shown in Figure 7 (c) along with the reported results. It is observed that the resonance frequency decreases with side <b>strip</b> <b>length</b> and the results from proposed method are in good agreement with the FDTD method. It may be mentioned that all the data obtained from proposed method are almost in good agreement with reported results. This validates the veracity of proposed method of analysis. 5.

40|$|Strips of {{urinary bladder}} smooth muscle were {{subjected}} {{to a series of}} quick release measurements. Each measurement consisted of several releases and resets to the original length, made during one contraction. The complete length-force characteristic of series elasticity was quantified by estimating H, the amplitude of quick release necessary to reduce the active force to exactly zero, and Db, a measure for the deviation of the characteristic from a straight line. By measuring a series of contractions at increasing stretched <b>strip</b> <b>lengths,</b> the length dependence of these parameters was studied. It was found that H depends linearly on stretched <b>strip</b> <b>length.</b> On average H/length amounted to 0. 04. Db decreased when strips were stretched, i. e. a straight line was more closely approximated. Both parameter dependencies support the concept of two separate elastic mechanisms, a linear true passive elasticity in series with a non-linear elasticity in the cross-bridges. For the latter, H amounts to 3. 8 % of the initial <b>strip</b> <b>length...</b>|$|R

40|$|Given {{a set of}} {{irregular}} shapes, {{the strip}} nesting problem {{is the problem of}} packing the shapes within a rectangular strip of material such that the <b>strip</b> <b>length</b> is minimized, or equivalently the utilization of material is maximized. If the packing found is to be repeated, e. g., on a roll of fabric or a coil of metal, then the separation between repeats {{is going to be a}} straight line.

Instead of minimizing <b>strip</b> <b>length</b> one minimizes the periodicity of these repeats. We describe how to extend a previously published solution method (Egeblad, Nielsen & Odgaard 2006) for the nesting problem such that it can also handle the relaxation above. Furthermore, we examine the potential of the relaxed variant of the strip packing problem by making computational experiments on a set of benchmark instances from the garment industry.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the physical and mechanical performance of flakeboard reinforced with bamboo strips. The study investigated three different bamboo strip alignment patterns and an experimental control. All panels were tested in static bending both along parallel and perpendicular to the lengths of the bamboo strips. Internal bond strength, thickness swelling, linear expansion, and water absorption were also examined. As expected, modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) were substantially greater for all three experimental panel types as compared to the control group. Linear expansion (LE) was also improved for all three experimental panel groups. The bamboo strip alignment patterns had no significant effect on thickness swelling, water absorption and internal bond. The sample means for MOR, MOE, and LE tested perpendicular to the bamboo <b>strip</b> <b>lengths</b> yielded slightly lower mean values than corresponding samples tested parallel to the bamboo <b>strips</b> <b>lengths.</b> This difference in mechanical properties is largely attributed to low panel density in the failure zones...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is studying the effect of stripping thermocouple electrical insulation on peltier surface measurement. Analytical, numerical, and experimental analyses have been performed to investigate the effect of different <b>stripped</b> <b>lengths</b> on temperature measurement of peltier surface. Two sizes of type K thermocouple, 80 μm and 200 μm, with different <b>stripped</b> <b>lengths</b> (0 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm) are used to measure different peltier surface temperature of 4 oC, 8 oC, 15 oC, 25 oC and 35 oC. During measurements thermocouple probe was {{in direct contact with}} peltier surface while the wires were extended vertically and exposed to natural convection from the external environment. Analytical results of thermocouple wire with insulation confirm that there is no specific value of the critical radius and the rate of heat flux around the thermocouple wire continuously increases with the wire diameter even though it is larger than the critical radius (or diameter). Numerical simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics software also confirms this that there is a negligible effect of the electrical insulation. Moreover, experimental results agree well with those obtained by the analytical and numerical methods and further reveal that the size of the thermocouple causes an impact on temperature measurement...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Data {{analysis}} of omics data {{should be performed}} by multivariate analysis such as principal component analysis (PCA). The way data are clustered in PCA is of major importance to develop some classification systems based on multivariate analysis, such as soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). In a previous study a one-class classifier based on SIMCA was built using microarray data from a set of potatoes. The PCA grouped the transcriptomic data according to varieties. The present work aimed to use PCA to verify the clustering of the proteomic profiles for the same potato varieties. RESULTS: Proteomic profiles of five potato varieties (Biogold, Fontane, Innovator, Lady Rosetta and Maris Piper) were evaluated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) performed on two immobilized pH gradient (IPG) <b>strip</b> <b>lengths,</b> 13 and 24 cm, both under pH range 4 - 7.

40|$|When {{considering}} a composite strip or plate under certain thermal and environmental conditions and loadings, {{there is a}} minimum strain threshold for {{the appearance of the}} first micro crack. The associated strain level is defined here as “critical strain”. There are various active displacement methods to measure this strain level (by tension and bending). The registration of the first micro crack is however challenging. Therefore, some alternative methods have been developed like the Bergen ellipse [1]. With this method, a relatively thin strip is forced by clamping to “follow” the elliptical contour of the jig. The strip undergoes various strain levels from 0 % to 2 % or 3 %. However, the strain distribution {{as a function of the}} <b>strip</b> <b>length</b> is far from linear. This causes inaccurate readings and high error sensitivity for certain areas on the ellipse. To overcome this problem, a novel jig design is introduced here; this design is based on a perfectly linear strain distribution along the <b>strip’s</b> <b>length.</b> The resulting curve is a classical one known as the Euler-Fresnel curve [2]. The linearity and the constant, low sensitivity to measurement errors guarantees high accuracy. Only at the beginning and the end of the strip, the measured strain might deviate from the real one, especially when the thickness of the strip is moderately less (Dh > 0. 1 [mm]) than the height of the slot, Figure 9. The jig is a low cost device that can easily be placed in climate cabinets for e. g. cryo-cycling. In this paper we focus on the mathematical derivation of the jig, compare it to the Bergen ellipse, and provide the full consideration of the associated primary and secondary forces and moments.
