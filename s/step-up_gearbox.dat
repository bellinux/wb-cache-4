50|$|The Hatsukaze Model 12 was {{the power}} section {{linked to a}} {{compressor}} to create a primitive jet engine called a motorjet; the resulting Tsu-11 was intended to power Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka Model 22 flying bombs. The standard Hatsukaze 11 engine was modified at a Navy arsenal by replacing the propeller drive shaft and engine front crankcase cover with a <b>step-up</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The gearbox increased engine output shaft RPM at a 1:3 ratio. At engine speed of 3,000 RPM, the compressor section was operating at 9,000 RPM. The compressed air was then ducted into a combustion chamber where a liquid fuel was sprayed. The heated compressed air then exits through the tailpipe providing static thrust of 180 kg (396 lb). It is likely that about 1/3 of the total thrust was contributed by adding the combustion chamber aft of the compressor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{condition}} monitoring {{system is essential}} for a large-scale wind turbine system to maximize its availability and reliability. In order to develop its effective {{condition monitoring}} algorithms, a wind turbine simulator is necessary for such a large-scale system. However, the existing simulators consisting of a motor and a generator are not suitable for this purpose, {{because they have not}} the general configuration of wind turbine systems. To solve this problem, we are now developing a novel wind turbine simulator that is composed of blades, a <b>step-up</b> <b>gearbox</b> and a generator. This paper presents a developed condition monitoring system and the design procedure of the wind turbine simulator...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} objective {{has been to}} redesign a high speed three stage axial compressor research facility. The new design provides uniform inlet flow to the compressor, a wider operational range at lower speeds, better speed control, and upgrades to the data acquisition system. The compressor used is a research compressor modeling the last three stages of a Rolls-Royce high-pressure compressor. Unlike low speed facilities, the research compressor matches both Reynolds number and Mach number of the engine representative conditions. The compressor {{is powered by a}} 1400 HP AC Motor. The design speed of 5000 rpm is achieved through a 5 : 1 <b>step-up</b> <b>gearbox,</b> and the speed is controlled with a variable frequency drive. ^ The facility redesign included turning the compressor around to provide a clean flow inlet path, not blocked by the driveline components. This required a new rotor shaft designed with a spline at one end. The new inlet design consists of a bellmouth, venturi flow meter, and a long straight duct section to provide an accurate mass flow measurement and a uniform flow. The redesigned throttle and exhaust are located between the gearbox and the compressor, with air exiting the facility through the open doors. ^ The inlet flow measurements show pressure uniformity of ± 0. 15 % deviation from average. The temperature uniformity of ± 4 % deviation from average has been accomplished. Rotational speed control to within 0. 5 rpm is now possible. This has led to the design operating point being established with an uncertainty of 0. 09 % for the total pressure ratio and 0. 73 % for the mass flow measurement. ...|$|E
25|$|Materials {{for wind}} turbine parts {{other than the}} rotor blades (including the rotor hub, gearbox, frame, and tower) are largely {{composed}} of steel. Modern turbines uses a couple of tonnes of copper for generators, cables and such. Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components {{in an effort to}} make the turbines more lightweight and efficient, and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved. Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still, requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine. Additionally, <b>step-up</b> <b>gearboxes</b> are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines., In particular, this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium. Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials. In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.|$|R
