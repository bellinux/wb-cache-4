5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus maculatus), mullet (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the smalltail shark {{is caught}} {{incidentally}} by gillnet and longline fisheries throughout its range. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted. In addition, the dried fins are exported {{for use in}} shark fin soup, the liver oil and cartilage are used medicinally, and the carcass is processed into fishmeal. In 2006, the IUCN assessed this species, including Pacific populations now separated as C. cerdale, as Data Deficient {{due to a lack}} of fishery data. In Trinidad, its abundance makes it the most economically important shark. Off northern Brazil, substantial numbers are caught by gillnet fisheries targeting the Serra <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus brasiliensis). In the 1980s, this species constituted roughly 43% of the shark and ray catch, but has since declined to around 17%. This apparent decline is thought to have resulted from increasing fishing effort, the large proportion of juveniles captured, and the shark's low reproductive rate. Consequently, the IUCN has assessed the smalltail shark in Brazil as Vulnerable, and noted the urgent need for conservation measures given that northern Brazil represents the center of the species' range. Although the smalltail shark was ostensibly given protection by inclusion on the 2004 Official List of Endangered Animals in Brazil, fishing remains effectively unmanaged.|$|E

25|$|Overfishing of {{king and}} <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{occurred}} in the 1980s. Regulations were introduced to restrict the size, amount of catch, fishing locations and bag limits for recreational fishers as well as commercial fishers. Gillnets were banned in waters off Florida. By 2001, the mackerel stocks had bounced back.|$|E
25|$|Fish Hawk was {{designed}} to work year-round in an annual cycle in which she engaged in scientific research involving trawling and dredging in the summer, then steamed north to collect and hatch cod eggs in late autumn. With the arrival of winter, she steamed south to hatch shad eggs, moving to various points along the coast during the winter and spring {{in accordance with the}} natural timing of shad runs. With those completed, she renewed the cycle by returning to research work during the following summer. As fisheries researchers later came to understand the reproduction of <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> and striped bass, Fish Hawk added hatching of these species to her annual routine.|$|E
25|$|The daggernose shark poses little {{danger to}} humans {{due to its}} small size and teeth. This shark is caught in small numbers by {{subsistence}} fishers in Trinidad, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guyana. It also comprises about one-tenth of the catch of a northern Brazil floating gillnet fishery targeting Serra <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus brasiliensis) and Acoupa weakfish (Cynoscion acoupa), which operates in estuaries during the dry season. This shark is often found in markets, but is not highly regarded as a food fish. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Critically Endangered, as it has a limited distribution and is highly susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate. The daggernose shark has declined over 90% {{over the past decade}} off Brazil, and similar declines have likely also occurred elsewhere in its range as fishing pressure in the region continues to grow more intense. The IUCN has urgently recommended the implementation of conservation schemes and the expansion of fishery monitoring for this species. Evidence also points to this species being on the verge of or already in reproductive collapse.|$|E
