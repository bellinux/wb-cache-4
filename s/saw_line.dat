50|$|Handcrews are diverse {{teams of}} career and {{temporary}} wildland firefighters. The crews typically consist of 18 - 20 {{men and women}} but can also contain 4 to 6 and 8 to 10. These crews have the responsibilities of constructing firelines - strips of land cleared of flammable materials and dug down to mineral soil. These lines are generally constructed around wildfires to control them. Another type of line handcrews create is <b>saw</b> <b>line.</b> This is line where all trees limbs are removed up to shoulder height and all small trees and brush is cut down. All the limbs and trees are then carried outside the line and scattered. These are also called ladder fuels that allow the fire to climb up into the canopies which makes controlling a fire much more difficult. Sawyers do the cutting and swampers do the moving of the debris. Depending {{on the size of}} the crew there can be between 1 and 5 swampers per sawyer. Other jobs include, burn outs, gridding for spot fires, and mop up after the fire is controlled.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} an investment calculation {{based on an}} assumed initial investment of a new <b>saw</b> <b>line</b> to an existing sawmill. In order to get as close to reality as possible, we have received data material from northern forest owners who recently made an initial investment in their sawmill in Kåge. In order to calculate and evaluate investments are several different methods, but we, we have chosen to use the discounted cash flow method. The method sums up {{with the help of}} a fixed cost of capital together with any future costs and revenues, thereby giving a present value of the investment. We also do a sensitivity analysis to examine how selected factors affect the investment research they change. The study is carried out to a fictitious investment, and therefore the result should not only be studied as a result of the figures. The purpose of this study was that {{with the help of a}}n investment calculation studying the profitability of a hypothetical investment, and by means of a sensitivity analysis to study the sensitivity of investment to changes. The result demonstrates that the calculations according to the present value method requires a lot of information of the prospective investment. The result also shows that just because an investment looks very profitable out, it can still be very sensitive to changes, and even at very small changes in the market can turn to the investment unprofitable. The study also shows some difficulties in the investment calculation. Difficulties such as estimating costs and revenues, constant development and change in the market, and to study how changes in various factors affecting the investment. ...|$|E

50|$|Control is {{an issue}} with jigsaws. The blades are small, weak and entirely {{unsupported}} at the lower end.

To guide a jigsaw on curved cut, it must be steered (turned) and not forced to move sideways. The usage of sharp blades is important as well to get high quality cuts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{inexpensive}} frequency-modulated contin-uous-wave (FMCW) {{radar system}} {{is presented in}} this paper, which, nevertheless, meets all industrial requirements. The FMCW radar uses a low-cost nonlinear voltage-controlled os-cillator (VCO), operating at an IF of 2. 45 GHz to generate the frequency modulation of the radar system. This VCO signal is applied twice, first to generate the radar transmitter signal at 24 GHz, and then it {{is fed to a}} surface acoustic wave (<b>SAW)</b> delay <b>line.</b> The <b>SAW</b> delay <b>line</b> generates a fixed delay time, which corresponds with a fixed radar distance. Thus, all systematic non-linearities and stochastic phase errors of the FMCW system can be monitored and, afterwards, can be compensated for in real time. This linearization technique leads to a significant enhancement in dynamic range for a FMCW radar system. For this FMCW system, <b>SAW</b> delay <b>lines</b> with a linear phase characteristic have been designed using a linear optimization program. The delay line consists of two chirped and weighted interdigital transducers. For high volume, low-cost, and high-yield production of the required SAW structures, with linewidths down to 0. 3 m, technological improvements had to be achieved, especially in photolithography. Based on these design and fabrication techniques, delay lines at 2. 45 GHz operating at the fundamental and third harmonic with bandwidths up to 800 MHz have been realized.
