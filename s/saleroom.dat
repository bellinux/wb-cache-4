500|$|... 1988 was the bicentenary of {{non-indigenous}} {{settlement in}} Australia and, as such, there was {{renewed interest in}} the 'lost' second Sydney punchbowl. The bowl eventually turned up in a catalogue for a Chinese export porcelain exhibition at Newark Museum, New Jersey, United States, titled Chinese Export Porcelain: A Loan Exhibition from New Jersey Collections. The bowl had been lent by Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., a former United States Congressman (in office 1953–1975). The discovery was made by Terry Ingram, a Sydney journalist specialising in antiques and art, who wrote about it in his <b>Saleroom</b> column, titled Newark Museum packs Aussie punch, in The Australian Financial Review on 25August 1988. It transpired {{that in the early}} 1930s, the bowl was acquired by Frelinghuysen's parents in a private negotiation with the owner at the time the National Art Collections Fund was attempting to raise interest from Sydney's cultural institutions. This discovery drew the attention of Paul Hundley, senior curator of the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM)'s USA Gallery, the Gallery itself a bicentennial gift of the American people to Australia. In May 2006, the ANMM announced it had acquired the bowl as a part gift from Frelinghuysen through the American Friends of the ANMM, a charitable organisation recognised by the US Internal Revenue Service which enabled Frelinghuysen to receive appropriate taxation benefits. The Australian Financial Review reported the acquisition in its <b>Saleroom</b> column, titled Museum bowled over, on 18May 2006. The punchbowl has been on display in the Museum's USA Gallery ever since. It also features as one of the 100 Stories from the ANMM, has digitised images in the ANMM catalogue and can be viewed on YouTube. At the time the ANMM acquired the punchbowl in 2006, the bowl was valued at $A330,000.|$|E
6000|$|When {{that little}} sale {{was over in}} the fusty <b>saleroom,</b> and those Victorian ashes scattered, he {{went out into the}} misty October {{sunshine}} feeling as if cosiness had died out of the world, and the board [...] "To Let" [...] was up, indeed. Revolutions on the horizon; Fleur in Spain; no comfort in Annette; no Timothy's on the Bayswater Road. In the irritable desolation of his soul he went into the Goupenor Gallery. That chap Jolyon's watercolours were on view there. He went in to look down his nose at them--it might give him some faint satisfaction. The news had trickled through from June to Val's wife, from her to Val, from Val to his mother, from her to Soames, that the house--the fatal house at Robin Hill--was for sale, and Irene going to join her boy out in British Columbia, or some such place. For one wild moment the thought had come to Soames: 'Why shouldn't I buy it back? I meant it for my!' No sooner come than gone. Too lugubrious a triumph; with too many humiliating memories for himself and Fleur. She would never live there after what had happened. No, the place must go its way to some peer or profiteer. It had been a bone of contention from the first, the shell of the feud; and with the woman gone, it was an empty shell. [...] "For Sale or To Let." [...] With his mind's eye he could see that board raised high above the ivied wall which he had built.|$|E

40|$|The Irish painter William Orpen (1878 - 1931), defined here as Ireland’s most ‘Spanish’ painter, was out {{of fashion}} for fifty years after his death; but he has {{recently}} been dramatically revalued, with his works fetching huge prices in <b>salerooms</b> and an unprecedentedly large exhibition of his work being mounted in London and subsequently Dublin. Best known for his Edwardian portraits and his devastating paintings of the First World War, he also produced a series of allegorical paintings of his native Ireland. These are discussed in this article, and linked to his admiration for J. M. Synge, his dislike of clericalism and repression in Irish life, and his celebration of sensuality. The same themes lie behind ‘Homage to Manet’, a celebrated group portrait which includes the Irish novelist George Moore and the art collector Hugh Lane —a close friend of Orpen’s. Orpen knew other figures of the cultural Revival, and his relation to them is discussed; as is the conflict of identity he experienced (like other middle-class Irish Protestants) when the radicalisation of Irish politics and {{the outbreak of the}} First World War put a new strain on the allegiances of people who had previously thought of themselves as both ‘British’ and ‘Irish’. After the trauma of the War, and Irish separation, Orpen opted for Britain; but, it is argued, he was closer to elements of the Irish cultural revival, and more involved with Irish politics and Irish history, than is usually accepted...|$|R

" [...] p. 3. Photocopy of original catalogue. [unknown]. Robert Henry Pulleine (1869 - 1935), physician and naturalist, was born on 7 June 1869 at Picton, Marlborough, New Zealand, son of Frederick Arthur Pulleine, later first registrar of the South Australian School of Mines and Industries, and his wife Lucy Jane, née Butt. His childhood was spent in Fiji. The family moved to Adelaide in 1881 and Robert attended the Collegiate School of St Peter before working at the Public Library of South Australia in 1885 - 87; in the neighbouring South Australian Museum he developed his interest in natural science. He taught at the Adelaide Collegiate School before entering the University of Adelaide in 1892, completing his medical training at the University of Sydney Medical School (M. B., Ch. M., 1898) and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. After working in Gympie Qld and further study in Britain, he returned in 1907 to Adelaide to become a highly respected consultant in these diseases. Pulleine’s practice supported his naturalist interests, particularly the importing of cacti seeds and plants and collecting trips to Tasmania and Central Australia. His valuable collection of books, Aboriginal artefacts and paintings were housed in a twenty-two-room, bluestone home with five acres (2 ha) of garden at Netherby near Adelaide. Pulleine developed a consuming interest in botany, anthropology, marine biology, history, entomology and, specifically, arachnology: his studies of the trapdoor spider drew the attention of scientists throughout the world. Pulleine published many medical and scientific pamphlets and articles, overseas and in Australia. With his friend Archibald Watson Pulleine owned Walwa Private Hospital. Pulleine died there of pneumonia complicating diabetes mellitus on 13 June 1935, and was buried in Mitcham cemetery. Pulleine’s extensive library and ethnographic collection were auctioned. Part of his collection had been exhibited at the South Australian Centennial Exhibition in 1936, and the South Australian Museum bought some of the Australian ethnologia.
