25|$|Cleaning {{of human}} remains varies by type. If necessary, <b>surface</b> <b>cleaning</b> of bone {{can be done}} with a very mild {{detergent}} and water solution, but bones should never be soaked in order to prevent dirt from becoming embedded in pores. The possibility of cleaning human remains is highly dependent on the fragility of the specimen.|$|E
25|$|C. difficile is {{transmitted}} {{from person to person}} by the fecal-oral route. The organism forms heat-resistant spores that are not killed by alcohol-based hand cleansers or routine <b>surface</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Thus, these spores survive in clinical environments for long periods. Because of this, the bacteria may be cultured from almost any surface. Once spores are ingested, their acid-resistance allows them to pass through the stomach unscathed. Upon exposure to bile acids, they germinate and multiply into vegetative cells in the colon.|$|E

50|$|Superhydrophilicity {{allows for}} {{surfaces}} to clean away {{a wide variety}} of dirt or debris. This mechanism is very different than the aforementioned superhydrophobic surfaces. For superhydrophilic self-cleaning <b>surfaces,</b> <b>cleaning</b> occurs because water on the surface is able to spread out to a great degree (extremely low water contact angle) to get between any fouling debris and the surface to wash away the debris.|$|R
25|$|Explosion limits also {{depend on}} the {{particle}} size of the dust involved, and are not intrinsic properties of the material. In addition, a concentration above the LEL can be created suddenly from settled dust accumulations, so management by routine monitoring, as is done with gases and vapours, is of no value. The preferred method of managing combustible dust is by preventing accumulations of settled dust through process enclosure, ventilation, and <b>surface</b> <b>cleaning.</b> However, lower explosion limits may be relevant to plant design.|$|E

40|$|Summary It {{is shown}} how the {{application}} of the recently introduced equi-maintained lux approach for the maintenance of a lighting system leads to significant cost savings over the conventional equi-interval criterion, the latter normally being used to find the optimum {{solution to the problem of}} achieving the desired maintained illuminance level for the minimum overall cost.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the bacteriological status of selected RTE foods, associated preparation <b>surfaces</b> and <b>cleaning</b> tools sampled from four retail delicatessens in Johannesburg.

50|$|For the {{activities}} described here the following terms are often found: metal cleaning, metal <b>surface</b> <b>cleaning,</b> component cleaning, degreasing, parts washing, parts cleaning. These are well established in technical language usage {{but they have}} their shortcomings. Metal cleaning can easily be mixed up with refinement of unpurified metals. Metal <b>surface</b> <b>cleaning</b> and metal cleaning do not consider the increasing usage of plastics and composite materials in this sector. The term component cleaning leaves out the cleaning of steel sections and sheets and finally degreasing only describes {{a part of the}} topic as in most cases also chips, fines, particles, salts etc. have to be removed.|$|E

40|$|DE 1005025101 B UPAB: 20060804 NOVELTY - A {{device for}} {{cleaning}} the interior space of vacuum chambers {{consists of a}} carrier (3) for electrical electrode(s) (1, 2) connected (or connectable) to a D.

USE - Especially for cleaning vacuum coating chambers for use in surface modification, e. g. by physical or chemical vapor deposition methods. ADVANTAGE - The devices are highly effective in cleaning the vacuum chamber interiors, and (unlike conventional mechanical and/or chemical cleaners) remove free particles as well as deposits on chamber <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Cleaning</b> is rapid and inexpensive, and use of toxic cleaning chemicals (requiring special safety precautions) is avoided...|$|R
50|$|Piranha {{solution}} {{should always}} be prepared by adding hydrogen peroxide to sulfuric acid slowly, never in reverse. Mixing the solution is extremely exothermic. If the solution is made rapidly, it will instantly boil, releasing large amounts of corrosive fumes. Even when made with care, the resultant heat can bring solution temperatures above 100 °C. It {{must be allowed to}} cool reasonably before it is used. The sudden increase in temperature can also lead to violent boiling of the extremely acidic solution. Solutions made using hydrogen peroxide at concentrations greater than 50% may cause an explosion. Once the mixture has stabilized, it can be further heated to sustain its reactivity. The hot (often bubbling) solution cleans organic compounds off substrates and oxidizes or hydroxylates most metal <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Cleaning</b> usually requires about 10 to 40 minutes, after which the substrates can be removed from the solution.|$|R

[...] "Decisions about appropriate treatments and methods of preservation for individual artifacts therefore should be made by a conservator in consultation with experts in the culture". Conservation goals for totem poles can include stabilization of materials such as wood, paint or loose joints, removal of biological growth, <b>surface</b> <b>cleaning,</b> application of a water or insect repellents, removal of decayed wood, stabilizing of totem at base and in some cases the removal of the totem pole. Conservators who perform treatments on a pole document any work performed via photographs or written notes. A <b>surface</b> <b>cleaning</b> is a common treatment by conservators. The <b>surface</b> <b>cleaning</b> is generally performed with a low-suction vacuum, soft brushes, mild detergent and soft sponges. Cleanings are important for removing any dirt, grime, grease, pollution or dust from the pole’s surface. It is recommended by conservators to start at the top and work your way down. Scaffolding or a lift is used with taller poles.|$|E

5000|$|Sputter {{cleaning}} is {{the cleaning}} {{of a solid}} surface in a vacuum by using physical sputtering of the <b>surface.</b> Sputter <b>cleaning</b> is often used in vacuum deposition and ion plating. In 1955 Farnsworth, Schlier, George, and Burger reported using sputter cleaning in an ultra-high-vacuum system to prepare ultra-clean surfaces for low-energy electron-diffraction (LEED) studies. [...] Sputter cleaning became {{an integral part of}} the ion plating process. Sputter cleaning has some potential problems such as overheating, gas incorporation in the surface region, bombardment (radiation) damage in the surface region, and the roughening of the surface, particularly if over done. It is important to have a clean plasma in order to not continually recontaminate the <b>surface</b> during sputter <b>cleaning.</b> Redeposition of sputtered material on the substrate can also give problems, especially at high sputtering pressures.|$|R
