In most cases the patients recovered {{of their own accord}} but some cases of <b>shigellosis</b> became seriously ill and died. Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved ineffective in serious cases, even when administered in large doses. However, he also had an experimental supply of sulphaguanidine that had been given to him by Dr E. K. Marshall of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The drug was administered to a patient with severe <b>shigellosis</b> who was not expected to live, and the patient soon recovered. Of the 21,015 Australian soldiers who contracted bacilliary dysentery during the Second World War, only 21 died.|$|E

In 2006, Ryan showed that administration of antibiotics to children with <b>shigellosis</b> in Bangladesh did not increase toxin production by the bacterium. This finding supports targeted antimicrobial treatment of humans with <b>shigellosis.</b> Such treatment is usually contraindicated in humans infected with Shiga-toxin expressing E. coli infection (STEC/EHEC: enterohemorrhagic E. coli, Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli), in whom such treatment substantially increasing the risk of renal failure.|$|E
25|$|During an {{outbreak}} of <b>shigellosis</b> in 1917, German professor Alfred Nissle isolated a strain of Escherichia coli from the feces of a soldier who was not affected by the disease. Methods of treating infectious diseases were needed at that time when antibiotics were not yet available, and Nissle used the E. coli Nissle 1917 strain in acute gastrointestinal infectious salmonellosis and <b>shigellosis.</b>|$|E

2500|$|According to two researchers, Nesse and Williams, {{diarrhea}} may {{function as}} an evolved expulsion defense mechanism. As a result, if it is stopped, {{there might be a}} delay in recovery. They cite in support of this argument research published in 1973 that found that treating Shigella with the anti-diarrhea drug (Co-phenotrope, Lomotil) caused people to stay feverish twice as long as those not so treated. The researchers indeed themselves observed that: [...] "Lomotil may be contraindicated in <b>shigellosis.</b> Diarrhea may represent a defense mechanism".|$|E
2500|$|Industrial {{facilities}} such as arms factory Československá zbrojovka {{and aircraft}} engine factory Zweigwerk (after the war it became Zbrojovka's subsidiary Zetor) {{and the city}} centre were targeted by several Allied bombardment campaigns between 1944 and 1945. The air strikes and later artillery fire killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 1,278 buildings. After the city's occupation by the Red Army on 26 April 1945 {{and the end of}} the war, ethnic German residents were forcibly expelled. In the so-called Brno death march, beginning on 31 May 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched [...] to the Austrian border. According to testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them died during the march. Later estimates by Czech sources put the death toll at about 1,700, with most deaths due to an epidemic of <b>shigellosis.</b>|$|E

Infants, the elderly, and the critically ill are susceptible to the most severe symptoms of disease, but all humans are susceptible to some degree. Individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are more frequently infected with Shigella. <b>Shigellosis</b> is a more common and serious condition in the developing world; fatality rates of <b>shigellosis</b> epidemics in developing countries can be 5-15%.|$|E

50|$|Shigella dysenteriae is {{a species}} of the {{rod-shaped}} bacterial genus Shigella. Shigella species can cause <b>shigellosis</b> (bacillary dysentery). Shigellae are Gram-negative, nonspore-forming, facultatively anaerobic, nonmotile bacteria.|$|E

50|$|<b>Shigellosis</b> {{is caused}} by one of several types of Shigella bacteria. Three species are {{associated}} with bacillary dysentery: Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri and Shigella dysenteriae. A study in China indicated that Shigella flexneri 2a {{was the most common}} serotype.|$|E
5000|$|Shigella sonnei is {{a species}} of Shigella. Together with Shigella flexneri, it is {{responsible}} for 90% of <b>shigellosis</b> cases.

50|$|<b>Shigellosis</b> {{is caused}} by four {{specific}} types of Shigella. These are typically spread by exposure to infected feces. This can occur via contaminated food, water, or hands. Contamination may be spread by flies or when changing diapers. Diagnosis is by stool culture.|$|E

50|$|Gastrointestinal {{disease in}} {{children}} is usually an acute, severe illness, whereas that in adults {{tends to be}} chronic diarrhea.

5000|$|... "Group D" [...] Shigella {{bacteria}} cause <b>shigellosis.</b> Those {{infected with}} the bacteria release it into their stool, thus causing possibility of spread through food or water, or from direct contact to a person orally.

50|$|Bifidobacteria {{were first}} {{isolated}} from a breast-fed infant by Henry Tissier, who also {{worked at the}} Pasteur Institute. The isolated bacterium named Bacillus bifidus communis was later renamed to the genus Bifidobacterium. Tissier found that bifidobacteria are dominant in the gut flora of breast-fed babies and he observed clinical benefits from treating diarrhea in infants with bifidobacteria. The claimed effect was bifidobacterial displacement of proteolytic bacteria causing the disease. During an outbreak of <b>shigellosis</b> in 1917, German professor Alfred Nissle isolated a strain of Escherichia coli from the feces of a soldier who was not affected by the disease. Methods of treating infectious diseases were needed at that time when antibiotics were not yet available, and Nissle used the E. coli Nissle 1917 strain in acute gastrointestinal infectious salmonellosis and <b>shigellosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dysentery {{may also}} be caused by <b>shigellosis,</b> an {{infection}} by bacteria of the genus Shigella, and is then known as bacillary dysentery (or Marlow syndrome). The term bacillary dysentery etymologically might seem to refer to any dysentery caused by any bacilliform bacteria, but its meaning is restricted by convention to Shigella dysentery.|$|E
50|$|On November 4, 1962, Enos died of {{dysentery}} {{caused by}} <b>shigellosis,</b> which was resistant to antibiotics of the time.

5000|$|Sanitation has {{historically}} been a major concern at Rainbow Gatherings. Human waste is deposited in latrine trenches (typically referred to as 'shitters') and treated with lime and ash from campfires. New latrines are dug and filled in daily. The 1987 gathering in North Carolina experienced an outbreak of highly contagious <b>shigellosis</b> (a.k.a. dysentery) causing diarrhea.|$|E
50|$|Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) {{is a type}} of {{pathogenic}} bacteria whose infection {{causes a}} syndrome that is identical to <b>shigellosis,</b> with profuse diarrhea and high fever. EIEC are highly invasive, and they use adhesin proteins to bind to and enter intestinal cells. They produce no toxins, but severely damage the intestinal wall through mechanical cell destruction.|$|E
50|$|Globally <b>shigellosis</b> {{occurs in}} at least 80 million people and results in about 700,000 deaths a year. Most cases occur in the {{developing}} world. Young children are most commonly affected. Outbreaks of disease may occur in childcare settings and schools. It is also relatively common among travelers. In the United States about half a million cases occur a year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shigellosis</b> {{is a type}} of {{diarrhea}} {{caused by}} a bacterial infection with Shigella. Symptoms generally start one to two days after exposure and include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and pain with passing stool. Blood may be present in the stool. Symptoms typically last five to seven days. Complications can include post infectious arthritis, sepsis, seizures, and hemolytic uremic syndrome.|$|E
