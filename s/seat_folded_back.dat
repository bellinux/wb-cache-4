5000|$|The school's main Victorian {{assembly}} hall was converted to the [...] "Performing Arts Centre" [...] between 2005 and 2007. This £3.5 million project, {{was paid for}} in part by donations from {{the parents of the}} schools current pupils and former pupils.

It is also available for use by the public and is used as a venue for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.|$|R
5000|$|The ZX's {{interior}} space and value received praise from critics and consumers. Of particular note was {{the rear seat}} arrangement; it was mounted on a sliding platform that allowed the seat to be moved rearwards to increase rear legroom, or forwards to increase cargo space. Unfortunately, only the <b>seat</b> <b>backs</b> <b>folded</b> down on models so fitted. Lower specification models with fully <b>folding</b> and removable <b>seats</b> had more ultimate capacity.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{has a low}} 8.2 : 1 {{compression}} ratio, {{allowing it}} to run on low-octane gasoline. The four-wheel drive is engaged by a lever on the floor, as are the optional differential locks. The car has rack-and-pinion steering and many suspension parts are the same at all four corners. The interior is minimal, although the seats, from the contemporary Volkswagen Passat, were considered surprisingly comfortable by period observers. The tiny back seat has two individually <b>folding</b> <b>seat</b> <b>backs,</b> but can be considered mainly an occasional seat.|$|R
50|$|Equipment in the Paris body included: leather upholstery, five lamps, two {{electric}} horns, eight-day clock, automatic screen wiper, {{roof ventilator}} and lamp, companions, rear blind controllable from the driver’s <b>seat,</b> <b>folding</b> luggage grid etc. The Riviera model {{had the same}} fittings but in addition the roof was flexible. It <b>folded</b> <b>back</b> like an ordinary hood over about two-thirds of its length.|$|R

50|$|A {{small number}} of clubs adapt to the UEFA {{requirements}} by using <b>seats</b> that <b>fold</b> away under aluminium terrace steps. For domestic games such areas look like conventional terraces with intermittent crush barriers. For UEFA games the barriers are removed, the aluminium steps <b>folded</b> <b>back</b> and the <b>seats</b> flipped up. After the UEFA game, the procedure is reversed. German clubs using fold-away seats are Hamburg SV, VfB Stuttgart, Fortuna Düsseldorf, Bayer Leverkusen and FC Bayern Munich.|$|R
2500|$|The 1977 models had {{numerous}} changes. Most noticeable {{was a new}} front end that AMC intended to make exclusive for the Gremlin line, consisting of independent squared headlight bezels with rounded corners and an egg-crate smile-shaped grille carrying over the rectangular parking lights of {{the previous two years}} and a new front bumper. A second [...] "American" [...] emblem was applied over the front edge of the hood on the right corner. The two-point seatbelts were replaced by fixed three-point units on both sedan models. Wagons included three-point retractable units as factory issue. The Carter RBS carburetor was discontinued leaving only the YF model on the 258 six. Two-door sedans with the manual transmissions now featured a floor-mounted gearshift with low-back fold-down individual seats, while models with automatic transmissions retained the bench <b>seat</b> with split <b>folding</b> <b>backs</b> and a column-mounted shifter. This also meant manual units incorporated a safety lock lever in their steering column ignition switch shared with American Rally model. The seats and door panels were slightly modified from the last year. A new [...] "American" [...] emblem with different typography was applied to glove box door. The [...] "258" [...] rear quarter panel emblems were replaced by new [...] "4.2" [...] units.|$|R
