5000|$|<b>Swinepox</b> is a {{worldwide}} {{disease of the}} pig, caused by a virus of the family Poxviridae and the genus Suipoxvirus. It {{is the most common}} cause of pox disease in pigs, with vaccinia virus being the next most common cause of outbreaks. [...] It is a mild to severe disease depending on the louse it was contracted from. Symptoms include papules and pustules on the skin of the abdomen. Characteristic lesions on the lower abdomen have dark hemorrhagic centers. [...] <b>Swinepox</b> is transmitted by direct contact and by the pig louse, Hematopinus suis. Often the hooves go crusty due to the animals water content in its body being used for fighting the infection. This in serious Swine pox cases can cause malformed hoofs and damage the ability for the pig to walk properly. In some extremely rare cases, the genetics of the animal can be changed by this disease but go unnoticed in terms of physical symptoms; this, if contracted by breeding pigs is very threatening for the potential baby piglets to be born. Piglets born from parents that both have the severest strain of the disease will be born frequently with disfigurements such as a tail that is bulbous, and crooked snouts. The inside of the animal is also affected by the genetic strain by making the muscles and fat of the animal pus filled and also weakens the piglets organs overtime resulting in death.|$|E
40|$|AbstractInfection of pigs with <b>swinepox</b> virus (SWPV) was {{reported}} in Brazil in 2011. SWPV causes a systemic pustular disease in pigs and the symptoms are clinically indistinguishable from those caused by vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. Pigs infected with VACV {{have been reported in}} various countries; however, VACV is endemic in Brazil, India and other countries, where it affects mainly dairy cows, dairy buffaloes and dairy workers causing localized pustules. The transmission of VACV to other susceptible hosts has also been detected in Brazil. Therefore, VACV should be investigated as a possible etiologic agent of pustular skin disorders in pigs. This work describes the development of a one-step duplex assay to detect <b>swinepox</b> and vaccinia viruses simultaneously in skin lesions of pigs with generalized pustular disease. The investigation of VACV infection in pigs is important in countries where this zoonosis is endemic and should be differentiated from SWPV infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the sensitivity of 11 porcine viruses to the antiviral effects of porcine interferon-alpha in serum from piglets which had been infected 19 h previously with transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and of porcine interferon-beta prepared in PK- 15 cells by induction with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, in yield reduction assays in pig kidney cells which were treated with interferon before virus challenge, and both before and after virus challenge. The most sensitive virus to both types of interferon was vesicular stomatitis. A porcine isolate of bovine herpesvirus type 1, hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus and porcine enterovirus types 1 and 2 were also highly sensitive to interferon-alpha. There was little reduction in the yield of porcine parvovirus or porcine rotavirus, while <b>swinepox,</b> swine influenza and transmissible gastroenteritis viruses were intermediate in their sensitivity to interferon-alpha. In addition to vesicular stomatitis virus, porcine adenovirus type 3, swine influenza, hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis and porcine rotavirus were highly sensitive to interferon-beta, while <b>swinepox,</b> bovine herpesvirus type 1, porcine parvovirus, transmissible gastroenteritis and porcine enteroviruses were less sensitive than the above viruses to interferon-beta, although all showed significant reductions in virus yield...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Many {{patients}} {{suffering from}} angina pectoris {{are treated with}} percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and quickly develop angiographic renarrowing, or restenosis, {{at the site of}} PCI treatment. Restenosis is thought to arise from the combinatorial activation of thrombotic and inflammatory responses. The inflammatory response responsible for restenosis is also thought to involve the activation of a cascade of serine proteases and its subsequent regulation. Poxviruses are known to possess a variety of immunomodulatory strategies, some of which target serine proteases, cytokines, and chemokines. To this end we evaluated whether systemic species-specific <b>swinepox</b> virus (SPV) infection could induce sufficient host-immune modulation to promote an anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effect, thereby preventing restenosis. Two groups of domestic feeder pigs were used- the first group was experimentally infected with SPV (n = 11) and the second group served as an uninfected control (n = 5). A week after infection, the pigs were anesthetized and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was performed in the left anterior descending coronary artery using X-ray fluoroscopy to visualize the balloon and record angiograms. Three weeks post infection, the pigs were euthanized and balloon angioplasty injured arteries were harvested and examined. We observed a statistically significant reduction of restenosis in SPV-infected pigs (p = 0. 05) compared to control pigs and conclude that systemic <b>swinepox</b> virus infection causes sufficient host immune suppression to significantly reduce restenosis in pigs after balloo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article {{describes}} five outbreaks of <b>swinepox</b> in backyard pigs in Northeastern Brazil. It affected backyard pigs from herds of poor hygienic-sanitary conditions with severe fly and lice infestations. The morbidity ranged from 33. 3 to 100 % among affected herds, with mortality reaching up to 60 %. The affected pigs developed multifocal to coalescent gray to white papules and blisters in the skin, with eventual eruptions, evolving to erosions and crusts. In addition to skin lesions, affected piglets presented apathy, anorexia and fever. The disease was auto-limiting, resolving within 15 to 25 days. Histological examination revealed proliferative and ulcerative vesiculopustular dermatitis with ballooning degeneration of epithelial cells, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, eosinophils and some macrophages in the dermis. Intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions were consistently observed in keratinocytes. Total DNA extracted from fresh tissue fragments obtained from one outbreak and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue {{from the other}} four outbreaks was submitted to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for <b>Swinepox</b> virus (SWPV) and Vaccinia virus (VACV). Genetic SWPV material was identified by PCR in fresh material from one outbreak. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the PCR amplicons (viral polymerase gene) demonstrated 100 % homology with sequences from SWPV. All tissues were PCR negative for VACV. Swine poxvirus is present in backyard pigs in Northeastern Brazil, indicating the need of including SWPV in the differential diagnosis of dermatitis in pigs...|$|E
40|$|Poxviruses are {{important}} {{human and animal}} pathogens that have evolved elaborate strategies for antagonizing host innate and adaptive immunity. The E 3 protein of vaccinia virus, the prototypic member of the orthopoxviruses, functions as an inhibitor of innate immune signaling and is essential for vaccinia virus replication in vivo and in many human cell culture systems. However, the function of orthologues of E 3 expressed by poxviruses of other genera with different host specificity remains largely unknown. In the present study, we characterized the E 3 orthologues from sheeppox virus, yaba monkey tumor virus, <b>swinepox</b> virus, and myxoma virus {{for their ability to}} modulate protein kinase R (PKR) function, cytokine responses and virus pathogenicity. We found that the E 3 orthologues of myxoma virus and <b>swinepox</b> virus could suppress PKR activation and interferon (IFN) -induced antiviral activities and restore the host range function of E 3 in HeLa cells. In contrast, the E 3 orthologues from sheeppox virus and yaba monkey tumor virus were unable to inhibit PKR activation. While the sheeppox orthologue was unable to restore the host range function of E 3, the yaba monkey tumor virus orthologue partially restored E 3 -deficient vaccinia virus replication in HeLa cells, correlated with its ability to suppress IFN-induced antiviral activities. Moreover, poxvirus E 3 orthologues show varying ability to inhibit the induction of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines. Despite these in vitro results, none of the E 3 orthologues tested was capable of restoring pathogenicity to E 3 -deficient vaccinia virus in vivo...|$|E

40|$|A {{class of}} {{secreted}} poxvirus tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -binding proteins has been isolated from Tanapox-infected cell supernatants. The inhibitor bound to a TNF-affinity column and {{was identified as}} the product of the 2 L gene. Sequence analysis of 2 L family members from other yatapoxviruses and <b>swinepox</b> virus yielded no sequence homology to any known cellular gene. The expressed Tanapox virus 2 L protein bound to human TNF with high affinity (K(d) = 43 pM) and exhibits an unusually slow off-rate. However, 2 L is unable to bind {{to a wide range of}} human TNF family members. The 2 L protein can inhibit human TNF from binding to TNF receptors I and II as well as block TNF-induced cytolysis. Thus, Tanapox virus 2 L represents an inhibitor of human TNF and offers a unique strategy with which to modulate TNF activity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe interferon-induced {{protein kinase}} PKR is {{activated}} upon binding double-stranded RNA and phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF 2 α on Ser- 51 to inhibit protein synthesis in virally infected cells. <b>Swinepox</b> virus C 8 L and vaccinia virus K 3 L gene products structurally resemble the amino-terminal third of eIF 2 α. We {{demonstrate that the}} C 8 L protein, like the K 3 L protein, can reverse the toxic effects caused by high level expression of human PKR in yeast cells. In addition, expression of either the K 3 L or C 8 L gene product was found to reverse the inhibition of reporter gene translation caused by PKR expression in mammalian cells. The inhibitory function of the K 3 L and C 8 L gene products in these assays {{was found to be}} critically dependent on residues near the carboxyl-termini of the proteins including a sequence motif shared among eIF 2 α and the C 8 L and K 3 L gene products.

40|$|DNA of Yaba virus, {{a member}} of the poxviruses, was mapped by cross-hybridization between {{fragments}} of various restriction enzymes. The genome was approxi-mately 13 5 kb in length and possessed two characteristic features of poxviruses: cross-links and inverted terminal repeats at both termini. Hybridization of fragments of Yaba virus DNA to known vaccinia virus DNA fragments indicated that the thymidine kinase (TK) gene mapped within the 0. 9 kb XhoI-HincI I fragment between 52 " 5 and 53 ' 5 kb from the left end of the genome. The fragment could rescue the TK + phenotype in TK cells preinfected with a TK vaccinia virus mutant. Nucleotide sequencing of the fragment revealed an ORF capable of encoding 181 amino acids. The sequence TAAAAATG-AAAAATTA upstream of the ORF was considered to be the promoter and the downstream sequence TTTT-TAT to be the early transcription termination signal. These sequences are in good accord with the consensus regulatory sequences for the expression of early genes of other known poxviruses. The amino acid sequence similarity among the poxvirus TK genes suggests that Yaba virus is most closely related to <b>swinepox</b> virus and less similar to fowlpox virus...|$|E
40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Yatapoxvirus, which include Tanapox virus (TPV) and Yaba monkey tumor virus, infect {{primates}} including humans. Two strains of TPV isolated 50 years apart from patients infected from the equatorial region of Africa have been sequenced. The original isolate from a human case in the Tana River Valley, Kenya, in 1957 (TPV-Kenya) and an isolate from an infected traveler in the Republic of Congo in 2004 (TPV-RoC). Although isolated 50 years apart the genomes were highly conserved. The genomes differed at only 35 of 144, 565 nucleotide positions (99. 98 % identical). We predict that TPV-RoC encodes 155 ORFs, however a single transversion (at nucleotide 10241) in TPV-Kenya resulted in the coding capacity for two predicted ORFs (11. 1 L and 11. 2 L) in comparison to a single ORF (11 L) in TPV-RoC. The genomes of TPV are A+ T rich (73 %) and 96 % of the sequence encodes predicted ORFs. Comparative genomic analysis identified several features shared with other chordopoxviruses. A conserved sequence within the terminal inverted repeat region that is also present in {{the other members of}} the Yatapoxviruses as well as members of the Capripoxviruses, <b>Swinepox</b> virus and an unclassified Deerpox virus suggests the existence of a conserved near-terminal sequence secondary structure. Two previously unidentified gene families were annotated that are represented by ORF TPV 28 L, which matched homologues in certain other chordopoxviruses, and TPV 42. 5 L, which is highly conserved among currently reported chordopoxvirus sequences...|$|E
40|$|AbstractImmunomodulatory {{proteins}} encoded by {{the larger}} DNA viruses interact with {{a wide spectrum of}} immune effector molecules that regulate the antiviral response in the infected host. Here we show that certain poxviruses, including myxoma virus, Shope fibroma virus, rabbitpox virus, vaccinia virus (strain Lister), cowpox virus, and raccoonpox virus, express a new family of secreted proteins which interact with members of both the CC and CXC superfamilies of chemokines. However, <b>swinepox</b> virus and vaccinia virus (strain WR) do not express this activity. Using a recombinant poxviruses, the myxoma M-T 1 and rabbitpox virus 35 kDa secreted proteins were identified as prototypic members of this family of chemokine binding proteins. Members of this T 1 / 35 kDa family of poxvirus-secreted proteins share multiple stretches of identical sequence motifs, including eight conserved cysteine residues, but are otherwise unrelated to any cellular genes in the database. The affinity of the CC chemokine RANTES interaction with M-T 1 was assessed by Scatchard analysis and yielded aKdof approximately 73 nM. In rabbits infected with a mutant rabbitpox virus, in which the 35 kDa gene is deleted, there was an increased number of extravasating leukocytes in the deep dermis during the early phases of infection. These observations suggest that members of the T 1 / 35 kDa class of secreted viral proteins bind multiple members of the chemokine superfamilyin vitroand modulate the influx of inflammatory cells into virus-infected tissuesin vivo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe genome {{sequence}} of Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV), an unclassified {{member of the}} yatapoxvirus genus, has been determined. Excluding the terminal hairpin loops, the YLDV genome is 144, 575 bp in length and contains inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of 1883 bp. Within 20 nucleotides of the termini, there is a sequence that is conserved in other poxviruses and {{is required for the}} resolution of concatemeric replicative DNA intermediates. The nucleotide composition of the genome is 73 % A+T, but the ITRs are only 63 % A+T. The genome contains 151 tightly packed open reading frames (ORFs) that either are ≥ 180 nucleotides in length or are conserved in other poxviruses. ORFs within 23 kb of each end are transcribed toward the termini, whereas ORFs within the central region of the genome are encoded on either DNA strand. In the central region ORFs have a conserved position, orientation, and sequence compared with vaccinia virus ORFs and encode many enzymes, transcription factors, or structural proteins. In contrast, ORFs near the termini are more divergent and in seven cases are without counterparts in other poxviruses. The YLDV genome encodes several predicted immunomodulators; examples include two proteins with similarity to CC chemokine receptors and predicted secreted proteins with similarity to MHC class I antigen, OX- 2, interleukin- 10 /mda- 7, poxvirus growth factor, serpins, and a type I interferon-binding protein. Phylogenic analyses indicated that YLDV is very closely related to yaba monkey tumor virus, but outside the yatapoxvirus genus YLDV is more closely related to <b>swinepox</b> virus and leporipoxviruses than to other chordopoxvirus genera...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe large {{differences}} between the G+C content of the orf virus genome {{and those of other}} characterized poxviruses have precluded the use of DNA hybridization to establish a gone map of orf virus. Here we have sequenced the ends of cloned restriction endonuclease fragments of the NZ 2 strain of orf virus (OV) and used the translated sequences to search protein data bases. Sequence from 15 points found high-scoring matches to data base entries, including 18 vaccinia virus (VAC) genes. We also present 2 kb of sequence from a region near the right terminus of the OV genome and show that it encodes homologs of VAC genes, F 9 L and F 10 L. The data presented here in conjunction with published and as yet unpublished data have allowed the construction of a gone map of OV on which 37 genes have been placed. Thirty-two of these genes have homologs in VAC Alignment of the OV gene map with that of VAC revealed that each OV gene and its VAC counterpart occurred in the same order and orientation on their respective genomes. The intervals between many of the points of sequence were also found to be strikingly similar. The conserved spacing of genes between OV and VAC within the central 88. 2 kb of the 139 -kb OV genome is not maintained in the termini where insertion, deletion, and translocation have occurred.

40|$|Classical {{swine fever}} (CSF) {{is a highly}} {{contagious}} and serious viral disease that affects the pig industry worldwide. The glycoprotein E 2 of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) can induce neutralizing antibodies, and it is widely used for novel vaccine development. To explore {{the development of a}} vaccine against CSFV infections, the gene of glycoprotein E 2 was inserted into the <b>swinepox</b> virus (SPV) genome by homologous recombination. The culture titers of rSPV-E 2 remained at about 4. 3 [*]×[*] 106 TCID 50 for more than 60 passages in PK 15 and swine testis cell lines. The rSPV-E 2 could not be replicated in Vero, MDBK or other non-porcine cell lines. After two to three passages, the SPV specific gene of rSPV-E 2 could not been detected in the non-porcine cell culture. To evaluate the immunogenicity of rSPV-E 2, 20 CSFV seronegative minipigs were immunized with rSPV-E 2, a commercial C-strain vaccine, wild-type SPV (wtSPV; negative control), or PBS (a no-challenge control). After challenge with CSFV, pigs in the rSPV-E 2 -immunized group showed significantly shorter fever duration compared with the wtSPV-treated group (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). E 2 -specific antibodies in the rSPV-E 2 -immunized group increased dramatically after vaccination and increased continuously over time. CSFV genomic copies in the serum of rSPV-E 2 -immunized pigs were significantly less compared with the wtSPV-treated group at all time points after challenge (P[*]<[*] 0. 01). Significant reduction in gross lung lesion scores, histopathological liver, spleen, lung, and kidney lesion scores were noted in the rSPV-E 2 -immunized group compared with the wtSPV-treated group (P[*]<[*] 0. 01). The results suggested that the recombinant rSPV-E 2 provided pigs with significant protection from CSFV infections; thus, rSPV-E 2 offers proof of principle {{for the development of a}} vaccine for the prevention of CSFV infections in pigs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Swinepox</b> virus (SWPV), {{the sole}} {{member of the}} Suipoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae, is the {{etiologic}} agent of a worldwide disease specific for swine. Here we report the genomic sequence of SWPV. The 146 -kbp SWPV genome consists of a central coding region bounded by identical 3. 7 -kbp inverted terminal repeats and contains 150 putative genes. Comparison of SWPV with chordopoxviruses reveals 146 conserved genes encoding proteins involved in basic replicative functions, viral virulence, host range, and immune evasion. Notably, these include genes with similarity to genes for gamma interferon (IFN-γ) receptor, IFN resistance protein, interleukin- 18 binding protein, IFN-α/β binding protein, extracellular enveloped virus host range protein, dUTPase, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, serpin, herpesvirus major histocompatibility complex inhibitor, ectromelia virus macrophage host range protein, myxoma virus M 011 L, variola virus B 22 R, four ankyrin repeat proteins, three kelch-like proteins, five vaccinia virus (VV) A 52 R-like family proteins, and two G protein-coupled receptors. The most conserved genomic region is centrally located and corresponds to the VV region located between genes F 9 L and A 38 L. Within the terminal 13 kbp, colinearity is disrupted and multiple poxvirus gene homologues are absent or share a lower percentage of amino acid identity. Most of these differences involve genes and gene families with likely functions involving viral virulence and host range. Three open reading frames (SPV 018, SPV 019. and SPV 020) are unique for SWPV. Phylogenetic analysis, genome organization, and amino acid identity indicate that SWPV is most {{closely related to the}} capripoxvirus lumpy skin disease virus, followed by the yatapoxvirus yaba-like disease virus and the leporipoxviruses.

40|$|Deerpox virus (DPV), an uncharacterized and {{unclassified}} {{member of}} the Poxviridae, has been isolated from North American free-ranging mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) exhibiting mucocutaneous disease. Here we report the genomic sequence and comparative analysis of two pathogenic DPV isolates, W- 848 - 83 (W 83) and W- 1170 - 84 (W 84). The W 83 and W 84 genomes are 166 and 170 kbp, containing 169 and 170 putative genes, respectively. Nucleotide identity between DPVs is 95 % over the central 157 kbp. W 83 and W 84 share similar gene orders and code for similar replicative, structural, virulence, and host range functions. DPV open reading frames (ORFs) with putative virulence and host range functions include those similar to cytokine receptors (R), including gamma interferon receptor (IFN-_R), interleukin 1 receptor (IL- 1 R), and type 8 CC-chemokine receptors; cytokine binding proteins (BP), including IL- 18 BP, IFN-α/βBP, and tumor necrosis factor binding protein (TNFBP); serpins; and homologues of vaccinia virus (VACV) E 3 L, K 3 L, and A 52 R proteins. DPVs also encode distinct forms of major histocompatibility complex class I, C-type lectin-like protein, and transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF-β 1), a protein not previously described in a mammalian chordopoxvirus. Notably, DPV encodes homologues of cellular endothelin 2 and IL- 1 R antagonist, novel poxviral genes also likely involved in the manipulation of host responses. W 83 and W 84 differ from each other by {{the presence or absence}} of five ORFs. Specifically, homologues of a CD 30 TNFR family protein, <b>swinepox</b> virus SPV 019, and VACV E 11 L core protein are absent in W 83, and homologues of TGF-β 1 and lumpy skin disease virus LSDV 023 are absent in W 84.
