25|$|Another {{influence}} on the perception of student sexuality is <b>school</b> <b>culture,</b> as illustrated by Louisa Allen’s study “Denying the Sexual Subject: Schools' Regulation of Student Sexuality.” This study outlines how <b>school</b> <b>culture</b> can lead students to perceive themselves as having varying levels of sexual agency based on gender while also creating a normalized sexuality {{similar to that in}} the Bay-Cheng study. Regardless of the material included in the curricula of school based sex education, the general attitude surrounding sex within individual schools can influence the ways students think about their own sexuality and sexual experiences.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiences}} {{children go}} through {{during times of}} armed conflict can impede their ability to learn in an educational setting. Schools experience drop-outs of refugee and immigrant students from an array of factors such as: rejection by peers, low self-esteem, antisocial behavior, negative perceptions of their academic ability, and lack of support from school staff and parents. Because refugees come from various regions globally with their own cultural, religious, linguistic, and home practices, the new <b>school</b> <b>culture</b> can conflict with the home culture, causing tension between the student and their family.|$|E

2500|$|After World War I, the {{presence}} and quality of marching bands in the American public school system expanded as military veterans with service band experience began to accept music teaching positions within schools across the country, eventually bringing wind music and marching band into both educational curriculum and <b>school</b> <b>culture.</b> With high school programs on the rise, marching bands started to become competitive organizations, with the first national contest being held in 1923 in Chicago, Illinois. [...] State and national contests became common, often featuring parades and mass-band concerts featuring all participating groups. [...] By 1938, competitive band programs had become numerous and widespread, making a national contest too large to manage and leading to multiple state and regional contests in its place. [...] Today, state contests {{continue to be the}} primary form of marching band competition in the United States.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} {{analysed}} and investigated how sustainable <b>school</b> <b>cultures</b> can be cultivated and perpetuated during changing times. The inquiry was positioned within the contextually bounded system of Christian schools which, {{according to the}} literature, have historically struggled to maintain core ideology and distinctiveness beyond the consolidation phase of cultural development. The study was grounded upon interpretivist assumptions and was framed within a qualitative paradigm of inquiry that utilised a multiple case study design to investigate how six principals within Christian schools in Queensland were seeking to cultivate sustainable <b>school</b> <b>cultures</b> that preserved core ideology whilst responding to change imperatives within an ever-increasingly complex and market driven socio-cultural milieu. The research findings revealed a model for cultivating sustainable Christian <b>school</b> <b>cultures</b> that incorporated four distinct yet interrelated processual fields of cultural meaning-making within a task-relationship/ tradition-innovation continuum. This model conceptualised the capacity building imperatives for sustainable Christian <b>school</b> <b>cultures</b> within the deeply contextualised settings of each school site and revealed process orientated emphases for building sustainable culture capacities. These process orientations provided fields of cultural meaning-making within which core ideology, expressed as social and cultural practices, within site-specific settings, could be sustained and perpetuated during each phase of a Christian school‟s cultural development. It is hoped that {{the findings of this}} study may assist principals and leaders from Christian, non-government and government sectors regarding a possible range of guiding principles, processes and practices that may enhance the cultivation of sustainable <b>school</b> <b>cultures</b> within their contextually bounded settings. It is also anticipated that the outcomes and recommendations of this study may assist leaders of other educational organisations and institutions, including universities and tertiary colleges, who are similarly desiring to cultivate sustainable cultures within changing times...|$|R

I present two teachers working on two very different schools to display how they perceive <b>school</b> <b>cultures</b> and <b>school</b> codes in their respective educational settings. A <b>school’s</b> code or <b>culture</b> is a result of a complex interplay between factors such as teacher background, school traditions, colleagues, students and the characteristics of the school’s area. To become aware of this process of socialisation is highly relevant for any teacher or teacher student since it has a direct impact on a teacher’s work. This study displays two cases of perceived <b>school</b> <b>cultures</b> and <b>school</b> codes and links them to theories within this specific research field...|$|R
