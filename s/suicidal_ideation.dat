40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between coping mechanisms and <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> among women who experience symptoms of postpartum depression. Design This exploratory descriptive study used secondary data from a study of women who experienced symptoms of postpartum depression. Participants Convenience and purposive sampling were used to obtain the community sample of 40 women who experienced symptoms of postpartum depression. Methods Binary logistic regression was employed to explore emotion-focused coping, avoidance-focused coping, problem-focused coping, and religious coping as predictors of <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations.</b> Results Approximately 27 % of the sample reported <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> within the past seven days. The results showed that lower levels of emotion-focused coping {{and higher levels of}} avoidance-focused and religious coping predicted <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> in participants. Problem-focused coping did not predict <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations.</b> Conclusion Overall, our findings provide support for the importance of coping mechanisms as predictors of <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> among women who experience symptoms of postpartum depression. The results illustrate the need for health professionals to conduct routine assessments on coping strategies and thoughts of suicide when caring for postpartum women, as well as the need to integrate coping approaches in the prevention and treatment of <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations...</b>|$|R

The study investigates whether differences among those with <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> exist with respect to gender, race, religious affiliation and faculty for which students are registered. The sample {{of the current study}} consisted of 161 students from two first year Psychology classes at the University of the Western Cape. Non-probability convenience sampling was used whereby only those students who attended the two lectures were asked to participate in the current study. Students self-completed a questionnaire which included a brief demographic section and a section with the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). The overall occurrence of <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> in the chosen sample was 26 %. No significant differences among those with <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> in terms of gender, race, religion or faculty were observed. The results of this study highlight the importance of establishing prevention and intervention programmes on university campuses to create more awareness about suicide and offer more education to students on this topic in general, as well as to specifically offer counselling and support to students suffering from <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Risk {{of suicide}} in {{patients}} with schizophrenia is 20 - to 50 -fold {{higher than in the}} general population. The impact of suicidal behaviour on quality of life rarely was a subject of in-depth analysis. The issue is particularly important in patients after first psychiatric hospitalisation, since the risk of suicide is very high during the first postdischarge months. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse correlations between presence of <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> prior to first hospitalisation and quality of life of patients with schizophrenia during the first post-hospitalisation year. Material and method: Overall, 86 patients were enrolled in the study. <b>Suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> and behaviours were assessed based on interviews with patients and their relatives, as well as on medical records. The patients’ quality of life was evaluated one month (1 st exam) and after one year (2 nd exam) after discharge. Quality of life was assessed using the WHOQOL questionnaire and the SFS scale. Psychopathological symptoms were evaluated using the PANSS inventory. Results: Prior to first hospitalisation, <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> were present in 39. 5...|$|R

Agnew's general strain theory provides the theoretical framework for the study. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was conducted allowing explicit modelling of both direct and mediating effects using observed and latent variables. The findings showed that both depressed mood and anger mediated the relationship between family conflict/violence and sexual abuse and suicidal attempts. However, when testing the mediating pathways between sexual abuse and family conflict/violence and <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations,</b> only depressed mood but not anger turned out to be a significant mediator.

25|$|In 2007 the FDA {{required}} all antidepressants {{to carry}} a black box warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in people younger than 25. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 2-fold increase of the <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideation</b> and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase of suicidality in the 18–24 age group. The suicidality was slightly decreased for those older than 24, and statistically significantly lower in the 65 and older group. This analysis was criticized by Donald Klein, who noted that suicidality, that is <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideation</b> and behavior, is not necessarily a good surrogate marker for completed suicide, and it is still possible that antidepressants may prevent actual suicide while increasing suicidality.|$|E

25|$|With {{long-term}} use and during withdrawal of benzodiazepines, treatment-emergent depression and emotional blunting may emerge and sometimes also <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideation.</b> There {{is evidence that}} the higher the dose used {{the more likely it is}} benzodiazepine use will induce these feelings. Reducing the dose or discontinuing benzodiazepines may be indicated in such cases. Withdrawal symptoms can persist for quite some time after discontinuing benzodiazepines. Some common protracted withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, depression, insomnia, and physical symptoms such as gastrointestinal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal effects. The protracted withdrawal state may still occur despite slow titration of dosage. It is believed that the protracted withdrawal effects are due to persisting neuroadaptations.|$|E

40|$|Background: Because equivocal {{findings}} exist {{with regard}} to the relationship between adolescents' suicidal behaviour and parental marital status, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate this relationship and in particular the effect of the perceived parent-adolescent relationship on this association, taking into account the role of gender. Method: For this purpose, self-report surveys were administered to a representative school-based sample of 2707 adolescents in Antwerp (Belgium). Results: 1) Boys living in a single parent family reported more <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> and self-harming behaviour than boys living in an intact family or in a remarried family; 2) Girls living in a remarried family reported more <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> and self-harming behaviour than girls living in an intact or in a single parent family; 3) Even after controlling for the levels of perceived parent-adolescent relationship, these associations remained significant. Limitations: The cross-sectional design, the retrospective assessment of suicidality and changes in family structure, the lack of external information and the assessment of the parent-adolescent relationship for both parents together, may have influenced the findings. Conclusions: When assessing risk factors for adolescent suicidality, marital status of the parents may bear clinical importance. In contrast to other studies, the perceived parent-adolescent relationship did not alter this association, a finding that needs further study. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} attitudes toward {{counseling}} about sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and other epilepsy risk factors among Austrian, German, and Swiss neurologists and neuropediatricians, {{and to determine}} factors associated with not discussing SUDEP. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to approximately 5, 000 neurologists and neuropediatricians in 2014 regarding respondents' demographics, their working environments, and how often they discussed SUDEP, <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> on anticonvulsive medication, driving restrictions, and risks in daily life activities. RESULTS: In total, 519 surveys were completed (respondents' mean age: 45. 5 years, 41. 6 % female, 66. 9 % adult neurologists, 31. 0 % neuropediatricians). A minority of 2. 7 % reported that they counseled all of their patients on SUDEP, 8. 7 % counseled {{most of the time}} (50 - 90 %), 20. 8 % sometimes (10 - 49 %), 44. 5 % rarely (1 - 9 %), and 23. 3 % reported not counseling about SUDEP at all. In contrast, 92. 9 % reported that they counseled all patients about driving restrictions and 81. 5 % about risks in daily life activities. <b>Suicidal</b> <b>ideations</b> were discussed in 59. 0 % for some and in 3. 3 % for all patients, whereas 35. 1 % of respondents reported never discussing <b>suicidal</b> <b>ideations.</b> Independent predictors of not discussing SUDEP were no additional epilepsy training, no or uncertain SUDEP cases in the past, < 10 years in practice, < 25 epilepsy patients seen per quarter, and the opinion of a lack of consequences in SUDEP prevention. The opinion that SUDEP is a risk factor in particular patient groups and the attitude that all risks should be discussed predicted counseling on SUDEP. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings show a discrepancy between guidelines and practice regarding the discussion of premature mortality due to SUDEP or suicidality. Both are not discussed at all by a substantial proportion of neurologists and neuropediatricians. This is in contrast to ubiquitous education about driving restrictions. Dissemination of knowledge among physicians about potential preventive strategies might increase the likelihood of discussion. Clinical practice guidelines are welcomed by the majority of physicians in this process...|$|R
