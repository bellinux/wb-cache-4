It is a self-contained surface-mount LED device designed either to function on its own or to plug into a compatible unit.|$|E
5000|$|Discrete {{transistors}} are individually packaged transistors. Transistors come in {{many different}} semiconductor packages (see image). The two main categories are through-hole (or leaded), and surface-mount, also known as <b>surface-mount</b> <b>device</b> (SMD). The ball grid array (BGA) is the latest surface-mount package (currently only for large integrated circuits). It has solder [...] "balls" [...] on the underside in place of leads. Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections, SMDs have better high-frequency characteristics but lower power rating.|$|E

50|$|Surface-mount {{technology}} (SMT) is {{a method}} for producing electronic circuits in which the components are mounted or placed directly {{onto the surface of}} printed circuit boards (PCBs). An electronic device so made is called a <b>surface-mount</b> <b>device</b> (SMD). In the industry it has largely replaced the through-hole technology construction method of fitting components with wire leads into holes in the circuit board. Both technologies can be used on the same board, with the through-hole technology used for components not suitable for surface mounting such as large transformers and heat-sinked power semiconductors.|$|E
5000|$|There is a newer {{version of}} the PCB. The V3.57 is a <b>surface-mount</b> <b>device</b> (SMD) {{version of the}} MegaSquirt V3 [...] "thru-hole" [...] main board. The 3.57 version of the board was created {{in order to allow}} for {{automated}} assembly of the majority of components using automated pick and place (machine assembly) and reflow soldering. The boards are meant for those unable or unwilling to assemble their own main board. Note that the V3.57 board is not a replacement for the [...] "build-it-yourself" [...] boards, but rather an additional version of the MegaSquirt main board intended to make life easier for distributors who are building their boards for resale, to compete with mainstream ECU suppliers.|$|E

The evolution, the morphology and the elemental analysis of the intermetallic layer have been evaluated before and after the thermal treatment. Voids produced by the release of volatile species during the soldering process due to the application of flux were present. If compared with SnPb soldered systems, lead-free joints are characterized by larger and a higher amount of voids. In several electronic joints (ball grid arrays (BGA), <b>surface-mounted</b> <b>device</b> components (SMD), etc.) fractures developed after the thermal stresses generated during the accelerated thermal aging. Warpage of the PCB has also been observed. Backward and forward compatibility of SnPb and lead-free BGA connections has been performed on pads with an ENIG finish.

When the number of layers increases, the short connection for the embedded components is clearly superior to the surface-mount capacitor. The resonance frequencies for the embedded capacitor do not change significantly with the increased layer count.

50|$|Most {{tantalum}} capacitors {{are available}} as <b>surface-mount</b> <b>devices</b> {{with a solid}} manganese dioxide or solid polymer electrolyte. A solid electrolyte ensures low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and a stable electrical behavior over a broad temperature range. The high specific capacitance of tantalum capacitors makes them particularly suitable for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals up to some mega-hertz and storing large amounts of energy to support the power rails of highly integrated circuits. Especially the SMD version with its small size and weight make tantalum capacitors attractive for flat or small products. However, due {{to the cost of}} tantalum ore, tantalum electrolytic capacitors are considerably more expensive than comparable aluminum electrolytic capacitors.|$|R

The proposed RF energy harvester operates at UHF RFID band (868 MHz ~ 915 MHz) for far-field RF energy harvesting applications. A concept of hybrid printed electronics which takes advantage of both flexibility of low-cost printed electronics and high performances of ICs is introduced. The passive components of the RF energy harvester, such as the circuit layout and the antenna, are printed on a flexible low-cost polymer substrate utilizing a catalyst-based inkjet printing process for the fabrication of copper metallization layers.

In this work, ceramic and solid tantalum capacitors were evaluated in terms of their dielectric properties as a function of temperature and at various frequencies. The <b>surface-mount</b> <b>devices</b> were characterized in terms of their capacitance stability and dissipation factor in the frequency range of 50 Hz to 100 kHz at temperatures ranging from room temperature (20 deg.

40|$|A {{printed circuit}} board (PCB) {{grouping}} problem arising from the electronics industry is considered. Given a <b>surface-mounting</b> <b>device</b> {{with a number of}} component feeders and several types of PCBs to be produced, the problem is how to group the PCBs so that the total set-up time for component feeders is minimized. The problem is formulated as an integer-programming problem and a column generation approach is proposed to solve it. In this approach, the original problem is decomposed into a master problem and a column-generation subproblem. Starting with a few columns in the master problem, new columns are generated successively by solving the subproblem optimally. To solve the subpro-blem, a branch-and-cut approach is used. To solve the master problem, a branch-and-bound algorithm is used with the generated columns. However, a branching strategy is also proposed that maintains consistency in the column-generation procedure after branching. Computational experiments show that the solution approach gives high-quality solutions in reasonable computing time...|$|R

Thus the problematic of heating sources, having any rotation, is solved to enlarge the capability of conventional analytical approaches for modeling more efficiently the thermal behavior of recent electronic boards. To demonstrate its relevance, the proposed analytical solution has been compared to numerical simulations on the case of a multi-layered electronic board submitted to different configurations of heating sources. ăThe comparison shows a good agreement between analytical and numerical calculations to predict the centroid or average temperatures. The promoted analytical approach establishes a kit of practical expressions, easy to implement, which would be cumulated, using superposition principle, to help electronic designer to early detect excessive temperatures of components or board beyond manufacturer limits.
