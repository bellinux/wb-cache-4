40|$|This paper {{explores the}} puzzle of {{underperformance}} during post-listing period by investigating whether managers manipulate earnings before their <b>stocks</b> <b>switch</b> from the NASDAQ to the NYSE and the AMEX, and from the AMEX to the NYSE during the period 1990 - 1997. Evidence indicates that managers manipulate earnings during the year prior to having their <b>stocks</b> <b>switch</b> to new trading locations. I find a negative relationship between prelisting discretionary current accruals and subsequent earnings changes and stock returns. Such negative relationship is specially pronounced for small-and-aggressive firms than large-andconserve firms. The negative relationship remains even after controlling the potential bias for high-performance firms and is common to all switching firms, especially for those switching to the NYSE...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we examine the {{operating}} performance of <b>stocks</b> that <b>switch</b> from NASDAQ to the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) or the New Stock Exchange (NYSE) and from AMEX to the NYSE. Specifically, we investigate whether post-listing operating performance {{is consistent with the}} reported negative long-term drift of post-listing stock returns and whether there is evidence of self-selection of the listing time. We find evidence of negative post-listing changes in operating return on assets and sales, which, on a match-adjusted basis, are significant for the relatively small NASDAQ <b>stocks</b> <b>switching</b> to AMEX. We also find evidence that firms self-select the time of listing changes. 2003 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association. ...|$|R

We find that the return patterns of <b>stocks</b> that <b>switch</b> markets become more similar to the return patterns of securities listed on the new market prior to the <b>switch.</b> <b>Stocks</b> that are eligible to switch but stay put are more similar to securities listed on their market than to securities listed on the other market.

40|$|Committee Chair:	Dr. Shaun Wang Major Department:	Risk Management and Insurance In {{this thesis}} I employ regime {{switching}} models on a unique dataset of bond downgrades {{to examine the}} information value of timely downgrades. I use ratings from a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) and a non-NRSRO as proxies {{for the arrival of}} public and private information. Regime switching models allow us to identify the time at which a discrete shift in the underlying stock return process takes place, estimate the distribution of returns in each regime and also observe the duration of each regime associated with the day of the downgrade. The first contribution is proposing an alternative way to perform an event study. First I define a regime switching model with two regimes: one of low and high volatility. The probabilistic nature of regime switching models allows us to identify the exact day on which <b>stock</b> returns <b>switch</b> to a high volatility regime. This is directly observed through the estimated daily conditional probability of being in one of the two regimes. In summary, I find that <b>stocks</b> <b>switch</b> from a low-volatility regime (1. 92 %) to a high-volatility regime (6. 10 %) {{on the day of the}} downgrade. The high-volatility regime lasts for about three days and it is mainly driven by downgrades of the smaller bond rating company (non-NRSRO). The second contribution is to propose a method to quantify stock return distress costs associated with downgrades. This measure is based on the capital asset pricing model, uses the parameters of the regime switching model and the estimated daily conditional probabilities of being in each regime. I find that distress costs on stock returns range from 9. 49 % to 12. 91 % for the 10 days prior to the day of the downgrade when assuming unity for the market price of risk. The magnitude and direction (sign) of my estimates are consistent with prior literature on the information value of bond ratings. The third contribution is to propose an extension to regime switching models to the bivariate case with a common shock. I show through a state-contingent model how shocks to the economy may cause a one time loss that affects a portfolio of stocks. I derive the frequency and severity implications of such exogenous shocks on regime switching models...|$|R

We employed linear and nonlinear methods to evaluate the hypothesis empirically. The linear tests show a cyclical pattern in linear dependence suggesting that the Indian <b>stock</b> market <b>switched</b> between periods of efficiency and inefficiency. In contrast, the results from nonlinear tests reveal a strong evidence of nonlinearity in returns throughout the sample period with a sign of tapering magnitude of nonlinear dependence in the recent period. The findings suggest that Indian stock market is moving towards efficiency. The results provide additional insights on association between financial crises, foreign portfolio investments and inefficiency.|$|R
40|$|Using the Australian {{banking and}} metals and mining {{industries}} as the categories in the Barberis and Shleifer model, this study demonstrates switching in the Australian <b>stock</b> market. <b>Switching</b> occurs when investors move into an industry by selling off stocks of an alternate industry, thus causing negative lagged cross-correlation between those industries. Our results, based on daily returns, suggest that category-level investor sentiment may drive observed switching {{patterns in the}} Australian stock market and not fundamental risk factors. Our results also show that switching does not necessarily only occur between value and growth stocks or large-cap and small-cap stocks. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors.

40|$|Markov {{switching}} processes, such as {{the hidden}} Markov model (HMM) and switching linear dynamical system (SLDS), are often used to describe rich dynamical phenomena. They describe complex behavior via repeated returns {{to a set of}} simpler models: imagine a person alternating between walking, running, and jumping behaviors, or a <b>stock</b> index <b>switching</b> between regimes of high and low volatility. Classical approaches to identification and estimation of these models assume a fixed, pre-specified number of dynamical models. We instead examine Bayesian nonparametric approaches that define a prior on Markov switching processes with an unbounded number of potential model parameters (i. e., Markov modes). By leveraging stochastic processes {{such as the}} beta and Dirichlet process, these methods allow the data to drive the complexity of the learned model, while still permitting efficient inference algorithms. They also lead to generalizations which discover and model dynamical behaviors shared among multiple related time series...|$|R
30|$|The linear {{test results}} support the {{proposition}} that Indian <b>stock</b> market <b>switched</b> between efficient and inefficient periods and {{this finding is consistent}} with Charles et al. (2012) Kim et al. (2011), and Alvarez-Ramirez et al. (2012). Nevertheless, the present evidence of strong presence of nonlinear dependence in stock returns throughout the sample suggests that the Indian stock market still inefficient and not experienced efficiency yet. Our finding of highest magnitude of nonlinearity during periods of financial crises in Indian stock returns is consistent with the findings of Urquhart and Hudson (2013) who found similar evidence for the US market. The evidence of nonlinearity during financial crises shows that the stock market crash and economic crises negatively affect the stock market efficiency. Furthermore, the present study finds outflow of FIIs during global financial crises. This evidence suggests that the increasing integration of Indian capital market has not only brought the benefits but also exposed the market to external shocks.|$|R
30|$|The present {{paper has}} {{investigated}} the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) in India, {{one of the}} fastest growing markets. The linear test results indicated a cyclical pattern in autocorrelations suggesting that the Indian <b>stock</b> market <b>switched</b> between periods of efficiency and inefficiency and market has become efficient from the year 2003. The findings from each of the nonlinear tests suggest a strong presence of nonlinear dependence in Indian stock returns throughout the sample period implying possible predictability of returns and consequent excess returns. The nonlinearity in stock returns was highest during various financial crises originated outside India and this finding shows association of informational inefficiency and financial crises. Furthermore, the vulnerability of Indian stock market to the external shocks in a financially liberalized economy is evident from the outflow of FIIs owing to external events. The present evidence of influence of financial crises and reversal of FIIs on efficiency of stock market should be interpreted as identifying an association rather than causality.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{works on}} dynamic asset pricing with heterogeneous agents. The heterogeneous agent model assumes that public {{information is available}} to all investors and agents. However, the agents or the investors form different beliefs and different trading strategies {{based on the same}} information. Investors keep reallocating their money between different strategies depending on their beliefs. This dissertation assumes there are two strategies in the market, namely fundamentalist and chartist strategies. A strategy with a good performance is expected to attract more investors than other strategies. Fundamentalists believe that any mispriced asset adjusts its price back to fair value. Chartists believe that the trend of deviations from fundamental values continues in the next period. This dissertation estimates the model by collecting monthly Australian stock price from 1882 to 2008. Our estimated results support that there is heterogeneity in the stock market and the model with two types of investors outperforms a homogeneous expectation model. The fractions of investors using the chartists and fundamentalists forecasting rules show substantial time variation and switching between predictors. From the 1980 s onwards, the investors in the <b>stock</b> market <b>switch</b> between two strategies more frequently than in the past...|$|R

In the model, the parameters that characterize the transition probability are formulated in the state space. Empirical results from several stock markets show that the duration structures greatly differ depending on countries.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{mechanism}} that relates asset {{returns to the}} firm s optimal listing choice. The crucial element in our framework is not {{a difference in the}} structure or rules of the alternative markets, but a difference in the return patterns of the securities that are traded on these markets. We use a simple trading model with asymmetric information to show that a stock would be more liquid when it is listed on a market with similar securities, or securities with correlated payoff patterns. We empirically examine the implications of our model using NYSE and Nasdaq securities, and document that the return patterns of stocks listed on the NYSE indeed look different from the return patterns of Nasdaq stocks. Stocks that are eligible to list on another market but do not switch have return patterns that are similar to other securities on their own market and different from securities listed on the other market. We show that the return patterns of <b>stocks</b> that <b>switch</b> markets change in the two years prior to the move in the direction of being more similar to the stocks on the new market. Our results are consistent with the notion that managers choose the market on which to list to maximize the liquidity of their stocks. ...|$|R
