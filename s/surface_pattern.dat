40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Surface</b> <b>patterns</b> with {{prescribed}} {{structures and}} properties are highly desirable {{for a variety}} of applications. Increasing the heterogeneity of <b>surface</b> <b>patterns</b> is frequently required. This work opens a new avenue toward creating nanoparticle arrays with multiple periodicities by combining two generally separately applied modalities (i. e., scaffolding and masking) of a monolayer colloidal crystal (MCC) template. Highly ordered, loosely packed binary and ternary <b>surface</b> <b>patterns</b> are realized by a single-step thermal treatment of a gold thin-film-coated MCC and a nonclose-packed MCC template. Our approach enables control of the parameters defining these nanoscale binary and ternary <b>surface</b> <b>patterns,</b> such as particle size, shape, and composition, as well as the interparticle spacing. This technique enables preparation of well-defined binary and ternary <b>surface</b> <b>patterns</b> to achieve customized plasmonic properties. Moreover, with their easy programmability and excellent scalability, the binary and ternary <b>surface</b> <b>patterns</b> presented here could have valuable applications in nanophotonics and biomedicine. Specific examples include biosensing via surface-enhanced Raman scattering, fabrication of plasmonic-enhanced solar cells, and water splitting. 1...|$|R

2500|$|The {{new design}} team was quickly put into action {{designing}} new earthenware dinnerware shapes and patterns {{to be included}} in the Gladding, McBean & Co.’s 1954 Franciscan Ware marketing promotion Modern Americana. [...] The Modern Americana promotion included a group of seven new patterns on three different shapes, to compliment Franciscan’s popular hand-painted embossed dinnerware lines; Apple, Desert Rose, and Ivy. [...] Two new lines with unique shapes were designed for Modern Americana; the 1800 Eclipse shape designed by George T. James and the 1900 Flair shape designed by Mary Jane Winans. [...] The only shape not designed for Modern Americana was the Metropolitan shape. [...] The Metropolitan shape was designed for Gladding, McBean & Co. by Morris B. Sanders {{to be included in}} the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 1940 Exhibition of Contemporary American Industrial Art. [...] The shape was adapted into a dinnerware line sold by the company as the matt glazed Metropolitan Service from 1940-42. [...] From 1948-54, the shapes were sold in gloss glazes as the dinnerware line Tiempo. [...] Surface patterns for the Modern Americana dinnerware group were Eclipse White, Pomegranate, and Starburst on the Eclipse shape; Flair White, Echo, and Woodlore on the Flair shape; and Trio on the Metropolitan shape. [...] Mary C. Brown, a contract designer, designed the surface patterns Starburst and Pomegranate for the Eclipse shape. [...] For the Flair shape, Brown designed the <b>surface</b> <b>pattern</b> Echo and Woodlore was designed by the contract design group, The Millers. [...] George T. James’ wife Esta James, a ceramist whose ceramics were exhibited at The Egg & The Eye gallery in Los Angeles, designed the <b>surface</b> <b>pattern</b> Trio for the Metropolitan shape. [...] The Modern American group of dinnerware patterns was marketed in the company’s promotions in 1954; however the promotion of this grouping ceased in 1955 with all the patterns being folded into the general earthenware lines sold by the Company.|$|E

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{focuses on}} <b>surface</b> <b>patterns,</b> spatiality, and pattern relations in textile design, and aims to explore <b>surface</b> <b>patterns</b> as spatial definers and what they {{mean in the}} context of <b>surface</b> <b>patterns.</b> A {{secondary}} focus relates to applying conceptual spatial determinations as alternative design variables in design processes, and exploring how these could be used to define and analyse pattern relations. Through a series of exploratory design experiments that used printed and projected surface patterns in a three-dimensional setting, which were documented using photographs and film, the notion of pattern relations, wherein scale was used as a design variable, was explored. The outcome of the experiments showed the expressional possibilities that <b>surface</b> <b>patterns</b> may provide in a defined space, and how these are connected to pattern relations. In order to encourage an accompanying discussion regarding alternative methods of analysing <b>surface</b> <b>patterns,</b> the construction of a theoretical model was initiated. Workshops with design students were used as another practical method in this work. The results showed that there is great potential in using conceptual spatial determinations to define pattern relations by viewing <b>surface</b> <b>patterns</b> as spatial definers, rather than taking a traditional perspective on their functions. Another outcome is the theoretical model, which proposes a specific approach to pattern relations. This research demonstrates how conceptual spatial determinations can benefit the textile design process, as well as design teaching, which could in turn provide the field with new expressions that may lead to a change in or fruitful addition to the practice...|$|R

40|$|Animal {{behavioral}} patterns {{can help}} us understand physiological and ecological constraints on animals and its influence on fitness. The <b>surfacing</b> <b>patterns</b> of aquatic air-breathing mam-mals constitute a behavioral pattern that has evolved as a trade-off between the need to re-plenish oxygen stores at the surface {{and the need to}} conduct other activities underwater. This study aims to better understand the <b>surfacing</b> <b>pattern</b> of a marine top predator, the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), by investigating how their dive duration and sur-facing pattern changes across their activity range. Activities were classified into resting, traveling, surface feeding and foraging at depth. For each activity, we classified dives into short and long dives and then estimated the temporal dependence between dive types. We found that minke whales modified their <b>surfacing</b> <b>pattern</b> in an activity-specific manner, both by changing the expression of their dives (i. e. density distribution) and the temporal depen-dence (transition probability) between dive types.

Other elements Ackroyd sees as inherited from the early Celtic church are a concern to portray the essence of animals, a tendency to understatement, and a concern for repeating structures that extends from Celtic knotwork to church organ music to Staffordshire ceramic-ware to stained glass windows and to the wallpapers of William Morris. Strong agrees with Ackroyd on all these points.|$|E

It is necessary to avoid undesired instability and defects of the resist films {{in order to ensure}} the accuracy of the design. This thesis aims to investigate the instability and the surface morphology of polymer films. Spin coating is the most widely used technique to prepare polymer films. Unfortunately, <b>surface</b> <b>patterns</b> are often obtained in spin coated films. Consensus remains elusive till now regarding the formation of these <b>surface</b> <b>patterns.</b> In this thesis, the effects of solvents and substrates on the stability and the surface morphology of polymer thin films have been systematically studied. The stability and the surface morphology were found to depend on the competition of polymer-substrate and solvent-substrate interactions. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) depth profiles were used to determine the distribution of end groups along the depth of the films. A high concentration of bromine end groups at the interface helps to prevent dewetting of films. An increase in the solvent-substrate interactions, which inhibited any contact between the polymer and the substrate, promoted dewetting of films. The addition of nanoparticles was able to suppress dewetting of films. The distribution of the nanoparticles along the depth of the films was obtained by ToF-SIMS depth profiling. The suppression of dewetting was attributed to the surface segregation of the nanoparticles because of their low-surface-tension surface coating. The structure of <b>surface</b> <b>patterns</b> was revealed by ToF-SIMS 3 D microanalyses. For the first time, the <b>surface</b> <b>patterns</b> were unambiguously shown to be hollow rather than solid. Moreover, the structural parameters of the <b>surface</b> <b>patterns</b> were estimated from the retrospectively reconstructed depth profiles. In addition, the effects of temperature and plasma treatment on the morphology of polymer films were also investigated in this thesis...|$|R
