As the corrosion progressed, the spots of iron oxide merged to form a continuous scale after about 5, 000 to 5, 500 hours of exposure.

25|$|Certain {{refractory}} oxides and carbides undergo fragmentation {{during their}} evaporation by the electron beam, {{resulting in a}} stoichiometry {{that is different from}} the initial material. For example, alumina, when evaporated by electron beam, dissociates into aluminum, AlO3 and Al2O. Some refractory carbides like silicon carbide and tungsten carbide decompose upon heating, and the dissociated elements have different volatilities. These compounds can be deposited on the substrate either by reactive evaporation or by co-evaporation. In the reactive evaporation process, the metal is evaporated from the ingot by the electron beam. The vapors are carried by the reactive gas, which is oxygen in case of metal oxides or acetylene in case of <b>metal</b> <b>carbides.</b> When the thermodynamic conditions are met, the vapors react with the gas {{in the vicinity of the}} substrate to form films. <b>Metal</b> <b>carbide</b> films can also be deposited by co-evaporation.
