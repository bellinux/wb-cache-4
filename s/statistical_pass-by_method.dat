40|$|The {{standards}} for the environmental quality required by the European Community are very demanding in what concerns traffic noise. The interaction tire/road is undoubtedly {{one of the main}} sources of traffic noise. Nevertheless, standards do not account for the increase in the noise level caused by rain falling onto road surfaces. Therefore, the aim of this work is to study the effects of water on pass-by noise since the weather is rainy about 25 per cent of the year in Portugal. Thus, it addresses two currently used pavement surfaces, porous asphalt and dense asphalt, constructed in a motorway. A version of the <b>Statistical</b> <b>Pass-By</b> <b>Method</b> was used to assess noise levels with dry and wet surfaces, using a selected set of heavy and light vehicles. The results include analysis of the statistical pass-by index, pressure noise levels and noise spectrum. Noise levels increase significantly with the presence of water, shifting the overall noise by 4 dB(A). The benefits of porous asphalt are null for heavy vehicles, particularly at high speeds.

40|$|Traffic {{noise is}} an {{important}} branch of the environment pollution which deeply affects the population {{and for that reason}} it has been included in the set of pavement performance indicators. Nevertheless, the knowledge on the environmental impact of the existing surface pavement layers is very limited, particularly for what respects to tyre/road noise of thin layers. These layers are at the present time widely used in a great extent with rubberized asphalt both in urban and rural roads especially in the north of Portugal due to environmental concerns. In this paper the comparison of the tyre/road noise (Lmax) generated in roads with thin surface layers is made. The noise levels generated by light and heavy vehicles are set according to the <b>Statistical</b> <b>Pass-By</b> <b>Method</b> (SPB) of which test methods is described in the standard ISO 11819 - 1 : 1997. At management level the information provided by tyre/road noise tests is essential to support environmentally sustainable construction and maintenance alternatives.

40|$|Abstract: Traffic {{noise is}} a {{particular}} threat to the environment {{in the vicinity of}} roads. The level of the noise is influenced by traffic density and traffic composition, as well as vehicle speed and the type of surface. The article presents the results of studies on tire/road noise from passing vehicles at a speed of 40 – 80 kph, carried out by using the <b>statistical</b> <b>pass-by</b> <b>method</b> (SPB), on seven surfaces with different characteristics. It has been shown that increasing the speed from 40 kph to 50 kph contributes to the increase in the maximum A-weighted sound pressure level by about 3 dB, regardless of the type of surface. For larger differences in speed (30 kph– 40 kph) increase in noise levels reaches values about 10 dB. In the case of higher speeds, this increase is slightly lower. In this article, special attention is paid to the noisiness from surfaces made of porous asphalt concrete (PAC), BBTM (thin asphalt layer), and stone mastic asphalt (SMA) with a maximum aggregate size of 8 mm and 5 mm. It has also been proved that surfaces of porous asphalt concrete, within two years after the commissioning, significantly contribute to a reduction of the maximum level of noise in the streets and roads with lower speed of passing cars. Reduction of the maximum A-weighted sound pressure level of a statistical car traveling at 60 kph reaches values of up to about 6 dB, as compared with the SMA 11. Along with the exploitation of the road, air voids in the low-noise surface becomes clogged and acoustic properties of the road decrease to a level similar to standard asphalt...|$|E

40|$|A design can {{be defined}} as {{context-sensitive}} when it achieves effective technical and functional transportation solutions, while preserving and enhancing natural environments and minimizing impacts on local communities. Traffic noise {{is one of the most}} critical environmental impacts of transportation infrastructure and it affects both humans and ecosystems. Tire/pavement noise is caused by a set of interactions at the contact patch and it is the predominant source of road noise at the regular traffic speeds. Wearing course characteristics affect tire/pavement noise through various mechanisms. Furthermore, acoustic performance of road pavements varies over time and it is influenced by both aging and temperature. Three experimentations have been carried out to evaluate wearing course characteristics effects on tire/pavement noise. The first study involves the evaluation of skid resistance, surface texture and tire/pavement noise of an innovative application of multipurpose cold-laid microsurfacing. The second one involves the evaluation of the surface and acoustic characteristics of the different pavement sections of the test track of the Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technology (CPATT) at the University of Waterloo. In the third study, a set of highway sections have been selected in Southern Ontario with various types of pavements. Noise measurements were carried out by means of the <b>Statistical</b> <b>Pass-by</b> (SPB) <b>method</b> in the first case study, whereas in the second and in the third one, Close-proximity (CPX) and the On-Board Sound Intensity (OBSI) methods have been performed in parallel. Test results have contributed to understand the effects of pavement materials, temperature and aging on tire/pavement noise. Negligible correlation was found between surface texture and roughness with noise. As a general trend, aged and stiffer materials have shown to provide higher noise levels than newer and less stiff ones. Noise levels were also observed to be higher with temperature increase...|$|R
40|$|<b>Statistical</b> <b>pass-by</b> {{and close}} {{proximity}} noise levels are two important indexes {{which can be}} used to evaluate the noise generated by traffic, particularly in the range of speeds where the contribution due to interaction between vehicle tyres and road surface becomes meaningful and predominant respect to the engine’s one. In recent works and in international projects (SILVIA), many efforts have been attempted to provide relationships between <b>statistical</b> <b>pass-by</b> and close proximity noise level, as different methods to measure the noise in running conditions. Several data sources are in fact available in which SPB and CPX results at the same road surfaces have been combined; however, based on a comparison between the results of different databases, the conclusion is that CPX-SPB relation is not reproducible. In this paper we show the relationship and the statistical correlation between SPB and CPX levels estimated by carrying out a series of measurements on several sites all over Tuscany Region, characterized by typical conditions of Italian collector roads. The aim of this work is to show that a good local correlation factor can be found even in a typical Italian context and to give some interesting results obtained by measuring test car passages, comparing them with CPX levels...|$|R

METHODS: To investigate traffic noise at toll plaza of highway, <b>Pass-by</b> <b>method</b> {{which is the most}} common used for measuring traffic noise was adopted and the traffic noise at toll plaza was measured for 10 min per hour for 11 hours(13 : 00 ~ 24 : 00). RESULTS: The measured traffic noise by <b>pass-by</b> <b>method</b> was changed as function of the transverse rumble strip configuration. Generally, the maximum difference among three noise measurement sections was 7 dB(A). It might be related with traffic speed. Also, the measured traffic noise was strongly generated from a passenger car which was 2 axle. It means that the most of traffic noise on the road is generated at tire/pavement interface of the passenger car. CONCLUSIONS:The traffic noise was strongly related with vehicle speed and transverse rumble strip configuration on the road. For driver safety, the transverse rumble strip is definitely necessary. However, the complaints from residents near highway was increased by traffic noise from transverse rumble strip. Therefore, To satisfy both safety and reduction of traffic noise, the development of configuration of transvers...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} number of {{vehicles}} using the national road networks that link major urban centers, traffic noise is becoming a major issue in relation to the transportation system. Thus, it is important to determine noise model parameters to predict road traffic noise levels as part of an environmental assessment, according to traffic volume and pavement surface type. To determine the parameters of a noise prediction model, <b>statistical</b> <b>pass-by</b> and close proximity tests are required. This paper provides a parameter determination procedure for noise prediction models through an adaptive particle filter (PF) algorithm, based on using a weigh-in-motion system, which obtains vehicle velocities and types, as well as step-up microphones, which measure the combined noises emitted by various vehicle types. Finally, an evaluation of the adaptive noise parameter determination algorithm was carried out to assess the agreement between predictions and measurements...|$|R

40|$|Noise is {{a growing}} health concern as urban {{residents}} increases rapidly and more reports of noise causing sleep disturbances and increasing the risk of cardiovascular health problems are published. Noise has a negative influence on life quality. This life quality deficiency also shows in housing and office pricing in noisy environments. Housing and office prices are often higher in quiet areas than in noisy areas. Therefore noise is both a health issue and has big economic consequences. The biggest contributor to the road traffic noise is the tire/road noise at speeds above 50 km/h. Therefore {{this is an important}} aspect to monitor and the problem has to be alleviated. In this thesis the client Ramböll has gotten many contracts concerning the state of the roads from governmental institutes. As a part of the evaluation of the roads they want to implement the noise emission as a factor. This gives the government institutions another parameter that helps in the decision of which part of the road network to refurbish first. In the effort to decide what is best way for Ramböll to measure noise a new setup for measuring noise has been developed. The most used ways of measuring tire/road-noise is the close proximity (CPX) -method and the <b>statistical</b> <b>pass-by</b> (SPB) -method. These methods both give accurate results but they have drawbacks. The SPB measurements are time consuming and only give noise levels for a small patch of a road. CPX measurement on the other hand require costly and time consuming development of a measurement trailer. Certifying the trailer and maintenance work of it is expensive. So this report shows a first step in how to build a measurement setup and what aspects were taken into consideration when it was designed. A close proximity measurement setup {{in the form of a}} tube with a microphone placed inside it was built and installed underneath the measurement vehicle. The  measurement setup designed and built was named the Tube-CPX measurement setup in this report. The measurements performed with this Tube-CPX measurement setup show promising results. Similarities between CPX measurement setup and the Tube-CPX setup have been found both in the frequency spectrum as well as in the relation with pass-by measurement noise levels. The repeatability of the Tube-CPX measurements is even better than the compared CPX measurements. Although results are promising more work is required before the Tube-CPX setup can be seen in operation at Ramböll. In particular the question which source causes which sound pressure is required to understand the measured levels. And also more controlled pass-by measurements have to be performed to determine the relation of the absolute values measured at the tire/road impact spot to the values that are most interesting, namely the sound pressure levels that the human at the side of the road depicts...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Current European legislation aims to limit vehicle noise emissions since many people are exposed to road traffic noise in urban areas. Vehicle pass-by noise is measured {{according to the international}} standard ISO 362 in Europe. More recent investigations of urban traffic have led to the proposal of a revised ISO 362 which includes a constant-speed test in addition to the traditional accelerated test {{in order to determine the}} pass-by noise value. In order to meet the legal pass-by noise requirements, vehicle manufacturers and suppliers must analyse and quantify vehicle noise source characteristics during the development phase of the vehicle. In addition, predictive tools need to be available for the estimation of the final pass-by noise value. This thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of vehicle pass-by noise and of the characteristics of the vehicle noise sources contributing to pass-by noise. This is supported through an extensive literature review in which current <b>pass-by</b> noise prediction <b>methods</b> are reviewed as well. Furthermore, three vehicle noise sources are replicated experimentally under laboratory conditions. This involves an orifice noise source, represented by a specially designed loudspeaker on a moving trolley, shell noise, represented by a metal cylinder structure, and tyre cavity and sidewall noise, represented by an annular membrane mounted on a tyre-like structure. The experimentally determined directivity characteristics of the acoustically excited noise sources are utilised in the <b>pass-by</b> noise prediction <b>method.</b> The predictive results are validated against experimental measurements of the three vehicle-like noise sources made within an anechoic chamber...|$|R
40|$|When using {{surfaces}} {{with special}} qualities, {{there is a}} need for tools to assess these qualities. Two <b>methods,</b> SPB (<b>Statistical</b> <b>Pass-by)</b> and CPX (Close Proximity), have been used for testing the noise properties of the surfaces in the other countries. Both of these methods had to be modified to suit the Finnish environment. SPBmod-method adheres to the ISO-standard quite closely. It was decided that heavy vehicles are not included in the test, as stipulated in the standard. The normalisation speeds used are 60, 80 and 100  km/h which are not the same as in the standard. There is only a draft standard for the CPX-method. In this standard it is suggested that four different tyres representing different vehicle types should be used. In Finland the method was modified so that measurements are done with one slick tyre (ASTM E  524). This method is called CPXmod. In this research it was recommended that SPBmod-method should be used. Noise levels of the different products can be expressed by comparing them to the virtual references. Virtual reference is an average of several SPBmod-results of different SMA  16 surfaces of different ages. Virtual references are: 60  km/h, 76  dB; 80  km/h, 80  dB; 100  km/h, 83. 5  dB. According to the standard, measurements can be taken when the air temperature is 5 - 30  °C. It was noticed that in Finland there is a seasonal variation in the results. The variation is smaller during the summer months. That is why it was suggested that in Finland the measurements should be taken during June, July and August. Standard also suggests that results should temperature corrected to the reference temperature (20  °C). There is also no common understanding at the moment about the formula of the temperature correction. That is why it is suggested that the measurements should be taken as close to the reference temperature as possible. Measurements should be taken after the first winter. Because of studded tyres the wearing of surfaces has been a problem in Finland. With the "normal" asphalt surfaces a commonly used method is the Prall method. It was found out that this test does not predict almost at all the wearing of quiet surfaces. One problem was that the test was too "rough" for the core samples and they got broken during the test. The Prall test was modified a little to keep the samples whole but the result was the same. It did not predict the wearing measured from the roads. The only way to evaluate the wearing of the quiet surfaces is to compare the profilometer results with the results of the "normal" asphalt products on the same road. Based on the test roads it seems that during the HILJA-project contractors have succeeded in developing surfaces which have good noise reducing qualities (even over 6  dB less noise than the virtual reference) and do not wear more than the normally used asphalt surfaces on the same roads. The enquiries show that there is still need and willingness to use these surfaces in future. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|New railway {{vehicles}} in Europe have {{to comply with}} noise limits as defined in the Technical Specification for Interoperability (TSI).

In the ACOUTRAIN project, procedures have been proposed for the transposition of pass-by measurement results for vehicle and track. This allows for transposition of pass-by data obtained at a non-compliant site to a TSI compliant track, or to another vehicle on the same track. Transposition of track or vehicle requires source separation of the rolling noise contributions of vehicle and track to the total <b>pass-by</b> level.

This performance can be introduced in noise predicting models, or can give relevant information to support strategic decisions of road authorities.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{relationships}} between tyre/road noise levels measured by the Coast-By (CB) and the Close-ProXimity (CPX) methods. For that purpose, tyre/road noise was measured for a passenger car fitted with four identical patterned tyres rolling {{on a set of}} 15 impervious road surfaces. The CPX and CB measurement methods have been used simultaneously on each road surface at vehicle speeds ranging between 50 km/h and 110 km/h. A very good correlation between overall CPX and CB noise levels recomposed between 400 Hz and 4000 Hz was observed which is consistent with previous results of the literature. With the whole set of road surfaces and frequencies, a fairly good correlation between the CPX and CB spectral noise levels was also observed. Taking each road surface individually, an excellent spectral correlation was observed, leading to a very accurate estimation of the overall CB noise levels from the CPX noise levels. Considering each one-third octave band frequency, the correlations between CPX and CB spectral noise levels were also good and enable to estimate the overall CB noise levels with the same accuracy as when using the correlation between the overall CPX and CB noise levels. As a perspective, the results could help to compare different tyre/road noise prediction models which have been calibrated or validated with different testing <b>method</b> (<b>pass-by</b> or close-proximity) ...|$|R
