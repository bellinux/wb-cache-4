40|$|A slotted {{waveguide}} {{planar array}} was established as the baseline {{design for the}} <b>spaceborne</b> <b>transmitter</b> antenna. Key aspects of efficient energy conversion {{at both ends of}} the power transfer link were analyzed and optimized alternate approaches in the areas of antenna and tube design are discussed. An integrated design concept was developed which meets design requirements, observes structural and thermal constraints, exhibits good performance and was developed in adequate depth to permit cost estimating at the subsystem/component level...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of two configurations for a spaceborne bistatic SAR are examined and {{compared with the}} {{properties of}} a monostatic SAR. The two bistatic configurations considered are a system consisting of an orbiting <b>spaceborne</b> <b>transmitter</b> and a ground receiver and a system consisting of a transmitter on a geostationary satellite and a receiver or receivers on an airborne platform. The properties discussed or analyzed include imaging coordinate system, azimuth and range resolution, azimuth and range ambiguities, and swath width...|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} mission concept {{relying on}} a sparse aperture radar is presented. The receiving-only antenna is distributed on a formation of small satellites orbiting the Earth below independent <b>spaceborne</b> <b>transmitters</b> and exploits their signal to realize a parasitic remote sensing. Therefore, it can be reconfigured and operated at different frequencies depending on the illuminator it intends to parasitize. In this paper, both mission feasibility and preliminary radar performance are assessed by considering a scenario that accounts for a single LEO transmitter and a very LEO receiver as representative of the fractionated passive antenna...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spaceborne</b> <b>transmitters</b> {{have been}} used in {{bistatic}} geometries for a number of planetary surface studies including inference of topography, Fresnel reflectivity, and rms surface slopes on the moon, Mars, and Venus. For the moon and Mars in particular, the bistatic geometry has enabled remote probing in regions and under conditions not obtainable with Earth-based radar systems, yielding information about surface characteristics and properties on scales of centimeters to hundreds of meters that complements monostatic radar observations. A new generation of planetary spacecraft now provides opportunities for further experiments, including more nearly complete definition of the surface scattering function and, possibly, imaging. Targets of interest include the polar regions of Venus (by Magellan) and Mars (by Mars Observer), the enigmatic icy Galilean satellites of Jupiter (by Galileo), and Saturn's largest moon Titan (by Cassini) ...|$|R

High power <b>spaceborne</b> TV <b>transmitter</b> design {{and the development of a}} low cost, low noise ground receiver for domestic reception are considered most important for implementation of a TVBS system...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{important}} experimentations {{were conducted}} {{on the use of}} space-airborne bistatic SAR. All the per-formed experiments relied on side-looking geometry both for the transmitter and the receiver, with platforms moving on parallel tracks, thus reducing geometric and radiometric distortions and focusing on synchronization and processing issues. However, present and future satellite illuminators shall allow more general observation geometries to be exploited for several additional applications with respect to remote sensing, such as navigation and surveillance, and the airborne receivers, depending on their working scenario, could be forced to gather data from arbitrary directions. On this basis a geometric analysis is carried out to define image resolutions and to indi-viduate best/worst illumination conditions of the <b>spaceborne</b> <b>transmitter...</b>|$|E
40|$|Future bi- and multistatic SAR {{systems could}} support the {{scientific}} community and the commercial market with an additional and powerful tool for imaging and exploration of interesting areas on earth. With the diversity of geometries between transmitter and receivers one can achieve for instance improvements in scene classification, extractions of particular features, and cost reduction. New promising experiments are necessary to investigate {{advantages and disadvantages of}} bi- and multistatic SAR system. This paper presents some challenging problems and possible solutions of future hybrid SAR exploration using a <b>spaceborne</b> <b>transmitter</b> and an airborne receiver. Special aspects like the resolution of the point spread function derived from the k-space or the estimation of the SNR will be shown. Finally, new intended bistatic spaceborne/airborne SAR experiments between TerraSAR-X and PAMIR will be discussed...|$|E
30|$|Following signal synchronisation, {{an image}} {{formation}} algorithm {{is required to}} generate imagery of an interrogated scene. In the general BSAR case, image formation algorithms need to take two things into account. The first is the outputs of the synchronisation algorithm to maintain coherence, {{and the second is}} the topology of the bistatic acquisition. The reason for the latter is that different acquisition geometries imply different bistatic range/Doppler histories, {{which may or may not}} allow efficient processing algorithms in the frequency domain. This is particularly true for the SS-BSAR case, where there is little control in the choice of acquisition geometry due to the <b>spaceborne</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Another factor to consider is the receiver configuration. A fixed receiver on the ground may generally be simpler in terms of the processing; however, this is not necessarily the case. On the other hand, a moving receiver has the added complexity of motion compensation.|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of the requirements}} and design options {{in the development of}} a <b>spaceborne</b> laser <b>transmitter</b> for NASA's Geodynamic Laser Ranging System. Three different oscillators are considered. The first is an injection-seeded ring oscillator yielding 1 mJ of energy within a 120 -ps pulse. The second is a frequency-modulated mode-locked oscillator emitting 0. 30 nJ in a 20 -ps pulse. The third is a self-starting, additive pulse mode-locked laser. Detailed design considerations and preliminary results of these lasers are reported as well as the design of a unique multipass amplifier...|$|R

Using either commercially available or recently developed in-house GaAs Schottky Read-profile IMPATT diodes, DC/RF power added efficiencies of 14 to 15 % were achieved in these amplifier stages. A two stage IMPATT driver amplifier with similar RF output power capability exhibited 13 + or - 0. 5 dB operating gain over a 1 GHz bandwidth...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{navigation}} system for Unmanned Airborne System (UAS) based on bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{is built on}} <b>spaceborne</b> radar <b>transmitters</b> and airborne receivers, the latter mounted in a forward-looking geometry. UASs can be categorized either accordingly {{to the type of}} the mission, or on the basis of altitude/endurance/range performance, or depending on maximum take-off weight (MTOW), on propulsion technology, etc. Two preliminary strawman system configurations, characterized by different performance levels and complexities, can be envisaged, all building of an upgrade of Galileo constellation. In the first case, the additional payload to be embarked on Galileo satellites has a medium impact on the platform, whereas such impact is kept at a more reasonable level for the second option...|$|R
40|$|Bistatic radars offer several {{advantages}} {{when compared to}} their monostatic counterparts. In addition to increased per- formance, sensitivity, coverage and revisit times, all of them parameters which are mainly dependent on their spatial conﬁguration, bistatic radars offer the objective advantage of being more robust to jamming, since the receiver operates as a mere passive system. The proposed system consists of a spaceborne radar transmitter illuminating an area of interest and one or several radar receivers mounted on a UAV to perform a two-goal mission: a) help autonomous navigation of the UAV by performing the sense and avoid function, and b) perform surveillance of the overﬂown area using high-resolution remote sensing techniques. Although the requirements for these signiﬁcantly different tasks might seem distant, having a <b>spaceborne</b> <b>transmitter</b> ensures that the coverage needed for both purposes is achievable. The system can provide a cheap and robust manner for enabling global UAV ﬂight, while enabling continuous all-weather imaging capabilities...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{summarizes}} {{the research on}} the feasibility investigation of Space-Surface (i. e. a <b>spaceborne</b> <b>transmitter</b> and an airborne receiver) Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SSBSAR) with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) which {{is used as a}} transmitter of opportunity. The most promising non-cooperative transmitter, among the existing GNSS, for the practical radar applications is the newly introduced European Galileo system. Three main areas are included in the thesis: the system overview, hardware and experimentation, and the experiential results analysis. The system overview discusses the key operation principles (topology, synchronization, etc.) of the proposed radar system and an analysis of the system parameters (power budget, spatial resolution etc.). A hardware was specially developed and the experiments have been conducted to investigate the system feasibility and performance. Synchronisation and image formation algorithms are discussed with the dedication to the proposed radar system. The experimental results, obtained from the synchronisation, stationary receiver and ground moving receiver experiments are presented and analysed in the thesis.

40|$|Radar is a {{powerful}} technique that has furnished otherwise unavailable information about solar system bodies for three decades. The advantages of radar in planetary astronomy result from: (1) the observer's control of all the attributes of the coherent signal used to illuminate the target, especially the wave form's time/frequency modulation and polarization; (2) the ability of radar to resolve objects spatially via measurements {{of the distribution of}} echo power in time delay and Doppler frequency; (3) the pronounced degree to which delay-Doppler measurements constrain orbits and spin vectors; and (4) centimeter-to-meter wavelengths, which easily penetrate optically opaque planetary clouds and cometary comae, permit investigation of near-surface macrostructure and bulk density, and are sensitive to high concentrations of metal or, in certain situations, ice. Planetary radar astronomy has primarily involved observations with Earth-based radar telescopes, but also includes some experiments with a <b>spaceborne</b> <b>transmitter</b> or receiver. In addition to providing a wealth of information about the geological and dynamical properties of asteroids, comets, the inner planets, and natural satellites, radar experiments have established the scale of the solar system, have contributed significantly to the accuracy of planetary ephemerides, and have helped to constrain theories of gravitation. This review outlines radar astronomical techniques and describes principal observational results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: High-altitude {{platforms}} (HAP) or near-space vehicle {{offers several}} advantages over current {{low earth orbit}} (LEO) satellite and airplane, because HAP is not constrained by orbital mechanics and fuel consumption. These advantages provide potential for some specific remote sensing applications that require persistent monitoring or fast-revisiting frequency. This paper investigates the azimuth-variant signal processing in HAP-borne bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) with <b>spaceborne</b> or airborne <b>transmitter</b> for high-resolution remote sensing. The system configuration, azimuth-variant Doppler characteristics and two-dimensional echo spectrum are analyzed. Conceptual system simulation results are also provided. Since the azimuth-variant BiSAR geometry brings a challenge for developing high precision data processing algorithms, we propose an image formation algorithm using equivalent velocity and nonlinear chirp scaling (NCS) to address the azimuth-variant signal processing problem. The proposed algorithm is verified by numerical simulation results...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} and experimental {{analysis of a}} pulsed 1645 nm optical parametric oscillator (OPO) conducted to prove the feasibility of such a device for a <b>spaceborne</b> laser <b>transmitter</b> in an integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar system. The investigation {{is part of the}} French-German satellite mission MERLIN (Methane Remote Sensing Lidar Mission). As an effective greenhouse gas, methane plays an important role for the global climate. The architecture of the OPO is based on a conceptual design developed by DLR, consisting of two KTA crystals in a four-mirror-cavity. One of the cavity mirrors is piezo-driven to provide single frequency operation of the OPO. Using numerical simulations, we studied the performance and alignment tolerances of such a setup with KTP and KTA and investigated means to optimize the optical design by increasing the efficiency and decreasing the fluence on the optical components. For the experimental testing of the OPO, we used the INNOSlab-based ESA pre-development model ATLAS as pump laser at 1064 nm. At a pulse frequency of 25 Hz this MOPA delivers a pump energy up to 45 mJ with a beam quality factor of about M- 2 = 1. 3. With KTP as nonlinear crystal the OPO obtained 9. 2 mJ pulse energy at 1645 nm from 31. 5 mJ of the pump and a pump pulse duration of 42 ns. This corresponds to an optical/optical efficiency of 29 %. After the pump pulse was reduced to 24 ns a similar OPO performance could be obtained by adapting the pump beam radius...|$|R
