[...] This resulted in the Michaelis–Menten equations. Menten also invented the azo-dye coupling reaction for alkaline phosphatase, which is still used in histochemistry. She characterised bacterial toxins from B. paratyphosus, Streptococcus <b>scarlatina</b> and Salmonella ssp., and conducted the first electrophoretic separation of proteins in 1944. She worked on the properties of hemoglobin, regulation of blood sugar level, and kidney function.|$|E

40|$|Rabbits immunized with filtrates of {{cultures}} of hemolytic streptococcus from erysipelas show cutaneous allergy. Two periods of allergy have been observed, an early and a late phase.

40|$|The {{cutaneous}} reaction {{demonstrates that}} the culture lysate of Streptococcus <b>scarlatinæ</b> is approximately ten time more potent in its toxic effect than is the culture filtrate since repeated and carefully controlled human skin tests show that 0. 1 cc. of a 1 : 2000 dilution of lysate reacts equally {{as well as a}} similar dose of a 1 : 250 dilution of culture filtrate (Dick's standard skin unit). Animal tests and the human intradermal reaction clearly reveal that the toxic principle of culture filtrate (Dick's toxin) and culture lysate (Duval-Hibbard endotoxin) are of the same nature) namely intracellular derivatives of the streptococcal cell. The in vivo prepared lysate affords a more potent antigen for the production of an antiendotoxic serum than the living, killed or culture filtrate of Streptococcus <b>scarlatinæ.</b> The inoculations into dogs of culture filtrate and of the "washed coccal bodies" yield strikingly different results. In those that receive filtrate no toxic effect is produced while in the ones injected with the washed coccal bodies a severe and often fatal toxemia results. The dog is highly susceptible to infection with Streptococcus <b>scarlatinæ</b> and also readily affected by injections of the in vivo prepared lysate. Toxic effects are produced almost immediately following the intravenous injection of lysate and death usually occurs in 24 to 48 hours from an acute hemorrhagic nephritis. Daily urinary examination shows a high percentage of albumin, large numbers of fine granular casts and quantities of macroscopic blood. A study of the kidney sections reveals an extensive glomerulonephritis. The work reported constitutes further evidence in support of our original contention that the poisonous substance of the scarlatinal streptococcus is derived from the bacterial cell set free through the dissolution of the germ plasm. The liberation of the poison in vitro occurs as the natural result of autolysis while in vivo it is produced through specific action of bacteriolysin...|$|R

In an hour or so the village doctor was there, and he expressed an opinion that the girl's ailment was certainly <b>scarlatina.</b> Mrs Dale, not satisfied with this, sent off a boy to Guestwick for Dr Crofts, having herself maintained an opposition of many years' standing against the medical reputation of the apothecary, and gave a positive order to the two girls not to visit poor Jane again.

I long to be among them, and named an early day, because measles and <b>scarlatina</b> are coming round again, and only Fanny, and the twins, Gus and Gam, have had either.

60|$|All {{this changed}} {{for a few}} hours the current of Mrs Dale's thoughts: but in the evening {{she went back to the}} subject of her morning conversation, and before the three ladies went to bed, they held {{together}} an open council of war upon the subject. Dr Crofts had been found to be away from Guestwick, and word had been sent on his behalf that he would be over at Allington early on the following morning. Mrs Dale had almost made up her mind that the malady of her favourite maid was not <b>scarlatina,</b> but had not on that account relaxed her order as to the absence of her daughters from the maid's bedside.|$|E

Sighs, with the high-minded, force themselves into the guise of poetry, and so it had been with him. He got leave of absence for a week, and shut himself up alone in his lodgings; for a week in his lodgings, during the long evenings of winter, did he remain unseen and unheard of. His landlady {{thought that he was}} in debt, and his friends whispered abroad that he had caught <b>scarlatina.</b> But {{at the end of the}} seven days he came forth, pale indeed, but with his countenance lighted up by ecstatic fire, and as he started for his office, he carefully folded and put into his pocket the elegantly written poem on which he had been so intently engaged." ...|$|E
60|$|In due course, {{the morning}} came--indeed, {{it was not}} far off--and with it wiser counsels. Mary woke early {{and talked about the}} baby, which was teething; indeed, so soon as the nurse was up she sent for it that the three of them might hold a {{consultation}} over a swollen gum. Also she discussed the date of their departure to Beaulieu, for again Christmas was near at hand; adding, however, somewhat to Morris's relief, that unless the baby's teeth went on better she really did not think that they could go, as it would be most unwise to take her out of the care of Dr. Charters and trust her to the tender mercies of foreign leeches. Morris agreed that it might be risky, and mentioned that in a letter which he had received from the concierge at Beaulieu a few days before, that functionary said that the place was overrun with measles and <b>scarlatina.</b>|$|E
60|$|And {{there were}} the water-babies in thousands, more than Tom, or you either, could count.--All the little {{children}} whom the good fairies take to, because their cruel mothers and fathers will not; all who are untaught and brought up heathens, and all who come to grief by ill-usage or ignorance or neglect; all the little children who are overlaid, or given gin when they are young, or are let to drink out of hot kettles, or {{to fall into the}} fire; all the little children in alleys and courts, and tumble-down cottages, who die by fever, and cholera, and measles, and <b>scarlatina,</b> and nasty complaints which no one has any business to have, and which no one will have some day, when folks have common sense; and all the little children who have been killed by cruel masters and wicked soldiers; they were all there, except, of course, the babes of Bethlehem who were killed by wicked King Herod; for they were taken straight to heaven long ago, as everybody knows, and we call them the Holy Innocents.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Headworth considered. 'Since you ask me, I {{think she}} has kept the {{possibility}} of the life before her. We have never mentioned the subject, and, as I said, the belief in his death ended a great suspense and sense of wounded affection. She began soon and vigorously to turn her attention to the support of her child, and has found a fair measure of happiness; {{but at the same time}} she has shrunk from all notice and society, more than would be natural in so very young a widow and so attractive, more than I should have expected from her original character. And once, when she did apprehend symptoms of admiration, she insisted that I should tell the history, enough, as she said, to make it plain that it was impossible. There was one night too, when she had <b>scarlatina,</b> and was a little lightheaded, only four years ago, when she talked a good deal about his coming back; but that might have been only the old impression on her brain, of that long watching at Dieppe.

6000|$|On the day {{following}} their religious discussion an accident happened {{which resulted in}} Geoffrey and Beatrice being more than ever thrown {{in the company of}} each other. During the previous week two cases of <b>scarlatina</b> had been reported among the school children, and now {{it was found that the}} complaint had spread so much that it was necessary to close the school. This meant, of course, that Beatrice had all her time upon her hands. And so had Geoffrey. It was his custom to bathe before breakfast, after which he had nothing to do for the rest of the day. Beatrice with little Effie also bathed before breakfast from the ladies' bathing-place, a quarter of a mile off, and sometimes he would meet her as she returned, glowing with health and beauty like Venus new risen from the Cyprian sea, her half-dried hair hanging in heavy masses down her back. Then after breakfast they would take Effie down to the beach, and her [...] "auntie," [...] as the child learned to call Beatrice, would teach her lessons and poetry till she was tired, and ran away to paddle in the sea or look for prawns among the rocks.|$|E
6000|$|That was the {{rallying}} {{cry of the}} Conservative party, worshippers of Baalzebub, god of flies, and of that (so say Syrian scholars) from which flies are bred. And, indeed, there were excuses for them, on the Yankee ground, that [...] "there's a deal of human natur' in man." [...] It is hard to human nature {{to make all the}} humiliating confessions which must precede sanitary repentance; to say, [...] "I have been a very nasty, dirty fellow. I have lived contented in evil smells, till I care for them no more than my pig does. I have refused to understand Nature's broadest hints, that anything which is so disagreeable is not meant to be left about. I have probably been more or less the cause of half my own illnesses, and of three-fourths of the illness of my children; for aught I know, it is very much my fault that my own baby has died of <b>scarlatina,</b> and two or three of my tenants of typhus. No, hang it! that's too much to make any man confess to! I'll prove my innocence by not reforming!" [...] So sanitary reform is thrust out of sight, simply because its necessity is too humiliating to the pride of all, too frightful to the consciences of many.|$|E
60|$|It befell (to go on {{a second}} time) that Sir John, hunting all day, and dining at five, fell asleep every evening, and snored so terribly that all the windows in Harthover shook, and the soot fell down the chimneys. Whereon My Lady, being no more able to get {{conversation}} out of him than a song out of a dead nightingale, determined {{to go off and}} leave him, and the doctor, and Captain Swinger the agent, to snore in concert every evening to their hearts' content. So she started for the seaside with all the children, in order to put herself and them into condition by mild applications of iodine. She might as well have stayed at home and used Parry's liquid horse-blister, for there was plenty of it in the stables; and then she would have saved her money, and saved the chance, also, of making all the children ill instead of well (as hundreds are made), by taking them to some nasty smelling undrained lodging, and then wondering how they caught <b>scarlatina</b> and diphtheria: but people won't be wise enough to understand that till they are dead of bad smells, and then it will be too late; besides you see, Sir John did certainly snore very loud.|$|E
6000|$|The Thackeray {{girls have}} had the <b>scarlatina</b> at Naples, and have been very desolate, I fear, without a female servant or friend near them.

Still, {{it has been an}} abnormal winter everywhere, and there are cold winds on that coast on certain months of the year always. Lockhart has gone away with the Duke of Wellington, who was in deep consideration how he should manage his funeral on the road. Robert was present when the question was mooted on the Duke's last evening. Should he send the body to England or bury it? Would it be delicate to ask Lockhart which he preferred? Somebody said: 'Suppose you were to ask what he would do with your body if you died yourself.' I am afraid poor Lockhart is really in a dangerous state of health, and {{that it would have been}} better if he had had something tenderer and more considerate than a dukedom travelling with him under his circumstances. He called upon us, and took a great fancy to Robert, I understand, as being 'not at all like a damned literary man.' ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{wonderful}} being absorbed both households, from grandpapa to the deposed sovereign Tilly, whom Sylvia {{called her}} own, and kept much with her; while Prue threatened {{to cause a}} rise in the price of stationery by the daily and copious letters full of warning and advice which she sent, feeling herself a mother in Israel among her tribe of nine, now safely carried through the Red Sea of <b>scarlatina.</b> Happy faces made perpetual sunshine round the little Sylvia, but to none was she so dear a boon as to her young god-mother. Jessie became a trifle jealous of [...] "old Sylvia," [...] as she now called herself, for she almost lived in baby's nursery; hurrying over in time to assist at its morning ablutions, hovering about its crib when it slept, daily discovering beauties invisible even to its mother's eyes, and working early and late on dainty garments, rich in the embroidery which she now thanked Prue for teaching her against her will. The touch of the baby hands seemed to heal her sore heart; the sound of the baby voice, even when most unmusical, had a soothing effect upon her nerves; the tender cares its helplessness demanded absorbed her thoughts, and kept her happy in a new world whose delights she had never known till now.|$|E
6000|$|But was I {{a gloomy}} and distempered man, if, upon such a morn as that, I {{stood on the}} little bridge across a certain brook, and watched the water run, with {{something}} of a sigh? Or if, when the schoolboy beside me lamented that the floods would surely be out, and his day's fishing spoiled, I said to him--"Ah, my boy, {{that is a little}} matter. Look at what you are seeing now, and understand what barbarism and waste mean. Look at all that beautiful water which God has sent us hither off the Atlantic, without trouble or expense to us. Thousands, and tens of thousands, of gallons will run under this bridge to-day; and what shall we do with it? Nothing. And yet: think only of the mills which that water would have turned. Think how it might have kept up health and cleanliness in poor creatures packed away in the back streets of the nearest town, or even in London itself. Think even how country folk, in many parts of England, in three months' time, may be crying out for rain, and afraid of short crops, and fever, and <b>scarlatina,</b> and cattle-plague, for want of the very water which we are now letting run back, wasted, into the sea from whence it came. And yet we call ourselves a civilised people." ...|$|E
6000|$|On gala {{days the}} town fires its great guns, which echo like popguns to these woods, and some waifs of martial music {{occasionally}} penetrate thus far.

[...] It seemed by the distant hum as if somebody's bees had swarmed, and that the neighbors, according to Virgil's advice, by a faint tintinnabulum upon the most sonorous of their domestic utensils, were endeavoring to call them down into the hive again. And when the sound died quite away, and the hum had ceased, and the most favorable breezes told no tale, I knew that they had got the last drone of them all safely into the Middlesex hive, and that now their minds were bent on the honey with which it was smeared.|$|E
60|$|The sickly {{geranium}} which spreads its blanched leaves {{against the}} cellar panes, and peers up, as if imploringly, {{to the narrow}} slip of sunlight {{at the top of}} the narrow alley, had it a voice, could tell more truly than ever a doctor in the town, why little Bessy sickened of the <b>scarlatina,</b> and little Johnny of the hooping-cough, till the toddling wee things who used to pet and water it were carried off each and all of them one by one to the churchyard sleep, while the father and mother sat at home, trying to supply by gin that very vital energy which fresh air and pure water, and the balmy breath of woods and heaths, were made by God to give; and how the little geranium did its best, like a heaven-sent angel, to right the wrong which man's ignorance had begotten, and drank in, day by day, the poisoned atmosphere, and formed it into fair green leaves, and breathed into the children's faces from every pore, whenever they bent over it, the life-giving oxygen for which their dulled blood and festered lungs were craving in vain; fulfilling God's will itself, though man would not, too careless or too covetous to see, after thousands of years of boasted progress, why God had covered the earth with grass, herb, and tree, a living and life-giving garment of perpetual health and youth.|$|E

'"Now," [...] I said, in conclusion, [...] "I fully {{meant to}} send back your boy, {{and tell you}} I would examine him six months hence, {{to see if he}} was fit to be brought into the school, but as I do trust he may behave better, and that this may be the means of {{recovering}} him from this sad state, I shall take him still, unless he behaves again very badly. But remember this--this is the turning point in the boy's life, and all, humanly speaking, depends on the example you set him. What an awful thing it would be, if it pleased God to take him away from you now, and a fit of measles, <b>scarlatina,</b> or any such illness, may do it any day! Remember that you are responsible to a very great extent for your child; that unless it sees you watchful over your thoughts, words, and actions; unless it sees you regular and devout in prayer at home (I don't believe they ever think of such a thing-- God forgive me, if I am wrong); unless it sees you habitually in your place in God's house, you are not doing your duty to yourselves or your child, you are not laying up any hope or comfort whatever for the day of your sickness and death. Now I hope you clearly understand me. I have spoken plainly--exactly what I think, and what I mean to act upon. You know now the sort of person you have to deal with. Good morning,"--and thereupon I marched out, amazed at my own pluck, and heartily glad that I had said what I wished, and felt I ought to say.|$|E
60|$|You will {{understand}} too well why I have waited some days before answering your letter, dearest Fanny, though you bade me write at once, when I {{tell you that}} my own precious Penini has been ill with gastric fever and is even now confined to his bed. Eleven days ago, when he was looking like a live rose and in an exaggeration of spirits, he proposed to go with me, to run by my portantina in which I went to pay a visit some {{mile and a half}} away. The portantini men walked too fast for him, and he was tired and heated. Then, while I paid my visit, he played by the river with a child of the house, and returned with me in the dusk. He complained of being tired during the return, and I took him up into my portantina for ten minutes. He was over-tired, however, over-heated, over-chilled, and the next day had fever and complained of his head. We did not think much of it; and the morning after he seemed so recovered that we took him with us to dine in the mountains with some American friends (the Eckleys--did you hear of them in Rome?)--twenty miles in the carriage, and ten miles on donkey-back. He was in high spirits, and came home at night singing {{at the top of his}} voice--probably to keep off the creeping sense of illness, for he has confessed since that he felt unwell even then. The next day the fever set in. The medical man doubted whether it was measles, <b>scarlatina,</b> or what; but soon the symptoms took the decisive aspect. He has been in bed, strictly confined to bed, since last Sunday-week night--strictly confined, except for one four hours, after which exertion he had a relapse. It is the same fever as Mr. Lytton's, only not as severe, I thank God; the attacks coming on at nights chiefly, and terrifying us, as you may suppose. The child's sweetness and goodness, too, his patience and gentleness, have been very trying. He said to me, 'You pet! don't be unhappy for me. Think it's a poor little boy in the street, and be just only a little sorry, and not unhappy at all.' Well, we may thank God that the bad time seems passed. He is still in bed, but it is a matter of precaution chiefly. The fever is quite in abeyance--has been for two days, and we have all to be grateful for two most tranquil nights. He amuses himself in putting maps together, and cutting out paper, and packing up his desk to go to Florence, which is the idée fixe just now. In fact when he can be moved we shall not wait here a day, for the rains have set in, and the dry elastic air of Florence will be excellent for him. The medical man (an Italian) promises us almost that we may be able to go in a week from this time; but we won't hurry, we will run no risks. For some days he has been allowed no other sort of nourishment but ten dessert-spoonfuls of thin broth twice a day--literally nothing; not a morsel of bread, not a drop of tea, nothing. Even now the only change is, a few more spoonfuls of the same broth. It is hard, for his appetite cries out aloud; and he has agonising visions of beefsteak pies and buttered toast seen in mirage. Still his spirits don't fail on the whole and now that the fever is all but gone, they rise, till we have to beg him to be quiet and not to talk so much. He had the flower-girl in by his bedside yesterday, and it was quite impossible to help laughing, so many Florentine airs did he show off. 'Per Bacco, ho una fame terribile, e non voglio aver più pazienza con questo Dottore.' The doctor, however, seems skilful....|$|E
