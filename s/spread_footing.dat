50|$|The project {{involved}} {{construction of}} two bores of varying width along the Barket Market-Liberty Market Road. The underpass has on/off ramps of varying length, with retaining walls of varying height. The underpass structure is over piles, and piles {{have also been}} used as a retaining structure. The two bores are separated by retaining walls in the underpass {{in such a way that}} four retaining walls frame each bore. The carriageways on the Liberty side are separated by a green belt, while the carriageways on the Barket Market side are separated by a retaining wall. The lengths of the on/off-ramps on the Barket Market side vary. In addition, four single span bridges have been connected to ramps to facilitate making U-turns. On the Barket Market side, with three of the four bridges, double U-turns are facilitated. The bridges are on <b>spread</b> <b>footing</b> with precast prestressed concrete girders. Service roads and slip roads have been provided at grade. A sump pump was installed on the Liberty-side ramp to prevent rain water from flooding the area of the underpass. Drains were made for its disposal.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In recent years, the {{construction}} of foundation elements from large-volume reinforced concrete is becoming increasingly common. This implies a potential increase {{in the risk of}} cracks of thermal origin, due to the heat of hydration of cement. Under these circumstances, these concrete elements need to be treated using the mass concrete theory, widespread in dam construction, but little used when designing buildings. This paper aims to present a case study about the procedures and problems involved in {{the construction}} of a <b>spread</b> <b>footing</b> with a volume of approximately 800 m³ designed for the foundation of a shopping center in São Paulo, Brazil...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhile many spread {{footings}} {{constructed on}} clayey soils are designed using consolidation settlement analyses for the serviceability limit state (SLS), immediate settlement, or undrained displacement, of the footing may also contribute {{a significant portion}} of the total and/or differential settlement. Owing to possible magnitudes in immediate settlement, and with regard to stress history, assessment of the contribution of immediate settlement comprises an essential task for the understanding of the performance of a foundation system. This study proposes a simple reliability-based design (RBD) procedure for assessing the allowable immediate displacement of a <b>spread</b> <b>footing</b> supported on clay in consideration of a desired serviceability limit state. A relationship between the traditional <b>spread</b> <b>footing</b> bearing capacity equation and slope tangent capacity is established, then incorporated into a bivariate normalized bearing pressure–displacement model to estimate the mobilized resistance associated with a given displacement. The model was calibrated using a high quality database of full-scale loading tests compiled from various sources. The loading test data was used to characterize the uncertainty associated with the model and incorporated into an appropriate reliability-based performance function. Monte Carlo simulations were then used to calibrate a resistance factor with consideration of the uncertainty in the bearing pressure–displacement model, bearing capacity, applied bearing pressure, allowable displacement, and footing width. An example is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed procedure to estimate the bearing pressure for an allowable immediate displacement of a footing at the targeted probability and serviceability limit state...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} an {{effective}} method for nonlinear constrained optimization of shallow foundation is presented. A newly developed heuristic global optimization algorithm called Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is introduced and {{applied for the}} optimization of foundation. The algorithm is classified as random search algorithm and does not require initial values and uses a random search instead of a gradient search, so derivative information is unnecessary. The optimization procedure controls all geotechnical and structural design constraints while reducing the overall cost of the foundation. To verify {{the efficiency of the}} proposed method, two design examples of <b>spread</b> <b>footing</b> are illustrated. To further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the GSA, these examples are solved using genetic algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed method could provide solutions of high quality, accuracy and efficiency for optimum design of foundation...|$|E

Great horned owls can apply at least 300 {{pounds per square inch}} (PSI) of crushing power in their talons, a PSI considerably greater than the human hand is capable of exerting.

40|$|Surveillance {{programs}} on farms {{and in the}} local environment provide an essential protection against the importation and spread of exotic diseases. Combined with border quarantine measures, these programs protect both consumers and producers from major health concerns and disease incursions that can potentially destroy local agricultural production and supporting industries, as well as generate substantial losses in trade and tourism. However, surveillance programs also impose costs {{in the form of}} expenditures on the surveillance program itself, along with the costs of disease management and eradication should an incursion occur. Taking border quarantine expenditures as given, this paper develops a stochastic optimal control model (with a jumpdiffusion process) to determine the optimal level of surveillance activity against a disease incursion by minimizing the present value of the major direct and indirect costs of the disease, as well as the cost of the surveillance and disease management and eradication programs. The model is applied to the case of a potential entry and <b>spread</b> of <b>Foot</b> and Mouth Disease in the United States. Results show that current surveillance expenditures are far less than optimal. Surveillance measures, border quarantine, disease incursion and <b>spread,</b> <b>Foot</b> and Mouth...|$|R

The Circular presents state-of-the-practice guidance {{on the design}} of shallow foundation support of highway bridges. The information is intended to be practical in nature, and to especially encourage the cost-effective use of shallow foundations bearing on structural fills. To the greatest extent possible, the document coalesces the research, development and application of shallow foundation support for transportation structures over the last several decades. Detailed design examples are provided for shallow foundations in several bridge support applications according to both Service Load Design (Appendix B) and Load and Resistance Factor Design (Appendix C) methodologies.

40|$|A <b>spread</b> <b>footing</b> is {{sometimes}} selected for a shallow foundation design on clay layers. Its {{ultimate bearing capacity}} usually fluctuates with seasonal changes. Thus, a series of laboratory bearing tests was performed on compacted kaolin specimens with different values of matric suction, which relates to water content. The values of matric suction within the specimens were measured using the contact filter paper technique. All tests were performed after measurement of matric suction by penetrating the rod on the specimen surface until failure. The test results on the normal scale plot show an increase in ultimate bearing capacity with increasing matric suction for all ranges of suction. The increase rate is high at low suction range and decreases with increasing suction.

40|$|The {{different}} {{materials that}} could be used to design the pedestal for a Moon based 16 meter telescope are discussed. The material that should be used has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, high modulus of elasticity, and high compressive and tensile strengths. For the model developed in this study, an aluminum-manganese alloy was used because of its low coefficient of thermal expansion. Due to variations in lunar soil conditions, both vertically and horizontally, three foundation systems are presented. The spudcan footing can be used in the case where dense soil is more than three meters. The <b>spread</b> <b>footing</b> is recommended where the dense soil is between one and three meters.
