He was the {{youngest}} of four children of Thomas Mason, a former textile manager, and Mary, the daughter of John Holden, Esq. The family had moved to Stalybridge from Derbyshire in 1776. After working as the manager of a mill in Ashton-under-Lyne, Thomas established his own business in 1815 in partnership with James Booth and Edward Hulton at Currier <b>Slacks</b> Mill in the town. Rapid growth in their enterprise saw them expand into the Bank Mill and Royal George Mills in the 1820s and Albion Mill in the 1830s. At the age of 10, Hugh was working in the mill, and his education consisted of attending Methodist Sunday schools in Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge and spending three years at a private school in Ashton-under-Lyne.|$|E

Objective: The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the results of tourniquet use with <b>slack</b> in the strap versus no <b>slack</b> before windlass turning, in order to develop best practices. Methods: The authors used a tourniquet manikin 254 times to measure tour-niquet effectiveness, windlass turns, time to stop bleed-ing, and blood volume lost at 5 degrees of strap <b>slack</b> (0 mm, 25 mm, 50 mm, 100 mm, and 200 mm maximum). Results: When comparing no <b>slack</b> (0 mm) to <b>slack</b> (any positive amount), there were increases with <b>slack</b> in windlass turns (p <. 0001, 3 -fold), time to stop bleeding (p <. 0001, 2 -fold), and blood volume lost (p <. 0001, 2 -fold). When comparing no <b>slack</b> to 200 mm <b>slack,</b> the median results showed an increase in <b>slack</b> for windlass turns (p <. 0001), time to stop bleeding (p <. 0001), and blood volume lost (p <. 0001).

There are also variable-flooded <b>slacks,</b> grassland and scrub further inland supporting {{a wide variety}} of flowering and lower plants, birds, and insects. It includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. It is characterised by marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush (Juncus acutus), and willow (Salix) species. On the strandline there is rock sea lavender (Limonium binervosum). The fore and mid dunes are generally sandy yellow dunes, colonised and stabilised by marram grass. Other notable species include sea stock (Matthiola sinuate), sea stork's-bill (Erodium maritimum), sea clover (Trifolium aquamosum), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias), and white horehound (Marrubium vulgare). Further inland, the stable grey dunes are stabilised by other species such as dune fescue (Vulpia membranacea). The dune <b>slacks,</b> the valleys between the dunes, may flood after heavy rain and are wet and marshy during the winter. They support round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush, round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia ssp. maritima), early gentian (Gentianella anglica), and many orchid species.

40|$|Abstract- With the {{challenges}} of growing functionality and scaling chip size, the possible performance improvements {{should be considered in}} the earlier IC design stages, which gives more freedom to the later optimization. Potential <b>slack</b> as an effective metric of possible performance improvements is considered in this work which, as far as we known, is the first work that maximizes the potential <b>slack</b> by retiming for synchronous sequential circuit. A simultaneous <b>slack</b> budgeting and incremental retiming algorithm is proposed for maximizing potential <b>slack.</b> The overall <b>slack</b> budget is optimized by relocating the FFs iteratively with the MIS-based <b>slack</b> estimation. Compared with the potential <b>slack</b> of a well-known min-period retiming, our algorithm improves potential <b>slack</b> averagely 19. 6 % without degrading the circuit performance in reasonable runtime. Furthermore, at the expense of a small amount of timing performance, 0. 52 % and 2. 08 %, the potential <b>slack</b> is increased averagely by 19. 89 % and 28. 16 % separately, which give a hint of the tradeoff between the timing performance and the <b>slack</b> budget. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{questions concerning}} <b>slack's</b> nature and its {{relationships with the}} environment and performance. The research investigates which view of <b>slack</b> (the operations or behavioral approach) best predicts performance. It examines the relationship of environment and <b>slack</b> using both interaction and mediation models. The PIMS database was used for 610 assembly manufacturing firms. The results support both the behavioral and the operations perspectives. This combined view suggests that <b>slack</b> capacity is optimized to improve sales while being minimized to improve profits. Excess inventory is minimized to improve sales but optimized to improve average ROS. In all cases, excess cash is minimized. In all equations, the <b>slack</b> variables entered the equations as costs. These results also support the argument that <b>slack</b> interacts with the environment rather than being in a functional relationship with it. Interaction terms of the <b>slack</b> types and the environment were significant in predicting sales. A mediation model was also tested but had a poorer fit with the data. <b>Slack</b> {{was found to be}} a multi-dimensional concept. The <b>slack</b> variables did not all intercorrelate positively. The negative relationships suggest that management makes decisions as when to use each <b>slack</b> resource. The <b>slack</b> variables (when lagged) had significant effects on each other, but not on performance. This indicates that the time horizon for <b>slack</b> may be shorter than was investigated in this research. The research demonstrated that <b>slack</b> inventory and non-slack supply buffers were negatively related. The conditions under which the firm trades <b>slack</b> for other buffering mechanisms were not clear. Predicted positive relationships between size and <b>slack</b> were found except that excess capacity and size were negatively related. This suggests that larger firms were holding <b>slack</b> in ways that are more discretionary and less obvious to their control systems. What is not clear from this research are the conditions under which management will choose a specific type of <b>slack.</b> In one case (excess working capital), technology predicts the level of this variable. Additional research is suggested to determine how, when and where these decisions are made...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between organizational <b>slack</b> and innovation has remained an unanswered empirical question {{for decades and}} theorists continue to argue over the basic issue of whether <b>slack</b> facilitates or inhibits innovation. Opponents of <b>slack</b> claim that <b>slack</b> relaxes incentives to innovate and encourages wasteful investment in R&D activities, while its proponents counter that <b>slack</b> resources allow individuals and departments to experiment with projects {{that might lead to}} important innovations. In this article, Nitin Nohria and Ranjay Gulati attempt to reconcile the theoretical debate by postulating that <b>slack</b> is neither inherently destructive to an organization, nor is it a fail-safe cure. By discouraging any form of experimentation whose success is uncertain, too little <b>slack</b> inhibits innovation. Similarly, an abundance of <b>slack</b> inhibits innovation by fostering complacency and lax controls. These two extremes suggest the notion that an intermediate level of <b>slack</b> is optimal for innovation in any organizational setting. Multivariate analyses of survey data from 264 functional departments of two multinational corporations support the authors' proposition that both too much and too little <b>slack</b> are detrimental for innovation. Thus, the authors argue that rather than focusing on whether <b>slack</b> has a uniformly positive or negative effect on innovation, theorists and managers should instead ask the question, 'What is the optimal amount of slack?'...|$|R
