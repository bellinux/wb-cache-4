Every few minutes Mrs. Conyers would come out on the porch and look down the road the way the buggy went, like she expected to see that kid coming back on a white pony with a red apple in his hand.

60|$|Wedderburn was a hive, sure enough. Not {{having a}} balloon ourselves, it is {{difficult}} to see all that is going on there; but there can be no mistake (except by the Honourable Hilary's seismograph) that it has become the centre of extraordinary activity. The outside world has paused to draw breath at the spectacle, and members of the metropolitan press are filling the rooms of the Ripton House and adding to the prosperity of its livery-stable. Mr. Crewe is a difficult man to see these days--there are so many visitors at Wedderburn, and the representatives of the metropolitan press hitch their horses and stroll around the grounds, or <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> and converse with gentlemen from various counties of the State who (as the Tribune would put it) have been led by a star to Leith.|$|E

I used to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> in town, and I--I couldn't get over the feeling that you'd simply run up to the drug store and would be right back, and till after it got dark I'd catch myself watching, looking up the street, and you never came, and the house was so empty and still that I didn't like to go in. And sometimes I fell asleep there, in my chair, and didn't wake up till after midnight, and the house----Oh, the devil! Please get me, Carrie. I just want you to know how welcome you'll be if you ever do come. But I'm not asking you to." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{children}} always helped {{their mother}} to edit my books in manuscript. She would <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> {{at the farm}} and read aloud, with her pencil in her hand, and the children would keep an alert and suspicious eye upon her right along, for the belief was well grounded in them that whenever she came across a particularly satisfactory passage she would strike it out. Their suspicions were well founded. The passages which were so satisfactory to them always had an element of strength in them which sorely needed modification or expurgation, and were always sure to get it at their mother's hand. For my own entertainment, and to enjoy the protests of the children, I often abused my editor's innocent confidence. I often interlarded remarks of a studied and felicitously atrocious character purposely to achieve the children's brief delight, and then see the remorseless pencil do its fatal work. I often joined my supplications to the children's for mercy, and strung the argument out and pretended to be in earnest. They were deceived, and so was their mother. It was three against one, and most unfair. But it was very delightful, and I could not resist the temptation. Now and then we gained the victory and there was much rejoicing. Then I privately struck the passage out myself. It had served its purpose. It had furnished three of us with good entertainment, and in being removed from the book by me it was only suffering the fate originally intended for it.|$|E

5000|$|Fields' most {{familiar}} characteristics included a distinctive drawl, {{which was not}} his normal speaking voice. His manner of muttering deprecatory asides was an inheritance from his mother, who in Fields' childhood would <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> and mumble sly comments about neighbors who passed by. He delighted in provoking the censors with double entendres and the near-profanities [...] "Godfrey Daniels" [...] and [...] "mother of pearl".

50|$|The Fort Griffin Fandangle {{traces the}} {{historical}} and cultural development of the area along the Clear Fork of the Brazos River in northern Shackelford County near Fort Griffin, the military outpost that from 1867 to 1881 provided protection for settlers {{in the region and}} gave rise to the town of Albany. The story is recalled through the memory of two old-timers of the region, a cattleman and his wife, who <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of a ranch house to reveal the past as they remember it. The production consists of a series of segments, each based on historical material introduced by the narrators and then interpreted by one or more songs and dancing.|$|E

5000|$|Wadewitz's {{love for}} Liberace {{began when he}} was a young boy growing up in Racine. Young Wadewitz would beg and plead with his parents to buy the new Liberace record when it came out. His {{favorite}} Liberace song is [...] "I'm Always Chasing Rainbows" [...] because it reminds him of his childhood when he would <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> after a warm summer rain as the sun was coming out and suddenly a rainbow would appear. His love for rainbows soon turned into a love for broadcasting and he has been chasing the big gig ever since. After college he moved to West Allis (Stallis) to reconnect with his love for Liberace. He began dressing like his childhood idol and now houses one of the largest Liberace collections in the world.|$|E

Freamon, who has enough time {{in to take}} full retirement, attends with Shardene in tow. Several officers, including McNulty's sergeant Jay Landsman, express dismay at his permanent departure from the homicide department, acknowledging that McNulty was [...] "real murder police" [...] and the best detective in the department in spite of (or possibly because of) his character flaws. McNulty and Freamon make amends with Kima, who admits that she informed Daniels of their lies; McNulty acknowledges that if {{she felt she had}} no other recourse, he trusted her judgment to do the right thing. Freamon takes Greggs into the bar to drink with their colleagues, but McNulty decides to head home.

They met as {{students}} at Bennington College in Vermont and began singing seriously together in 2009. Two come from [...] "singing families" [...] and one got experience singing in a church choir. They were influenced in part by Bulgarian women's choir music, as well as artists such as Celine Dion. According to one report, they would <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of a shared house in Bennington and harmonize on songs they had written; when they sang as a trio, they realized it was [...] "something special." [...] Self-released recordings were picked up by influential blogs such as Pitchfork in late 2009, and they got a record deal with the label Partisan and others. They've been compared to the musical group The Roches. Amelia Randall Meath is the daughter of television producer and professional Santa Claus Jonathan Meath, and lead singer in the band Sylvan Esso.|$|E

The album includes several songs co-written with Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, who co-produced it with Kevin Augunas. The album was so titled to commemorate {{the story of her}} life. June said: [...] "I feel I've spent my life pushing against a stone. And the jobs I've had have been fitting for getting a true feel for how the traditional artists I loved came home after a hard day to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> and play tunes until bedtime." [...] The record includes performances by Booker T. Jones, who co-wrote one of the songs contained on the album. The track [...] "Workin' Woman Blues" [...] was produced and engineered by Peter Sabák in Budapest. June has described the recording of the song as [...] "magical" [...] as it was completed in approximately 30 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{being born}} and {{attending}} {{high school in}} Belize City, Melonie was raised in Burrell Boom.She also attended Community College in the city, where she became a Certified Network Engineer. Upon returning to her home village, Melonie began to experiment with music, entering competitions and ultimately recording music. Her experience with different cultures has contributed greatly to her versatility and numerous styles of music. She has said her biggest influences and motivation has been her family. [...] "I come from a very musical family and I’ve watched my grandfather, uncles, mother, and aunts utilise music as {{the heart of our}} family. It has always brought us together through tears and turmoil, happiness and distress, and it still does! To this day, I can still <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> and listen to the refined, melodious voice of my grandfather as he strums his guitar chanting traditional music and singing ballads of yesteryear." [...] says Melonie. Some of her biggest influences outside of her family include; Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Bob Marley, Abba, Karen Carpenter, and Lauryn Hill. Melonie has tried to stay true to herself, and true to her music by facing issues real to not only her, but to people all over the world. It might only be a first step, but getting through this first step has been years of dedication and perseverance.|$|E
