40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on market power in emissions permits markets, modeling an emissions trading scheme in which polluters differ with respect to their marginal abatement costs at the business-as-usual emissions. The polluters play a two-stage static complete information game in which their market power arises endogenously from their characteristics. In the first stage all polluters bid in an auction for the distribution of the fixed <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> issued by the regulator, and in the second stage they trade these permits in a secondary market. For compliance, they can also engage in abatement activity at a quadratic cost. Under the assumptions of the model, in equilibrium all polluters are successful in the auction. In the secondary market the low-cost emitters are net sellers and the high-cost emitters are net buyers. Moreover, the high-cost emitters are worse off {{as a result of the}} strategic behavior. In addition, the secondary market price is unambiguously above the auction clearing price. I find that the aggregate compliance cost when polluters act strategically increases in the heterogeneity of their marginal abatement costs at the business-as-usual emissions, but there exists a threshold of the fixed <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> above which strategic behavior is compliance cost-saving for the polluters. Finally, for a low enough variance of the marginal abatement cost at the business-as-usual emissions, strategic behavior is compliance cost-saving for the polluters, regardless of the level of the available <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits...</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{theoretical}} background for tradable smoking pollution permits has been outlined by economist Ted Bergstrom of the University of California, Santa Barbara. Bergstrom models {{the negative effects}} of smoking on others as an externality problem that is caused by a [...] "missing market"—no market exists in which non-smokers and smokers can form agreements to internalize the external costs of smoking. In Bergstrom's model, governments fill in this missing market by introducing a new commodity, [...] "smoking permits," [...] along with a law requiring smokers (or smoke-emitting firms) to purchase permits. The government then produces a ﬁxed <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> smoking <b>permits</b> and distributes them in some way among smoke emitters.|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a tradable permit market requires the regulator to select a level of aggregate emissions and then distribute the associated permits (rent) to specific groups. In most circumstances, these decisions are often politically contentious and frequently influenced by rent seeking behaviour. In this paper, we use a contest model to analyse the effects of rent seeking effort when permits are freely distributed (grandfathered). Rent seeking behaviour can influence both the share of permits which an individual firm receives and also the total <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits.</b> This latter impact depends on the responsiveness of the regulator to aggregate rent seeking effort. Using a three-stage game, we show that rent seeking can influence both the distribution of rents and the ex post value of these rents, whilst welfare usually decreases in the responsiveness of the regulator. tradable permit market, rent seeking, initial allocation...|$|E
50|$|The EU ETS {{has seen}} a number of {{significant}} changes, with the first trading period described as a 'learning by doing' phase.

In 2012, the EU ETS was also extended to the airline industry, though this has been paused for one year given the possibility of a global system for these emissions. The price of EU ETS carbon credits has been lower than intended, with a large surplus of allowances, {{in part because of the}} impact of the recent economic crisis on demand.

40|$|The authors examine policy {{problems}} related {{to the use of}} emissions taxes, and emissions trading, two market-based instruments for controlling pollution by getting regulated firms to adopt cleaner technologies. By attaching an explicit price to emissions, these instruments give firms an incentive to continually reduce their volume of emissions. Command, and-control emissions standards create incentives to adopt cleaner technologies only up {{to the point where the}} standards are no longer binding (at which point the shadow price on emissions falls to zero). But the ongoing incentives created by the market-based instruments are not necessarily right, either. Time-consistency constraints on the setting of these instruments limit the regulator's ability toset policies that lead to efficiency in adopting technology options. After examining the time-consistency properties of a Pigouvian emissions tax, and of the emissions trading, the authors find that: 1) If damage is linear, efficiency in adopting technologies involves either universal adoption of the new technology, or universal retention of the old technology, depending on the cost of adoption. The first best tax policy, and the first-best permit-supply policy are both time-consistent under these conditions. 2) If damage is strictly convex, efficiency may require partial adoption of the new technology. In this case, the first-best tax policy is not time-consistent, and the tax rate must be adjusted after adoption has taken place (ratcheting). Ratcheting will induce an efficient equilibrium if there is a large number of firms. If there are relatively few firms, ratcheting creates too many incentives to adopt the new technology. 3) The first-best supply policy is time-consistent if there is a large number of firms. If there are relatively few firms, the first-best supply policy may not be time-consistent, and the regulator must ratchet the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits.</b> With this policy, there are not enough incentives for firms to adopt the new technology. The results do not strongly favor one policy instrument over the other, but if the point of an emissions trading program is to increase technological efficiency, it is necessary to continually adjust the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> in response to technological change, even when the damage is linear. This continual adjustment is not needed for an emissions tax when damage is linear, which may give emissions taxes an advantage over emissions trading.

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} {{replacement}} cost method for calculating {{the value of}} stochastic carbon sink in the EU climate policy for mitigating carbon dioxide emissions. Minimum costs with and without carbon sinks are then derived with a safety-first approach in a chance constrained framework for current system with an emission trading system and national allocation plans and a hypothetical system where all sectors trade. The theoretical results show that i) the value of carbon sink approaches zero for high enough risk discount, ii) relatively low abatement cost in the trading sector curbs <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> on the ETS market, and iii) large abatement costs in the trading sector create values from carbon sink for meeting national targets. The empirical application to the EU commitment of 20 % reduction in carbon dioxides shows large variation in carbon sink value depending on risk discount and on institutional set up. Under no uncertainty, the value can correspond to approximately 0. 45 % of total GDP in EU under current policy system, but it is reduced to one third if all sectors are allowed to trade. The values are unevenly allocated among countries, but in different ways depending on EU policy; under current system countries make gains from reduced costs of meeting national targets, under a sector wide trading scheme buyers of permits gain from reductions in permit price and sellers make associated losses...|$|E
40|$|Shadow prices {{indicate}} implicit {{values of}} limited resources {{at the margin}} and provide important information in decision making for resource management. In continuous economic models, shadow prices associated with demand-supply balance constraints represent consumers' willingness to pay and producers' marginal cost, hence they correspond to market equilibrium prices. As well known, however, marginal analysis fails {{in the case of}} discrete optimization, such as mixed integer programming. An alternative concept has been introduced in the literature to measure the value of an extra unit of a limited resource in such cases. This concept is based on average rather than marginal values, thus called the average shadow price, and interpreted {{in the same way as}} conventional shadow prices. Whether average shadow prices in a discrete economic model can serve as market equilibrium prices has not been addressed in the related literature. The present paper addresses this issue in an empirical setting. Using a tradable pollution permit market as an example, where firms' YES/NO type technology adoption decisions are represented by binary variables, we show that the average shadow price of tradable permits can be interpreted as the equilibrium price only when certain conditions related to the cost structure and emission levels hold. On the other hand, we show that an iterative procedure based on individual firms' cost minimizing behavior presents a better approach for finding a price that can eliminate or reduce the gap between demand and <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> in the market.

40|$|After Bonn and Marrakech it {{is likely}} that {{emission}} trading will be realized in the near future. Major influences on the permit market are the institutional details, the participation structure and the treatment of hot air. Different scenarios do not only differ in their implications for the demand and <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> and thus the permit price, but also in their allocative effects. Most repercussions can be expected to stem from the effects on the world markets for fossil fuel and especially the oil market. For example the withdrawal of the USA from the Kyoto Protocol and the allocation mechanism for the hot air in Russia, Ukraine and Eastern Europe influence the level of energy demand and gross and net energy prices which in turn change the production structure of energy intensive goods and influence welfare depending on whether a country is an energy net exporter or importer. In this paper we discuss different institutional designs for hot air trading combined with the US withdrawal and quantify the effects by using a computable general equilibrium model. Besides detailed results for the analyzed scenarios, two major findings are relevant for future studies on emission trading: First, marginal abatement cost curves are not as stable as presumed up to now. Second, we find that indeed the allocative repercussions of a scenario are to a large degree determined by its effects on world energy demand and world energy prices. Both findings imply that partial equilibrium models of permit trading that are based on marginal abatement curves ignore the important interaction between the permit market and the world energy markets.

While the expected level of emissions under a hybrid policy may {{be more or less}} than under pure emissions trading or a pure emissions tax, under the assumption that uncertainty about aggregate marginal abatement costs is symmetric the most likely outcome is that emissions {{will turn out to be}} less under the hybrid. Finally, a steeper expected marginal damage function calls for higher permit supply and safety valve, which reduces expected aggregate emissions and the probability that the safety valve will be employed.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of U. S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol on environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, {{and the distribution of}} compliance costs for remaining Annex-B countries taking into consideration the monopoly power by the Former Soviet Union (FSU) on international emission permit markets. Based on a multi-region partial equilibrium framework of marginal carbon abatement cost curves, we find that U. S. withdrawal considerably alters the environmental and economic implications of FSU market power in permit trade. Under U. S. compliance, monopolistic permit by FSU has no impact on environmental effectiveness as compared to a competitive trading system. Aggregate emissions of Annex-B regions fall by 10 % below business-as-usual emission levels. Excess costs of market power amount to 40 % of total compliance costs under competitive permit markets. Under U. S. withdrawal, monopolistic permit supply on behalf of the Former Soviet Union will assure some environmental effects of the Kyoto Protocol, with aggregate Annex-B emissions (including U. S.) falling by 3 % vis-à-vis the business-as-usual emission level. For competitive permit trade, environmental effectiveness would be reduced to zero since the U. S. withdrawal implies an excess <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> driving permit prices down to zero. Efficiency losses from monopoly behavior by FSU under U. S. withdrawal double total compliance costs compared to a competitive permit market system which achieves the same environmental target. Given FSU monopoly power, U.

40|$|The {{trading of}} rights to emit carbon dioxide has not officially been sanctioned by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, but it is of {{interest}} to investigate the consequences, both for industrial (Annex B) and developing countries, of allowing such trades. The authors examine the trading of caps assigned to Annex B countries under the Kyoto Protocol and compare the outcome with {{a world in which}} Annex B countries meet with their Kyoto targets without trading. Under the trading scenario the former Soviet Union is the main seller of carbon dioxide permits and Japan, the European Union, and the United States are the main buyers. Permit trading is estimated to reduce the aggregate cost of meeting the Kyoto targets by about 50 percent, compared with no trading. Developing countries, though they do not trade, are nonetheless affected by trading. For example, the price of oil and the demand for other developing country exports are higher with trading than without. The authors also consider what might happen if developing countries were to voluntarily accept caps equal to Business as Usual Emissions and were allowed to sell emission reductions below these caps to Annex B countries. The gains from emissions trading could be big enough to give buyers and sellers incentive to support the system. Indeed, a global market for rights to emit carbon dioxide could reduce the cost of meeting the Kyoto targets by almost 90 percent, if the market were to operate competitively. The division of trading gains, however, may make a competitive outcome unlikely: Under perfect competition, the vast majority of trading gains go to buyers of permits rather than to sellers. Even markets in which the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> is restricted can, however, substantially reduce the cost to Annex B countries of meeting their Kyoto targets, while yielding profits to developing countries that elect to sell permits.

40|$|Emissions trading {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed, {{and in some}} cases implemented, as a tool to reduce pollution. Under an emissions trading system ETS), producers must acquire permits equal to the amount of their emissions in a given period. These permits are then remitted to the issuing institution. So far, the results from actual implementations of emissions trading have been mixed, and some policymakers have argued that taxes would be more effective in reducing emissions. Related criticisms have also appeared in academic studies. For example, in a highly publicized recent study, Clò and Vendramin (2012) criticized features of the ETS that have led to low prices for permits. They also point out shortcomings, specifically in regard to the ability of emissions trading to induce investment in new technologies. They advocate a tax as a more effective non-distortionary instrument. We use insights from dynamic mechanism design in monetary economics to derive properties of optimal dynamic emissions trading mechanisms. We argue that efficient tax policies must be “state-contingent,” and we demonstrate an equivalence between such state-contingent taxes and emissions trading. Restrictions resulting from the money-like feature of permits can break this equivalence when there is endogenous progress in clean technologies. We argue that these restrictions must be taken into consideration in actual policy implementation. Our analysis introduces several ingredients that are largely missing in the existing literature. First, if the policy objective is to maximize social welfare, as opposed to simply reducing emissions to a predetermined level, and if the economy is subject to shocks, then {{it is likely that the}} optimal path for emissions will be time-dependent. In particular, the welfare maximizing level of emissions will depend on the aggregate state of the economy. Second, our analysis identifies state-contingent taxes as an important tool toward implementing efficient levels of output and emissions. Third, we discuss the optimal permit-issue policy in the presence of shocks. Our model shows that a state-contingent tax system can do at least as well as a cap-and-trade system in most cases, and it can dominate it when there is endogenous clean technology adoption. More generally, we argue that policymakers should think about permit-issue in a manner similar to that used by central bankers. At the optimum, the price of permits must increase over time. In the presence of aggregate risk, the optimal <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> is not constant over time and must respond to the shocks affecting the economy. Finally, when firms can choose the level of technological progress in green technologies, emissions trading cannot implement the optimal allocation if there is a high fraction of “dirty firms. ” The reason is that emissions trading either makes technology adoption by these firms too slow, or it must distort production levels relative to the first best. Interestingly, fiscal policies do not suffer from this drawback...|$|E
