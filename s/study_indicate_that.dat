Results indicated that lions form phylogeographic groups, one each in North Africa / Asia, West Africa, eastern Sahel, south-eastern Africa and south-western Africa. Results of another phylogeographic <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> southeastern Ethiopia, western Somalia and northern Kenya are genetic admixture regions between lions from Central Africa and Southern Africa, and that lions {{in the northern}} part of Central Africa are genetically closer to lions in North and West Africa, and those in the southern part closer to lions in Southern Africa.|$|E

Results of this <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> their distribution is closely associated with distribution of wapiti, while distribution of wild boar was not such a strong predictor for tiger distribution. Although they prey on both Siberian roe deer and sika deer, overlap of these ungulates with tigers was low. Distribution of moose was poorly associated with tiger distribution. The distribution of preferred habitat of key prey species was an accurate predictor of tiger distribution.|$|E

25|$|Two extant {{types of}} {{domestic}} water buffalo are recognized based on morphological and behavioural criteria – the river buffalo of South Asia and further {{west to the}} Balkans, Egypt, and Italy, and the swamp buffalo, found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east. The origins of the domestic water buffalo types are debated, although results of a phylogenetic <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the swamp type may have originated in China and was domesticated about 4,000 years ago, while the river type may have originated from India and was domesticated about 5,000 years ago. Water buffalo were traded from the Indus Valley Civilisation to Mesopotamia, in modern Iraq, 2500 BC by the Meluhhas. The seal of a scribe employed by an Akkadian king shows the sacrifice of water buffalo.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} this <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the taxi drivers' (experts') recall of streets was higher in both the route order {{condition}} and the map order condition than in the two random conditions. This indicates that the experts {{were able to use}} their prelearned spatial knowledge to organize the information {{in such a way that}} they surpassed STM and WM capacity limitations. The organization strategy that the drivers employed is known as chunking. Additionally, the comments made by the experts during the procedure point towards their use of route knowledge in completing the task. To ensure that it was in fact spatial information that they were encoding, the researchers also presented lists in alphabetical order and semantic categories. However, the researchers found that it was in fact spatial information that the experts were chunking, allowing them to surpass the limitations of both visuo-spatial STM and WM.|$|E

25|$|A blood-oxygen-level {{dependent}} (BOLD) fMRI {{was used}} {{in a study by}} Drummond et al. to measure the brain's response to verbal learning following sleep deprivation. An fMRI recorded brain activity during a verbal learning task of participants either having a normal night of sleep or those deprived of 34.7 (± 1.2) hours of sleep. The task alternated between a baseline condition of determining whether nouns were upper or lower case and an experimental condition of memorizing a list of nouns. The results of the <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> performance is significantly worse on free recall of the list of nouns when sleep deprived (an average of 2.8 ± 2 words) compared to having a normal night of sleep (4.7 ± 4 words). In terms of brain regions activated, the left prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex, and temporal lobes were found to be activated during the task in the rested state and discrete regions of the prefrontal cortex were even more activated during the task in the sleep deprived state. As well, the bilateral parietal lobe, left middle frontal gyrus, and right interior frontal gyrus were found to be activated for those sleep deprived. The implication of these findings are that the brain can initially compensate for the effects of sleep deprivation while maintaining partially intact performance, which declines with an increasing time-on-task. This initial compensation may be found in the bilateral regions of both frontal and parietal lobes and the activation of the prefrontal cortex is significantly correlated with sleepiness.|$|E

2500|$|... "Student syndrome" [...] {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} where a student will begin to fully apply himself or herself to a task only immediately before a deadline.

Results from a 2002 <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> many students are aware of procrastination and accordingly set binding deadlines long before the date for which a task is due. These self-imposed binding deadlines are correlated with a better performance than without binding deadlines though performance is best for evenly spaced external binding deadlines. Finally, students have difficulties optimally setting self-imposed deadlines, with results suggesting a lack of spacing before the date at which results are due.|$|E
