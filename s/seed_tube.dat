40|$|ABSTRACT. Variation in corn {{seed spacing}} from a John Deere MaxEmerge Plus Vacumeter planter was {{evaluated}} on the University of Nebraska Planter Test Stand {{in a laboratory}} setting for two <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> conditions (new or worn) with two examples of corn seed shape (round or flat). Seed spacing uniformity was measured using three seed spacing uniformity parameters: Coefficient of Precision (CP 3), ISO Multiples index, and ISO Miss index. Differences were detected in all three seed spacing uniformity parameters due to the <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> condition. The new seed tubes had better seed spacing uniformity than the worn seed tubes, within each example of the seed shapes (round or flat) used in this experiment. For the seed used in this experiment, the round corn seed had better seed spacing uniformity than the flat corn seed, {{within each of the}} <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> conditions (new or worn). A recommended schedule for <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> replacement to maintain seed spacing uniformity has not been developed, and more research in this area is needed. Currently, sugarbeet growers in western Nebraska use one of three options: a) test one of their seed tubes on a good planter test stand every year before sugarbeet planting season and replace all tubes when results indicate it will improve seed spacing uniformity to the desired level; b) feel the inside front surface of the <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> every year before sugarbeet planting season and change seed tubes when the feel of the surface changes from a slick plastic to a very fine sandpaper; or c) replace seed tubes before sugarbeet planting season when they have planted over approximately 150 acres of corn per planter row with their current seed tubes...|$|E
40|$|The {{rotary tiller}} slot planter {{of the present}} {{invention}} comprises a subsoiler shank positioned to engage the soil and make a trench therein. A pair of rotary tiller blades are rotatably mounted on the opposite sides of the sub-soil shank in planes parallel thereto. The center-lines of the rotary tiller wheels are located behind the subsoil shank. Each of the wheels have a plurality of blades extending radially outwardly from the rotational axis thereof and terminating in outer radial ends which engage the soil slightly ahead of the subsoiler shank and adjacent the lateral edges of the trench. A <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> shank is positioned behind the subsoiler shank and between the tiller wheels. The <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> shank has a lower end positioned to extend below the soil surface. A <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> is positioned behind the <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> shank for depositing seed in the soil. The rotation of the blades {{on opposite sides of the}} subsoil shank causes the soil to be mechanically aggregated and aerated and helps prepare a seed bed for the seeds. Also, the rotating tiller blades chop the debris which may be along the trench and throw soil backwards so as to cover the planted seed. Shorter rotary blades on the tiller wheels are shaped to throw debris and the upper one-half inch of soil sideways away from the row...|$|E
40|$|In-furrow {{application}} of granular insecticides in corn {{is an effective}} way to provide root zone protection against insects such as corn root worm, wire worms, cutworms, white grubs and other harmful species. Traditional granular application methods consist of dispensing a uniform {{application of}} pesticide over {{the entire length of the}} furrow. A seed-specific granular pesticide application system was developed to decrease the volume of chemical used by metering pesticide into a modified <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> fitted with a brush to hold granules in the <b>seed</b> <b>tube.</b> As a seed passes through the brush, granules are released and fall into the open furrow near the seed. Modifying seed tubes with a brush introduced the possibility of an effect on seed spacing. Effect of the <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> modification on seed spacing was evaluated in laboratory and field trials. ^ Lab trials were performed using a stationary corn planter row unit. Variables tested were brushes (no, yes), granules (no, yes), seeds per second (8. 4, 20. 6), and tilt (no, 8 ° sidehill, 8 ° sidehill x 8 ° downhill). High speed video (1000 fps) recorded seed trajectory and the data was analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results showed while the brushes variable increased the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, and seed speed, the combination of brushes and granules did not affect the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, or seed speed. ^ Field trials consisted of 4 row plots, 30 m (100 ft) long, and replicated 3 times for a total of 12 rows for each variable. Data was recorded by measuring plant-toplant spacing. Data was then analyzed as a complete, unaltered, set and as an adjusted set with all data points 50 % above expected and 50 % below expected removed. Multiple linear regression was the analysis method of choice. Results showed that the brushes and granules combination did not affect seed spacing but did decrease standard deviation of seed spacing (full data set) and increase standard deviation of seed spacing (adjusted data set). ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In-furrow {{chemical}} inputs, such as fungicides and insecticides, {{are currently}} applied {{as a continuous}} band at planting. Focusing these applications at the seed, and minimizing the chemical applied between seeds could reduce in-furrow inputs significantly. The University of Tennessee Sensors and Controls Laboratory has developed a seed-specific applicator to apply discrete bands of liquid chemical to individual seeds at planting. First, seeds are detected in the <b>seed</b> <b>tube,</b> then tracked {{from the point of}} detection to the point of chemical application, and finally sprayed with a variable length chemical band as the seed lands in the furrow. Accuracy of the prototype applicator has been evaluated under various field conditions using cottonseed. In 2002, the applicator was calibrated using a trial-and-error method; 55 to 98 % of planted seeds were adequately sprayed, depending on planter speed [3. 2, 6. 4, 9. 7 km/hr (2, 4, 6 mph) ] and spray band length [2. 5 to 6. 6 cm (1. 0 to 2. 6 in.) ]. The calibration process was automated in 2003, and similar results were observed. Assuming a seeding rate of 9. 8 sd/m (3 sd/ft), material savings of 35 - 75 % are expected (depending on band length) ...|$|E
40|$|A large {{variety of}} natural and {{synthetic}} polymers have been explored as scaffolds for the seeding and growth {{of different types of}} cells. To fabricate a scaffold that {{can be used as a}} synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM), it is important to replicate the nanoscale dimensions of natural ECM. The electrospinning process allows to produce Ultrathin fibers so that this method represents a suitable approach to scaffold fabrication for tissue engineering applications. In this work, the feasibility of obtaining flat or tubular matrices from biocompatible poly[(ethyl phenylalanato) (1. 4) (ethyl glycinato) (0. 6) phosphazene] by electrospinning was evaluated and the effect of process parameters on the diameter of nanofibers was examined. The adhesion and growth of rat neuromicrovascular endothelial cells cultured on sheets and tubes composed by the polymer with an average fiber diameter of 850 +/- 150 nm were also reported. Microscopic examination of the <b>seeded</b> <b>tubes</b> demonstrated that, after 16 days of incubation, endothelial cells formed a monolayer on the whole surface.

It is our hypothesis that to achieve long-term functionality and patency, not only the complete lining with endothelial cells but also full biocompatibility is essential. DesignThe aim was the development of a conduit from a scaffold and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) separated from peripheral blood of a single donor. Materials and methodsEPC and a fibrin preparation were separated from porcine peripheral blood. Fibrin segments were generated seeded with EPC and were perfused in a bioreactor in vitro. ResultsFrom 100 ml blood 12 – 15 cm long fibrin tubes were successfully generated lined with endothelial-like cells. <b>Seeded</b> <b>tubes</b> showed a remarkable elasticity and burst strength up to 90 mm mercury. ConclusionsStable fibrin tubes were successfully generated completely lined with an endothelium-like monolayer from fibrin and EPC, both isolated from the same volume of blood. Although their stability is not those needed for arterial grafting, our results raise the hope, that with distinct improvements in future studies functional autologous vascular grafts could be engineered from the patient's own blood...|$|R

Seed of corn, sunflower, canteloupe, zucchini, bean, pea, and pumpkin cultivars were packaged in two 18 x 2. 5 cm aluminum tubes; wall thickness for each tube was 1. 33 mm. One <b>seed</b> <b>tube</b> was attacked to payload M 0006, tray C- 2; a second tube was stored at room temperature in a lab on Earth. Five lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosimetry wafers (TLD- 100 wafers) were placed in each aluminum tube. The total mean dosages for flight and ground-control TLD wafers were 210. 0 and 0. 9 rads, respectively. Seeds were washed for 2 hrs in a phosphate buffered saline solution. Bacteria were isolated by plating samples of the seed-washings onto dilute tryptic soy agar. Pure isolates of morphologically distinct bacteria were obtained by standard microbiological procedures. Bacteria were grouped according to colony-type and preliminary identification was completed using a fatty-acid analysis system. Bacillus spp. were the primary microoganisms that survived on seed during the experiment. Bacterial diversity and relative abundance were similar for the ground flight seed. Bacillus subtilus, B. pumilus, B. licheniformis, B. polymyxa, B. megaterium, and B. pabuli were isolated most frequently.

40|$|Questions {{concerning}} wildflower usage on Indiana highway rights-of-way were investigated. Native prairie wildflower {{seed quality}} {{was found to}} be highly variable among supply companies, species, and years. Less variability was found among “garden” wildflower species and suppliers. 	Direct seeding {{was found to be}} successful with six species of native prairie forbs: Butterfly Milkweed Asclepiads tuberose, Wild Bergamot Monarda fistulosa, New England Aster Aster novae-angliae, Pale-purple Coneflower Echinacea pallida, Gray-headed Coneflower Ratibido pinnota, Ironweed Vernonia fasciculosa. 	Five species of “garden” wildflowers performed well: Common Cosmos Cosmos bipinnatus, Yellow Cosmos Cosmos sulphureus, Cornflower Centaurea cyanus, Goldenwave Coreopsis sincioria, Black-eyed Susan Rudbeckia hiria. Significant variation was found for species establishment success with respect to soil type. 	Seeding transplanting was found to be a successful method for establishment of forb species, especially those that are difficult to establish by direct seeding. Eight-inch deep <b>seeding</b> <b>tubes</b> increased plant survival compared to plants produced in five inch deep tubes. Use of water-holding polymers in the growing medium, or inoculation with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi did not improve forb transplant survival. YAM inoculation did result in larger plants after the first growing season. 	The cost of establishment and management of wildflowers varied with the type and management strategy.

Additionally, the potential of <b>seeding</b> capillary <b>tubes</b> with a reagent was studied. Pretreatment of tubes would allow microcrystalline tests to be carried out quicker and anywhere without the necessity of taking along expensive and hazardous reagents. The sealing of capillary tubes containing developed microcrystalline tests in order to preserve results for a long period of time was successfully done by applying paraffin wax to the open ends. Finally, it was concluded that capillary tubes are suitable vessels for performing microcrystalline tests. The increased portability of the improved set-up allows tests to be safely executed outside laboratories without impairing the quality of the result. Findings were applied to six legal high samples purchased online between May and August 2011. The active ingredients like MDAI as well as cutting agents like caffeine were successfully identified using the microcrystalline test technique in capillary tubes...|$|R
40|$|Reentry {{models for}} use in {{hypersonic}} wind tunnel tests were fabricated using a stereolithography apparatus. These models were produced in one day or less, which is a significant time savings compared to the manufacture of ceramic or metal models. The models were tested in the NASA Langley Research Center 31 -Inch Mach 10 Air Tunnel. Most of the models did not survive repeated tests in the tunnel, and several failure modes of the models were identified. Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of nitric oxide (NO) was used to visualize the flowfields in the wakes of these models. Pure NO was either <b>seeded</b> through <b>tubes</b> plumbed into the model or via a tube attached to the strut holding the model, which provided localized addition of NO into the model s wake through a porous metal cylinder attached {{to the end of}} the tube. Models included several 2 -inch diameter Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment (IRVE) models and 5 -inch diameter Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) models. Various configurations were studied including different sting placements relative to the models, different model orientations and attachment angles, and different NO seeding methods. The angle of attack of the models was also varied and the location of the laser sheet was scanned to provide three-dimensional flowfield information. Virtual Diagnostics Interface technology, developed at NASA Langley, was used to visualize the data sets in post processing. The use of calibration "dotcards" was investigated to correct for camera perspective and lens distortions in the PLIF images. Lessons learned and recommendations for future experiments are discussed...|$|R

Then, 4  μm thick sections were processed for toluidine blue staining (Sigma-Aldrich).|$|R
40|$|SummaryPulsed Dose Rate (PDR) {{treatment}} {{is a new}} brachytherapy modality that combines physical advantages of high-dose-rate (HDR) technology (isodose optimization and radiation safety) with radiobiological advantages of low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy. Pulsed brachytherapy uses a stronger radiation source than that employed in LDR brachytherapy and provides a series of short 10 to 30 minutes long exposures every hour amounting to approximately the same total dose in the same overall as that administered in the LDR. Modern afterloading equipment offers some advantages over interstitial or intracavitary insertion of separate needles, <b>tubes,</b> <b>seeds</b> or wires. Isodose volumes in tissue can be created flexibly {{by a combination of}} careful positioning of the catheter and by adjusting the dwell times of the computerized stepping source. Automatic removal of radiation sources into a shielded safe eliminates radiation exposures to staff and visitors. Radiation exposure is also eliminated to the staff who previously loaded and unloaded a large variety of radioactive sources into the catheters, ovoids, tubes etc. This review, based on summarized clinical investigations, analyses the feasibility, differences between methods of brachytherapy and preliminary clinical applications of PDR brachytherapy...|$|R
