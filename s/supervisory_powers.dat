25|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Ögedeid and Chagataid families, Möngke {{eliminated}} their estates and assigned acquiescent family members new territories either in Turkestan or in northwest China. After the bloody purge, Möngke ordered a general amnesty for prisoners and captives. In another move to consolidate his power, Möngke gave his brothers Kublai and Hulagu <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> in North China and Iran. Rumors spread that his brother Kublai founded a de facto independent ulus (district) and perhaps took for himself some of the tax receipts that should by rights be coming to Karakorum. In 1257 the Emperor sent two tax inspectors to audit Kublai's official. They found fault, listed 142 breaches of regulations, accused Chinese officials, and even had some executed; Kublai's office was abolished. Möngke's authority took over the collection of all taxes in Kublai's estates. As his Confucian and Buddhist advisers pointed out, Kublai first sent his wives to the court of Khagan and then appealed to Möngke in person. They embraced in tears and Möngke forgave his brother.|$|E

In order to place <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> in a context, Part II outlines the emergence and decline of <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> in the federal system. Part III then traces the origin of <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> in New York to Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 s dictum in Lemon. Part IV explains how <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> is {{an aspect of the}} much broader inherent judicial power, which finds expression in the familiar common law decision-making process. Part V discusses three principal areas in which <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> has been exercised by New York courts since Cardozo: formulating rules of discovery, regulating grand jury practice, and fashioning remedies for governmental misconduct. Finally, Part VI demonstrates that <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> is a legitimate exercise of judicial authority based on two distinct theories: as a sub-constitutional common law of justice and fair dealing, and {{as an integral part of}} the court 2 ̆ 7 s inherent common law power to formulate rules for the proper administration of justice...|$|R

Hence, the power need not be doctrinally confined to the vindication of personal rights ... The supervisorypower enables federal courts, in proper circumstances, to shift the focus from the rights of particular litigants and place it upon governmental conduct or institutions threatening the courts' integrity." ...|$|R
500|$|The Common Assembly (which {{later became}} the European Parliament) was {{composed}} of 78 representatives and exercised <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> over the executive High Authority. The Common Assembly representatives were to be national MPs delegated each year by their Parliaments to the Assembly or directly elected [...] "by universal suffrage" [...] (article 21), though in practice it was the former, as there was no requirement for elections until the Treaties of Rome and no actual election until 1979, as Rome required agreement in the Council on the electoral system first. However, to emphasise that the chamber was not a traditional international organisation composed of representatives of national governments, the Treaty of Paris used the term [...] "representatives of the peoples". The Assembly was not originally specified in the Schuman Plan because it was hoped the Community would use the institutions (Assembly, Court) of the Council of Europe. When this became impossible because of British objections, separate institutions had to be created. The Assembly {{was intended as a}} democratic counter-weight and check to the High Authority, to advise but also to have power to sack the Authority for incompetence, injustice, corruption or fraud.

Under the 2007 Drinking Water Regulations, the EPA had <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> for public water supplies, and could direct a water services authority to improve the management or quality of a public water supply. Where the EPA found deficiencies, it would make recommendations as to what action the water services authority needs to take to remedy any deficiency.

Since the formation of Irish Water, it is legally obliged to [...] "submit all drinking water quality results for compliance testing to the EPA on an annual basis".|$|E

2500|$|Mindful of {{the reports}} of abuse and {{corruption}} in Bengal by Company servants, the India Act itself noted numerous complaints that [...] "'divers Rajahs, Zemindars, Polygars, Talookdars, and landholders"' had been unjustly deprived of 'their lands, jurisdictions, rights, and privileges'."

Although the <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> of the Governor-General-in-Council in Bengal (over Madras and Bombay) were extended—as they were again in the Charter Act of 1793—the subordinate presidencies continued to exercise some autonomy until both the extension of British possessions into becoming contiguous and the advent of faster communications in the next century.|$|E

40|$|Relying on {{something}} it calls <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> or <b>supervisory</b> authority, the Supreme Court regularly prescribes {{rules of procedure}} and evidence for inferior courts. Both scholars and the Court have treated the Court 2 ̆ 7 s exercises of this authority as unexceptional exercises of the inherent authority that Article III grants every federal court to regulate procedure {{in the course of}} adjudication. Article III 2 ̆ 7 s grant of inherent authority, however, is conventionally understood as permitting a federal court to regulate its own proceedings. When the Supreme Court exercises <b>supervisory</b> <b>power,</b> it regulates the proceedings of other federal courts. More than a reference to every court 2 ̆ 7 s inherent authority, therefore, is required to justify the Court 2 ̆ 7 s action. If the Supreme Court possesses a unique ability to regulate federal court procedure, it must be because of some unique attribute of the Supreme Court. This Article explores a justification that may well animate the Court 2 ̆ 7 s assertions of supervisory power: the notion that the Court possesses <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> by virtue of its constitutional supremacy. Analyzing this justification requires pursuit of two questions that are wholly unexplored in the literature and case law. Does Article III 2 ̆ 7 s distinction between supreme and inferior courts operate only as a limit on the way that Congress can structure the judicial department, or does it also operate as a source of inherent authority for the Supreme Court? And assuming that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s supremacy grants it inherent authority over inferior courts, is <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> over procedure part of the authority granted...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates whether {{regulations}} {{have an independent}} effect on bank risk-taking or whether their effect is channeled through the market power possessed by banks. Given a well-established set of theoretical priors, the regulations considered are capital requirements, restrictions on bank activities and official <b>supervisory</b> <b>power.</b> We use data from the Central and Eastern European banking sectors over the period 1998 - 2005. The empirical results suggest that banks with market power tend to take on lower credit risk and have a lower probability of default. Capital requirements reduce risk in general, but for banks with market power this effect significantly weakens or can even be reversed. Higher activity restrictions in combination with more market power reduce both credit risk {{and the risk of}} default, while official <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> has only a direct impact on bank risk. © 2009 Elsevier B.

Our dataset consists of 2853 observations from 615 publicly quoted commercial banks operating in 74 countries during the period 2000 - 2004. We investigate the impact of regulations related to the three pillars of Basel II (i. e. capital adequacy requirements, official <b>supervisory</b> <b>power,</b> and market discipline mechanisms), as well as restrictions on bank activities, on cost and profit efficiency of banks, while controlling for other country-specific characteristics. Our results suggest that banking regulations that enhance market discipline and empower the <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> of the authorities increase both cost and profit efficiency of banks. In contrast, stricter capital requirements improve cost efficiency but reduce profit efficiency, while restrictions on bank activities have the opposite effect, reducing cost efficiency but improving profit efficiency. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.
