5|$|In {{paintings}} and engravings of the 18th and 19th centuries, Pugs usually appear with longer legs and noses than today, and sometimes with cropped ears. The modern Pug's appearance probably changed after 1860 {{when a new}} wave of Pugs were imported directly from China. These Pugs had shorter legs and the modern-style Pug nose. The British aristocrat Lady Brassey is credited with making black Pugs fashionable after <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> some back from China in 1886. Ear cropping was made illegal in 1895.|$|E

5|$|To {{regain his}} strength, Edwards {{and his wife}} took a {{carriage}} to a rustic cottage refuge in Arkville in the Catskill Mountains but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed Mrs. Edwards {{that there would be}} no recovery for her husband from the advanced Bright's disease with complications from chronic pneumonia so <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> him back to New York City. Edwards died at home at 185 East 116th Street in East Harlem late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of noble {{households}} shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number of guests at the largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle {{at the start of}} the 16th century. When Elizabeth I visited Kenilworth in 1575 <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> an entourage of 31 barons and 400 staff for a visit that lasted an exceptional 19 days; Leicester, the castle's owner, entertained the Queen and much of the neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. With this scale of living and entertainment the need to find more space in older castles became a major issue in both England and Scotland.|$|E

5|$|By early April, Michigan {{was back}} in service; {{for the next several}} months, she {{primarily}} trained gunners in the Chesapeake Bay. While on a convoy escort that had left the United States on 30 September, the ship's port screw fell off. She was forced to leave the convoy on 8 October and return to port for repairs. She was out of service {{for the rest of the}} war. In November 1918, Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe. Michigan was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force in late December 1918 to ferry American soldiers back from Europe. She made two round trips in 1919 during the operation, the first from 18 January to 3 March, and the second from 18 March to 16 April. <b>She</b> <b>brought</b> back 1,062 men between the two voyages.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> back to Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever {{given to a}} woman. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both {{civil and political rights}} for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Ryder {{played a}} young taxicab driver in Jim Jarmusch's Night on Earth. The film {{was given a}} limited release, but {{received}} critical praise. Ryder then starred in the dual roles of Count Dracula's reincarnated love interest Mina Murray and Dracula's past lover Princess Elisabeta, in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), a project <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> to director Francis Ford Coppola's attention. In 1993, she starred in the melodrama The House of the Spirits, based on Isabel Allende's novel. Ryder played the love interest of Antonio Banderas' character. Principal filming was done in Denmark and Portugal. The film was poorly reviewed and a box office flop, grossing just $6million on its $40million budget.|$|E

5|$|In Megara, Neaira {{continued}} {{to work as a}} hetaera, and in 371 met Stephanus. Stephanus offered to act as her patron if she returned with him to Athens. Apollodorus claims that with her <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> two sons and a daughter to Athens, but modern commentators have largely concluded that the sons in question were in fact those of Stephanus, by an Athenian woman. Indeed, Christopher Carey points out that one of the sons, at least, was probably a legitimate son of Stephanus, being named after his father, and John Buckler notes that Apollodorus contradicts himself on whether Neaira's alleged sons were hers by another man, or hers by Stephanus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was {{promoted}} at the NBS and {{put in charge of}} the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} season, Kommandøren served the tourist trade in Sogn, while she sailed the regular passenger/cargo routes {{during the winter}} months. Kommandøren was {{generally}} used as an express route ship, often carrying patients {{on their way to}} treatment. Amongst the cargo carried by was often live animals, including horses, cattle and sheep. During one of her trips, Kommandøren ran aground on 20 October 1900 near Tjugum in Balestrand. The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region, like she did in September 1920, when <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> politicians to Vik to inspect the area for a proposed railway project. Shortly after delivery, in September 1892, Kommandøren provided transport support to a large-scale Norwegian Army field exercise in Western Norway. She was tasked with transporting troops from Gudvangen to Lærdalsøyri after the completion of the exercises.|$|E

5|$|In {{this era}} Scotland {{followed}} {{the trend of}} Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. James V, {{as well as being}} a major patron of sacred music, was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court, although almost nothing of this secular chamber music survives. The return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her position as a Catholic, gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. Like her father she played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer. <b>She</b> <b>brought</b> French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household.|$|E
