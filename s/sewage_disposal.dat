5|$|The city {{provides}} <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal</b> {{and water}} supply services, with water {{coming from the}} Huron River and groundwater sources. There are two water-treatment plants, one main and three outlying reservoirs, four pump stations, and two water towers. These facilities serve the city, which is divided into five water districts. The city's water department also operates four dams along the Huron River, two of which provide hydroelectric power. The city also offers waste management services, with Recycle Ann Arbor handling recycling service. Other utilities are provided by private entities. Electrical power and gas are provided by DTE Energy. AT Inc. is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area. Cable TV service is primarily provided by Comcast.|$|E

5|$|The {{ash fall}} created some {{temporary}} major problems with transportation, <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal,</b> and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane {{was closed for}} a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.|$|E
5|$|Local {{residents}} were evicted, including 1,200 {{people who lived}} in shacks around the barracks. Around 300 Jewish residents of Oświęcim were brought in to lay foundations. From 1940 to 1941, 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents of the western districts of Oświęcim were expelled from places adjacent to the camp. The Germans also ordered expulsions of Poles from the villages of Broszkowice, Babice, Brzezinka, Rajsko, Pławy, Harmęże, Bór, and Budy to the General Government. German citizens were offered tax concessions and other benefits if they would relocate to the area. By October 1943, more than 6,000 Reich Germans had arrived. The Nazis planned to build a model modern residential area for incoming Germans, including schools, playing fields, and other amenities. Some of the plans went forward, including the construction of several hundred apartments, but many were never fully implemented. Basic amenities such as water and <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal</b> were inadequate, and water-borne illnesses were commonplace.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growth}} in the {{population}} of Perth and Fremantle, concerns about water quality, pollution and adequate <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal</b> became widespread.

An extensive water supply scheme was eventually compiled by the civil engineers Henry John Saunders and James Barratt in June 1887.|$|E

25|$|Before 1973 {{water and}} {{sanitation}} services were provided by water undertakings and sewerage and <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal</b> authorities respectively. Until the 1950s there existed over a thousand water undertakings, with administrative boundaries {{similar to those of}} local government boundaries. By the early 1970s their number had been reduced to 198 by a gradual consolidation process aimed at achieving economies of scale. Out of the 198 water undertakings 64 were run by individual local government authorities, 101 by joint boards comprising several local government authorities, and 33 were statutory privately owned water companies, some of which date back to the Victorian era. At the same time there were over 1,300 sewerage and <b>sewage</b> <b>disposal</b> authorities, most of them run by individual local government authorities. The sector thus was highly fragmented.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBiowastes such as {{sewage sludge}} usually have high {{moisture}} contents and thermal {{technologies such as}} pyrolysis and incineration will meet the trouble of heavy evaporation load. Hydrothermal treatment has been adopted as an energy-effective method for dewatering and avoiding water evaporation. In addition, hydrothermal treatment can involve the carbonization of sewage sludge, leaving the stabilized solid product, therefore acting as a final treatment step for <b>sewage</b> sludge <b>disposal.</b> As an energy convertor, pyrolysis is a competitive technology to incineration. In this research products and energy balance for operating the hydrothermal process within temperature range of 220 - 270 oC were {{compared with those of}} pyrolysis process operating within 250 - 700 oC for <b>sewage</b> sludge <b>disposal.</b> It has been found that the hydrothermal treatment produces less solid product (char) & gas than pyrolysis process and is more energy efficient.

40|$|Land {{application}} {{of sewage sludge}} in China is thoroughly reviewed. Operation of <b>sewage</b> sludge <b>disposal</b> is usually expensive and/or easy to contaminate the environment. In China, most sewage sludge has not been treated and disposed of properly, resulting in environmental pollution and potential exposure to humans. In the near future, sewage sludge production in China will increase rapidly together with the dramatic increase of municipal wastewater treatment ratio (treated/produced), implying {{that the problem of}} <b>sewage</b> sludge <b>disposal</b> will become more serious and unavoidable.
