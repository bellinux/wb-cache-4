Anisotropic elastic coefficients of the wet clay pack {{are assumed to be}} independent of mineralogy and to be linearly dependent on clay packing density (CPD), a fraction of clay in an individual wet clay pack. Simulated compressional and shear velocities normal to the bedding plane and are shown to be in a good agreement with measured <b>sonic</b> <b>velocities.</b> Further, elastic coefficients of shales, and, calculated from the log <b>sonic</b> <b>velocities,</b> calibrated porosity and clay fraction obtained from the mineralogy tool are used to invert for elastic constants of clays, C 33 and C 44. The obtained elastic coefficients of clays show lower scatter than the original elastic coefficients of shales. The noticeable increase of the clay elastic coefficients with the depth increase is shown to result from the positive trend of the CPD with depth. Being interpolated to the same CPD = 0. 8, elastic coefficients of clays show no depth dependency.

40|$|The dynamic {{effects of}} {{combustion}} {{are due to}} the evolution of exothermic energy and its deposition in the compressible medium where the process takes place. The paper examines the dynamics of combustion phenomena, including ignition, turbulent flame propagation (inflammation), explosion, and detonation, with emphasis on their exothermic characteristics. Ignition and explosion are treated as problems of nonlinear mechanics, and their dynamic behavior is described in terms of phase space models and cinematographic laser shear interferograms. The results of a numerical random vortex model of turbulent flame propagation are confirmed in a combustion tunnel experiment, where it was observed that a fresh mixture of burnt and unburnt gases can sustain combustion with a relatively small expenditure of overall mass flow, due to the increasing specific volume of burnt gases inside the flame front. An isentropic pressure wave is found to precede the accelerating flame in the process of detonation, and components of this presssure wave are shown to propagate at local <b>sonic</b> <b>velocities...</b>|$|R
