5|$|In the mid-1920s, New York's {{metropolitan}} area surpassed London's as the world's most populous {{metropolitan area}}. New York City's metropolitan area exceeded ten {{million by the}} early 1930s. The economic boom of the 1920s and the great speculation {{of the real estate}} market fostered a new wave of skyscraper projects in the city. The 1916 Zoning Resolution restricted the height that the street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings could rise before they needed to incorporate <b>setbacks</b> that recessed the buildings' exterior walls away from the streets. This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant <b>setbacks,</b> large volumes, and striking silhouettes that were often decorated elaborately.|$|E

40|$|Global {{sea-level rise}} {{of up to}} 0. 6 m is {{predicted}} in the next 100 years. In areas where coastal structures prevent landward migration of beaches, a major impact of sea-level rise will be a loss of beach habitat, with repercussions for beach-dependent organisms such as sea turtles. <b>Setback</b> regulations, which prohibit construction within a set distance from the sea, {{have the potential to}} mitigate loss of beach area by providing a buffer zone which allows for the natural movement of beaches in response to perturbation. The potential impact of a rise in sea level on 11 important sea turtle nesting beaches in Barbados under a range of <b>setback</b> regulations was determined. Three sea-level rise scenarios were modelled under five different <b>setback</b> regulations (10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 m). Beach area was lost from all beaches under all sea-level rise scenarios with a 10 and 30 m <b>setback,</b> from some beaches with a 50 m <b>setback</b> and from one beach with a 70 m <b>setback.</b> No beach area was lost with a 90 m <b>setback</b> distance. Sea turtles nest within a range of beach elevations and there was an overall loss of beach habitat within the preferred nesting elevation range with both a 10 and 30 m <b>setback</b> under all sea-level rise scenarios. Considerable variation in the extent of beach and nesting area loss was observed. The implementation and enforcement of adequate <b>setback</b> regulations have the potential to maintain the ecological and economic function of beaches in the face of extensive coastal development and sea-level rise...|$|R

50|$|<b>Setback</b> is the {{difference}} between right side and left side wheelbase length. It can also be measured as an angle. <b>Setback</b> less than the manufacturer specified tolerance (for example about 6mm) does not affect car handling. That's because, when the vehicle is turning, one wheel is ahead of the other by several centimetres and therefore the <b>setback</b> is negligible. There are even some car models with different factory setting for right and left side wheelbase length, for various design reasons. An off-spec <b>setback</b> may occur because of a collision or a difference between right and left caster.|$|R

30|$|The {{second part}} of the {{questionnaire}} included 77 items on respondents’ perceptions of their residential space, based on five generic criteria: side <b>setback</b> areas, maintenance, neighbors, doors and windows to side <b>setback</b> areas and the side <b>setback</b> areas, including 12 items for preference and 15 items for neighboring relations. Eight items for general residential and neighborly satisfaction were included (Bonaiuto et al. 2003) to test the respondents’ general tendency towards their neighborhood atmosphere and if it is influenced to any degree by their likely view to the neighboring building through the side <b>setback</b> areas. A Likert 5 -point scale was used in which 1 means ‘totally disagree’ and 5 means ‘totally agree’. All the respondents were asked to fill out this section of the questionnaire regardless of whether they actually have neighboring side <b>setback</b> areas, in order to examine general awareness about such side <b>setback</b> areas following Canter’s notion of individuals conceptualizing spaces against actual ‘users’ (Canter 1986), as well as Stockols’ evaluation of the quality of alternative places (Stockols and Shumaker 1981), which here would be an actual experience of place.|$|R

5|$|The Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel {{was known}} as the Straight Creek Tunnel during construction, named for the {{waterway}} that runs along the western approach to the tunnel. Before the tunnel was dedicated, it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson. Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many <b>setbacks</b> and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest <b>setbacks</b> was the discovery of fault lines {{in the path of the}} tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. Despite the best efforts of engineers, three workers were killed boring the first tube, and four in boring the second.|$|E
40|$|The term tape <b>setback</b> method denotes {{a method}} of {{designing}} and fabricating bonded joints between (1) box beams or other structural members made of laminated composite (matrix/ fiber) materials and (2) metal end fittings used to fasten these structural members to other structural members. The basic idea of the tape <b>setback</b> method is to mask the bonded interface between the metallic end fitting and composite member such that the bond does not extend out to the free edges of the composite member. The purpose served by the tape <b>setback</b> method is to strengthen the joints by decoupling stress concentrations from edge defects, which can cause premature failures. A related prior method that serves a similar purpose, involving the use of tapered adherends at the joints, can be too difficult and costly to be acceptable in some applications. The tape <b>setback</b> method offers an easier, less costly alternative. The structural members to which the method was originally applied were box beams {{in the form of}} composite tubes having flat faces with rounded corners. The end fittings were plugs made of a low-thermal- expansion nickel/iron alloy (see figure). In computational-simulation studies of tensile and compressive loading of members without tape <b>setback,</b> stresses were found to be concentrated at the free end edges of the composite tubes, and inspection of members that had been subjected to real tension and compression tests showed that cracks started at the free end edges. As applied to these members, the tape <b>setback</b> method makes them less vulnerable to initiation of failure at edge defects produced during fabrication. In real tension tests of comparable members without and with tape <b>setback,</b> the average mean tensile strength of the members with tape <b>setback</b> was found to be 1. 9 times that of the members without tape <b>setback...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Setback</b> {{buildings}} with geometric irregularity (both in elevation and plan) are now increasingly encountered in modern urban construction. <b>Setback</b> buildings are characterised by staggered abrupt reductions in floor area along {{the height of}} the building, with consequent drops in mass, strength and stiffness. Height-wise changes in stiffness and mass render the dynamic characteristics of these buildings different from the ‘regular’ building. This paper presents the design code perspective of this building category. Almost all the major international design codes recommend dynamic analysis for design of <b>setback</b> {{buildings with}} scaled up base shear corresponding to the fundamental period as per the code specified empirical formula. However, the empirical equations of fundamental period given in these codes are a function of building height, which is ambiguous for a <b>setback</b> building. It has been seen from the analysis that the fundamental period of a <b>setback</b> building changes when the configuration of the building changes, even if the overall height remains the same. Based on modal analysis of 90 <b>setback</b> buildings with varying irregularity and height, this study proposes a correction factor to the empirical code formula for fundamental period, to render it applicable for stepped building...|$|R
