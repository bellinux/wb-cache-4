By Eastern Han, the obligation upon retired <b>soldiers</b> <b>to</b> join local militias was removed.|$|E

5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised <b>soldiers</b> <b>to</b> copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E
