The rationale behind this strategy is to give a higher chance to the users that have not transmitted previously and protect them from the possible interference caused by the users that have already made a transmission.|$|R

This is to avoid many users having high <b>access</b> <b>probabilities</b> and thus to prevent having many collisions.

Because mobile devices still have limited processor power, computing-intensive applications need to be offloaded to either remote clouds or nearby cloudlets for processing. But, remote cloud computing is hindered by the long latency and expensive roaming charges of cellular radio access. Therefore, cloudlet computing becomes appealing to provide instant and low-cost service through resource-rich devices (e. g., desktops) {{in the vicinity of}} mobile devices. It is evident that cloudlet computing is challenged by the intermittent connection between cloudlets and mobile devices due to user mobility. The question is how to evaluate the impact of user mobility on cloudlet computing perfor-mance. In this paper, we examine the cloudlet <b>access</b> <b>probability,</b> task success rate, and task execution speed to measure the impact of mobility. We discover that the cloudlet <b>access</b> <b>probability</b> is µTC/(µTI +µTC) determined by mean connection time µTC and mean inter-connection time µTI between the mobile device and the cloudlet. Furthermore, we find that the task success rate and execution speed depend on not only task computation demand and cloudlet computing speed but also cloudlet <b>access</b> <b>probability.</b> Our findings reveal that the ratio µTC/(µTI + µTC) quantifies the impact of node mobility on both cloudlet <b>access</b> <b>probability</b> and cloudlet computing performance.

We conducted a critical discourse analysis on selected access and equity documents using a gender-based diversity framework as determined by two objectives: 1) to identify dominant and counter discourses in health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity literature; and 2) to develop understanding of how particular discourses impact the inclusion, or not, of LGBT communities in health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity frameworks. The analysis was conducted in response to public health and clinical research that has documented barriers to health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> for LGBT communities including institutionalized heterosexism, biphobia, and transphobia, invisibility and lack of health provider knowledge and comfort. The analysis was also conducted {{as the first step}} of exploring LGBT access issues in home care services for LGBT populations in Ontario, Canada. Methods A critical discourse analysis of selected health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity documents, using a gender-based diversity framework, was conducted to offer insight into dominant and counter discourses underlying health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity initiatives. Results A continuum of five discourses that characterize the health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity literature were identified including two dominant discourses: 1) multicultural discourse, and 2) diversity discourse; and three counter discourses: 3) social determinants of health (SDOH) discourse; 4) anti-oppression (AOP) discourse; and 5) citizen/social rights discourse. Conclusions The analysis offers a continuum of dominant and counter discourses on health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity as determined from a gender-based diversity perspective.
