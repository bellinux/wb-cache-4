[...] He also opined that the diamond within the fetish was the clitoris of the Arumbaya, describing it as [...] "their pleasure, wrapped up in a fetish". He also thought that there was a homosexual subtext between Ramón and Alonso, believing that the scene in which a bullet was fired into Ramón's buttocks was symbolic of anal sex.|$|E
500|$|Several reviews also {{commented on}} how {{addictive}} the game {{can be for}} the player. David Houghton of PlayStation Official Magazine called XCOM [...] "one of the most unique and endlessly compulsive games of the year so far." [...] Erik Kain of Forbes called it [...] "one of the most addictive games I’ve ever played" [...] that [...] "falls somewhere between chocolate and crack {{on the scale of}} addictive substances." [...] Allistair Pinsof of Destructoid, in pointing out how easily one could be absorbed in the game, told readers to [...] "take the act of me wiping XCOM from my hard drive as high praise.

I think this <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> to where you are, what you going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that.

500|$|As well {{as working}} with {{established}} writers, Bancroft {{has created a}} number of children's books in her own right, including An Australian 1 2 3 of Animals and An Australian ABC of Animals, which have been favourably reviewed as imaginative and well-illustrated. Her style of illustration {{has been described as}} [...] "bold and mysterious", and as [...] "traditional Australian Aboriginal representation rendered in bright, eye-catching colors." [...] In 2009 Bancroft received the Dromkeen Medal for her contribution to children's literature. In May 2010, the Governor-General of Australia Quentin Bryce launched Bancroft's latest book, Why I Love Australia. A long-time supporter of Bancroft's work, Ms Bryce said: [...] "Why I love Australia is a work and title that, again, <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> of its author and illustrator. It simply and exquisitely rejoices in telling a story of this magnificent, sacred land we share: the mountains, rivers and gorges; seas and coral reefs; grasslands and bushlands; saltpans and snow; houses and streets; the jewelled night sky, and so much more." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} more positive. The New Statesmans Robert Potts found the stories [...] "entertaining and {{intriguing}} for readers familiar with their background {{and with the}} genre", {{and for the most}} part charmingly innocent, [...] "especially when compared with the reality of boarding-school life". [...] The evocation of adolescent homoeroticism was deliberate and playful rather than pornographic. In a similar vein, Richard Canning in The Independent found the Willow Gables fiction vibrant, well-constructed and entertaining, and praised Larkin's [...] "sly Sapphic spin". In a more recent analysis Terry Castle, writing in the journal Daedalus, disagrees profoundly with the notion expressed by Adam Kirsch in The Times Literary Supplement, that the publication of the Coleman works was damaging to Larkin's reputation. On the contrary, argues Castle, [...] "the Brunette phase <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> about the paradoxical process by which Philip Larkin became 'Larkinesque'—modern English poetry's reigning bard of erotic frustration and depressive (if verse-enabling) self-deprecation".|$|E
500|$|Asked {{how does}} he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I think it's timely and {{timeless}} at the same time, and I think that's {{one of the most}} difficult things for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically it's heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the album's 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the band's thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> about its significance in the metal canon".|$|E

500|$|Q {{magazine}} {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, stating [...] "It <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> for Pearl Jam's continuing creative acumen that they can respond so confidently to a new punk scene that has sprung up." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album an A- rating, writing that [...] "Three or four of these songs are faster and riffier than anything else in P. Jam's book, token experiments like [...] "Bugs" [...] are genuinely weird, and in an era of compulsory irony [...] sincerity is something like a relief—a Kurtlike relief at that." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+. He said, [...] "Vitalogy marks the first time it's possible to respect the band's music as much as its stance." [...] He added that [...] "despite its musical advances, Vitalogy leaves an odd, unsettling aftertaste. You walk away from it energized, but wondering what price Eddie Vedder, and Pearl Jam, will ultimately pay for it." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis gave it three out of four stars and commended Pearl Jam for their earnest songwriting. However, DeRogatis also wrote that the album [...] "leaves you wishing that they'd just lighten up". USA Todays Edna Gundersen gave Vitalogy three and a half out of four stars and stated that it [...] "delivers the band's most compelling, inventive and confident music to date", while calling it [...] "the rebel yell of a band that is maturing without mellowing". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn gave Vitalogy four out of four stars and viewed its music as an improvement over Pearl Jam's previous work, writing [...] "This isn't just the best Pearl Jam album but a better album than the band once even seemed capable of making". AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars, saying, [...] "Pearl Jam are at their best when they're fighting, whether it's Ticketmaster, fame, or their own personal demons." [...] According to The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), [...] "By Vitalogy PJ hit their apex … the band's creative zenith, finding them doing a Led Zeppelin III on acoustic tracks like 'Corduroy' and turning in a Tom Waits-like weird attack on 'Bugs'".|$|E

He further said that [...] "this win of his party in third consecutive elections <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> about the trust Turkish people repose in his leadership and the government's policies." [...] The Prime Minister hoped that the relations with Turkey would further be strengthened under the stewardship of Erdoğan as both brotherly nations have mutuality of views on regional and international issues.|$|E

2500|$|Rats {{have long}} been {{considered}} deadly pests. Once considered a modern myth, the rat flood in India has now been verified. Indeed, every fifty years, armies of bamboo rats descend upon rural areas and devour everything in their path. Rats {{have long been}} held up as the chief villain in {{the spread of the}} Bubonic Plague, however recent studies show that they alone could not account for the rapid spread of the disease through Europe in the Middle Ages. Still, the Center for Disease Control does list nearly a dozen diseases [...] directly linked to rats. Most urban areas battle rat infestations. Rats in New York City are famous for their size and prevalence. The urban legend that the rat population in Manhattan equals that of its human population (a myth definitively refuted by Robert Sullivan in his book [...] "Rats") <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> about New Yorkers' awareness of the presence, and on occasion boldness and cleverness, of the rodents. [...] New York has specific regulations for getting rid of rats—multi-family residences and commercial businesses must use a specially trained and licensed exterminator.

2500|$|This novel {{deals with}} the issue of racism on a level beyond a white/other dichotomy. [...] Race {{relations}} in the novel are complicated by the favoring of Spanish blood within the ethnic category of [...] "Mexican." [...] This is demonstrated in the multiple references to Spanish features as the beauty ideals within the Mexican communities. [...] Another demonstration of this favoring is evident in the marriage relations and rules, as Mexicans of indigenous blood or features were not allowed into the marriage structures of those with more direct Spanish lineage and were bound to roles as [...] "peons." [...] While this racist structure existed within the hacienda community, there was simultaneously a land conflict between Native American Indians, Mexicans, and Anglo Americans, as referenced in historical context. [...] This caused a lot of bitter feelings, as witnessed in the derogatory use of the word [...] "gringo" [...] and the fear of Indian Americans. The historical context of the U.S./Mexican War] is a continuous theme throughout the entire novel, and is represented often through the gender expressions of the characters. [...] The women come to represent peace and life while the heterosexual men represent fighting and war. This <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> to the strict gender roles of this culture and time period, in which femininity and masculinity are defined in these classic terms. Don Santiago is also seen as the ultimate patriarch, an identity that ultimately does not serve him well.|$|E

[...] Taran Adarsh commented, [...] "Shahid delivers his career-best performance in Jab We Met... Kareena is in top form as well. Jab We Met is a turning point in her career [...] Fantabulous -- that's the right word to describe her work this time. The confidence with which she handles the contrasting characterization <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes.</b> This film should do for her what Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) did for Kajol." [...] Subhash K. Jha approved the chemistry as well, [...] "...there are sparks...and the ones between Kareena and Shahid are so unselfconsciously genuine that you end up looking at the characters rather than the two actors going through a series of brilliantly conceived and energized incidents..." [...] The Times of India gave the film 4 out of 5 stars concluding, [...] "The film belongs to Shahid and Kareena who pitch in memorable performances and lend a whole new meaning to the boy-meets-girl story." [...] Joginder Tuteja from indiaglitz.com gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, described it as [...] "Shahid-Kareena's DDLJ", and concluded that [...] "...it would be a pain if any of the two actors do not get awarded and rewarded for their performances..." ...|$|E
