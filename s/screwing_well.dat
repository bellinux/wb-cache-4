5000|$|Chinese elm {{heartwood}} ranges in tone from reddish brown {{to light}} tan or flesh coloured, while the sapwood approaches off-white. The grain is often handsome and dramatic. Unlike other elms, freshly cut Chinese elm has a peppery or spicy odour. While it turns easily {{and will take}} a nice polish off the lathe without any finish, and it holds detail well, the fibrous wood is usually considered too tough for carving or hand tools. Chinese elm contains silica which is hard on planer knives and chainsaws, but it sands fairly easily. Like other woods with interlocking grain, planes should be kept extra sharp to prevent tearing at the grain margins. It steam-bends easily, holds <b>screws</b> <b>well</b> but pilot holes and countersinking are needed. It {{tends to be a}} [...] "lively" [...] wood, tending to warp and distort while drying. This water resistant wood easily takes most finishes and stains.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate first the influence of the actuator force...|$|R
5000|$|The American elm's wood is coarse, hard, and tough, with interlacing, contorted fibers {{that make}} it {{difficult}} to split or chop, and cause it to warp after sawing. [...] Accordingly, the wood originally had few uses, save for making hubs for wagon wheels. [...] Later, with the advent of mechanical sawing, American elm wood was used for barrel staves, trunk-slats, and hoop-poles, and subsequently became fundamental to the manufacture of wooden automobile bodies, with the intricate fibers holding <b>screws</b> unusually <b>well.</b>|$|R

Much of Britten's vocal music was written specifically for his artistic and life partner, tenor Sir Peter Pears. Many regarded Langridge as Pears' true successor because they shared similar vocal qualities and brought uncommon immediacy to the music they performed. He recorded many of his famous roles, including Peter Grimes and the Prologue / Quint in The Turn of the <b>Screw,</b> as <b>well</b> as all the orchestral song cycles for tenor voice.|$|R
5000|$|If {{water is}} {{fed into the}} top of an Archimedes screw, it will force the screw to rotate. The {{rotating}} shaft can then be used to drive an electric generator. Such an installation has the same benefits as using the screw for pumping: the ability to handle very dirty water and widely varying rates of flow at high efficiency. Settle Hydro and Torrs Hydro are two reverse screw micro hydro schemes operating in England. The <b>screw</b> works <b>well</b> as a generator at low heads, commonly found in English rivers, including the Thames, powering Windsor Castle.|$|R

5000|$|In 1897, Albright and Edmund B. Hayes bought Buffalo Bolt Company, which George C. Bell {{had founded}} in 1859. Buffalo Bolt {{produced}} {{nuts and bolts}} that were used by manufacturers {{in the production of}} automobiles, ships, trains, household appliances, and hundreds of other products. [...] Under Albright, production increased many times over. In 1869, Buffalo Bolt produced 14,000 nuts and bolts per day, and by 1911, the Company was producing 1,250,000 per day. [...] By 1920, Buffalo Bolt was producing 600,000,000 pieces of bolts, nuts, and <b>screws</b> as <b>well</b> as 5,000 varieties of finished products and 50,000 tons of steel rolled.|$|R

Smooth-shank nails do {{not hold}} well, and neither do fine-pitch screws, especially in the edge.

50|$|Both the {{original}} fusil-mitrailleur Mle 1924 (automatic rifle, model of 1924) {{as well as}} the modified Mle 1924 M29 have the same overall features: a folding bipod, an in-line stock, a pistol grip, a top-mounted 25-round detachable magazine and a bolt hold-open after the magazine's last round had been fired. There are two separate triggers: the trigger in front for using semi-automatic fire only and the rear trigger for firing on full automatic. Protection of all the openings against mud and dust proved excellent. The cyclic rate was controlled at 450 rounds per minute, thus allowing more continuous firing without overheating. In general, this new weapon was accurate and highly reliable but the barrel was <b>screwed</b> <b>well</b> into the receiver, as in the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), and thus it could not be separated quickly and easily in the field as for the British Bren gun. The French Army instruction manual (July 1925) recommends not to go beyond 400 rounds of uninterrupted firing since at that point the gun needs to be given a pause of ten to fifteen minutes in order to cool off. But instead, the French instruction manual recommends the following routine for the FM 1924 : fire 4 to 5 detachable magazines (100 to 125 rounds), take a short pause, then keep repeating that same restrained fire plus short pause routine which permits steady performance and very extensive firing periods.|$|R
50|$|A {{ball screw}} is a {{mechanical}} linear actuator that translates rotational motion to linear motion with little friction. A threaded shaft provides a helical raceway for ball bearings which {{act as a}} precision <b>screw.</b> As <b>well</b> as being able to apply or withstand high thrust loads, they can do so with minimum internal friction. They are made to close tolerances and are therefore suitable for use in situations in which high precision is necessary. The ball assembly acts as the nut while the threaded shaft is the screw.In contrast to conventional leadscrews, ballscrews tend to be rather bulky, due {{to the need to}} have a mechanism to re-circulate the balls.|$|R
50|$|One way of {{eliminating}} this translation along the axis {{is to set}} the first ball on a fine-thread <b>screw</b> as <b>well.</b> By appropriate adjustment of all three screws, the mirror can be tilted in either direction without translation. The screws can by driven by a motor under computer control to make this seem to the operator like simple rotation about a virtual pivot point {{in the center of}} the mirror surface. The translation can instead be eliminated mechanically by using a gimbal mount, which uses two rings that each pivot about a line running through the center of the mirror. This gives kinematically-correct two-axis rotation about the center of the mirror.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front of}} the sole {{features}} a rigid or semi-rigid spike plate containing between 3 and 9 threaded holes called spike wells. Spikes can be <b>screwed</b> into each <b>well</b> using a spike wrench. Recently, some individuals have attempted to add a [...] "through hole" [...] {{at the bottom of}} the spike to make them easier to tighten, remove, and install.|$|R
50|$|The {{thread angle}} is the {{included}} angle, measured at a section {{parallel to the}} axis, between the two bearing faces of the thread. The angle between the axial load force and the normal to the bearing surface is approximately equal to half the thread angle, so the thread angle has a great effect on the friction and efficiency of a <b>screw,</b> as <b>well</b> as the wear rate and the strength. The greater the thread angle, the greater the angle between the load vector and the surface normal, so the larger the normal force between the threads required to support a given load. Therefore, increasing the thread angle increases the friction and wear of a screw.|$|R

40|$|Thermally induced {{displacements}} due to thermal expansions {{continue to}} present {{one of the}} main problem areas in the machine tool sector. To compensate displacements simplified thermal FE simulation models are developed, with which compensating calculations will be carried out online in the NC control computer in future (software in the loop). To increase the accuracy experimental tests are conducted on the machine components of the machine tool and compared with FE simulations. The experimental comparison forms the basis for exact simulation models, which are reduced in their complexity though, to subsequently be able to make quick predictions for temperature compensation. This paper describes the thermal investigation on the machine tool component of ball <b>screws</b> as <b>well</b> as the thermal FE model for comparing the heat transfer parameters to be examined...|$|R

No data were provided for mechanical and physical characterization of these screws.
