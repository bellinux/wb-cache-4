5|$|Abstinence-only <b>sex</b> {{education}} {{does not}} reduce teenage pregnancy. Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive <b>sex</b> education. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative <b>sex</b> without vaginal <b>sex</b> or deliberate oral <b>sex</b> without vaginal <b>sex</b> are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural <b>sex</b> {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina <b>sex</b> (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} bones are present, <b>sex</b> can be {{determined}} by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms. When available, the pelvis is extremely useful in the determination of <b>sex</b> and when properly examined can achieve <b>sex</b> determination with a great level of accuracy. The examination of the pubic arch {{and the location of}} the sacrum can help determine <b>sex.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{nearly all}} species of birds, an individual's <b>sex</b> is {{determined}} at fertilisation. However, {{one recent study}} demonstrated temperature-dependent <b>sex</b> determination among the Australian brushturkey, for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male <b>sex</b> ratio. This, however, was later proven to not be the case. These birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent <b>sex</b> determination, but temperature-dependent <b>sex</b> mortality.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sex</b> {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and <b>sex</b> educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about <b>Sex,</b> a <b>Sex</b> Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and <b>sex</b> therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and <b>sex</b> columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by <b>sex</b> therapists.|$|E

5|$|The <b>sex</b> {{scenes were}} choreographed by feminist writer and <b>sex</b> {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having <b>sex</b> and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} <b>sex</b> scenes, she asked if she could be a <b>sex</b> consultant for the film and they agreed. The main <b>sex</b> scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E

A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell <b>sex</b> for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did not think that he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold <b>sex</b> that night had teeth that were rotten. They had <b>sex</b> on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E

5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital <b>sex</b> is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during <b>sex</b> with high-risk partners such as <b>sex</b> workers, and that condom use during marital <b>sex</b> implies infidelity. Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E

5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of <b>sex</b> hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an unusually large amount of male <b>sex</b> hormones (androgens) into female <b>sex</b> hormones (estrogens).|$|E

In order to make this statistic more widely known, Falle founded <b>Sex</b> Trade 101. She began offering training for police and partners with the Toronto Police Service's <b>sex</b> crimes unit.

In another interview, a man purchasing <b>sex</b> in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes.
