5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{considered}} poisonous, P.fusiformis {{is not recommended}} for consumption.

5|$|The crop can be {{attacked}} by larvae of the carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The fly is attracted by the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> bruised tissue.|$|E

5|$|A strong <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> burning {{was present}} in the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. As they approached Black Rod's box {{in the corner of}} the room, they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left to go to the nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E
5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E

The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E

5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made and the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, nearly 20,000 people {{attended}} the third annual Hempstalk Festival at Sellwood Riverfront Park in Portland, Oregon.

No festival attendees were arrested. Seattle Hempfest is an annual event in Seattle, Washington also attended by Oregonians, known as the world's largest annual gathering advocating decriminalization of marijuana for uses including but not limited to medicinal, industrial, and recreational. The 2008 Seattle Hempfest, which took place August 1617, set a new record with around 150,000 people in attendance.|$|E
5|$|Kamadhenu {{is often}} {{addressed}} by the proper name Surabhi or Shurbhi, which is also used as a synonym for an ordinary cow. Professor Jacobi considers the name Surabhi—"the fragrant one"—to have originated from the peculiar <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> cows. According to the Monier Williams Sanskrit–English Dictionary (1899), Surabhi means fragrant, charming, pleasing, as well as cow and earth. It can specifically refer to the divine cow Kamadhenu, the mother of cattle who is also sometimes described as a Matrika ("mother") goddess. Other proper names attributed to Kamadhenu are Sabala ("the spotted one") and Kapila ("the red one").|$|E

5|$|Mycena arcangeliana (commonly {{known as}} the angel's bonnet or the late-season bonnet) is a species of Mycenaceae fungus. It has been known {{by a number of}} {{scientific}} names, and its taxonomy is still somewhat disputed. It produces small mushrooms with caps varying in colour from whitish to a darker grey-brown, and stems of an olive-greyish that fade with age. The mushrooms can be mistaken for the similar Mycena flavescens. They have a mild taste, but a strong <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> iodoform; they are not edible. The species grows on dead wood in autumn months, and can be found throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|Several Suillus species which grow under pines {{could be}} {{confused}} with S.brevipes. S.granulatus has a longer stipe, and distinct raised granules on the stipe. S.brevipes is differentiated from S.albidipes by not having a cottony roll of velar tissue (derived from a partial veil) at the margin when young. S.pallidiceps is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and S.albivelatus has a veil. S.pungens has a characteristic pungent odor, compared to the mild <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> S.brevipes, and like S.granulatus, has glandular dots on the stipe.|$|E
5|$|The Great Stink was {{an event}} in central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather {{exacerbated}} the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> untreated human waste and industrial effluent that was present {{on the banks of}} the River Thames. The problem had been mounting for some years, with an ageing and inadequate sewer system that emptied directly into the Thames. The miasma from the effluent was thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks of cholera prior to the Great Stink were blamed on the ongoing problems with the river.|$|E
