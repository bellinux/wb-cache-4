2500|$|This tuning is {{like that}} of the lowest four strings in <b>standard</b> <b>tuning.</b> Consequently, of all the regular tunings, it is the closest {{approximation}} to <b>standard</b> <b>tuning,</b> and thus it best allows the transfer of a knowledge of chords from <b>standard</b> <b>tuning</b> to a regular tuning. Jazzmusician StanleyJordan plays guitar in all-fourths tuning; he has stated that all-fourths tuning [...] "simplifies the fingerboard, making it logical".|$|R
50|$|Another {{feature of}} <b>standard</b> <b>tuning</b> {{is that the}} {{ordering}} of notes often differs from root position. Notes are often inverted or otherwise permuted, particularly with seventh chords in <b>standard</b> <b>tuning,</b> as discussed below.|$|R

50|$|The four-stringed requinto jarocho {{can follow}} the <b>standard</b> <b>tuning</b> of (ADGc), but is also {{commonly}} tuned to GADg and CDGc. The five-stringed requinto, however, adds a string above the <b>standard</b> <b>tuning</b> 5 half-steps below the initial first string, making it EADGc.|$|R
50|$|Quartal and quintal harmonies {{also appear}} in {{alternate}} tunings. It {{is easier to}} finger the chords {{that are based on}} perfect fifths in new <b>standard</b> <b>tuning</b> than in <b>standard</b> <b>tuning.</b> New <b>standard</b> <b>tuning</b> was invented by Robert Fripp, a guitarist for King Crimson. Preferring to base chords on perfect intervals—especially octaves, fifths, and fourths—Fripp often avoids minor thirds and especially major thirds, which are sharp in equal temperament tuning (in comparison to thirds in just intonation).|$|R
30|$|An optimum {{value of}} <b>tuning</b> <b>frequency</b> ratio exists {{at which the}} {{response}} of the system reduces to minimum value. As the value of TMFD units in MTMFD increases the value of optimum tuning ratio increases or tend to constant for higher number of TMFD units. Also, as the value of mass ratio increases the optimum value of <b>tuning</b> <b>frequency</b> ratio decreases.|$|R
50|$|Augmented-fourths tunings have {{extended}} range. Because {{each of its}} tritone-intervals between successive strings is wider than the perfect-fourth intervals (and one major third) of <b>standard</b> <b>tuning,</b> augmented-fourths tunings have greater range than standard tuning—six additional notes, only one less note than Robert Fripp's new <b>standard</b> <b>tuning.</b>|$|R

5|$|In <b>standard</b> <b>tuning,</b> playing {{scales of}} one octave {{requires}} three patterns, which {{depend on the}} string of the root note. Chords cannot be shifted diagonally without changing finger-patterns. <b>Standard</b> <b>tuning</b> has four finger-patterns for musical intervals, four forms for basic major-chords, and three forms for the inversion of the basic major-chords.|$|R
50|$|Among all regular tunings, all-fourths tuning E-A-D-G-C-F is {{the best}} {{approximation}} of <b>standard</b> <b>tuning,</b> which is more popular. An advantage of <b>standard</b> <b>tuning</b> {{is that it has}} many six-string chords, unlike all-fourths tuning. All-fourths tuning is traditionally used for the bass guitar; it is also used for the bajo sexto.|$|R

5000|$|C tuning {{is a type}} of guitar tuning. The {{strings of}} the guitar are tuned two whole steps lower than <b>standard</b> <b>tuning.</b> The {{resulting}} notes can be described most commonly as C-F-A♯-D♯-G-C or C-F-B♭-E♭-G-C. This is not be confused with C# tuning which is one and one half steps lower than <b>standard</b> <b>tuning.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>tuning</b> {{defines the}} string pitches as E, A, D, G, B, and E, from lowest (low E2) to highest (high E4). <b>Standard</b> <b>tuning</b> {{is used by}} most guitarists, and {{frequently}} used tunings {{can be understood as}} variations on <b>standard</b> <b>tuning.</b> “Nonstandard” tunings are also called “alternative” or “alternate”. Some tunings are used for particular songs by professional musicians, and may be called after the song's title. There are hundreds of such tunings, which are often minor variants of established tunings. Communities of guitarists who share a musical tradition often use the same or similar tunings.|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, five- and six-string open chords (“cowboy chords”) are more {{difficult}} to play in a regular <b>tuning</b> than in <b>standard</b> <b>tuning.</b> Instructional literature uses <b>standard</b> <b>tuning.</b> Traditionally a course begins with the hand in first position, that is, with the left-hand covering frets 1–4. Beginning players first learn open chords belonging to the major keys C,G, andD. Guitarists who play mainly open chords in these three major-keys and their relative minor-keys (Am,Em,Bm) may prefer <b>standard</b> <b>tuning</b> over many regular tunings, On the other hand, minor-thirds tuning features many barre chords with repeated notes, properties that appeal to acoustic-guitarists and beginners.|$|R
50|$|A six-string guitar {{has five}} musical-intervals between its {{consecutive}} strings. In <b>standard</b> <b>tuning,</b> the intervals are four perfect-fourths and one major-third, the comparatively irregular interval for the (G,B) pair. Consequently, <b>standard</b> <b>tuning</b> requires four chord-shapes {{for the major}} chords. There are separate chord-forms for chords having their root note on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth strings. Of course, a beginner learns guitar by learning notes and chords, and irregularities make learning the guitar difficult—even more difficult than learning the formation of plural nouns in German, according to Gary Marcus. Nonetheless, most beginners use <b>standard</b> <b>tuning.</b>|$|R
