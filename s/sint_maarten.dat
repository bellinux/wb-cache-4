5|$|While it {{was moving}} little over the south-central Caribbean, Omar brought {{prolonged}} tropical storm conditions to the ABC Islands. Sustained winds to near gale force battered the islands, although peak gusts to 58mph (92km/h) were confined to Bonaire. In 24 hours, a maximum precipitation total of 4.0 in (102mm) was recorded on Aruba, while 1.7 in (43mm) and 1.5 in (41mm) of rain fell in Curaçao and Bonaire, respectively. The high winds damaged roofs on all three islands, and rough seas caused beach erosion and significant damage to coastal facilities. Some rain damage also occurred, with significant flooding reported {{in some parts of}} Aruba. In the SSS Islands (Saba, St. Eustatius, and <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten)</b> strong winds from Omar, gusting up to 76mph (122km/h), and high waves caused significant damage and coastal flooding. On <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten,</b> rainfall from the storm totaled to 5.4in (139.4mm). Damage in <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten</b> was mainly limited to beach erosion and scattered power outages.|$|E
5|$|Koningsdag is also {{celebrated in}} Aruba, Curaçao, and <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten,</b> {{constituent}} {{countries of the}} Kingdom of the Netherlands.

5|$|Aruba, Curaçao and <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten</b> are {{constituent}} {{countries of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and thus have King Willem-Alexander as their sovereign, {{as well as the}} remaining islands forming the Caribbean Netherlands. Aruba was first settled under the authority of the Spanish Crown circa 1499, but was acquired by the Dutch in 1634, under whose control the island has remained, save for an interval between 1805 and 1816, when Aruba was captured by the Royal Navy of King George III. The former Netherlands Antilles were originally discovered by explorers sent in the 1490s by the King of Spain, but were eventually conquered by the Dutch West India Company in the 17th century, whereafter the islands remained {{under the control of the}} Dutch Crown as colonial territories. The Netherlands Antilles achieved the status of an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954, from which Aruba was split in 1986 as a separate constituent country of the larger kingdom. The former Netherlands Antilles again split as three areas in 2010. The monarch is represented in each region by the Governor of Aruba, Alfonso Boekhoudt, the Governor of Curaçao, Frits Goedgedrag, and the Governor of <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten,</b> Eugene Holiday.|$|E
5|$|Summer Carnivals {{include those}} on Antigua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sint Eustatius, Saint John, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Saba, Nevis and Anguilla, {{the latter two}} of which are {{especially}} known for popular calypso competitions. Christmastime Carnivals are held on Montserrat, Saint Croix, Saint Martin and Saint Kitts; Montserrat's distinctive Carnival includes masquerades and steelbands, and both islands also feature calypso competitions. The Carnival of <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten,</b> which takes place a month after Easter, is known for the burning of King Moui-Moui as the culmination of the festival. Many islands, especially the French and Dutch Antilles, are home to pre-Lenten Carnivals, including Martinique, Aruba, Saint-Barthélemy, Bonaire, Curaçao, Dominica, Saint Thomas and Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Klaus {{attained}} {{tropical storm}} status early on October 4, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for the northern Leeward Islands from Saint Martin to Antigua, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning as its quick strengthening became apparent; additionally, the government of France issued a tropical storm warning for Guadeloupe. A hurricane watch was issued for the Virgin Islands, though it was dropped as Klaus began to weaken. In Guadeloupe, officials advised citizens to transport livestock to safer areas, and also to avoid potentially flooded areas. Prior to its arrival, schools were closed in Martinique, <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten,</b> and Antigua. The VC Bird International Airport was closed during {{the passage of the}} hurricane.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Frances for the Leeward Islands {{during the afternoon}} of August 29, which was upgraded to a warning that night and expanded to include the islands of Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, Saba, Saint Kitts, Sint Eustatius, and <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten.</b> A hurricane watch was issued during the night of August 29 for the northern British Virgin Islands, the northern United States Virgin Islands, Culebra, and Vieques. On the morning of August 30, the hurricane watch for Vieques was downgraded to a {{tropical storm}} watch. That afternoon, hurricane watches were changed to tropical storm warnings across Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, British Virgin Islands, and the northern U. S. Virgin Islands while a tropical storm watch was issued for St. Croix while all remaining hurricane watches were dropped. That night, tropical storm watches were issued for eastern portions of the northern coast of the Dominican Republic while a tropical storm warning was issued for Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00UTC on September24, when Edith {{intensified}} into a hurricane, hurricane warnings {{were issued}} from Guadeloupe to Saint Vincent, including Barbados. Gale warnings were also issued for areas north of Guadeloupe to <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten.</b> As Edith approached Saint Lucia around 08:00UTC on September25, a hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The warnings and advice {{given by the}} San Juan Weather Bureau were credited for limiting damage and loss of life on Martinique. After Edith entered the Caribbean later on September25, the watch was spread to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, while gale warnings were issued for the south coast of Hispaniola, east of Santo Domingo, as well as Puerto Rico the Virgin Islands. At 08:00UTC on September26, hurricane warnings were issued for southern Haiti and southwestern Dominican Republic due to the impending threat. After Edith slowed and began a more northerly movement, a hurricane warning was issued for the eastern portion of the Dominican Republic and western Puerto Rico while the warning for western Hispaniola was discontinued at 02:00UTC on September27. Two hours later, the storm had weakened and {{it was evident that}} Edith would pass over the Dominican Republic. As a result, the hurricane warning for Puerto Rico was downgraded to a gale warning.|$|E
5|$|In addition, many {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were posted in the Greater and Lesser Antilles. At 2100UTC on August20, a hurricane watch was issued for <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten,</b> Saba, and Sint Eustatius, {{while there was}} a tropical storm watch for Antigua, Barbuda, and Anguilla. Early on August21, the hurricane watch was expanded to include the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Additionally, the tropical storm watch was extended out to the British Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Martin. A hurricane warning was issued for Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands late on August21. In Dominica, both a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch were reported, while a tropical storm watch was put into effect in Dominican Republic. At 0300UTC on August22, a hurricane watch was issued for Haiti north of Port-au-Prince as was a tropical storm warning in Dominican Republic from Palenque to Cabrera. An hour later, a tropical storm watch was put into effect for the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands. By 0900UTC on August22, Dominican Republic's entire north coast was under a hurricane warning. Additionally, the tropical storm watch for the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands was upgraded to a hurricane watch.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{regarding}} {{debt and}} revenue-sharing within the Netherlands Antilles {{eventually led to}} the dissolution of the territory and its division as constituent islands Curaçao and <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten</b> claimed a status of autonomy similar to that of Aruba, while the islands Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius were absorbed directly into the Netherlands. Thus, the 2008 Summer Olympics served as the final Olympics games in which the Netherlands Antilles participated as a territory. The future of the Dutch Antillean athletes to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were cast into doubt as a result. As residents of the Netherlands Antilles hold Dutch passports, IAAF General Secretary Pierre Weiss remarked all former Dutch Antillean athletes should immediately become eligible to represent the Netherlands in the Netherlands Antilles' stead. Ultimately, however, the IOC decided in its 123rd session upon three items: that former Dutch Antillean athletes would compete independently under the Olympic flag; that recognition for the Netherlands Antilles' Olympic Committee was to be withdrawn; and that a temporary administrative structure would serve in the Dutch Antillean NOC's place until after the 2012 London games, directly supervised and supported by the IOC.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} warning for Antigua, Barbuda, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis was discontinued at 1200UTC on August22, {{as was the}} tropical storm warning for Dominica. Three hours later, a {{hurricane warning}} was issued for the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and another hurricane watch was posted for the central Bahamas. Additionally, the hurricane warning for Saba, Sint Eustatius, <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten,</b> was discontinued. At 2100UTC on August22, a hurricane watch was issued in Cuba for the provinces of Holguín and Las Tunas, while a tropical storm warning was issued for Haiti north of Port-au-Prince. The hurricane warning for the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico was lowered to a tropical storm warning, before being canceled early on August23. Additionally, all watches and warning east of the United States Virgin Islands were discontinued. On August23, a hurricane warning was issued for the central Bahamas and Cuba in the provinces of Guantanamo, Holguín, and Las Tunas. A hurricane watch was put into effect for the northwestern Bahamas and Cuba in Camagüey and Ciego de Ávila on the north coast and Santiago de Cuba and Granma on the south coast. By 1500UTC on August25, all of the remaining tropical cyclone watches and warnings were cancelled.|$|E
