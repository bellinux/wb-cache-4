Recently, the senior management of many companies have begun to {{take an interest in}} reducing the impact to the environment and have begun changing their business processes. While reassessing operations makes <b>sense,</b> <b>finding</b> a starting place has been a difficult. In this paper, we propose a new method of prioritizing process changes, using a synthesis of Business Process Reengineering, TQM, and Value Chain analysis. We call this framework Green Reengineering. I. INTRODUCTION Despite the spectacular gains in productivity over the last thirty years, along with the continued pursuit for improved productivity using reengineering principles, the environment has suffered tremendous environmental damage. Toothless regulation, both domestically and internationally, has been unsuccessful at stopping the harm to our environment. In [...] ...|$|E
40|$|GIB SIE WIEDER’ [1] is {{a series}} of two {{political}} compositions, dedicated to exceptional performers Garth Knox (viola d’amore) and Rhodri Davies (harp). In this project, the central focus is on resonance in both a musical and wider socio-cultural <b>sense.</b> <b>Finding</b> the term closely correlated to the construction of gender, I direct my inner ear to the hidden background noises of the organisation of society. As a woman and composer, I perceive aural patterns of individual and political significance. In this work my aim is to to deconstruct engrained structures of resonance and assumptions of gender, and redefine them from a personal perspective as the basis for a new compositional identity. In this article, I identify my political perspective as an artist, and describe how this affects and stimulates my creative process.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we {{investigate}} the approximation of a function by a polynomial with floating-point coefficients; {{we are looking}} for the best approximation in the L 2 <b>sense.</b> <b>Finding</b> a best polynomial L 2 -approximation with real coefficients is an easy exercise about orthogonal projections. However, truncating the coefficients to floating-point numbers, which is needed for further computations, makes the approximation way worse. Hence, we study the problem of computing best approximations under the constraint that coefficients are floating-point numbers. We show that the corresponding problem is NP-hard, by reduction to the CVP problem. We investigate the practical behaviour of exact and approximate algorithms for this problem. The conclusion is that it is possible in {{a short amount of time}} to obtain a relative or absolute best L 2 -approximation. The main applications are for large dimension, as a preliminary step of finding L ∞-approximations and for functions with large variations, for which relative best approximation is by far more interesting than absolute. 1...|$|E

40|$|Resource {{allocation}} {{and transmit}} optimization for the multiple-antenna Gaussian interference channel are important but difficult problems. Recently, {{there has been}} a large interest in algorithms that find operating points which are optimal in the sum-rate, proportional-fair, or minimax <b>sense.</b> <b>Finding</b> these points entails solving a nonlinear, non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that solves these problems exactly, to within a prescribed level of accuracy and in a finite number of steps. The main idea is to rewrite the objective functions so that methods for monotonic optimization can be used. More precisely, we write each objective function as a difference between two functions which are strictly increasing over a normal constraint set. The so-obtained reformulated, equivalent problem can then be solved efficiently by using so-called polyblock optimization. Numerical examples illustrate the advantages of the proposed framework compared to an exhaustive grid search. © 2009 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this small-scale, {{heuristic}} qualitative study was {{to learn from the}} experiences of parents bereaved of a child through drug related causes. Specifically, it explored the meaning and significance they attach to the role of becoming peer supporters of others similarly bereaved. Method: This is a heuristic study in which semi-structured interviews were conducted with six participants who had all lost a child aged between eighteen and thirty. The findings were analysed using thematic analysis, a method described by Braun and Clarke (2006, 2014) which covers a spectrum of epistemological approaches, and is well-suited to the heuristic approach (Moustakas, 1990). The researcher, also a parent bereaved of a child through a drug overdose, is explicitly part of this work and uses her own experience, alongside those of the participants, to inform the work. Findings: There were four main themes highlighted by the researcher. Firstly, the devastating nature of the bereavement and the difficult grief process, encompassing disenfranchisement, shame, and stigma. Secondly, how the parents found support for themselves after their loss and gradually moved to becoming a supporter of others. Thirdly, the parents' reflections on the role of being a helper, both positive and negative. Fourthly, how they continue to support themselves in the role of a bereaved parent volunteer supporter. Conclusion: The work supports previous research suggesting this is a devastating form of bereavement which has been seldom studied. The findings endorse the necessity of meaning making and <b>sense</b> <b>finding</b> felt by many bereaved people, and the fact that finding meaning may be harder after a traumatic loss such as the ones represented here. The parents found meaning by maintaining a bond with their deceased child through their work, and connection by keeping company with others who had understanding of what they had suffered. The study illustrates aspects of posttraumatic growth, while emphasising that such a process is neither easy nor inevitable...|$|E

40|$|Since {{polysemy}} {{has multiple}} but related <b>senses,</b> <b>finding</b> any coherent system would seem impossible. But its senses are not random. When {{we look at}} inferences among them, {{it becomes clear that}} there must be a systematic structure of some kind. Based on the prototype theory, which views lexical items as constituting natural categories of senses, the present work aims at proposing solutions to problems resulting from the polysemy of kai. After an in-depth analysis of the polysemy kai, we find that the links between polysemy senses are defined not only by shared properties (i. e. analogy), but also by conceptual connections (e. g. metonymy or metaphor). This study suggests that polysemy reflects human's categorization of things and can be successfully accounted for by a cognitive approach. 1...|$|R
30|$|Research {{knowledge}} is never value-neutral. Rather it {{is created by}} inquiry through a dynamic interaction between the investigator and the investigated (Guba & Lincoln, 2005). In this <b>sense,</b> <b>findings</b> are value-mediated. One of our underlying values that mediated our findings {{is the notion that}} supervision should be more participatory. This was based on participatory learning theory and the idea of creating communities of practice (Bandura, 1977; Wenger, 1999). By utilising social learning Web 2.0 tools and participating in developing their own and others’ knowledge, the supervision process becomes one where students and their supervisors are co-creators of knowledge rather than consumers of knowledge created by experts (Jenkins, 2006). This is consistent with transforming higher degree research training through the incorporation of appropriate technologies for the 21 st century context because these technologies allow greater interaction among participants and ideally produce more collaboration.|$|R
