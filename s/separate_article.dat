25|$|No mid-major team, however, or {{team from}} any conference {{outside of the}} six aligned {{conferences}} (with the exception of independent Notre Dame, who played Alabama for the 2012 title), had ever played in the BCS Championship Game, causing increasing controversy. This controversy had become even more intense {{in light of the}} 4–1 record that mid-major teams had against teams from the six automatic qualifying conferences in the BCS Bowl games they had been allowed to play in. The performances and perfect record of Texas Christian University in the 2010 season and Boise State University in the season prior to that also fueled the controversy surrounding the perceived inequalities that the BCS seemed to perpetuate (see BCS Controversies below or in this more detailed <b>separate</b> <b>article).</b> However, little headway was made to institute an alternative system like a playoffs tournament, given the entrenched vested economic interests in the various bowls, until after the 2011 season, which saw LSU and Alabama, both members of the SEC West division, play each other in the 2012 BCS Championship game, where Alabama defeated LSU in a shutout win. Thereafter, acknowledging the many game, polling, and other related controversies, fans' complaints, and declining game viewership, among other factors, the major conferences decided to institute the College Football Playoff, which began after the 2014 regular season.|$|E

500|$|Ian Jones and Steve Williams, writers for British review website Off the Telly, {{claimed that}} the episode [...] "ditched all pretence of a plot and went flat out for individual, {{unconnected}} sight gags and vignettes". The two noted that it was their least favorite debut episode for a season of The Simpsons. In a <b>separate</b> <b>article</b> in Off the Telly, Jones and Williams write that the episode [...] "...wasn't shown for reasons of taste and has never appeared on terrestrial television in Britain", referring to a BBC Two schedule of the ninth season, which began in October 2001.|$|E
500|$|Babe threatens Abi {{and burns}} {{her as a}} way of keeping her in the clear.

She described the moment as [...] "chilling", writing, [...] "The fact that the grim moment isn't seen (you just hear Abi's anguished scream) makes it even more terrifying." [...] In a <b>separate</b> <b>article,</b> Deen also praised the scene where Babe forced her way into Abi's house and said, [...] "the way she says 'watch your back' makes our blood run cold." [...] In 2017, Lindsay opined that Babe should receive her comeuppance and that Abi [...] "needs to be instrumental" [...] in this.|$|E

He wrote that [...] "'Fionna and Cake' was reminiscent of the series' earlier episodes, in regards to its bright animation, well-paced plot, music, its successful blend of fantasy action and comedy, and its focus on character-based drama. As a result, he felt that the entry was composed of elements that make the series as a whole great. In a <b>separate</b> <b>article,</b> Sava named the entry one of the ten most representative episodes of the series and wrote that it is also [...] "the most aggressively girl-friendly episode of the series".|$|E
