Harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment.

5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to <b>swing</b> the <b>match</b> back from England's firm control.|$|R

Additionally, the arrival of bowlers like Peter Siddle, Ben Hilfenhaus and Doug Bollinger ensured that Lee had to fight for a position in the team. However, he took six wickets in the first innings against the England Lions team in a practice match leading up to the Ashes. Lee was the only bowler to get reverse <b>swing</b> in this <b>match</b> and appeared to be in line for selection for the First Test at Cardiff. However, he picked up a left side strain and a sore rib in this match and he was ruled out of the first three Tests.

40|$|The {{internet}} {{revolution has}} led to the demand for high speed, low cost solutions for providing high bandwidth to the consumers. Cable and DSL systems address these requirements through sophisticated analog and digital signal processing schemes. A key element of the analog front end of such systems is the line driver which interfaces with the transmission medium such as co-axial cable or twisted pair. The line driver is an amplifier that provides the necessary output current to drive the low impedance of the line. The main requirements for design are high output <b>swing,</b> high linearity, <b>matched</b> impedance to the line and power efficiency. These requirements are addressed by a class AB amplifier whose output impedance can be controlled through feedback. The property of this topology is that when the gain is unity, the output resistance of the driver is matched to the line resistance. Unity gain is achieved for varying line conditions through a tuning loop consisting of peak-to-peak detectors and differential difference amplifier. The design is fabricated in 0. 5 micron AMI CMOS process technology. For line variations from 65 to 170 ohms, the gain is unity with an error of 3 % and the impedance matching error is 20 % at the worst-case. The linearity is better than 50 dB for a 1. 2 V peak-to-peak signal over the signal bandwidth from 10 kHz to 5 MHz and the line resitance range from 65 to 160 ohms...|$|R

500|$|Although Hirst was a {{right-handed}} batsman, he bowled {{with his}} left arm at medium-fast pace. He {{was one of the}} first bowlers to make the ball swerve through the air in a controlled fashion. According to A. A. Thomson, Hirst's development of swing bowling was almost as revolutionary as Bernard Bosanquet's invention of the googly. His bowling partnership with Rhodes was particularly effective, and established a formidable reputation. Hirst could not make the ball <b>swing</b> in every <b>match,</b> nor could he maintain it through a long innings. However, when he could achieve swerve, even the best batsmen found it almost impossible to bat against him. His success was dependent on atmospheric conditions; for example, he could not swing the ball much in Australia. He was particularly effective when bowling into the wind. Sammy Woods described facing Hirst when the ball was moving in the air: [...] "How the devil can you play a ball that comes in at you like a hard throw-in from cover-point?" [...] Hirst was not an especially quick bowler, [...] a little faster than medium pace, with a long run-up and a relaxed action. He usually bowled over the wicket, meaning he bowled from the right hand side of the wickets and therefore angled the ball across the pitch. After delivery, the ball swung through the air at the last minute and hurried through after pitching, appearing to get faster. A very accurate bowler, he was difficult to score against unless a batsman was prepared to hit him in the air over mid on. The main dangers to the batsmen were the risk of being bowled or hitting the ball with a defensive shot and being caught by specially-placed fielders on the leg side. His ability to make the ball swing made him effective on a variety of pitches. Before Hirst developed his technique, bowlers often rubbed the ball in the dirt to remove the shiny layer of the ball, unaware that this layer helped the ball to swing. Hirst's Wisden obituary records: [...] "Hirst, in fact, has been described as the father of all modern seam and swing bowling." ...|$|R
