30|$|However, due to {{the fact}} that direct-path signal’s time delays and peak phases {{constitute}} both the synchronization error component and the nominal range component, the range history of direct-path signal will be removed in the synchronized echo data as well. This means that the system impulse response of the <b>synchronized</b> <b>data</b> will be quite different from that of the general bistatic SAR data. It is most straightforward to use time-domain algorithms such as back-projection algorithm (BPA) to focus the <b>synchronized</b> <b>data</b> [25 – 27]. However, it requires high-precision position measurement and suffers from severe computational load. Therefore, a frequency-domain algorithm is the preferred choice, but has to be re-engineered accordingly.|$|E

30|$|In {{published}} methods, the direct-path {{signal is}} a common choice for the synchronization of bistatic SAR systems, since the direct-path signal takes the advantage of high SNR and clean phases. However, it is still very difficult to extract synchronization errors with high precision from the direct-path signal, if no other auxiliary data is variable. In this paper, as a novel idea, time delays and peak phases of direct-path signal are utilized to compensate corresponding components of reflected signal directly. Time and phase synchronization errors can be completely removed using the presented method. Meanwhile, {{as the cost of}} synchronization, the system impulse response of the synchronized echo becomes quite {{different from that of the}} general bistatic SAR. To focus the particular <b>synchronized</b> <b>data,</b> the 2 -D spectrum of <b>synchronized</b> <b>data</b> is derived under linear approximations, and then a frequency-domain imaging algorithm is proposed. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed approach can provide accurate time and phase synchronization and well-focused images.|$|E

The message rate used in SIGS is very low with 8 Hz, to consume less power. Hence it is essential to synchronize the system at low message rate.

40|$|For {{development}} of technologies and science utilizing a high intensity proton accelerator, JAERI and KEK are promoting a joint project "Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) ". J-PARC consists of a linear accelerator (Linac), a 3 GeV rapid-cycling synchrotoron (RCS), and a 50 GeV synchrotoron (MR). Each accelerator transports high intensity beam to the experimental facilities, a materials and life science facility (MLF), a nuclear and particle physics facility, and an accelerator-driven transmutation experimental facility. Since the RCS is a proton synchrotron with an extreme high power of 1 MW, a delicate {{care must be taken}} to suppress radiation due to beam loss. The RCS injects each beam pulse of 25 Hz into the MLF and the 50 GeV MR in a predefined order. Since different beam control parameters are required for the MR and the MLF, monitoring and control must be made separately for each beam pulse, distinguishing the destination in the control system. In order to realize this demand, synchronicity of data is indispensable. There is beam position data etc. which requires synchronicity collection (fast <b>synchronized</b> <b>data</b> and slow <b>synchronized</b> <b>data).</b> To collect such data, we will build the system which use...|$|E
