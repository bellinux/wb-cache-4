25|$|When the {{open-loop}} gain has several poles, {{rather than the}} single pole of the above example, feedback can result in complex poles (real and imaginary parts). In a two-pole case, the result is peaking in the frequency response of the feedback amplifier near its corner frequency and ringing and overshoot in its step response. In the case {{of more than two}} poles, the feedback amplifier can become unstable and oscillate. <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of gain margin and phase margin.

25|$|Symon Petliura, who {{was head}} of the Directorate of the Ukrainian National Republic in 1919, had moved to Paris in 1924 and {{was the head of the}} government-in-exile of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Sholom Schwartzbard, who had lost his family in the 1919 pogroms, held Symon Petliura {{responsible}} for them (<b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> on Petliura's role in the pogroms). According to his autobiography, after hearing the news that Petliura had relocated to Paris, Schwartzbard became distraught and started plotting Petliura's assassination. A picture of Petliura with Józef Piłsudski published in the Encyclopedia Larousse allowed Schwartzbard to recognize him.|$|E
25|$|Just as the {{resistance}} of a conductor depends upon temperature, {{the resistance}} of a conductor depends upon strain. By placing a conductor under tension (a form of stress that leads to strain {{in the form of}} stretching of the conductor), the length of the section of conductor under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing {{the resistance of}} the strained section of conductor. Under compression (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section of conductor decreases. <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> on strain gauges for details about devices constructed {{to take advantage of this}} effect.|$|E
25|$|Pliny the Elder {{theorized that}} Julius Caesar's name {{came from an}} {{ancestor}} who was born by caesarean section, {{but the truth of}} this is debated (<b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of the etymology of Caesar). The Ancient Roman caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, lived through childbirth and successfully gave birth to her son, ruling out the possibility the Roman ruler and general was born by caesarean section. His first wife however died in childbirth, giving birth to a stilborn son who might have lived had a caesarean taken place.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, Jupiter-sized {{bodies that}} orbit {{too close to}} the {{habitable}} zone but not in it (as in 47 Ursae Majoris), or have a highly elliptical orbit that crosses the habitable zone (like 16 Cygni B) make it very difficult for an independent Earth-like planet to exist in the system. <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of a stable habitable zone above. However, during the process of migrating into a habitable zone, a Jupiter-size planet may capture a terrestrial planet as a moon. Even if such a planet is initially loosely bound and following a strongly inclined orbit, gravitational interactions with the star can stabilize the new moon into a close, circular orbit that is coplanar with the planet's orbit around the star.|$|E
