5|$|An American design, , {{authorized}} in 1905 {{and laid}} down in December 1906, was another of the first dreadnoughts, but she and her <b>sister,</b> , <b>were</b> not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines and had a superior layout of the main battery, dispensing with Dreadnoughts wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.|$|E
5|$|As was {{traditional}} in {{the royal}} family, Anne and her <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> brought up separated from their father in their own establishment at Richmond, London. On the instructions of Charles II, they were raised as Protestants. Placed {{in the care of}} Colonel Edward and Lady Frances Villiers, their education was focused on the teachings of the Anglican church. Henry Compton, Bishop of London, was appointed as Anne's preceptor.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone along with Dan Sterling. The episode served as both a parody of genetic {{engineering}} and a statement against its potential evils. The scenes of Stan getting beat up by his <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> inspired by Parker's real-life childhood experiences with his own sister, who is also named Shelley.|$|E
5|$|The two battleships of the Nevada-class were {{virtually}} identical except in their propulsion. Nevada and her <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> fitted with different engines {{to compare the}} two, putting them 'head-to-head': Oklahoma received older vertical triple expansion engines, which had proven more fuel-efficient and reliable than the direct drive turbines of some earlier battleships, while Nevada received geared Curtis steam turbines.|$|E
5|$|Wise {{was born}} in 1884 to Sophie Hasel and her husband, farmers in Hardscrabble, a town in Medina County, Ohio. Three {{brothers}} and a <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> also born to the family, although contemporary sources name only one, a brother named Fred. In 1906, Martha Hasel met the substantially older Albert Wise at a box social; the two were married, though Wise neglected {{to give her a}} wedding ring.|$|E

5|$|According to flashbacks {{during the}} game, Squall {{grew up in}} an orphanage with the other playable {{characters}} (except Rinoa). The orphans were cared for by Edea; although Squall remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, cynical and introverted boy whose original goal is to go through life without any emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his detachment from his companions is a defensive mechanism to protect himself from the emotional pain he suffered when he and his older <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> separated.|$|E
5|$|Daghlian was {{estimated}} to have received a dose of 510rem (5.1Sv) of neutron radiation, from a yield of 1016 fissions. Despite intensive medical care, he developed symptoms of severe radiation poisoning and his mother and <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> flown out to care for him (his father had died in 1943). He fell into a coma, and died 25 days after the accident. He was the first known fatality caused by a criticality accident. His body was returned to New London, where he was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{inherited}} {{lands in}} Lincolnshire worth {{one half of}} a knight's fee. These were augmented with gifts from Richard and John, much of which were in Essex. He also acquired lands in Surrey and in Somerset, and his marriage to Joan brought him estates in Essex. Joan's lands also brought him into conflict with Falkes de Breauté, the husband of Joan's younger sister and co-heiress, and the two brothers-in-law were involved in lawsuits over their wives' lands {{for more than five}} years. Joan and her <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> also co-heiresses to the barony of Courcy, in right of their mother Alice de Courcy.|$|E

5|$|The ship saw limited action during World War I. Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I {{opted to}} remain neutral until October 1916, when {{pressure}} from the Triple Entente forced him to abdicate {{in favor of a}} pro-Entente government. For the remainder of the war, Kilkis operated solely as a harbor defense ship. In the immediately ensuing Greco-Turkish War of 19191922, Kilkis supported Greek landings in Turkey and participated in the final Greek sea-borne withdrawal in 1922. She remained in service into the early 1930s, when she was used for a training ship. During the German invasion of Greece in 1941, she and her <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> sunk in Salamis by German Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers. The two ships were ultimately raised in the 1950s and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire. The two battleships and the ancient central battery ironclad —which had {{been built in the}} mid-1870s—had been on a summer training cruise since July, and so were prepared for the conflict. On 1 October, shortly after the outbreak of war, Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut. The following day, the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Ottoman fleet, including Barbaros Hayreddin, remained in port for the duration of the war. By the end of the war, Barbaros Hayreddin and her <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> in very poor condition. Their rangefinders and the ammunition hoists for their main battery guns had been removed, their telephones did not work, and the pipes for their pumps were badly rusted. Most of the watertight doors could not close, and the condensers remained problematic.|$|E
5|$|Born on Korhal IV, the {{scion of}} a {{powerful}} founding family of the Terran Confederacy, Mengsk was a colonel in the Confederate Marine Corps and {{a veteran of the}} Guild Wars, who became a successful prospector after war's end. Though trying to distance himself from the actions of his father, a prominent Korhal senator and vocal dissident against the Confederacy, Mengsk became a revolutionary himself when his father, mother, and younger <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> murdered by Confederate assassins. His activities soon spurred the Confederacy to launch a nuclear attack against Korhal, wiping out its population; Mengsk swore vengeance, and formed a revolutionary group he called the Sons of Korhal. Years of open conflict successfully weakened Confederate control over the fringe worlds, during which he recruited followers such as Sarah Kerrigan, Jim Raynor and Edmund Duke. Raynor and Kerrigan grew uneasy with Mengsk's increasingly extreme methods, namely luring Zerg to attack Confederate targets, leading to Mengsk abandoning Kerrigan to the Zerg on the Confederate capital of Tarsonis (another reason for the latter was Kerrigan had been the assassin that murdered his father). With the destruction of Tarsonis by the Zerg, Mengsk crowned himself emperor and styled himself as a benevolent dictator.|$|E

50|$|Caroline Wardlaw {{had three}} <b>sisters,</b> who <b>were</b> Ocey's aunts. The elder <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> Mary E. Long Wardlaw (1849-1937), who married Fletcher Tillman Snead (1829-1891). Together they {{produced}} a son, Fletcher Wardlaw Snead (1875-1955), who was Ocey's first cousin and would become her husband. The second <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> Virginia Oceana Wardlaw (1852-1910) who never married. Both <b>sisters</b> <b>were</b> {{also involved in}} education. Both of Ocey's aunts were also implicated in her murder. The third <b>sister,</b> who <b>was</b> not implicated in her murder, was Bessie Gertrude Wardlaw (1867-1954) who married Richard Spindle (1855-1928).|$|R
5|$|Dannatt and his <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> sent to {{separate}} boarding schools. He attended Felsted Junior School, where he gained an ambition {{to become a}} professional cricketer. For his secondary education, {{he was sent to}} St. Lawrence College in Ramsgate, Kent, where he joined the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and eventually rose to senior under-officer. While at school, he developed a dislike of his first name, Francis, after it was mistaken for a girl's and he was invited to a birthday party at which he was the only boy. He eventually switched to his middle name, Richard, when he was fifteen. By then aspiring to become a barrister, Dannatt applied to study law at Emmanuel College, Cambridge but was turned down after an interview, at which point his ambition switched towards a military career.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{designed}} as a minelayer, the German Navy never operated her as such. She and her <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> used to raid a British convoy to Norway in October 1917. The two cruisers sank two escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve merchant ships of the convoy. The Kaiserliche Marine considered sending the two ships to attack convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulties associated with refueling at sea convinced the Germans to abandon the plan. Brummer {{was included in the}} list of ships interned at Scapa Flow following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the scuttling of the fleet. Brummer was successfully scuttled, and unlike most of the other wrecks, she was never raised for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|HMS Renown was {{the lead}} ship of her class of battlecruisers of the Royal Navy built during the First World War. She was {{originally}} laid down as an improved version of the s. Her construction was suspended on the outbreak of war on the grounds {{she would not be}} ready in a timely manner. Admiral Lord Fisher, upon becoming First Sea Lord, gained approval to restart her construction as a battlecruiser that could be built and enter service quickly. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Eustace Tennyson-D'Eyncourt, quickly produced an entirely new design to meet Admiral Lord Fisher's requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ships in 15 months. They did not quite meet that ambitious goal, but the ship was delivered {{a few months after the}} Battle of Jutland in 1916. Renown, and her <b>sister</b> , <b>were</b> the world's fastest capital ships upon completion.|$|E
50|$|Two sisters go {{down by a}} body of water, {{sometimes}} a river and sometimes the sea. The older one pushes the younger in and refuses to pull her out again; generally the lyrics explicitly state her intent to drown her younger sister. Her motive, when included in the lyrics, is sexual jealousy - in some variants, the <b>sisters</b> <b>are</b> being two-timed by a suitor; in others, the elder <b>sister's</b> affections <b>are</b> not encouraged by the young man. In a few versions, a third <b>sister</b> <b>is</b> mentioned, but plays no significant role in events. In most versions, the older <b>sister</b> <b>is</b> described as dark, while the younger <b>sister</b> <b>is</b> fair.|$|R

5|$|Howell's body later washed ashore and was {{returned}} to Australia for burial; Fraser's remains were never discovered. Howell was accorded a funeral with full military honours, which took place at Warringal Cemetery, Heidelberg on 22 April 1920, with several hundred mourners in attendance; his widow, parents and <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> chief among these. A firing party of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery led the gun carriage bearing the coffin to the cemetery. Captains Adrian Cole, Frank Lukis and Raymond Brownell acted as pallbearers along with five other officers who had served in either the Royal or Australian Flying Corps. On 12 February 1923, a stained-glass window dedicated {{to the memory of}} Howell was unveiled by General Sir Harry Chauvel at St. Anselm's Church of England in Middle Park; Howell {{had been a member of}} the congregation there in his youth. Following the closure of St. Anselm's in 2001, the window was moved to St. Silas's Church, Albert Park, which is now also the parish church for the former parish of St. Anselm.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 {{the ship}} was sold to the South African Navy, {{together}} with her sister ship, Rosamund, and departed England on 22 November after a refresher course at the minesweeping school at HMS Lochinvar, Port Edgar, Scotland. The sisters arrived at Cape Town on 24 December, making stops at Gibraltar, Freetown and Walvis Bay en route. She was rechristened by {{the mayor of the}} city, A. E. Hirst, on 21 January 1948. The navy had originally intended to rename the ship Maritzburg, but decided to use the city's full name after protests. In November of that year, the sisters exercised with the British 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron. Later that month, together with the frigate , they visited ports in Portuguese Mozambique, returning to Durban on 12 December. While serving as a midshipmans' training ship, Pietermaritzburg became the largest South African warship to visit Knysna in September 1953. The ship and her <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> placed in reserve for a time in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|One day at harvest time, {{according}} to William of Newburgh {{during the reign}} of King Stephen (1135–1154), the villagers of Woolpit discovered two children, a brother and sister, beside one of the wolf pits that gave the village its name. Their skin was green, they spoke an unknown language, and their clothing was unfamiliar. Ralph reports that the children were taken to the home of Richard de Calne. Ralph and William agree that the pair refused all food for several days until they came across some raw broad beans, which they consumed eagerly. The children gradually adapted to normal food and in time lost their green colour. The boy, who appeared to be the younger of the two, became sickly and died shortly after he and his <b>sister</b> <b>were</b> baptised.|$|E

50|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that an older <b>sister</b> <b>is</b> likely to give a varied gender role to their younger {{siblings}} as well as being more likely to develop a close bond with their younger siblings. Older <b>sisters</b> <b>are</b> more likely to play with their younger siblings. Younger siblings display a more needy behavior when in close proximity to their older <b>sister</b> and <b>are</b> more likely to be tolerant of an older sisters bad behavior. Boys with only an older <b>sister</b> <b>are</b> more likely to display stereotypically male behavior, and such masculine boys increased their masculine behavior with the more sisters they have. The reverse is true for young boys with several sisters, as they tend to be feminine, however they outgrow this by the time they approach pubescence. Boys with older <b>sisters</b> <b>were</b> less likely to be delinquent or have emotional and behavioral disorders. A younger <b>sister</b> <b>is</b> less likely to be scolded by older siblings than a younger brother. The most common recreational activity between older brother/younger <b>sister</b> pairs <b>is</b> art drawing. Some studies also found a correlation between having an older sister and constructive discussions about safe sexual practises. Some {{studies have shown}} that men without <b>sisters</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be ineffectual at courtship and romantic relationships.|$|R
