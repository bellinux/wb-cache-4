5|$|LTP is persistent, lasting {{from several}} minutes to many months, {{and it is}} this {{persistence}} that separates LTP from other forms of <b>synaptic</b> <b>plasticity.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is one {{of several}} {{phenomena}} underlying <b>synaptic</b> <b>plasticity,</b> the ability of chemical synapses to change their strength.

Here, mixed protonic {{and electronic}} conductor (MPEC) hybrid indium-tungsten-oxide (IWO) synaptic transistors gated by nanogranular phosphorosilicate glass (PSG) based electrolytes were obtained.

5|$|Normally brain {{electrical}} activity is non-synchronous. Its activity is regulated by various factors {{both within the}} neuron and the cellular environment. Factors within the neuron include the type, number and distribution of ion channels, changes to receptors and changes of gene expression. Factors around the neuron include ion concentrations, <b>synaptic</b> <b>plasticity</b> and regulation of transmitter breakdown by glial cells.|$|E
5|$|In the hippocampus, ApoER2 is {{complexed}} with NMDA receptors {{through the}} PSD-95 adapter protein. When reelin binds ApoER2, it initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors. This occurs through Dab-1 activation of Src family kinases, which {{have been shown to}} play a role in regulating <b>synaptic</b> <b>plasticity.</b> VLDLR also acts as a receptor coupled to ApoER2 as it does during development, but its role is not well understood. ApoER2 plays a more important role in this process, most likely due to its ability to bind the PSD-95 adapter protein through the 59 amino acid insert on its cytoplasmic tail. Studies with mice have shown that knocking out ApoER2 or just the alternatively spliced exon 19 causes a much greater impairment of LTP than knocking out VLDLR.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all animals}} {{are capable of}} modifying their {{behavior}} {{as a result of}} experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the <b>synaptic</b> <b>plasticity</b> hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.|$|E

With interfacial electrochemical doping, channel conductances of the oxide EDL transistor can be regulated to different levels, corresponding to different initial synaptic weights. Thus, activity dependent synaptic responses such as excitatory postsynaptic current, paired-pulse facilitation, and high-pass filtering are discussed in detail.

40|$|In {{the adult}} {{mammalian}} cortex, {{a small fraction}} of spines are created and eliminated every day, and the resultant synaptic connection structure is highly nonrandom, even in local circuits. However, it remains unknown whether a particular synaptic connection structure is functionally advantageous in local circuits, and why creation and elimination of synaptic connections is necessary in addition to rich <b>synaptic</b> weight <b>plasticity.</b> To answer these questions, we studied an inference task model through theoretical and numerical analyses. We demonstrate that a robustly beneficial network structure naturally emerges by combining Hebbian-type <b>synaptic</b> weight <b>plasticity</b> and wiring plasticity.

25|$|Plastic change {{often results}} from the {{alteration}} {{of the number of}} neurotransmitter receptors located on a synapse.

However, the underlying cellular mechanisms are not understood. Small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels are present at glutamatergic synapses where they limit <b>synaptic</b> transmission and <b>plasticity.</b> Here, we show that beta adrenoceptor activation regulates synaptic SK channels in lateral amygdala pyramidal neurons, through activation of protein kinase A. We show that SK channels are constitutively recycled from the postsynaptic membrane and that activation of beta adrenoceptors removes SK channels from excitatory synapses. This results in enhanced <b>synaptic</b> transmission and <b>plasticity.</b> Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which beta adrenoceptors control <b>synaptic</b> transmission and <b>plasticity,</b> through regulation of SK channel trafficking, and suggest that modulation of synaptic SK channels may contribute to beta adrenoceptor-mediated potentiation of emotional memories...|$|R

25|$|The {{ability to}} learn rules is {{dependent}} on nonsynaptic plasticity. One study sought to teach rats to discriminate between various odors, and it took several days {{to teach them to}} distinguish between a first pair of smells. However, after learning this, the rat was able to learn to distinguish between different odors much faster. Changes in excitability of the pyramidal neurons in these rats were observed for three days after training. These changes faded eventually, suggesting that the neurons were involved in learning the rules, not in storing memory. Daoudal and Debanne attempted to determine if the same learning rules and induction mechanisms defined for <b>synaptic</b> <b>plasticity</b> also applied to nonsynaptic plasticity affecting ion channels. They determined that nonsynaptic and <b>synaptic</b> <b>plasticity</b> share common learning rules and induction pathways, e.g., NMDA receptor dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). They also showed that nonsynaptic and <b>synaptic</b> <b>plasticity</b> synergistically form a coherent engram to store memory traces.|$|E

40|$|The calcium-binding protein frequenin (Frq), {{discovered}} in the fruit fly Drosophila, and its mammalian homologue neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS- 1) {{have been reported to}} affect several aspects of synaptic transmission, including basal levels of neurotransmission and short- and long-term <b>synaptic</b> <b>plasticities.</b> However, discrepant reports leave doubts about the functional roles of these conserved proteins. In this review, we attempt to resolve some of these seemingly contradictory reports. We discuss how stimulation protocols, sources of calcium (voltage-gated channels versus internal stores), and expression patterns (presynaptic versus postsynaptic) of Frq may result in the activation of various protein targets, leading to different synaptic effects. In addition, the potential interactions of Frq's C-terminal and N-terminal domains with other proteins are discussed. Frq also has a role in regulating neurite outgrowth, axonal regeneration, and synaptic development. We examine whether the effects of Frq on neurotransmitter release and neurite outgrowth are distinct or interrelated through homeostatic mechanisms. Learning and memory are affected by manipulations of Frq probably through changes in synaptic transmission and neurite outgrowth, raising the possibility that Frq may be implicated in human pathological conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and X-linked mental retardation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

40|$|Glutamatergic synapses rely on AMPA receptors (AMPARs) {{for fast}} <b>synaptic</b> {{transmission}} and <b>plasticity.</b> AMPAR auxiliary proteins regulate receptor trafficking, and modulate receptor mobility and its biophysical properties.

We show that Shisa 7 physically interacts with synaptic AMPARs in mouse hippocampus. Shisa 7 gene deletion resulted in faster AMPAR currents in CA 1 synapses, without affecting its synaptic expression. Shisa 7 KO mice showed reduced initiation and maintenance of long-term potentiation of glutamatergic synapses. In line with this, Shisa 7 KO mice showed a specific deficit in contextual fear memory, both short-term and long-term after conditioning, whereas auditory fear memory and anxiety-related behavior were normal.
