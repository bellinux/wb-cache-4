40|$|Feasibility of a currency board type of {{monetary}} arrangement in transitional economies of Eastern Europe is a function {{of the size}} of the country and the nature of the financial sector in a country. For very small countries where financial services can be provided by <b>subsidiaries</b> of foreign <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> the currency board is likely to be an optimal monetary arrangement. However, if the need exists for an efficient domestically based financial sector - as is likely in medium and large countries - the currency board type of arrangement appears unfeasible. Major reason is the need to restructure the domestic financial system in these countries. Such restructuring is costly and unlikely to be paid out of fiscal revenues. Hence, the need for Central Bank with its ability to create "net domestic assets" as the restructuring agent. However, once the transition is concluded and East European countries accession to EU becomes a serious possibility, a currency board arrangement appears to be a best intermediate monetary step before joining the Euro area. currency board, transitional economies, monetary arrangement, accession to European Union...|$|R
40|$|To be effective, {{programs}} of regulatory reform {{must address the}} incentive conflicts that intensify financial risk-taking and undermine government insolvency detection and crisis management. Subsidies to risk-taking that large institutions extract from the financial safety-net encourage managers to make their firms riskier, harder to supervise, and politically and administratively more difficult to fail and unwind. Except in the very short run, repealing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or breaking up so-called too-big-to-fail institutions will do little to arrest subsidy-induced activities. Rebuilding Glass-Steagall barriers between banking, securities, and insurance firms would instead make implicit taxpayer support of large institutions less transparent and serve foreign interests by encouraging conglomerate firms to operate affected businesses through foreign <b>subsidiaries.</b> To discourage <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> from abusing safety-net support, government supervisors must be made specifically accountable for delivering and pricing safety-net benefits fairly and efficiently.

40|$|PURPOSE AND MOTIVATION: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effect {{functional}} diversification on the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> The focus is on whether <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> should be allowed to combine commercial banking and investment banking functions under one financial conglomerate. Under current regulators <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> are allowed to combine the functions, however regulators are considering driving regulation towards separating commercial and investment banking. This study sheds light on whether the contemplated separation of investment and commercial banking increases or decreases the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> DATA AND METHODS: The data sample of his study consists of 51 <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> from Europe and the US, with a time span ranging from 2007 to 2014. Functional diversification is measured using income and asset based measures, collected from the annual financial statements of the <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> Credit risk is measured with the <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> level credit default swap (CDS) spreads and the CDS spread difference with banking sector CDS index spreads. The impact of functional diversification on credit risk is examined with multiple panel data regressions, where the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> is explained with the functional diversification measures and a set of control variables. Furthermore, multiple robustness checks are developed. FINDINGS: Based on the results, functional diversification decreases the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> at the <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> credit risk level and compared with the average credit risk in the banking sector. The results are confirmed with multiple robustness checks. Based on the results the contemplated separation of commercial and investment banking with new regulation can have grave consequences. Separating the two functions would decrease functional diversification increasing the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> and the probability of <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> failures...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{different}} views {{on the effects of}} public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> on corporate debt restructuring : the soft budget view and the hard budget view. The former view, which is held by Kornai (1979, 1983), Dewatripont and Maskin (1995), and others insists that because centralized public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> have difficulty committing themselves to refrain from providing additional funds to distressed firms, corporate reorganizations often result in overinvestment. On the other hand, the latter view argues that public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> should prefer corporate liquidation rather than the continuation of business because public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> are secured by mortgages to a greater extent and are more reluctant to forgive the debts than private <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> In this paper, I have empirically examined the role and impact of public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> government-affiliated <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> in particular, from the viewpoints of debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and bankruptcy procedures for distressed firms. The conclusions of this paper are as follows. In the DIP financing, the Development Bank of Japan always takes the lead, followed by private <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> Namely, so-called cowbell effect may exist, which is inconsistent with the hard budget view. Regarding the selection of bankruptcy procedures, firms that owed to government-affiliated <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> have a tendency to opt for private procedures which have the effect of delaying a drastic debt restructuring. This is consistent with the soft budget view. public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> bankruptcy procedures, debtor-in-possession financing...|$|R
