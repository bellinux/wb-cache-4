25|$|Onerva enjoyed her <b>studies,</b> <b>teachers,</b> {{and peers}} and {{performed}} {{well at the}} girls' school. After the girls' school, she continued into secondary school (jatko-opisto), where she engaged in various extracurricular activities. Onerva was talented: she sung, wrote, painted, and recital. In continuing her studies, she studied French and acquired a preliminary teacher's degree in 1902. After two years of secondary education, Onerva began to prepare for her matriculation examination as a private student of Helsingin Suomalainen Yhteiskoulu since her secondary institution did not offer the possibility to take the examination. She graduated in 1909 with grades just a few points below excellent. On her final year of schooling, she pondered her career and future. She had a tough choice ahead of her, since {{she was interested in}} various different disciplines. At secondary school, Onerva had been inspired by theater and she seriously entertained the possibility to become a professional actor. In autumn 1902 Onerva enrolled in the department of history and philology at the University of Helsinki, but she never graduated.|$|E

2500|$|Instructors {{appear to}} use podcasts {{in several ways}} within {{academic}} settings. For example, podcasts are used to duplicate the classroom lecture. [...] The student attends the lecture and uses the podcast as a backup for reviewing complex topics. Podcasts are also used to share additional information with students {{in the form of}} audio recordings that aid student learning and provide support in relation to core learning materials. This includes assignment tips, hints, and pre/post-assignment feedback, along with additional audio to supplement subject content. Language, Science and Social <b>Studies</b> <b>teachers</b> in K-12 settings use podcasts of news coverage, historically significant speeches, cultural events and official happenings as rich trappings for the teaching-learning process. Students in a French or Political Science class can listen, for example, to a podcast of former French President Jacques Chirac's actual voice as he departs his presidential position. They could also listen to French citizens as they discuss Chirac's position.|$|E
