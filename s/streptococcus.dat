40|$|Historically, {{resistance}} to phagocytosis {{has been determined}} by incubating group A <b>streptococci</b> in human blood and comparing the numbers of CFU before and after incubation. Utilizing a flow cytometry-based technique, we have investigated the phagocytosis of M+ group A <b>streptococci</b> by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in heparinized human peripheral whole blood. Intracellular labeling of <b>streptococci</b> with a nontoxic fluorescent dye allowed us to quantify the association and phagocytosis of M+ <b>streptococci</b> by PMNs in whole blood in {{the presence or absence}} of C 5 a, a physiologically important chemotactic activator of PMNs. We found that wild-type strains of group A <b>streptococci</b> that are resistant to phagocytosis (determined by the classical Lancefield method) readily associate with C 5 a-activated whole-blood PMNs. In the absence of opsonizing M-type-specific antibodies, the M+ <b>streptococci</b> associated with PMNs are phagocytized and killed. In addition, blockade of the β 2 integrin, CD 11 b/CD 18, with anti-human CD 11 b monoclonal antibody inhibited association between M+ <b>streptococci</b> and C 5 a-activated PMNs. These findings establish a new relationship between M+ <b>streptococci</b> and PMNs, in which C 5 a-activated PMNs have the capacity to kill M+ <b>streptococci</b> in whole blood through a receptor-mediated phagocytic mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The role of S {{protein in}} the {{adherence}} of group A and G <b>streptococci</b> to human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultivated in 96 -well microdilution plates was studied by utilizing fluorescein-labeled <b>streptococci.</b> The assay proved suitable for quantitative determination of bacterial adherence to cultured endothelial cells for all tested strains of <b>streptococci.</b> Only bacterial strains with significant S protein binding but weak fibronectin binding {{were included in}} these studies. Fibronectin-mediated adherence to endothelial cells of these <b>streptococci</b> was less than 25 % of total and could be blocked by antifibronectin immunoglobulin G. Further treatment of endothelial cell monolayers with anti-S protein immunoglobulin G at concentrations up to 1 mg per well led to an almost complete inhibition of adherence for all tested streptococcal cultures, indicating significant contribution of S protein in the streptococcus-endothelial cell interaction. Blocking of S-protein-binding sites on <b>streptococci</b> by preincubation with exogeneous S protein at a concentration of 10 micrograms per 4 x 10 (7) <b>streptococci</b> led to about 75 % reduction of S-protein-mediated adherence to endothelial cells.

40|$|Specific binding of the 125 I-labeled human S protein (vitronectin) {{which has}} been shown to be {{identical}} with serum-spreading factor, was observed with group A, C, and G <b>streptococci</b> as well as with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The specific binding of S protein to group A, C, and G <b>streptococci</b> was high, whereas the binding to S. aureus and E. coli cultures was moderate. In contrast, group B <b>streptococci</b> and a number of other bacterial species tested did not interact with S protein. The binding of S protein to bacteria was saturable and could be inhibited only by unlabeled S protein but not by albumin. Trypsinization and heat treatment of bacteria destroyed the S-protein binding capacity for group G <b>streptococci,</b> S. aureus, and E. coli but not for group A and C <b>streptococci.</b> Likewise, unlabeled human fibronectin and heparin inhibited the binding of labeled S protein to group G <b>streptococci,</b> S. aureus, and E. coli, but did not influence the binding to group A and C <b>streptococci.</b> Double-reciprocal plots of S-protein binding to group G <b>streptococci</b> indicated that fibronectin inhibited the binding in a competitive manner, while heparin acts in a noncompetitive manner. Moreover, the binding of S protein to G <b>streptococci</b> could be partially by the synthetic peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, which contains the cell attachment site of S protein. Trypsin-treated S protein had similar binding activity as untreated S protein for group G <b>streptococci,</b> S. aureus, and E. coli, but showed reduced binding to group A and C <b>streptococci.</b> The present data are indicative of two different types of bacterial binding sites in S protein.

40|$|The optimal {{incubation}} conditions for isolation of group A <b>streptococci</b> from throat cultures are controversial.

Group A <b>streptococci</b> were identified by the fluorescent-antibody technique. Of 1, 040 specimens, 506 (48. 6 %) grew beta-hemolytic <b>streptococci,</b> including 200 (19. 2 %) group A <b>streptococci.</b> Group A <b>streptococci</b> were recovered significantly more often with anaerobic incubation than with aerobic incubation after 24 h (182 versus 138; P less than 0. 001) and after 48 h (193 versus 174; P less than 0. 05). Non-group A beta-hemolytic <b>streptococci</b> also were recovered significantly more often with anaerobic incubation after 24 and 48 h (P less than 0. 001). Colony counts were not affected by the incubation atmosphere. We conclude that incubation of throat cultures in an anaerobic atmosphere is superior to incubation in air for detection of group A <b>streptococci.</b> The greater sensitivity of anaerobic incubation, however, may not justify the extra laboratory effort and cost required to differentiate group A <b>streptococci</b> from the non-group A <b>streptococci</b> detected {{as a result of}} anaerobic incubation.
