The south part of the wetlands had been altered by a <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfill</b> that the city acquired in 1969 to prevent its development as industrial land. The city later filled {{the north end of}} the park with debris from construction of Interstate 405 through downtown Portland. The plan in the early 1970s was to fill the rest of the wetlands and to use the space for museums, perhaps a motocross course, and a gondola lift to transport visitors from the top of the bluff to the park. Public pressure from the Audubon Society of Portland, the Sellwood-Moreland Improvement League, and The Nature Conservancy helped persuade the city to stop filling the wetlands. In 1988, after many years of debate, officials designated Oaks Bottom as the first urban wildlife refuge in Portland. Since then, Friends of Oaks Bottom, a volunteer group, has helped the city's parks department with trail maintenance, habitat restoration, and information services.|$|E
25|$|Adam Branson : Adam is Tender's older twin brother. Because {{he was the}} firstborn, Adam got {{to stay in the}} Church {{community}} in Nebraska and marry, while Tender was among those sent to earn a living for the Church in the outside world. Adam is the person who leaked the community's illegal activities to the police ten years {{prior to the start of}} the novel, which was the event that instigated the community's mass suicide. Since then, Adam has been traveling the country, killing surviving members of the Church and masking the murders as suicides in order to motivate further suicides. His motivations are unclear. His goal seems to be to completely eradicate the Creedish beliefs and challenge the Church at its core. He also may see his actions as merciful to the victims of the cult brainwashing. In the course of the novel, he also kills the caseworker and the agent, making Tender the prime suspect in both murders. Adam and Fertility help Tender escape from the police as they come to arrest him, and as the brothers travel north in hiding, they return to the Creedish Church Compound, which is now the Sensitive Materials <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Landfill.</b> As they argue over their memories of the Creedish way of life, Tender crashes the car, which sends a dashboard figurine (of Tender) into Adam's eye.

40|$|Waste {{management}} {{is a distinct}} practice aimed at reducing its effects on {{health and the environment}} and increasing energy and material recovery. The urban waste management industry has been slow to adopt new technologies, such as <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills</b> and incineration, which enable better treatment results. The aim of a thorough ecological-economic evaluation of different treatment technologies is to extract the maximum practical benefits from investments and to ensure the minimum environmental impacts of wastes. This paper compares four garbage treatment systems, including <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills</b> systems, fluidized bed incineration system, grate type incineration system and the current landfills system in Liaoning Province, China. By considering the economic and environmental impacts of waste treatment and disposal, impact of emissions, and contribution of wastes input, this paper constructed an emergy-based urban solid waste model for evaluating the sustainability of the holistic systems. The results in Liaoning indicate that the human health losses caused by the harmful air emissions are ranked in this order: fluidized bed incineration > grate type incineration > current <b>landfills</b> > <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills,</b> while the ecosystem losses are ranked: grate type incineration > fluidized bed incineration > <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills</b> > current landfills. The electricity yield ratios are ranked: grate type incineration > fluidized bed incineration > <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills</b> > current landfills. Taken together this suggests that in considering the incineration option, decision makers must weigh the benefits of incineration against the significant operating costs, potential environmental impacts, and technical difficulties of operating. Emergy analysis of the urban solid treatment systems can provide a set of useful tools which can be used to compare the comprehensive performances of different waste treatment processes for decision-making and optimizing the whole process...|$|R
