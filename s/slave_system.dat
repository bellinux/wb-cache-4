5|$|Republicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized {{and argued}} for {{abolition}} {{as a necessary}} step in national progress. Amendment supporters also argued that the <b>slave</b> <b>system</b> had negative effects on white people. These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Advocates said ending slavery would restore the First Amendment and other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.|$|E
5|$|Gregory {{was also}} one of the first Christian voices to say that slavery as an {{institution}} was inherently sinful. He believed that slavery violated mankind's inherent worth, and the nature of humanity to be free; a departure from classical, and Judeo-Christian precedent which he rooted in Genesis, arguing that man was given mastery of animals but not of mankind. Although aspects of the <b>slave</b> <b>system</b> had been criticized by Stoics such as Seneca, this was the first and only sustained critique of the institution of slavery itself made in the ancient world.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{model of}} Baddeley & Hitch {{was composed of}} three main components; the central executive which acts as supervisory system and controls {{the flow of information}} from and to its slave systems: the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad.

25|$|Politically, the Draka {{state is}} {{described}} as 'aristocratic republic' with a parliamentary system of government.

Draka citizens have a considerable degree of free speech, but fundamental criticism of the <b>slave</b> <b>system</b> is forbidden. The Draka economy is heavily dominated by cartels known as Combines, with ownership split {{between the state and the}} Landholders' League (Citizens can only own the right to use land, not the land itself, which can be confiscated in the event of neglect or misuse). There is also a considerable small-business private sector. The Draka economy is on the gold standard, with the basic unit of currency being the Auric. In the third novel, with gold becoming plentiful due to imports from space, the Draka switch to the Auric reflecting a basket of commodities.|$|E
25|$|With the {{emergence}} of the Republicans as the nation's first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out. Although much of the West– the focal point of sectional tensions– was unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the <b>slave</b> <b>system</b> had been buttressed to an extent by the Democratic Party, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation's territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. But Democrats suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; Abraham Lincoln's election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.|$|E

Thus, although a major slaveholder, he opposed the <b>slave</b> <b>system</b> in Virginia. He believed that slave importation, together with the natural population increase, would result in a huge future slave population in Virginia; a system of leased lands, though not as profitable as slave labor, would have [...] "little Trouble & Risque [...] ".|$|E

Hay despised President Jackson and Jacksonian democracy, which he deemed corrupt and responsible for {{the continuation of the}} <b>slave</b> <b>system</b> that Hay saw overthrown at huge cost in the American Civil War. [...] He feared a return to values he deemed anticapitalist, and made the Bread-winners [...] "the laziest and most incapable workmen in town", whose ideals are pre-industrialist and foreign in origin. Hay saw no excuse for violence; as {{the will of the people}} could be expressed through the ballot, the remedy for any grievances was the next election. According to Gale, Hay [...] "never loses an opportunity to demean the Irish"—they are depicted as talkative and easily led (Offitt writes for the Irish Harp), and the reader is told that [...] "there was not an Irish laborer in the city but knew his way to his ward club as well as to mass".|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, between 1540 and 1555, Tahmasp {{conducted}} {{a series of}} invasions of the Caucasus region which provided battle experience for his soldiers, as well as leading to the capture of large numbers of Christian Circassian and Georgian slaves (30,000 just in these four raids). These slaves would form the basis of an Safavid military <b>slave</b> <b>system.</b> [...] These slaves would serve a similar role in their formation, implementation and use to the janissaries of the neighbouring Ottoman Empire. [...] Their arrival in such large numbers {{led to the formation of}} a new grouping in Iranian society solely composed of ethnic Caucasians. Although the first slave soldiers would not be organized until Abbas' reign, during Tahmasp's time Caucasians would already become important members of the royal household, the harem and in the civil and military administration.|$|E
2500|$|However, as the {{abolitionist}} movement's agitation {{increased and}} the area developed for plantations expanded, apologies for slavery became more faint in the South. Leaders then described slavery as a beneficial scheme of labor control. John C.

Calhoun supported his view with the following reasoning: in every civilized society one portion of the community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the arts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than the free laborers of Europe; and under the <b>slave</b> <b>system</b> conflicts between capital and labor are avoided.
