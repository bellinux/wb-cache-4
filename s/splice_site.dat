50|$|Due to the {{sensitive}} location of <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> mutations in the acceptor or donor areas of <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> can become detrimental {{to a human}} individual. In fact, {{many different types of}} diseases stem from anomalies within the <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{identifying}} <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> {{consists of two}} sub-problems: finding their boundaries, and characterizing their sequence markers. Other splicing elements [...] -including, enhancers and silencers [...] -that occur in the intronic and exonic regions {{play an important role}} in splicing activity. Existing methods for detecting splicing elements are limited to finding either <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> or enhancers and silencers, even though these elements are well-known to co-occur. We introduce SeeSite, an efficient and accurate tool for detecting <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> and their complementary exon splicing enhancers (ESEs). SeeSite has three stages: graph construction, finding dense subgraphs, and recovering <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> and ESEs along with their consensus. The third step involves solving Consensus Sequence with Outliers, an NP-complete string clustering problem. We prove that our algorithm for this problem outputs near-optimal solutions in polynomial time. Using SeeSite we demonstrate that ESEs are preferentially associated with weaker <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> and <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> of a certain canonical form co-occur with specific ESEs...|$|R

25|$|RNA {{mediated}} cleavage and ligation {{is found}} in group 1 and group 2 self-splicing RNAs. VS RNA contains many conserved sequence characteristics to group 1 introns. However VS ribozyme <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> is different from group 1 intron <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> and VR ribozyme self-cleaving site is outside of {{the core of the}} group 1 intron. In the cleavage reaction VS ribozyme produce 2’,3’ -cyclic phosphate and the group 1 introns produce 3’-hydroxyl. Functional similarity with group 1 introns and then mechanistically being different from the introns support this hypothesis that VS ribozyme is a chimera formed by insertion of a novel catalytic RNA into group 1 introns.|$|E
25|$|Alignment {{of primary}} {{transcript}} mRNA sequences derived from eukaryotes to a reference genome requires specialised handling of intron sequences, which are absent from mature mRNA. Short read aligners perform an additional round of alignments {{specifically designed to}} identify splice junctions, informed by canonical <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> sequences and known intron <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> information. Identification of intron splice junctions prevents reads being misaligned across splice junctions or erroneously discarded, allowing more reads to be aligned to the reference genome and improving the accuracy of gene expression estimates. Since gene regulation may occur at the mRNA isoform level, splice-aware alignments also permit detection of isoform abundance changes {{that would otherwise be}} lost in a bulked analysis.|$|E

50|$|The {{secondary}} {{structure of the}} HAC1/XBP1 intron is very well conserved, and consists of two hairpins (H2 and H3) around the <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> and an extended hairpin (H1) that brings the <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> together (see figure). The sequence of the intron is well conserved only around the <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> Non-canonical <b>splicing</b> motifs CNG'CNG in the loop region of H2 and H3 hairpins are conserved.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntrons are {{flanked by}} a {{partially}} conserved coding sequence that forms the immediate exon junction sequence following intron removal from pre-mRNA. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that these sequences have been targeted by numerous intron insertions during evolution, but {{little is known about}} this process. Here, we test the prediction that exon junction sequences were functional <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> that existed in the coding sequence of genes prior to the insertion of introns. To do this, we experimentally identified nine cryptic <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> within the coding sequence of actin genes from humans, Arabidopsis, and Physarum by inactivating their normal intron <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> We found that seven of these cryptic <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> correspond exactly to the positions of exon junctions in actin genes from other species. Because actin genes are highly conserved, we could conclude that at least seven actin introns are flanked by cryptic <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> and from the phylogenetic evidence, we could also conclude that actin introns were inserted into these cryptic <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> during evolution. Furthermore, our results indicate that these insertion events were dependent upon the splicing machinery. Because most introns are flanked by similar sequences, our results are likely to be of general relevance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAdenovirus type 2 RNA {{splicing}} {{events were}} quantitatively mapped by using deep cDNA sequencing. The {{majority of the}} previously identified <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> were detected. The lack of complete consistency between the present and previous results is because of some sites which were incorrectly mapped in previous studies, such as the <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> for pVII, pVIII and E 3 - 11. 6 K. Several previously predicted <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> such as that for E 3 - 14. 5 K and E 4 ORF 3 / 4 were not detected. In addition, several new <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> were identified. The novel RNAs may code for hitherto undetected proteins or alternatively spliced mRNAs for known proteins. The open reading frames downstream of two novel <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> located in the major late transcription unit region, were shown to be highly conserved. Another interesting possibility {{is that some of}} them are non-coding RNAs. Finally, the adenovirus mRNA polyadenylation sites were accurately mapped and in some cases shown to be heterogeneous...|$|R
25|$|Missense, {{nonsense}} and <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> mutations of the UBR1 gene in {{both parents}} have been found with JBS, confirming the homozygous nature of the JBS phenotype. Variability of the phenotype, associated with residual ubiquitin ligase activity in some patients, has also been attributed to hypomorphic mutations occasionally found in either of the carrier parents. The UBR1 gene is located on human chromosome 15.|$|E
25|$|Insertions add {{one or more}} extra {{nucleotides}} {{into the}} DNA. They are usually caused by transposable elements, or errors during replication of repeating elements. Insertions in the coding region of a gene may alter splicing of the mRNA (<b>splice</b> <b>site</b> mutation), or cause {{a shift in the}} reading frame (frameshift), both of which can significantly alter the gene product. Insertions can be reversed by excision of the transposable element.|$|E
25|$|HGPS {{is caused}} by {{sporadic}} mutations (not inherited from parent) in the LMNA gene, which encodes for lamin A. Specifically, most HGPS are caused by a dominant, de novo, point mutation p.G608G (GGC > GGT). This mutation causes a <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> within exon 11 of the pre-mRNA to come into action, leading to the last 150 base pairs of that exon, and consequently, the 50 amino acids near the C-terminus, being deleted. This results in a truncated lamin A precursor (a.k.a. progerin or LaminAΔ50).|$|E

40|$|Auxiliary {{splicing}} signals play a {{major role}} in the regulation of constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing, but their relative importance in selection of mutation-induced cryptic or de novo <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> is poorly understood. Here, we show that exonic sequences between authentic and aberrant <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> that were activated by splice-site mutations in human disease genes have lower frequencies of splicing enhancers and higher frequencies of splicing silencers than average exons. Conversely, sequences between authentic and intronic aberrant <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> have more enhancers and less silencers than average introns. Exons that were skipped as a result of splice-site mutations were smaller, had lower SF 2 /ASF motif scores, a decreased availability of decoy <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> and a higher density of silencers than exons in which splice-site mutation activated cryptic <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> These four variables were the strongest predictors of the two aberrant splicing events in a logistic regression model. Elimination or weakening of predicted silencers in two reporters consistently promoted use of intron-proximal <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> if these elements were maintained at their original positions, with their modular combinations producing expected modification of splicing. Together, these results show the existence of a gradient in exon and intron definition at the level of pre-mRNA splicing and provide a basis for the development of computational tools that predict aberrant splicing outcomes...|$|R

25|$|Mutations causing {{progeria}} are defective in splicing LMNA mRNA, therefore producing abnormal lamin A protein, {{also known}} as progerin. The mutations activate a cryptic <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> within exon 11 of the gene, thereby causing the deletion of the processing site on prelamin A. This results in an accumulation of progerin that is unable to mature into lamin A, leading to misshapen nuclei. Missplicing also leads to the complete or partial loss of exon 11 and results in a truncated prelamin A protein in the neonatal lethal tight skin contracture syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Taxicab {{geometry}} {{can be used}} {{to assess}} the differences in discrete frequency distributions. For example, in RNA splicing positional distributions of hexamers, which plot the probability of each hexamer appearing at each given nucleotide near a <b>splice</b> <b>site,</b> can be compared with L1-distance. Each position distribution can be represented as a vector where each entry represents the likelihood of the hexamer starting at a certain nucleotide. A large L1-distance between the two vectors indicates {{a significant difference in the}} nature of the distributions while a small distance denotes similarly shaped distributions. This is equivalent to measuring the area between the two distribution curves because the area of each segment is the absolute difference between the two curves' likelihoods at that point. When summed together for all segments, it provides the same measure as L1-distance.|$|E

40|$|A {{clean data}} set of {{verified}} <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> from Homo sapiens are reported {{as well as}} the standards used for the clean-up procedure. The sites were validated by: (i) standard cleaning procedures such as requiring consistency in the annotation of the gene structural elements, completeness of the coding regions and elimination of redundant sequences; (ii) clustering by decision trees coupled with analysis of ClustalW alignments of the translated protein sequence with homologous proteins from SWISS-PROT; (iii) matching against human EST sequences. The sites are categorised as: (i) donor sites, a set of 619 EST-confirmed donor sites, for which 138 are either the sites or the regions around the sites involved in alternative splice events; (ii) acceptor sites, a set of 623 ESTconfirmed acceptor sites, for which 144 are either the sites or the regions around the sites are involved in alternative splice events; (iii) genuine <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> a set of 392 <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> wherein both the donor and acceptor sites had EST confirmation and were not involved in any alternative splicing; (iv) alternative <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> a set of 209 <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> wherein both the donor and acceptor sites had EST confirmation and the sites or the regions around them were involved in alternative splicing. A set of nucleotide regions {{that can be used to}} generate a control set of false <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> that have a high confidence of being nonfunctional are also reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of computational tools that can predict human <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> are reviewed using a test set of EST-confirmed <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> The programs (namely HMMgene, NetGene 2, HSPL, NNSPLICE, SpliceView and GeneID- 3) differ {{from one another}} in the degree of discriminatory information used for prediction. The results indicate that, as expected, HMMgene and NetGene 2 (which use global as well as local coding information and splice signals) followed by HSPL (which uses local coding information and splice signals) performed better than the other three programs (which use only splice signals). For the former three programs, one in every three false positive <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> was predicted in the vicinity of true <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> while only one in every 12 was expected to occur in such a region by chance. The persistence of this observation for programs (namely FEXH, GRAIL 2, MZEF, GeneID- 3, HMMgene and GENSCAN) that can predict all the potential exons (including optimal and sub-optimal) was assessed. In a high proportion (> 50 %) of the partially correct predicted exons, the incorrect exon ends were located {{in the vicinity of the}} real <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> Analysis of the distribution of proximal false positives indicated that the splice signals used by the algorithms are not strong enough to discriminate particularly those false predictions that occur within 25 nt around the real sites. It is therefore suggested that specialised statistics that can discriminate real <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> from proximal false positives be incorporated in gene prediction programs...|$|R

Considering the enormousness of DNA sequences, the computing speed is an important issue. In this paper, we propose to use a probabilistic kernel-based method to predict DNA <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> which project the sequence data into a new probabilistic feature space. We then use Support Vector Machines to recognize the true <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> While the performance is comparable to the re-sults obtained with polynomial kernels, the computation is performed much faster. ...|$|R

500|$|Early {{embryonal}} lethality, {{also known}} as early embryonic death or a non-viable embryo, may occur when the embryo possesses two dominant white alleles, or have the homozygous genotype. The {{reason for this is}} that many mutations for W are caused by nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations or DNA deletions, which, if homozygous, would make it impossible to produce a functional KIT protein. [...] However, it is possible that homozygous embryos from alleles of missense and <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> mutations might be viable because they have less effect on gene function. A 2013 study also unearthed horses that were compound W5/W20 heterozygotes, almost completely white, essentially with greater depigmentation than could be accounted for by either allele alone.|$|E

40|$|Identification of <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> plays a {{key role}} in {{annotation}} of genes and hence, the improvement of computational prediction of <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> with high accuracy has great significance. In this article, we first quantitatively determined the length of window and the number and position of the consensus bases by a Chi-square test, and then extracted the sequence multi-scale component (MSC) features and the position (Pos) and adjacent positions relationship (APR) features of consensus sites. Then we constructed a novel classification model using SVM with above features and applied it to the HS³D dataset. Compared with the results in current literatures, our method produces a great improvement in the 10 -fold cross validation accuracies for training sets with true and spurious <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> of both equal and different-proportions. This method was also applied to the NN 269 dataset for further evaluation and independent test.

The strong correlation permitted us to determine extensive consensus sequences at the donor and acceptor sites of longer introns. These sequences were further refined and extended by examining the information in regions around <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> that only partially matched the consensus. The correlation between length and information provided the basis for determining alternative consensus arrangements associated with shorter introns, as well as general base-composition preferences that likely promote spliceosome function. We also observed a correlation between information near <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> and the lengths of nonadjacent introns, indicating that there are long-range effects spanning multiple introns.

Mechanisms of alternative splicing are highly variable, and new examples are constantly being found, particularly {{through the use of}} high-throughput techniques.

40|$|DNA in {{the nucleus}} of all eukaryotes is {{transcribed}} into mRNA where it is then translated into proteins. The DNA which is transcribed into mRNA is composed of coding and non-coding regions called exons and introns, respectively. It undergoes a post-trancriptional process called splicing where the introns or the non-coding regions are removed from the pre-mRNA to give the mature mRNA. Splicing of pre-mRNAs at 5 ́ and 3 ˊ ends is a crucial step in the gene expression pathway. The mis-splicing by the spliceosome at different sites known as cryptic <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> is caused by mutations which will affect the primary mRNA product formed and eventually the protein that is created. This leads to devastating genetic diseases. Consequently it is of extreme importance to understand the reason behind the mis-splicing caused by the mutation and why particular <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> known as cryptic <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> are chosen instead. This work aims to answer this central question. It aims to understand why known cryptic <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> are selected over authentic <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> and whether we can detect and predict putative cryptic <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> in the human genome. This project utilizes two different probabilistic models, namely position weight matrices and hidden Markov models, to answer this question. Position weight matrix is a widely used computational method in bioinformatics and is used to represent motifs in biological sequences. Hidden Markov Model is a statistical method of modeling {{a system that has}} several unobserved or hidden states. It is an effective method for representing the probability distribution over several observable sequences.
