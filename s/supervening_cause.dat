An analysis of accident reports reveals categories of <b>supervening</b> <b>causes</b> of accidents {{which can be}} directly linked {{to the concept of}} generic competencies (information management, communication and coordination, problem solving, and effect control). These findings strongly suggest adding the human element as another safety-constituting pillar to the concept of ship safety next to technology and regulation. We argue that the human element has unique abilities in dealing with critical and highly dynamic situations which can contribute to the system's recovery from non-routine or critical situations.

Whereas the ‘de novo’ onsetof headache in a patient surely constitutes a reasonfor increased attention by the physician, difficulties occur when a new pathology arises in a patient already diagnosed as suffering from a primary form. This represents a risk in disregarding the <b>supervening</b> secondary <b>cause,</b> especially if the secondary headache remains quite similar in its clinical manifestation to the previous primary one.

In Peters, Flamman and Company v Kokstad Municipality, for example, a company was wound up during World War I by the Smuts government, which had declared its German owners to be enemies of state. In consequence, the company was unable any longer to carry out its contractual obligations. Kokstad Municipality sued for breach of contract, but the judge determined that, because of the supervening circumstances, performance was objectively impossible (casus fortuitus); the contract should therefore be terminated.|$|R
60|$|Finally, {{even when}} the {{derivative}} uniformity is itself a law of causation (resulting from the combination of several causes), it is not altogether independent of collocations. If a <b>cause</b> <b>supervenes,</b> capable of wholly or partially counteracting the effect of {{any one of the}} conjoined causes, the effect will no longer conform to the derivative law. While, therefore, each ultimate law is only liable to frustration from one set of counteracting causes, the derivative law is liable to it from several. Now, the possibility of the occurrence of counteracting causes which do not arise from any of the conditions involved in the law itself depends on the original collocations.|$|R

More than 215 cases of NSF have subse-quently {{been described in}} the NFD/NSF registry, with increas-ing numbers of cases being reported (2). NSF is a fibrosing disorder that involves predominantly the skin but also affects systemic organs such as the liver, heart, lungs, diaphragm, and skeletal muscle (3).

60|$|In {{certain cases}} the {{successive}} steps of variation might <b>supervene,</b> from <b>causes</b> {{of which we}} are wholly ignorant, at a very early period of life, or each step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which it first appeared. In either case (as with the short-faced tumbler) the young or embryo would closely resemble the mature parent-form. We have seen that this is the rule of development in certain whole groups of animals, as with cuttle-fish and spiders, and with a few members of the great class of insects, as with Aphis. With respect to the final cause of the young in these cases not undergoing any metamorphosis, or closely resembling their parents from their earliest age, we can see that this would result from the two following contingencies: firstly, from the young, during a course of modification carried on for many generations, having to provide for their own wants at a very early stage {448} of development, and secondly, from their following exactly the same habits of life with their parents; for in this case, it would be indispensable for the existence of the species, that the child should be modified {{at a very early age}} in the same manner with its parents, in accordance with their similar habits. Some further explanation, however, of the embryo not undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite. If, on the other hand, it profited the young to follow habits of life in any degree different from those of their parent, and consequently to be constructed in a slightly different manner, then, on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, the active young or larvæ might easily be rendered by natural selection different to any conceivable extent from their parents. Such differences might, also, become correlated with successive stages of development; so that the larvæ, in the first stage, might differ greatly from the larvæ in the second stage, as we have seen to be the case with cirripedes. The adult might become fitted for sites or habits, in which organs of locomotion or of the senses, &c., would be useless; and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be retrograde.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{argues that}} a {{functional}} reduction of ordinary psychology to neuropsychology is possible by means of constructing fine-grained functional, mental sub-types that are coextensive with neuropsychological types. We establish this claim by means of considering as examples the cases of the disconnection syndrome and schizophrenia. We {{point out that the}} result is a conservative reduction, vindicating the scientific quality of the mental types of ordinary psychology by systematically linking them with neuroscience. That procedure of conservative reduction by means of functional sub-types is in principle repeatable down to molecular neuroscience. 1. Functional reduction There are good arguments for taking the mind to be identical with the brain. In other words, any mental property token as described by psychology is identical with some configuration of neurobiological property tokens that can in principle be identified and described by a neuroscientific theory. It is common ground that (1) the mental strongly supervenes on the physical, that (2) every physical effect has a complete physical cause insofar as it has a cause at all and that (3) mental property tokens are causally efficacious. If one takes mental tokens not to be identical with configurations of neurobiological tokens, which are a sort of physical tokens, then one runs into {{what is known as the}} causal exclusion problem: assuming that a mental property token m 1 causes another mental property token m 2 (3), m 1 can bring about this mental change only by bringing about a physical change as well (1), that is, by having a physical effect p 2 that is sufficient as a supervenience basis for m 2 (given suitable background conditions).

WBAN communication with its various applications will enable physician to continuously monitor their patients, patients to move freely and sportiness to follow up their performance improvement. In a daily life situation, coexistence between a considerable numbers of WBAN can occurred frequently. The coexistence environments of wireless BAN systems can be a home, a small office, an elevator, a waiting room inside a hospital, etc. These WBAN systems most probably will belong to different vendors and various configurations. Moreover, inside the same BAN, maybe there exist various wireless devices serving different applications to meet different demands for customers. These devices coexist in very near vicinity and probably sharing the same frequency band according to the mechanism used for every device. The interference problem between these devices is a serious issue. The conflict <b>supervene</b> <b>cause</b> significant degradation {{to the performance of}} the coexistence systems, and decreases its ability of coexistence. Coexistence ability means the ability to perform the system’s functions in an environment where multiple systems sharing the same resources and {{may or may not be}} using the same system designs. In order to mitigate Multi User Interference (MUI) occurred due to the coexistence, we utilize one of the popular techniques proposed for MUI under UWB technology which is Direct Sequence UWB (DS-UWB). For each device in this system, a random unique spreading code is applied to the transmitted signal to produce a sequence of pulses to provide both the high performance capabilities as well as the low power and low production cost which is required for high-data-rate multimedia applications. Considering the problem of variety of WBAN devices, we propose to vary the spreading code lengths according to the number of active users in the system. This can provide mitigation to Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) as well as MUI. We analyze, mathematically and by simulation, the performance of this system with a scenario contains two different applications’ sensors which require different spreading code length usage. Next, considering that the overlapping occurred between these codes can be classified into full overlapping or partial overlapping, we search for the optimal pair of spreading codes for these two sensors aiming to satisfy the different requirements for its applications. To this end, we introduce a novel ratio factor called overlapping factor (OVF) between the spreading sequence lengths to identify the optimal value of OVF which satisfy the requirements. We conclude that, to achieve the two applications requirements, OVF should range between 0. 05 and 0. 5. To introduce more realization to the MUI problem, two optional proposal approaches in the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers combined with our core proposal considering the variable processing gain. For PHY layer, we introduce to combine Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology and UWB with the core proposal variable processing gain scheme. On MIMO side, we use Space Time Spreading (STS) scheme to transmit two data bits in two time slots without any need for extra transmission power or feedback information at the transmitter side. Adaptively changing the spreading sequence used for STS help to carry out the system needs. Adaptive change in spreading sequence follows the number of active users in the system and the priority the sensor obtain to transmit its data. Results show that using STS can mitigate the effect of channel fading caused due to its cyclostationary nature as well as more efficient mitigation to the MUI effect which reflected as an improvement in system overall performance in terms of BER. On the MAC layer, a detailed study of the newly emerged IEEE 802. 15. 6 protocol which has been established to standardize the communication of the WBAN devices. It defines a three Medium Access Control (MAC) layers, namely, Scheduled access and scheduled-polling access, Improvised access and unscheduled access, and Random access. These three MAC schemes work in support of three PHY layers, i. e., Narrowband (NB), Ultra wideband (UWB), and Human Body Communications (HBC) layers. As a step toward cross-layer design that satisfactorily enhances the network performance, it is essential to consider the interaction among the PHY and MAC layers. Physical layer with its key parameter in our scenario which is the spreading code length has a direct impact on multiple accesses of WBAN devices through affecting the interference at receivers and susceptibility to it. Local adaptation of spreading code length to achieve a target BER restraints the MAC decision by altering the feasible transmission schedules and payload transmission rates. In this interaction, we propose an adaptive spreading slotted-Aloha scheme for IEEE 802. 15. 6 protocol. We evaluated the proposal scheme’s performance analytically by Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) model. Numerical simulations derived an analysis of a WBAN system using adaptive DS-UWB as its PHY layer in addition to slotted Aloha random access mechanism as our MAC layer. We take into account the priorities of the active medical and non-medical sensors. We closely follow IEEE 802. 15. 6 specifications under beacon mode with superframes under non-saturation conditions. Results for AWGN, IEEE CM 3 for WBAN and Rician channel models shows that using a short sequence code length for entertainment sensors provide a poor throughput under IEEE 802. 15. 6. While having same sequence length or longer for medical sensors provide a better performance in throughput with the expansion of time slot length. In the meantime, Medical sensors’ delay reduces with the increase in slot length in case of halving the entertainment spreading sequence length or doubling the medical spreading sequence length. While transmitting with equal spreading code length for both medical and entertainment sensors leads to maintaining very close delay with a limited improvement for medical sensors...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} mental causation, {{at least in}} one of its most basic forms, is how to {{reconcile}} two plausible but potentially incompatible intuitions. The first intuition is that the mind makes a difference in the world. For example, I am writing this paragraph for certain reasons, and before long I will stop to eat something because of certain desires for food. Seemingly, these reasons and desires play a role in what happens. The second intuition is that the physical world is causally complete, so everything that happens {{is the result of the}} movement of physical particles. For example, the neural turbulence in my head seems to be the actual cause of my hands fluttering across the keyboard in certain ways, whilst certain muscle contractions in my arms cause the food to enter my mouth. What room is there for the mind to play a causal role when everything seems to happen because of the movement of physical particles? For some time reductive physicalism was the prevailing solution to the problem of mental causation (Place, 1956; Feigl, 1958; Smart, 1959). Reductive physicalism posits a reductive identity of the mental to the physical. In so doing, it endorses physical causal completeness, but achieves mental causation as well, since the mental is identical with the causally efficacious physical. In the nineteen seventies, nonreductive physicalism replaced reductive physicalism as the predominant solution to the problem of mental causation in the nineteen seventies. Nonreductive physicalism solves the problem of mental causation by agreeing that the physical is causally complete, but achieves mental causation as well by supposing that the mental supervenes upon the physical, and thus inherits the causal power of the physical. In recent years this nonreductive consensus has been threatened. This is partially due to an argument that has been distilled from Jaegwon Kim’s principle of causal/explanatory exclusion. One part of this compound principle is the principle of causal exclusion, which states that there can be no more than a single sufficient cause for any given event (Kim, 2005, p. 42). This principle of causal exclusion creates the following problem: the nonreductive physicalist endorses the causal completeness of the physical, and so she agrees that there is a sufficient physical cause for any given event. The nonreductive physicalist also avoids making a reductive identity between the mental and the physical, so she agrees that the mental is distinct from the physical. Therefore, if a given event has a complete physical cause, and the mental cause is distinct from this complete physical <b>cause,</b> then this <b>supervening</b> mental <b>cause</b> must be excluded. The physical cause does all of the work, so there is no work left over for the mental cause. In this dissertation I consider and respond to Jaegwon Kim’s principle of causal/explanatory exclusion. I conclude that the most promising response to the problem generated from causal exclusion is to endorse what I call structuralism. Structuralism construes mental states as mereological structures, or configurations, of parts. Macro structure plays a role in determining which micro properties its parts will and will not instantiate, so there is a genuine role for the mental to play. The micro properties that are instantiated, however, do all of the causal work, so causal completeness is secured as well. This is a nonreductive position, since the mereological structure of the parts is not identical with the parts themselves. This model avoids the causal exclusion problem by noting that mereological relations are non-causal determinative relations, so mental states can play an important determinative role without contributing any causal power beyond what the causally sufficient micro properties of the parts contribute. This solution to the problem of causal exclusion affords a solution to the parallel problem generated from the principle of explanatory exclusion as well. The principle of explanatory exclusion states that “there can be no more than a single complete and independent explanation for any one event” (Kim, 1988, p. 233). I resolve this difficulty by adopting a nuanced form of what is called the dual-explananda reply. Since the above reasoning suggests that mental states are distinct from physical events, we can conclude that mental explanations and physiological explanations do not refer to the same thing, so there is no exclusion pressure between the two explanations...|$|R
60|$|Between the two {{examples}} {{which we have}} here given, {{there is a difference}} worth pointing out. In the former (in which the phenomenon produced is a substance, and not a motion of a substance), since the rust remains forever and unaltered unless some new <b>cause</b> <b>supervenes,</b> we may speak of the contact of air a hundred years ago as even the proximate cause of the rust which has existed from that time until now. But when the effect is motion, which is itself a change, we must use a different language. The permanency of the effect is now only the permanency of a series of changes. The second foot, or inch, or mile of motion is not the mere prolonged duration of the first foot, or inch, or mile, but another fact which succeeds, and which may in some respects be very unlike the former, since it carries the body through a different region of space. Now, the original projectile force which set the body moving is the remote cause of all its motion, however long continued, but the proximate cause of no motion except that which took place at the first instant. The motion at any subsequent instant is proximately caused by the motion which took place at the instant preceding. It is on that, and not on the original moving cause, that the motion at any given moment depends. For, suppose that the body passes through some resisting medium, which partially counteracts the effect of the original impulse, and retards the motion; this counteraction (it need scarcely here be repeated) is as strict an example of obedience to the law of the impulse, as if the body had gone on moving with its original velocity; but the motion which results is different, being now a compound of the effects of two causes acting in contrary directions, instead of the single effect of one cause. Now, what cause does the body obey in its subsequent motion? The original cause of motion, or the actual motion at the preceding instant? The latter; for when the object issues from the resisting medium, it continues moving, not with its original, but with its retarded velocity. The motion having once been diminished, all that which follows is diminished. The effect changes, because the cause which it really obeys, the proximate cause, the real cause in fact, has changed. This principle is recognized by mathematicians when they enumerate among the causes by which the motion of a body is at any instant determined the force generated by the previous motion; an expression which would be absurd if taken to imply that this “force” was an intermediate link between the cause and the effect, but which really means only the previous motion itself, considered as a cause of further motion. We must, therefore, if we would speak with perfect precision, consider each link in the succession of motions as the effect of the link preceding it. But if, for the convenience of discourse, we speak of the whole series as one effect, it must be as an effect produced by the original impelling force; a permanent effect produced by an instantaneous cause, and possessing the property of self-perpetuation.|$|R
