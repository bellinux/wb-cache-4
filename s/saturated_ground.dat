5|$|Tropical Storm Gert struck {{just south}} of where Category 3 Hurricane Emily had struck, and where Tropical Storm Bret hit in late June. As a result, there were {{concerns}} that serious flooding and mudslides would result due to <b>saturated</b> <b>ground.</b> As a precaution, about 1,000people were evacuated from low-lying residences and businesses near the towns of Naranjos Amatlán and Tamiahua in Veracruz, and about 6,000 throughout Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|In Virginia, Allison {{produced}} light rainfall, {{with the}} southeastern and south-central {{portions of the}} state experiencing over 3inches (76mm). A tree in a <b>saturated</b> <b>ground</b> fell over and killed one person. Allison also produced one tornado in the state. Washington, D.C. experienced moderate rainfall from the storm, totaling to 2.59inches (66mm) in Georgetown. In Maryland, rainfall from Tropical Depression Allison totaled to 7.5inches (190mm) in Denton, closing eleven roads and causing washouts on 41 others. The Maryland Eastern Shore experienced only minor rainfall from one to two inches (25 to 50mm). Damage was light, and no deaths were reported. In Delaware, the storm produced moderate rainfall, peaking at 4.2inches (106mm) in Greenwood. No damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Floyd in New York {{included}} two deaths {{and millions of}} dollars in damage. Hurricane Floyd, once a large and powerful Category 4 hurricane, made landfall in North Carolina and moved northward along the East Coast, making landfall on Long Island as a tropical storm. The threat of the hurricane prompted schools in New York City to close {{for the first time since}} 1996, and 20 shelters were opened. Floyd produced flooding rainfall and gusty winds throughout the state, from the southern Hudson Valley to the Lake Champlain area. The flood waters damaged multiple roads and forced residents to evacuate from certain locations. Strong winds left as many as 100,000 people without power and brought down a high number of trees due to the <b>saturated</b> <b>ground.</b> In the aftermath of the storm, 15 counties in eastern New York were declared eligible for state or federal assistance.|$|E
500|$|August 18, 1955 [...] As Tropical Storm Diane {{begins its}} {{turn to the}} east-northeast over Virginia, {{associated}} heavy rains, combined with <b>saturated</b> <b>grounds</b> from Connie just days before, cause flooding in central parts of the state, especially along the Potomac River.|$|R
2500|$|The record {{snowfall}} {{may have}} been a contributing factor for a deadly mudslide in the town of Saint-Jean-Vianney in May 1971 when heavy rains combined with already <b>saturated</b> <b>grounds</b> because of heavy melting snow [...] formed a large sinkhole of about 600meters wide and 30meters deep. 31people were killed by the mudslide.|$|R
5|$|Prior to Odette's {{predicted}} arrival, the Dominican Republic government {{issued for}} {{the evacuation of}} more than 10,000people, mostly from those living near rivers. At least 2,000 shelters were set up, capable of housing up to 800,000people. In addition, the government mobilized the army to force those unwilling to leave from their homes. Such precautions were taken due to already <b>saturated</b> <b>grounds</b> from heavy rainfall three weeks prior.|$|R
5|$|The strong winds, {{combined}} with <b>saturated</b> <b>ground</b> from the rainfall, brought down trees in widespread {{areas of the}} Hudson Valley and Capital District. Many of the trees would not have otherwise fallen in drier conditions. Some of the downed trees fell on structures. In a narrow swath in the Wolf Pond Valley of Warren County, where wind gusts are estimated to have reached , hundreds of trees were blown down. At the storm's worst, power outages affected over 100,000 people region-wide, and some individuals remained without power for a week. At the Albany International Airport, the storm forced the cancellation of flights, and throughout the region schools were closed. Several boats sustained damage along the shore of Lake Champlain. Throughout Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and Westchester counties, initial cost estimates were $14.6 million, although that figure represents {{only a portion of}} the actual monetary damage. The storm also caused about $2 million in property damage in Essex County.|$|E
25|$|The heavy {{rainfall}} and resulting <b>saturated</b> <b>ground</b> provided conditions {{which led to}} a greater risk of landslides. On 27 December the British Geological Survey and Met Office gave a rare landslide warning for the southwest of England. December saw an amber warning situation resulting from <b>saturated</b> <b>ground</b> conditions, with forecasts of more {{heavy rainfall}} and multiple reports of slope instability resulting in likely disruption to infrastructure and people.|$|E
25|$|During the Autumn {{the most}} intense September low since 1981 brought {{widespread}} flooding and wind damage to the UK. Widespread flooding occurred again in November, December and January 2013, as more heavy rains overwhelmed the <b>saturated</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of residents in the northern Philippines took shelter from the storm as there was a high likelihood over severe flooding due to already <b>saturated</b> <b>grounds.</b> Schools throughout the area were canceled for several days due to the storm. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) placed Batanes under storm signal 2 while the Babuyan Islands were under storm signal 1.|$|R

25|$|Flooding {{may occur}} as an {{overflow}} {{of water from}} water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on <b>saturated</b> <b>ground</b> in an areal flood. While {{the size of a}} lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals.|$|E
25|$|England and Wales saw the (provisionally) second wettest week in {{the last}} 50 years between 20–26 November, behind only a period October–November 2000. 26 November saw a {{landslip}} on Aelfelda Terrace, Whitby, after <b>saturated</b> <b>ground</b> led to failure of the retaining wall. Five terraced houses were later demolished following fears of their collapse, after being condemned. Around 500 houses were flooded, RNLI lifeboats evacuated residents and an elderly woman {{was found dead in}} her own property after the River Elwy swelled to 6ft above its normal level in the town of St Asaph in North Wales on 27 November. The month saw some of the worst floods of the year {{in many areas of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|These events {{damaged the}} summer tourist custom to the railway, the towns served, {{and the area}} as a whole. A {{spokesman}} announced on 22 June that the line was expected to reopen between Bewdley and Arley {{by the end of}} July and the section between Bridgnorth and Hampton Loade to be up and running by the end of August; however it became apparent in early July 2007 that these reopenings would be delayed by as much as a month, later extended to up to three months. On 19 July, another torrential storm caused further wreckage in at least 45 separate locations as rain fell on the already <b>saturated</b> <b>ground,</b> and at least ten of these spots damage was so serious major engineering work was required before reconstruction could get under way. It was also said later that the crucial link between Hampton Loade and Arley, including Highley station and the new Engine House museum, would probably not open until as late as Spring 2008.|$|E
40|$|The equations, {{determining}} temporal {{behavior of}} coupled electronic and phonon subsystems in the electromagnetic field, are analyzed. The steady state solution describing saturation {{of the three}} level in such a system is achieved. It is shown that laser-like self-excitation of phonons cannot be obtained though essential phonon enhancement may be gained provided certain conditions are fulfilled. Field induced transparency is predicted between first two levels when the field <b>saturates</b> <b>ground</b> and highest levels, and the concentration of ions is high...|$|R

5|$|Ahead of the storm, oil {{and mining}} {{operations}} in threatened regions were temporarily shut down. Already {{suffering from the}} impacts of Cyclones Clare and Daryl, residents were warned about the likelihood of flooding due to the already <b>saturated</b> <b>grounds.</b> The Bureau of Meteorology also issued tropical cyclone warnings {{for most of the}} Pilbara coastline on 28 February. The same day, the Fire and Emergency Services of Australia issued a Yellow Alert for Point Samson, Roebourne, Wickham, Dampier, Karratha, and Mardie. Residents in these areas were advised to evacuate if necessary and ensure that all cyclone preparations had been completed. Shelters were also opened for residents who sought need for one. Schools throughout the Pilbara region were also closed for several days {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|R
500|$|Dennis had {{moderate}} {{effects in}} the state, primarily from flooding.

Light to moderate wind gusts of [...] combined with <b>saturated</b> <b>ground</b> downed several trees, one of which fell into a house, killing a man near Atlanta. A man also died while working with utility crews to restore power. One tornado was reported, downing 200trees.|$|E
500|$|The intense winds {{brought down}} utility poles and {{hundreds}} of trees (likely exacerbated by <b>saturated</b> <b>ground</b> from record rainfall in the months prior), leaving [...] "barely a road" [...] passable. The storm razed several invasive species, with endemic trees proving more resilient. A composting facility received 1,200truckloads of plant debris per day after Fay and Gonzalo, up {{from an average of}} 100. Damage from the storms totaled around US$260,000on Bermuda National Trust properties, which include nature preserves and cemeteries. Similarly, the Bermuda Botanical Gardens and Arboretum were closed due to safety hazards resulting from extensive vegetation damage.|$|E
500|$|In Connecticut, {{the storm}} caused one casualty: a man drowned after boating in the swollen Quinnipiac River. The storm caused {{extensive}} flooding and serious damage. Wind gusts exceeding , {{combined with the}} <b>saturated</b> <b>ground,</b> brought down many trees and triggered severe power outages in the area. As Floyd tracked up the Connecticut River Valley towards Massachusetts, it dropped heavy precipitation. The heaviest rainfall occurred in a southwest–northeast orientated swath from northern New Jersey to southwestern Connecticut, including southeastern New York. At the Danbury Airport, [...] of rain was reported. Rainfall rates of [...] per hour occurred at Bethel and Danbury. Numerous rivers overflowed; for example, the Still River and its tributaries triggered severe flooding. The worst of the flooding—considered the worst in 40 years—took place at Danbury. Hundreds of homes, two car dealerships, several roads, and other structures were damaged there. At Greentree Motors, all 200 vehicles were declared a total loss. Parts of the city were submerged with [...] of water. However, throughout the state, roads were closed and basements were inundated. The flooding inflicted at least $1.3 million in monetary damage within Fairfield County. Portions of the state were declared a federal disaster area.|$|E

50|$|The first {{rainfall}} {{began to}} fall in Edinburgh at approximately 9:00 PM {{on the evening of}} June 6. The torrential rain would last until 12:00 PM on June 7. An unofficial rainfall total of 10.71 in was measured in Edinburgh. Official National Weather Service rainfall totals across Central Indiana during this period ranged from 3.09 in to 9.85 in. This water had no place to go as it struck the already <b>saturated</b> <b>grounds,</b> so runoff was extremely high. The Big Blue River and Sugar Creek began to rise rapidly. Runoff quickly flooded agricultural areas and much of this water made its way into several subdivisions in Edinburgh. Many homes were flooded with several feet of water. US 31, SR 252, and Interstate 65 were all flooded {{at the height of the}} flood, essentially cutting Edinburgh off from surrounding areas.|$|R
