5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began {{powering}} {{down some of}} the LM's systems to conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured Orion for their three-day stay on the lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon. The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after <b>surface</b> <b>exploration</b> had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, the third and final moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.|$|E
5|$|The Lunar Module (LM) was {{designed}} to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage {{was designed}} totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, {{each with its own}} engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and <b>surface</b> <b>exploration</b> equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. An Extended Lunar Module weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days. The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen by Thomas J. Kelly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Planetary rovers play a {{significant}} role in <b>surface</b> <b>explorations</b> on the Moon and/or Mars. However, because of wheel slippage, the wheels of planetary rovers can get stuck in loose soil, and the exploration mission may fail because of this situation. To avoid slippage and increase the wheels’ drawbar pull, the wheels of planetary rovers typically have parallel fins called lugs on their surface. In this study, we conducted experiments using two-wheeled testbeds in a sandbox to provide a quantitative confirmation of the influence of lugs on the traversability of planetary rovers. In this paper, we report the results of the experiments, and discuss the influence of lugs on the traversability of planetary rovers. I...|$|R
40|$|Martian sediments and {{sedimentary}} rocks, clastic and nonclastic, should {{represent a}} high priority target in any future return-sample mission. The discovery of such materials and their subsequent analysis in terrestrial laboratories, would greatly increase {{the understanding of the}} Martian paleoclimate. The formation of Martian clastic sedimentary rocks, under either present, low-pressure, xeric conditions or a postulated, high-pressure, hydric environment, depends upon the existence of a supply of particles, various cementing agents and depositional basins. A very high resolution (mm-cm range) photographic reconnaissance of these areas would produce a quantum jump in the understanding of Martian geological history. Sampling would be confined to more horizontal (recent) <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Exploration</b> techniques are suggested for various hypothetical Martian sedimentary rocks...|$|R

Each domain requires specific materials. Score ranges from 0 to 57, being 0 the worst rating.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{properties of the}} lunar regolith were originally inferred from remotely sensed data, first from the Earth and later from orbiting spacecraft. The Surveyor landings and the Apollo <b>surface</b> <b>explorations</b> produced a more concrete characterization of the macroscopic properties. In general, the upper regolith consists of a loosely consolidated layer centimeters thick underlain by a particulate but extremely compacted layer to depths of meters or tens of meters. The median particle size as determined by mechanical sieving in terrestrial laboratories is several tens of micrometers. However, the comminuting processes that form the layer produce particles in all sizes down to manometers. The smallest particles, having a high surface to volume ratio, tend to be electrostatically bound to larger particles and are quite difficult to separate mechanically in the laboratory. Particle size distributions determined from lunar soil samples often group particles smaller than 10 micrometers...|$|R
