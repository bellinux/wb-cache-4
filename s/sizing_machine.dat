40|$|Small size ultra-precision Computer Numerical Control (CNC) {{machines}} require high dynamic performance. Flexible frame phenomena {{can limit}} the machine dynamic performance, particularly in small <b>size</b> <b>machines.</b> A novel accelerometer based feedback concept for improving machine dynamic performance {{was developed and}} realised, a virtual metrology frame. It expends the limited techniques for improving dynamic performance of a small <b>size</b> <b>machine</b> by measuring the flexible frame displacement, and feeding it into the controller. The concept was implemented in a simplified linear motion system, and showed a 12 dB reduction in {{the magnitude of the}} first resonance in the plant frequency response function. This allowed improving the servo bandwidth by 58 % based on a PID controller. A new technique for real-time dynamic displacement measurements using accelerometer was developed. It shows a low sensor noise σ< 30 nm; thus, accelerometers are used as a displacement sensor in a control system...|$|R
50|$|Before mechanisation, the sizing {{process was}} a time {{consuming}} task. The weaver painted the size onto the warp as it lay on the loom, then fanned it dry before weaving the cloth. The <b>sizing</b> <b>machine</b> improved the process by sizing a warp before putting it into the loom. The warp threads are first wound onto a large beam, which is then placed {{at one end of}} the <b>sizing</b> <b>machine.</b> Then the warp is drawn off the beam and passes through a bath of boiling size, between sets of rollers and cooled, dried and rewound onto another beam. It is then ready to be woven.|$|E
50|$|Next {{process in}} the textile {{production}} is fabric manufacturing. Fabric Manufacturing laboratory has variety of weaving machines from hand loom to high speed air jet loom. This laboratory consist of dobby and jacquard hand looms, dobby and jacquard shuttle looms, terry towel looms, rapier dobby and jacquard looms, air jet loom, sectional warping machine and <b>sizing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E

The threads pass through size to stiffen them and reduce friction. The size is a mixture of flour, soft soap and tallow: {{specific}} to the mill. The threads are dried over steam-heated cylinders and wound onto the weavers beam.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} design, {{engineering}} principles and applications of machine tools specially developed for large parts. Large workshop machines {{are commonly used}} for manufacturing, where {{the impact of the}} general engineering principles differs substantially from those applied to conventional <b>size</b> <b>machines.</b> Portable machines are used during assembly and operation due to mobility, agility and energy constraints. Such large dimensions produce an amplification factor of any error source, so verification and calibration of such large or portable machines becomes evenmore critical than in conventional machines. The paper also includes future trends and unsolved challenges...|$|R

50|$|In {{early days}} beaming was often {{done in the}} weaving shed but later the process tended to be {{transferred}} to the spinning mill. The spinners would send lorrys loaded with of beams wound with thread of the ordered specification to the weavers. Several tapers beams would be attached to creels on the Tape <b>Sizing</b> <b>machine,</b> and the threads from these would be sized and combined to create the smaller weavers beams. As a rule of thumb, a tapers beam had thread long enough to make 20 weavers beams.|$|E
50|$|The warp {{needs to}} be taken from a 300 bobbins on V-shaped frame and wound onto a beam. Four or five beams are merged to make the 2000 end beam that is needed, and they are placed in the Cylinder Tape <b>Sizing</b> <b>Machine</b> (made in 1919 by Howard & Bullough Ltd. of Accrington).

50|$|When yarn {{enters a}} weaving mill, the warp is usually already on a beam and the weft is on {{different}} size cops and cheeses. The weft {{has to be}} wound onto pirns to fit in the shuttles suitable for installed looms. The beam with 2000 or more ends {{is placed in the}} Cylinder Tape <b>Sizing</b> <b>Machine.</b> The threads pass through the size to stiffen them and reduce friction. The size is a mixture of flour soft soap and tallow. The ends are dried over steam-heated cylinders and wound onto the final beam, the weavers beam.|$|E
50|$|In 1792, Dr Cartwright {{obtained}} {{his last}} patent for weaving machinery; this provided his loom with multiple shuttle boxes for weaving checks and cross stripes.However all his efforts were unavailing; {{it became apparent}} that no mechanism, however perfect, could succeed so long as warps continued to be sized while a loom was stationary. His plans for sizing them while a loom was in operation, and before being placed in a loom, failed. These problems were resolved in 1803, by William Radcliffe and his assistant Thomas Johnson, by their inventions of the beam warper, and the dressing <b>sizing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} of sizing a warp was mechanised {{during the nineteenth}} century when William Radcliffe and his assistant Thomas Johnson invented the <b>sizing</b> <b>machine.</b> The purpose of introducing size, which is either a starchy substance for cotton or gelatinous mixture for woollen fibre, is to reduce the chances of threads fraying and breaking due to the friction of the weaving process. The size stiffens the thread and helps the fibres lie closely together. Many recipes for size can be found in textile manufacturing books. The recipes include flour, sago, china clay, types of soap, fats and some chemicals.|$|E

50|$|Attached to {{the weaving}} shed {{in a typical}} mill would be a boiler house where the steam was raised, an engine room housing a {{stationary}} steam engine and a two or three storey building where the preparatory processes were done below and above would be the warehouse. This also housed the offices. Weaving was not possible without a continuous supply of weft on pirns, and beams carrying the warp. Starting with the warp, {{it had to be}} warped from creels of thread, in a multistage process onto the weavers' beam. This could be done in the mill or the warp could be bought in and delivered on the tapers beam. The beam of thread had to be sized in a tape <b>sizing</b> <b>machine</b> by sizers.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{rolling process}} {{is widely used}} to achieve width {{reduction}} in hot strip milling production. However, there 2 ̆ 7 ve been some drawbacks about the conventional methods that cannot be ignored, such as dog-bone profile and seam-effect.

The objective of this thesis is to simulate the <b>sizing</b> <b>machine,</b> identify the advantages of sizing process over edging process, and compare the performance of <b>sizing</b> <b>machine</b> under different boundary conditions. In order to achieve these goals, this thesis develops a numerical model for the vertical <b>sizing</b> <b>machine</b> under typical operation conditions and conducts a structural finite element analysis of the model.

40|$|The {{design of}} ferrite-assisted {{synchronous}} reluctance machines is investigated, with {{particular attention to}} the pivotal aspect of avoiding irreversible de-magnetization. Geometric rules for obtaining a robust design are proposed and described analytically. The safe operating area is quantified in terms of the corresponding maximum electrical loading. Such demagnetization limit shows to be depending on the operating temperature and the <b>machine</b> <b>size.</b> Furthermore, the comparison between the continuous load and de-magnetization conditions shows that low and medium <b>size</b> <b>machines</b> can be stiffer against demagnetization, with respect to larger machines, and have room for transient overload. The analysis is validated by finite-elements and a design example is given, namely a twelve poles direct-drive machine, rated 910 Nm, 200 rp...|$|R
