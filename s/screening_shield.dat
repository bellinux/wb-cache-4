40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of a conducting layer on the magnetic flux penetration in a superconducting Nb film is studied by magneto-optical imaging. The metallic layer partially covering the superconductor provides an additional velocity-dependent damping mechanism for the flux motion that helps to protect the superconducting state when thermomagnetic instabilities develop. If the flux advances with a velocity slower than w = 2 /μ 0 σ t, where σ is the cap layer conductivity and t is its thickness, the flux penetration remains unaffected, whereas for incoming flux moving faster than w, the metallic layer becomes an active <b>screening</b> <b>shield.</b> When the metallic layer {{is replaced by a}} perfect conductor, it is expected that the flux braking effect will occur for all flux velocities. We investigate this effect by studying Nb samples with a thickness step. Some of the observed features, namely the deflection of the flux trajectories at the border of the thick center, as well as the favored flux penetration at the indentation, are reproduced by time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work the methods for {{producing}} flat and three dimensional <b>shielding</b> <b>screens</b> from the perforated steel tape are proposed. The possible application variants of mentioned screens are offered and analyzed. Main attention is given for producing one-layer and multi-layer screens with cellular structure {{due to its}} relatively low weight and technological elasticity-complex three-dimensional structures could be done successfully. Examples of produced <b>shielding</b> <b>screens</b> from perforated steel tape for protection from electromagnetic fields in different frequency range are offered and tested. The efficiency of a shielding material was determined by measuring the magnetic field before and after applying the shielding material. Distribution of the magnetic field behind the <b>shielding</b> <b>screen</b> was determined by software vector mapping. Shielding efficiency was measured for 1) a three layer perforated steel screen; 2) an one-layer perforated steel <b>screen</b> - <b>shielding</b> <b>screen</b> was placed in between the magnetic field source and the measurement point forming two dimensional screen; 3) copper composite sprayed screen. During experimental investigation it was established, that a three-layer perforated steel screen application allowed the 27 % reduction in the magnetic field, while one-layer perforated steel screen gave only 12 % reduction. Copper composite sprayed screen reduced magnetic field by 15 %. Recommendations for producing the multi-layer perforated steel <b>screen</b> accordingly to <b>shielding</b> efficiency are elaborated and laid down. The discussed material carries also ecological significance, since the material is produced by waste products (after stumping etc.). Therefore the production of such materials comes with reduced cost both in light of capital expenditures and ecological footprint...|$|R

The instrument comprises a cooled corrugated horn antenna coupled to a total-power radiometer. A cryogenic mechanical waveguide switch alternately connects the radiometer to the horn and to an internal reference load.

50|$|Two {{different}} physical explanations {{have been}} given for the increased stability of high multiplicity states.

However, accurate quantum-mechanical calculations (starting in the 1970s) have shown that {{the reason is that the}} electrons in singly occupied orbitals are less effectively <b>screened</b> or <b>shielded</b> from the nucleus, so that such orbitals contract and electron-nucleus attraction energy becomes greater in magnitude (or decreases algebraically).|$|R
