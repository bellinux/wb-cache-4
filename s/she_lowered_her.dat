500|$|Conversely, the sequel, Godchild, {{received}} positive reviews. When {{the first}} chapter premiered in Shojo Beat, critics commented on the potiental and art of the series, but found the chapter [...] "listless" [...] and confusing. Reviews of the bound volumes were positive. Writing for The Book Report, Robin Brenner described the mysteries as [...] "unsettling, splatter-filled, and deliciously {{in line with the}} melodramatic, horrific traditions of Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley." [...] Leroy Douresseaux of Coolstreak Cartoons wrote: [...] "By turns bizarre and unsettling, Godchild is actually quite engaging, but can be difficult to follow for those who didn't come in at the beginning". Writing for Sequential Tart, Sheena McNeil described Godchild as [...] "a masterpiece {{in every sense of the}} word." [...] In reviews of subsequent volumes, <b>she</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> score, and praised Yuki's characterization, mysteries, and artwork; she concluded: [...] "Godchild is a fantastic and different story that can't be denied." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> eyelids. Razumov {{looked at}} her curiously.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that when the strawberry poison dart frog females visit their pools, <b>she</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>her</b> vent into the water whereupon the tadpole moves against her, stiffens, and vibrates. This stimulates the female to release 1-5 unfertilized eggs, which comprise the tadpole's sole diet.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> eyes an instant, {{then raised}} them again {{to meet his}} own.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes for}} a moment, as though to conceal the sudden soft flash.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> eyes, {{but she did}} {{not seem}} to take offence. I meant none.|$|E
50|$|Belle {{looks for}} him in a saloon and kills four of his men in a duel. Later we see her sing a ballad of love in a saloon. He confronts her for another game.

60|$|Miss Jewell agreed. <b>She</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes and}} looked under the lashes at the skipper.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> {{head still}} more so that I {{could not see}} {{anything}} of her face.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> eyes; {{her bosom}} quickened slightly, and the colour ebbed and flowed in her cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's {{well the}} breeze freshened,' said Long John. 'I heard the creak o' davits {{just after the}} first discharge. <b>She</b> was <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> boats, or I'm a Dutchman.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No: it's {{not good}} of me. I'm {{thinking}} of myself--not of you." [...] <b>She</b> suddenly <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> tone. [...] "I {{wish you were}} married to him," [...] she said.|$|R
50|$|Halfas, this time, {{stands and}} fights, {{eventually}} losing to Anita's skill. She prepares to kill him, as he requests, by using all three swords, but Krassel intervenes and takes Kadum and Soul.

60|$|She {{looked at}} him, {{a prayer for}} {{explanation}} trembling on her lips. But before the calm command of his tone and glance <b>she</b> slowly <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> head and withdrew beyond the curtain.|$|R
50|$|Australia has {{a history}} of riverboats. Australia's biggest river, the Murray, has an inland port called Echuca. Many large riverboats were working on the Murray, but now a lower water level is {{stopping}} them. The Kalgan River in Western Australia {{is one of the oldest}} rivers in the world; it has had two main riverboats. The Silver Star, 1918 to 1935, would <b>lower</b> <b>her</b> funnel to get under the low bridge. Today, the Kalgan Queen riverboat takes tourists up the river to taste the local wines. <b>She</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>her</b> roof to get under the same bridge.|$|R

When she shows up for the interview, it's like no interview she's ever had before. She's asked all sorts of embarrassing questions and asked to say lines in front of a camera.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps he has," [...] <b>she</b> agreed, <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> voice a little. [...] "At least, I believe one thing. I {{believe that}} he is a good German and yet a great friend of England." ...|$|R
50|$|Buck Williams gets {{a call in}} the {{elevator}} from Chloe as she tells him about the wine and Bruce's death. Buck promises {{to come home from}} his trip soon as {{the elevator}} stops and the door opens to reveal an armed Carolyn. <b>She</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>her</b> weapon and Buck states that they need to talk, implying that they had met before.

Nicolae Carpathia walks out from the flames looking very mad, completely unharmed.|$|R
6000|$|Fleda hesitated; at last, {{before her}} companion's, <b>she</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> look. [...] "Because I love him. It's because he's weak {{that he needs}} me," [...] she added.|$|E

The video also features a tribute to Trayvon Martin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can you assure me, on your honor, of {{one other}} thing," [...] <b>she</b> asked, <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> voice on her side. [...] "Can you {{honestly}} {{tell me that}} this is not the first of other fits that are to come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} you would come," [...] she said, [...] "and yet I {{knew that it would}} be a {{struggle}} between you and them. For--the Prince--" [...] <b>she</b> murmured, <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> voice, [...] "had pledged his word to keep us apart." ...|$|R
