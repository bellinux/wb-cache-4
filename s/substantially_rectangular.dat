50|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a new or improved frame for a motorcycle which comprises two <b>substantially</b> parallel <b>rectangular</b> loops each formed from a single length of tubing, and {{the ends of the}} tube forming each loop cross and are welded to each other at the top front corner of the loop, the free ends of the tube which extend beyond the crossing point being welded to the side of an inclined head tube adjacent to the top and bottom thereof. The assembled frame is extremely strong for its weight and designed to provide the maximum resistance to any stresses applied to the frame by road shocks or by the driving torque of the power unit.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{two-dimensional}} signal constellations for {{the transmission of}} binary non-uniform memoryless sources over additive white Gaussian noise channels is investigated. The main application of this problem is the implementation of improved constellations where transmitted data is highly non-uniform. A simple algorithm, which optimizes a constellation by re-arranging its points in a pairwise fashion (i. e., two points are modified a time with the other points remaining fixed), is presented. In general, the optimized constellations depend on both the source statistics and the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) in the channel. We show that constellations designed with source statistics considered can yield symbol error rate performance that is <b>substantially</b> better than <b>rectangular</b> quadrature amplitude modulation signal sets used with either Gray mapping or more recently developed maps. Gains as high as 5 dB in Eb/N 0 SNR are obtained for highly non-uniform sources. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved equivalent circuit representation for the lightning stroke {{to estimate the}} magnitudes and waveshapes of currents and voltages through transmission system components due to lightning strokes. Results indicate that arrester currents can {{go as high as}} 130 kA with a front time of the order of 15 us, while the arrester potentials are <b>substantially</b> <b>rectangular</b> lasting anywhere upto 60 us. Transformer potentials are initially oscillatory exceeding the BIL. This could be dangerous. Thus, this work was successful in improving the equivalent circuit representation of the lightning stroke and highlighted interesting areas for further research...|$|E

One, two or even three or more slots are possible, where the slot is located at one;or more locations selected from a group of locations comprising a top surface of the flap, a bottom surface of the flap, an intersection of the top and side surface of the flap, an intersection of the bottom and side surfaces of the flap, and a side surface of the flap.

40|$|A {{solar cell}} shingle {{was made of}} an array of solar cells on a lower portion of a <b>substantially</b> <b>rectangular</b> shingle {{substrate}} made of fiberglass cloth or the like. The solar cells may be encapsulated in flourinated ethylene propylene or some other weatherproof translucent or transparent encapsulant to form a combined electrical module and a roof shingle. The interconnected solar cells were connected to connectors {{at the edge of}} the substrate through a connection to a common electrical bus or busses. An overlap area was arranged to receive the overlap of a cooperating similar shingle so that the cell portion of the cooperating shingle may overlie the overlap area of the roof shingle. Accordingly, the same shingle serves the double function of an ordinary roof shingle which may be applied in the usual way and an array of cooperating solar cells from which electrical energy may be collected...|$|E

An implant for {{insertion}} between vertebrae of the verterbral column {{having a}} <b>substantially</b> <b>rectangular</b> or trapezoidal cross-section and covering faces adapted {{to face the}} adjacent vertebrae which are porous and/or designed with a profile. The implant has such a width that it substantially covers at the maximum the rear half of the vertebrae facing the spinous process, preferably at the maximum the rear third of the vertebrae facing the spinous process, and such a length that it substantially covers the rear region of the vertebrae. The limiting surface of the implant facing {{the inside of the}} vertebrae and extending {{in the direction of the}} adjacent vertebrae is convex. This enables an adequate and reliable supporting function to be achieved with only one implant and can easily be inserted sideways from behind. Fuss, Franz Konstantin and Sabitzer, Ronald J...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical and {{numerical}} {{investigations have}} been carried out {{on the use of the}} Integral Equation Method of solution for the Potential Theory problem of the interaction between a floating body and a train of regular waves in a two-dimensional domain. In particular, a numerical study has been carried out of the indirect method of solution of the integral equation resulting from a distribution of Green's Function sources over a boundary coincident with the immersed surface of the body. It is demonstrated that a significant increase in solution efficiency, with no loss of precision, can be effected by improvements in the general numerical techniques of solution together with the use of a polynomial type distribution of elements over the source boundary. It is also demonstrated that significant improvements in solution accuracy for rectangular aspects can be achieved by a slight 'rounding' of the submerged edges of the mathematical model. An experimental investigation of the interaction between a train of regular waves and a <b>substantially</b> <b>rectangular</b> floating body includes measurements of the reflection and transmission characteristics, for both the fixed and floating mode of the body, together with measurements of the body motions. The primary objective of the experimental study is the validation of theoretically predicted interaction parameters derived from the above methods. The experimental program was designed both to determine the extent of validity of Potential Theory within regimes where diffraction effects predominate, and also to determine the conditions under which the use of Potential Theory alone becomes invalid due to the significant presence of non-linear effects. As a consequence of the results of this investigation, recommendations are made both with regard to the possible achievement of further improvements in solution efficiency and, more importantly, with regard to a general improvement of solution accuracy by the inclusion of the above-mentioned non-linear effects in the theoretical formulations...|$|E
