25|$|Driving an {{avalanche}} is the {{component of the}} avalanche's weight parallel to the slope; as the avalanche progresses any unstable snow in its path will tend to become incorporated, so increasing the overall weight. This force will increase as the steepness of the slope increases, and diminish as the slope flattens. Resisting this {{are a number of}} components that are thought to interact with each other: the friction between the avalanche and the surface beneath; friction between the air and snow within the fluid; fluid-dynamic drag at {{the leading edge of the}} avalanche; <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> between the avalanche and the air through which it is passing, and <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> between the fragments within the avalanche itself. An avalanche will continue to accelerate until the resistance exceeds the forward force.|$|E
25|$|Mechanically {{stabilized}} earth, {{also called}} MSE, is soil constructed with artificial reinforcing via layered horizontal mats (geosynthetics) fixed at their ends. These mats provide added internal <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> {{beyond that of}} simple gravity wall structures. Other options include steel straps, also layered. This type of soil strengthening usually needs outer facing walls (S.R.W.'s – Segmental Retaining Walls) to affix the layers to and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Soil is an {{assemblage}} of particles that have little to no cementation while rock (such as sandstone) may consist of an assembly of particles that are strongly cemented together by chemical bonds. The shear strength of soil is primarily due to interparticle friction and therefore, the <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> on a plane is approximately proportional to the effective normal stress on that plane. The {{angle of internal friction}} is thus closely related to the maximum stable slope angle, often called the angle of repose.|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} for investigating the <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of cohesive soils {{subjected to a}} high rate of shearing strain is described. A fast step-loading torque apparatus was used to induce a state of pure shear in a hollow cylindrical soil specimen. The relationship between <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> and rate of shear deformation was established for various soil densities expressed in terms of initial void ratio or water content. For rate of shearing deformation studies, the <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> increases initially with shearing velocity, but subsequently reaches a terminal value as the shearing velocity increases. The terminal <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> is also found to increase as the density of the soil increases. The results of this investigation are useful in the rheological study of clay. It is particularly important for mobility problems of soil runways, since the soil resistance is found {{to be sensitive to the}} rate of shearing...|$|R

The analysis of two series of samples, using soil paste for the consistency index of 0. 9 and 0. 4 – 0. 3 was carried out. The results imply that the increasing moisture content causes a decrease in the angle of <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> and cohesion and is also reflected in the higher compressibility of the soil. It was observed that regardless of the soil consistency, the angle of <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> decreases and the cohesion value and the oedometric modulus of primary (consolidation) and secondary compressibility grows with the increase in the clay fraction...|$|R

25|$|Shear {{strength}} {{is a term}} used in soil mechanics to describe {{the magnitude of the}} shear stress that a soil can sustain. The <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> of soil is a result of friction and interlocking of particles, and possibly cementation or bonding at particle contacts. Due to interlocking, particulate material may expand or contract in volume as it is subject to shear strains. If soil expands its volume, the density of particles will decrease and the strength will decrease; in this case, the peak strength would be followed by a reduction of shear stress. The stress-strain relationship levels off when the material stops expanding or contracting, and when interparticle bonds are broken. The theoretical state at which the shear stress and density remain constant while the shear strain increases may be called the critical state, steady state, or residual strength.|$|E

2500|$|The shear {{strength}} and stiffness of soil determines {{whether or not}} soil will be stable or {{how much it will}} deform. Knowledge of the strength is necessary to determine if a slope will be stable, if a building or bridge might settle too far into the ground, and the limiting pressures on a retaining wall. It is important to distinguish between failure of a soil element and the failure of a geotechnical structure (e.g., a building foundation, slope or retaining wall); some soil elements may reach their peak strength prior to failure of the structure. Different criteria can be used to define the [...] "{{shear strength}}" [...] and the [...] "yield point" [...] for a soil element from a stress–strain curve. One may define the peak shear strength as the peak of a stress–strain curve, or the shear strength at critical state as the value after large strains when the <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> levels off. If the stress–strain curve does not stabilize before the end of shear strength test, the [...] "strength" [...] is sometimes considered to be the <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> at 15–20% strain.

2500|$|The {{active state}} {{occurs when a}} {{retained}} soil mass is allowed to relax or deform laterally and outward (away from the soil mass) {{to the point of}} mobilizing its available full <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> (or engaged its shear strength) in trying to resist lateral deformation. That is, the soil is at the point of incipient failure by shearing due to unloading in the lateral direction. It is the minimum theoretical lateral pressure that a given [...] soil mass will exert on a retaining that will move or rotate away from the soil until the soil active state is reached (not necessarily the actual in-service lateral pressure on walls that do not move when subjected to soil lateral pressures higher than the active pressure). The passive state occurs when a soil mass is externally forced laterally and inward (towards the soil mass) to the point of mobilizing its available full <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> in trying to resist further lateral deformation. That is, the soil mass is at the point of incipient failure by shearing due to loading in the lateral direction. It is the maximum lateral resistance that a given soil mass can offer to a retaining wall that is being pushed towards the soil mass. That is, the soil is at the point of incipient failure by shearing, but this time due to loading in the lateral direction. Thus active pressure and passive resistance define the minimum lateral pressure and the maximum lateral resistance possible from a given mass of soil.|$|E
2500|$|To {{understand}} {{the mechanics of}} soils {{it is necessary to}} understand how normal stresses and shear stresses are shared by the different phases. Neither gas nor liquid provide significant resistance to shear stress. The <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> of soil is provided by friction and interlocking of the particles. The friction depends on the intergranular contact stresses between solid particles. The normal stresses, on the other hand, are shared by the fluid and the particles. [...] Although the pore air is relatively compressible, and hence takes little normal stress in most geotechnical problems, liquid water is relatively incompressible and if the voids are saturated with water, the pore water must be squeezed out in order to pack the particles closer together.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of reinforced earth structures {{depends on the}} mobilization of interfacial <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> between soil and reinforcement. This criterion typically eliminates the use of fine-grained soil as a backfill material in reinforced earth structures. Considering the distribution of induced interfacial shear stress in soil around {{the surface of the}} reinforcement, {{it has been shown that}} only a thin zone of frictional material around the reinforcement is required to mobilize almost full interfacial <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of sand. Six series of pullout tests have been conducted, with different types of reinforcement, to study the effect of thickness of sand (frictional material) around the reinforcement on the pullout resistance. Sawdust and kaolin clay have been used as bulk backfill material, providing the soil with negligible friction. With low-friction-strength soil as bulk material, a 15 -mm thickness of sand around the reinforcement is required to increase the interfacial <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> to that with sand as the bulk material. With this new technique, low-frictional fine-grained soils can be used as bulk backfill material in reinforced earth constructions...|$|R

Results reveal that pore pressure, secant modulus, {{undrained shear strength}} and angle of <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> increase when sand content was raised in both compression and extension. It was {{also found that the}} tested materials were overconsolidated by the fact that normalized shear strength depends on initial confining stress. The compacted sand-clay mixtures exhibit anisotropy in mechanical behavior so that undrained shear strength and angle of <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> were greater in compression than in extension.

2500|$|But in {{addition}} to friction, soil derives significant <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> from interlocking of grains. [...] If the grains are densely packed, the grains tend to spread apart from {{each other as they}} are subject to shear strain. The expansion of the particle matrix due to shearing was called dilatancy by Osborne Reynolds. If one considers the energy required to shear an assembly of particles there is energy input by the shear force, T, moving a distance, x and there is also energy input by the normal force, N, as the sample expands a distance, y. [...] Due to the extra energy required for the particles to dilate against the confining pressures, dilatant soils have a greater peak strength than contractive soils. Furthermore, as dilative soil grains dilate, they become looser (their void ratio increases), and their rate of dilation decreases until they reach a critical void ratio. Contractive soils become denser as they shear, and their rate of contraction decreases until they reach a critical void ratio.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between a solid slab and a voided biaxial slab refers to <b>shear</b> <b>resistance.</b> Due to the reduced concrete volume, the <b>shear</b> <b>resistance</b> will also be reduced.

Experiments show the propagation of a shear band ahead of the initial crack. Finite element simulations are used to interpret the results.

A propagating shear band is obtained when the material is modeled as having reduced <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> described by a thermo-viscoplastic power law, and complete loss of <b>shearing</b> <b>resistance</b> when the <b>shear</b> strain reaches a critical value.

To examine the imperfection effect on the <b>shear</b> buckling <b>resistance</b> of a web plate with sectional damage, a series of nonlinear finite element (FE) analyses were carried out for a web plate with sectional damage, which was assumed as local corrosion damage.

40|$|In this thesis, two {{problems}} have been studied: one is the reliability of design resistances of composite beams in bending, {{the other is the}} longitudinal <b>shear</b> <b>resistances</b> in concrete flanges of composite beams with profiled sheeting. For the first problem, a general theory is developed based on the concepts of safety-index and second-moment reliability, to analyse the reliability of a design resistance for composite structures. This theory consists of two basic parts: one is the determination of several distinct safety factors for a single resistance function, with respect to the specified safety level; the other is the assessment of safety level, corresponding to given safety factors. Application of this theory is related to the relevant test results. In the scope of Eurocode 4, this theory is particularly used to calibrate safety factors employed for design plastic bending resistances of composite beams. From the calculation based on 122 test results, the reliability of using the Eurocode provisions, including the recommended safety factors and the theoretical models, is judged for bending resistances of beams with full and partial shear connection. In studying the longitudinal <b>shear</b> <b>resistances</b> in concrete flanges of composite beams with and without profiled sheeting, a simple theory to determine the resistances is established. This theory is based on the "friction-cohesion" and "concrete strut" models for concrete in shear and takes the effect of profiled sheeting into account. Associated with the theoretical work, seven tests on three specimens for investigating the longitudinal <b>shear</b> <b>resistances</b> are reported. From both experimental results and theoretical calculation, the behaviour of the test specimens is studied, and, finally, new design recommendations are made to predict the longitudinal <b>shear</b> <b>resistances</b> of the composite beams...|$|R

Two types of 3 D laser scanners were used to digitise the granite joint planes from the sizes of 60 mm to 8, 000 mm in length.
