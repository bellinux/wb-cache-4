In study, recent (2000 - 2005) processing-production {{activities of}} seafood plants processing and marketing <b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> (Chamelea gallina L., 1753) in Turkey were evaluated. The {{study was conducted}} through interviewing managers of 6 <b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> processing plants. The capacities of the plants ranged between 55 and 200 tons/day with a total indoor production area of 100 000 m 2. The plants employed around 500 workers and 55 technical staff. None of them solely depended on <b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> processing and marketing. They were also processing, storing and marketing other fishery products, fruits and vegetables during closed seasons for <b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> fishing. Entire processed <b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> were stored and exported to EU countries, particularly to Italy before following fishing season. Sum of <b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> processed between 2000 and 2005 by those 6 plants was higher than official produc tion figures of the species.

40|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> clams Chamelea gallina and C. striatula are commercially {{important}} bivalves inhabiting European and North African coastal waters. The taxonomic {{status of}} these taxa {{has been the}} subject of debate for decades. In order to elucidate this issue, we generated 5 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA and H 3 histone gene probes and mapped them by fluorescent in situ hybridization to the chromosomes of morphologically identified <b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> clams, collected from four geographically distant Atlantic and Mediterranean populations. The nucleotide variation at the three DNA markers, that is, the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS 2), the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), and the large ribosomal subunit rRNA (16 S) fragments, was also studied and the resultant phylogenetic trees were evaluated. Striking differences in both the chromosome distribution of these genes and the clustering of the samples on the phylogenetic trees observed provide clear evidence that C. gallina and C. striatula are separated species...|$|E

40|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> Chamelea gallina (Linnaeus 1758) is {{a species}} of {{substantial}} economic importance, distributed along the Mediterranean coast and the Eastern Atlantic coasts. Due to an intensive trade activity since the 1970 ’s, this species has experienced a rapid decline in the last 30 years, still exacerbated by irregular mortality events due to undetermined triggers. Global profiling of gene expression {{has the potential to}} disentangle the biological effects of various environmental stressors causing severe landings decline or mortality events. In this study, we report the development of a C. gallina-specific oligo-microarray, a first transcriptomic platform for global gene expression profiling in the <b>striped</b> <b>venus.</b> This tool was applied to compare gene expression profiles of clams collected in different periods along the Abruzzo coast in a reference site (T 7) and in a site subject to mortality events (T 4). Our results reveal substantial transcriptional modifications among the investigated sites and the significant up-regulation of several genes involved in the immune response in the T 4 site. The transcriptomic differences between clams from the two investigated sites endorse distinct health and metabolic status under different environmental stressors.

40|$|This study reports {{relative}} growth, shell length-age {{keys and}} growth performance indices (overall growth performance (OGP) and phi prime) for the <b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> Chamelea gallina from the Huelva coast in southwest (SW) Spain. The morphometric relationship shell height (SH) /shell length (SL) presented isometric growth whereas SL/shell width (SW) and SL/weight (W) displayed negative allometric growth. Shell length at age was estimated through length-frequency distribution (LF) and internal shell growth bands by acetate peel method (AP). C. gallina population consists mainly of three age classes with shell lengths around 13 - 15 mm {{for the first}} year, 25 mm {{for the second year}} and 30 mm for the third year. The OGP and phi prime values obtained in the present study are within the range of values for other C. gallina populations from the Gulf of Cádiz. Nevertheless, marked differences in growth performance were observed between populations from the Black Sea (lower growth performance) and from other locations along the southern distribution area of this species, which {{may be related to the}} low levels of temperature (SST), salinity (SSS) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration that exhibit large intra-annual fluctuations.

40|$|Background: The <b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> Chamelea gallina clam {{fishery is}} among the oldest and {{the largest in the}} Mediterranean Sea, {{particularly}} in the inshore waters of northern Adriatic Sea. The high fishing pressure has lead to a strong stock abundance decline, enhanced by several irregular mortality events. The nearly complete lack of molecular characterization limits the available genetic resources for C. gallina. We achieved the first transcriptome of this species with the aim of identifying an informative set of expressed genes, potential markers to assess genetic structure of natural populations and molecular resources for pathogenic contamination detection. Methodology/Principal Findings: The 454 -pyrosequencing of a normalized cDNA library of a pool C. gallina adult individuals yielded 298, 494 raw reads. Different steps of reads assembly and filtering produced 36, 422 contigs of high quality, one half of which (18, 196) were annotated by similarity. A total of 111 microsatellites and 20, 377 putative SNPs were identified. A panel of 13 polymorphic transcript-linked microsatellites was developed and their variability assessed in 12 individuals. Remarkably, a scan to search for contamination sequences of infectious origin indicated the presence of several Vibrionales species reported to be among the most frequent clam pathogen’s species.

40|$|Research PaperA {{wide range}} of {{fisheries}} are managed using vessel catch limits combined with different kinds of effort restrictions. This management framework {{is expected to have}} desirable consequences for the bioeconomic sustainability of fisheries. When appropriately implemented this approach produces outcomes that are similar to those associated with individual fishing quotas. However, there is little empirical evidence of this fact. Provided vessel catch limits are defined according sustainable criteria this management framework applied in a fully exploited or overexploited fishery results in most of the vessels actually landing the maximum amount of fish allowed. This observation makes it necessary for the analysis to adopt an input orientation because vessels can only be more technically efficient if they use the optimal quantity of productive inputs for the given maximum output. However, few studies illustrate this point {{despite the fact that the}} measurement of technical efficiency has been theoretically well described in efficiency and productivity analysis literature. An input-oriented DEA model is solved in this paper to determine technical efficiency of <b>Striped</b> <b>venus</b> (Chamelea gallina, Linnaeus, 1758) fishery of the Gulf of Cádiz (South Atlantic Spanish Region / Spanish IX-a ICES subdivision). Technical efficiency is interpreted as an observed measure of input capacity utilization and enables a comparison of differences in technical efficiency across the different technologies that co-exist in this fishery...|$|E
40|$|A fast, {{simple and}} robust method has been {{developed}} for the simultaneous determination of 23 pharmaceuticals (including some major metabolites) in bivalve mollusks. The analytes belong to eight different therapeutic groups: antibiotics, psychiatric drugs, analgesics/anti-inflammatories, tranquilizer, calcium channel blockers, diuretic, and prostatic hyperplasia. The method is based on pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) followed by solid phase extraction clean-up (SPE), and ultra performance liquid chromatography–triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPL–MS/MS) for the identification and quantification of the target analytes. It {{has been developed}} and validated in three different species of bivalves: Crassostrea gigas (Pacific oyster), Mytilus galloprovincialis (Mediterranean mussel), and Chamelea gallina (<b>striped</b> <b>venus</b> clam). The majority of the compounds were extracted with a recovery between 40 and 115 %. The developed analytical method allowed {{the determination of the}} compounds in the lower ng/g concentration levels. The relative standard deviation was under 12 % for the intra-day and 20 % inter-day analyses, respectively. Finally, the method was applied to oyster, clam and mussel samples collected from the Ebro delta, Spain. The most ubiquitous compounds detected were the psychiatric drug venlanfaxine and the antibiotic azithromycin, with the highest concentrations found in mussel (2. 7 ng/g dw) and oyster (3. 0 ng/g dw), respectively.

An outdoor flow-through plant was set up and two pH levels (natural seawater pH as a control, pH 7. 4 as the treatment) were tested in long-term experiments. Mortality was low throughout the first experiment for both mussels and clams, but a significant increase, which was sensibly higher in clams, was observed at the end of the experiment (6 months). Significant decreases in the live weight (- 26 %) and, surprisingly, in the shell length (- 5 %) were observed in treated clams, but not in mussels. In the controls of both species, no shell damage was ever recorded; in the treated mussels and clams, damage proceeded via different modes and to different extents. The severity of shell injuries was maximal in the mussels after just 3 months of exposure to a reduced pH, whereas it progressively increased in clams until the end of the experiment. In shells of both species, the damaged area increased throughout the experiment, peaking at 35 % in mussels and 11 % in clams. The shell thickness of the treated and control animals significantly decreased after 3 months in clams and after 6 months in mussels. In the second experiment (3 months), only juvenile mussels were exposed to a reduced pH. After 3 months, the mussels at a natural pH level or pH 7. 4 did not differ in their survival, shell length or live weight. Conversely, shell damage was clearly visible in the treated mussels from the 1 st month onward. Monitoring the chemistry of seawater carbonates always showed aragonite undersaturation at 7. 4 pH, whereas calcite undersaturation occurred in only 37 % of the measurements.

This study was based on the monitoring campaigns of these bivalve banks, held annually by the IPMA, from 1999 to 2011, as well as environmental data of rainfall, an indicator of food availability (chlorophyll a), wind index and Sea surface Temperature (SST) over these 13 years. The objectives of this study are to analyze the variation of the spatial and temporal distribution of these species in the Western and Eastern Algarve, as well as to evaluate how the studied environmental parameters condition the abundance of the species concerned, in the following year, for the period before spawning and for the period after spawning + one month. Thus, annual distribution maps were elaborated for each species and region (Western and Eastern) and 16 linear models were applied to all four studied species, the two regions (Barlavento and Sotavento) and the study period (three months before spawning and spawning + one month The results of this study showed that the distribution and abundance of these species varies over the years, revealing different patterns of banks in terms of preference or absence for each species, and that all the analyzed environmental factors were significant in determining their abundance, the following year. The most significant environmental parameters affecting abundance were the rainfall and the chlorophyll a levels, especially in the Western area. In general, increasing chlorophyll levels were beneficial in contributing to the abundance of species either breeding adults or growing larvae, while the most abundant rainfall levels were positive for adult populations, and negative to the early life stages of these bivalves. This study also shows the need to develop {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between the environmental parameters studied and the specific characteristic of the Algarve coast, so there can be a better management of the stocks, and an anticipated prediction of the populations’ growth, which will enable a better monitoring of these important bivalve communities.
