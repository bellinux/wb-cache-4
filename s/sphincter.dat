5|$|The lower esophageal <b>sphincter,</b> or {{gastroesophageal}} <b>sphincter,</b> {{surrounds the}} lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach. It is also called the cardiac <b>sphincter</b> or cardioesophageal <b>sphincter,</b> named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal <b>sphincter</b> causes gastroesophageal , which causes heartburn and if it happens often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa.|$|E
5|$|The upper esophageal <b>sphincter</b> {{surrounds}} {{the upper part}} of the esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle but is not under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal <b>sphincter</b> is triggered by the swallowing reflex. The primary muscle of the upper esophageal <b>sphincter</b> is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor.|$|E
5|$|Branches also {{innervate}} {{muscles of}} the perineum and the pelvic floor; namely, the bulbospongiosus and the ischiocavernosus muscles respectively, the levator ani muscle (including the Iliococcygeus, pubococcygeus, puborectalis and either pubovaginalis in females or puboprostaticus in males) the external anal <b>sphincter</b> (via the inferior anal branch), and male or female external urethral <b>sphincter.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is surrounded}} {{at the top}} and bottom by two muscular rings, known respectively as the upper esophageal <b>sphincter</b> and the lower esophageal <b>sphincter.</b> These sphincters act to close the esophagus when food is not being swallowed. The esophageal sphincters are functional but not anatomical, meaning that they act as sphincters but do not have distinct thickenings like other sphincters.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve is {{the main}} nerve of the perineum. It carries {{sensation}} from the external genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the anus and perineum, as well the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the male or female external urethral <b>sphincter</b> and the external anal <b>sphincter.</b> If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, lesions may cause sensory loss or fecal incontinence. The nerve may be temporarily blocked {{as part of an}} anaesthetic procedure.|$|E
5|$|The Nissen fundoplication, {{in which}} the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal <b>sphincter</b> to stimulate its {{function}} and control reflux, was first conducted by Rudolph Nissen in 1955.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal <b>sphincter,</b> are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal <b>sphincter</b> have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing <b>sphincter</b> contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
5|$|The muscles exactly {{relate to}} the joints, {{operating}} them mechanically like the wires and strings of a puppet. A complex case is the tongue. <b>Sphincter</b> muscles are admired also.|$|E
5|$|Unilateral pudendal nerve {{neuropathy}} inconsistently causes {{fecal incontinence}} in some, but not others. This is because crossover innervation {{of the external}} anal <b>sphincter</b> occurs in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because of back pressure (exerted by the <b>sphincter</b> of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the common bile duct and the ampulla of Vater. The <b>sphincter</b> of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal <b>sphincter</b> relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal <b>sphincter</b> relaxes.|$|E
5|$|In {{ascending}} cholangitis, it {{is assumed}} that organisms migrate backwards up the bile duct as a result of partial obstruction and decreased function of the <b>sphincter</b> of Oddi. Other theories about the origin of the bacteria, such as through the portal vein or transmigration from the colon, are considered less likely.|$|E
5|$|A {{sea anemone}} {{is capable of}} {{changing}} its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the <b>sphincter</b> closing the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of <b>sphincter</b> valves on the {{arterial}} side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal <b>sphincter</b> receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal <b>sphincter</b> receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E
5|$|The biliary tree is {{normally}} relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The <b>sphincter</b> of Oddi {{acts as a}} mechanical barrier. The biliary system normally has low pressure (8 to 12 cmH2O) and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous forward flow of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, if present, into the duodenum, and does not allow {{the establishment of an}} infection. The constitution of bilebile salts and immunoglobulin secreted by the epithelium of the bile duct also has a protective role.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder <b>sphincter,</b> the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal <b>sphincter</b> to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, <b>sphincter</b> muscles in the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal muscles in their walls. The oral disc has radial muscles in the epidermis, {{but most of the}} muscles in the column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, as well as the arrangement of these retractor muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.|$|E
5|$|The column or trunk is {{generally}} {{more or less}} cylindrical and may be plain and smooth or may bear specialist structures; these include solid papillae (fleshy protuberances), adhesive papillae, cinclides (slits) and small protruding vesicles. In some species the part immediately below the oral disc is constricted and {{is known as the}} capitulum. When the animal contracts, the oral disc, tentacles and capitulum fold inside the pharynx and are held in place by a strong <b>sphincter</b> muscle part way up the column. There may be a fold in the body wall, known as a parapet, at this point, and this parapet covers and protects the anemone when it is retracted.|$|E
5|$|The {{muscles and}} nerves are much simpler {{than those of}} most other animals, {{although}} more specialised than in other cnidarians, such as corals. Cells in the outer layer (epidermis) and the inner layer (gastrodermis) have microfilaments that group into contractile fibers. These fibers are not true muscles {{because they are not}} freely suspended in the body cavity as they are in more developed animals. Longitudinal fibres are found in the tentacles and oral disc, and also within the mesenteries, where they can contract the whole length of the body. Circular fibers are found in the body wall and, in some species, around the oral disc, allowing the animal to retract its tentacles into a protective <b>sphincter.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{documented}} mechanism {{is that the}} ingestion of food causes gastric distention, which is followed by abdominal compression and the simultaneous relaxation of the lower esophageal <b>sphincter</b> (LES). This creates a common cavity between the stomach and the oropharynx that allows the partially digested material {{to return to the}} mouth. There are several offered explanations for the sudden relaxation of the LES. Among these explanations {{is that it is a}} learned voluntary relaxation, which is common in those with or having had bulimia. While this relaxation may be voluntary, the overall process of rumination is still generally involuntary. Relaxation due to intra-abdominal pressure is another proposed explanation, which would make abdominal compression the primary mechanism. The third is an adaptation of the belch reflex, which is the most commonly described mechanism. The swallowing of air immediately prior to regurgitation causes the activation of the belching reflex that triggers the relaxation of the LES. Patients often describe a feeling similar to the onset of a belch preceding rumination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sphincter</b> {{function}} in rectal prolapse {{is almost always}} reduced. This {{may be the result}} of direct <b>sphincter</b> injury by chronic stretching of the prolapsing rectum. Alternatively, the intussuscepting rectum may lead to chronic stimulation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR - contraction of the external anal <b>sphincter</b> in response to stool in the rectum). The RAIR was shown to be absent or blunted. Squeeze (maximum voluntary contraction) pressures may be effected as well as the resting tone. This is most likely a denervation injury to the external anal <b>sphincter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smooth muscle bundles pass {{on either}} side of the urethra, and these fibers are {{sometimes}} called the internal urethral <b>sphincter,</b> although they do not encircle the urethra. Further along the urethra is a <b>sphincter</b> of skeletal muscle, the <b>sphincter</b> of the membranous urethra (external urethral <b>sphincter).</b> The bladder's epithelium is termed transitional epithelium which contains a superficial layer of dome-like cells and multiple layers of stratified cuboidal cells underneath when evacuated. When the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous (flat) and the stratification of the cuboidal cells is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching.|$|E
25|$|For {{the urine}} {{to exit the}} bladder, both the autonomically {{controlled}} internal <b>sphincter</b> (in the male) and the voluntarily controlled external <b>sphincter</b> must be opened. Problems with these muscles can lead to incontinence.|$|E
25|$|Surgery may {{be carried}} out if {{conservative}} measures alone are not sufficient to control incontinence. There are many surgical options, and their relative effectiveness is debated {{due to a lack}} of good quality evidence. The optimal treatment regime may be a both surgical and non-surgical treatments. The surgical options can be considered in four categories: restoration and improvement of residual <b>sphincter</b> function (sphincteroplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, tibial nerve stimulation, correction of anorectal deformity), replacement / imitation of the <b>sphincter</b> or its function (anal encirclement, SECCA procedure, non-dynamic graciloplasty, perianal injectable bulking agents), dynamic <b>sphincter</b> replacement (artificial bowel <b>sphincter,</b> dynamic graciloplasty), antegrade continence enema (Malone procedure), and finally fecal diversion (e.g. colostomy). A surgical treatment algorithm has been proposed. Isolated <b>sphincter</b> defects (IAS/EAS) may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails, the person can be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. Functional deficits of the EAS and/or IAS (i.e. where there is no structural defect, or only limited EAS structural defect, or with neurogenic incontinence) may be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. If this fails, neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal <b>sphincter</b> may be indicated. Substantial muscular and/or neural defects may be treated with neosphincter initially.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} paruresis {{involves}} a tightening of the <b>sphincter</b> and/or bladder neck {{due to a}} sympathetic nervous system response. The adrenaline rush that produces the involuntary nervous system response probably has peripheral and central nervous system involvement. The internal urethral <b>sphincter</b> (smooth muscle tissue) or the external urethral <b>sphincter</b> (striated muscle), levator ani (especially the pubococcygeus) muscle area, {{or some combination of}} the above, may be involved. It is possible that there is an inhibition of the detrusor command through a reflex pathway as well. The pontine micturition center (Barrington's nucleus) also may be involved, as its inhibition results in relaxation of the detrusor and prevents the relaxation of the internal <b>sphincter.</b>|$|E
25|$|In healthy individuals, {{the lower}} urinary tract has two {{discrete}} phases of activity: the storage (or guarding) phase, when urine {{is stored in}} the bladder; and the voiding phase, when urine is released through the urethra. The state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra. At low bladder volumes, afferent firing is low, resulting in excitation of the outlet (the <b>sphincter</b> and urethra), and relaxation of the bladder. At high bladder volumes, afferent firing increases, causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge. When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. Voiding continues until the bladder empties completely, {{at which point the}} bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage. The muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. During the storage phase the internal urethral <b>sphincter</b> remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation. During micturition, parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral <b>sphincter</b> to relax. The external urethral <b>sphincter</b> (<b>sphincter</b> urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition.|$|E
25|$|Neutering {{also has}} been {{associated}} with an increased likelihood of urethral <b>sphincter</b> incontinence in male dogs.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{whether it is}} a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric <b>sphincter</b> muscle.|$|E
25|$|Urinary incontinence* is leakage of urine, usually due to {{incompetence}} of the urethral <b>sphincter</b> {{in adult}} dogs and ectopic ureter (a congenital {{condition in which}} the ureter enters the urinary tract posterior to the urethral <b>sphincter)</b> in puppies. In adult dogs it is most commonly seen in large spayed females. The lack of estrogens in spayed dogs {{has been linked to}} development of incontinence. Replacement of estrogens, phenylpropanolamine, and surgery have all been used for treatment.|$|E
25|$|Pyloric {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} a pylorus that is narrow. This is due to congenital hypertrophy of the pyloric <b>sphincter.</b> The lumen of the pylorus is narrower, and less food is able to pass through. This problem is often detected in the early weeks of life. When it is present, a newborn baby may projectile vomit after eating, but despite vomiting remain hungry. Pyloric stenosis may be managed by the insertion of a stent, or through surgical cutting of the pyloric <b>sphincter,</b> a pyloromyotomy.|$|E
25|$|In {{advanced}} {{stages of}} withdrawal, ultrasonographic evidence of pancreatitis {{has been demonstrated}} in some patients and is presumably attributed to spasm of the pancreatic <b>sphincter</b> of Oddi.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{pelvic floor}} {{exercises}} and anal <b>sphincter</b> exercises in FI is poorly determined. While {{there may be}} some benefit they appear less useful than implanted sacral nerve stimulators. These exercises aim to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (mainly levator ani). The anal sphincters are not technically part of the pelvic floor muscle group, but the EAS is a voluntary, striated muscle which therefore can be strengthened in a similar manner. It has not been established whether pelvic floor exercises can be distinguished from anal <b>sphincter</b> exercises in practice by the people doing them. This kind of exercise is more commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, for which there is a sound evidence base for effectiveness. More rarely are they used in FI. The effect of anal <b>sphincter</b> exercises are variously stated as an increase in the strength, speed or endurance of voluntary contraction (EAS).|$|E
25|$|The {{association}} with uterine prolapse (10-25%) and cystocele (35%) {{may suggest that}} there is some underlying abnormality of the pelvic floor that affects multiple pelvic organs. Proximal bilateral pudendal neuropathy has been demonstrated in patients with rectal prolapse who have fecal incontinence. This finding was shown to be absent in healthy subjects, and may be the cause of denervation-related atrophy of the external anal <b>sphincter.</b> Some authors suggest that pudendal nerve damage is the cause for pelvic floor and anal <b>sphincter</b> weakening, and may be the underlying cause of a spectrum of pelvic floor disorders.|$|E
25|$|Non-surgical {{treatments}} are recommended initially for acute and chronic anal fissures. These include topical nitroglycerin or calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem), or injection of botulinum toxin into the anal <b>sphincter.</b>|$|E
