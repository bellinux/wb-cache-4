In the original Milgram experiment on obedience, for example, where participants, who were in a room with only the experimenter, were ordered to administer increasingly more severe electrical shocks as punishment to a person in another room (from here on out, referred to as the “victim”), the conflict or social restraint experienced by the participants was the obligation to not disobey the experimenter - even when shocking the victim to the highest <b>shock</b> <b>level</b> given, a behavior which the participants saw as opposing their personal and social ideals (Milgram, 1965, p. 129).|$|E

50|$|Deindividuation {{refers to}} a {{decrease}} in self-awareness and self-evaluation {{as a result of}} being part of a group. Individuals who experience deindividuation seem to be influenced to a greater degree by identity cues. In a 1979 study by Robert D. Johnson and Leslie L. Downing, participants were instructed to give an electric shock to research assistants while wearing either a KKK disguise or a nurse's uniform. The results showed that the costumes worn by participants affected the <b>shock</b> <b>level</b> that they administered to the research assistants. Johnson and Downing stated that these findings supported the argument that deindividuation increases the influence that identity cues have on individuals. In virtual environments, deindividuation is believed to be driven by the level of anonymity that this type of setting provides for its users.|$|E
50|$|Robert Elwood and Mirjam Appel at the Queen's University of Belfast {{argue that}} pain may be {{inferred}} when {{the responses to}} a noxious stimulus are not reflexive but are traded off against other motivational requirements, the experience is remembered and the situation is avoided in the future. They investigated this by giving hermit crabs small electric shocks within their shells. Only crabs given shocks evacuated their shells indicating the aversive nature of the stimulus, but fewer crabs evacuated from a preferred species of shell demonstrating a motivational trade-off. Most crabs, however, did not evacuate at the <b>shock</b> <b>level</b> used, but when these shocked crabs were subsequently offered a new shell, {{they were more likely}} to approach and enter the new shell. They approached the new shell more quickly, investigated it for a shorter time and used fewer cheliped probes within the aperture prior to moving in. This demonstrates the experience of the electric shock altered future behaviour in a manner consistent with a marked shift in motivation to get a new shell to replace the one previously occupied.|$|E

40|$|A program {{requirement}} for field test temperatures {{that are beyond}} the test accelerometer operational limits of − 30 °[*]F and + 150 °[*]F required the calibration of accelerometers at high <b>shock</b> <b>levels</b> and at the temperature extremes of − 50 °[*]F and + 160 °[*]F.

40|$|Reliable {{experimental}} {{characterization of}} high-g shock environments is a long-standing problem which faces much difficulty. The <b>shock</b> <b>levels</b> experienced by various defense-related structural and mechanical components {{are not always}} easily obtained in the true environments but are known to span a significant range of peak accelerations and pulse durations. The reproduction of these high-g <b>shock</b> <b>levels</b> in a controlled setting is highly important but also quite complicated. A system which is characterized by substantial energy output, {{a high level of}} precision, and adjustability is ideal for producing the varying and intense conditions experienced by components subjected to shock loads. The UCSD Blast Simulator, a complex experimental device which simulates explosive blasts without a fireball or the use of explosive materials, has proven to be an appropriate tool for this application. The system uses high-precision, computer-controlled hydraulic actuators to fire a piston mounted with various impact materials at high velocities into the specified test article. In the developed experimental series, a cylindrical steel specimen is launched by the Blast Simulator from a set of custom pedestals into a catcher pit. The response of the test article to the impact is acquired and analyzed with various methods.

5000|$|Milgram also {{conducted}} two other experiments, replications {{of his original}} obedience experiment, with the intent being to analyze the effect of group behavior on participants: instead of the subject being alone with the experimenter, two confederates were utilized. In {{the first of the}} two experiments, “Groups for Disobedience,” the confederates defied the experimenter and refused to punish the victim (p. 130). [...] This produced a significant effect on the obedience of the participants: in the original experiment, 26 of the 40 participants administered the maximum shock; in the disobedient groups experiment, only 4 of 40 participants administered the highest level of voltage (Table 1). [...] Despite this high correlation between <b>shock</b> <b>level</b> administered and the obedience of the group in the disobedient groups experiment, there was no significant correlation for the second of the replicated experiments: “Obedient Groups”, where the confederates did not disobey the experimenter and, when the participant voiced angst regarding the experiment and wished to stop administering volts to the victim, the confederates voiced their disapproval (p. 133). [...] Milgram concludes the study by remarking that “the insertion of group pressure in a direction opposite that of the experimenter’s commands produces a powerful shift toward the group. Changing the group movement does not yield a comparable shift in the participant’s performance. The group success in one case and failure in another can be traced directly to the configuration of motive and social forces operative in the starting situation.” That is, if the group’s attitudes are similar to or compatible with the participant’s/observer’s, there is a greater likelihood that the participant/observer will join with the group (p. 134).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} some of {{the latest}} results of a research project aimed at using composite corrugated paperboard structures for protection of products against mechanical shocks and vibration during transportation and handling. Specifically, the behaviour of multi-layered corrugated paperboard (MCPB) under shock loading is investigated. Conventionally, packaging cushion design requires the determination of the maximum expected <b>shock</b> <b>levels</b> or equivalent drop which are usually determined from statistical analysis of original field measurements. With this approach, it is generally acknowledged that the cushioning element is engineered to provide adequate protection for statistically likely events but not for extreme events with low statistical likelihood. It is reluctantly accepted that, should it occur, the latter will result in damage to the product. MCPB can be formed with a broad range of compressive characteristics and with various proportions of elastic and plastic behaviour. The objective of this experimental investigation was to determine the optimum elastic/plastic proportion to extend the protective range to include large <b>shock</b> <b>levels.</b> The experimental results obtained include the effects of compression history on the stress-strain properties of MCPB as well as the behaviour of the material in both virgin and pre-compressed form under impulsive loads. The mechanism of deformation of the corrugation...|$|R
