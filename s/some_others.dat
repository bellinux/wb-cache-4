Persistent serotonergic deficits were observed after binge like treatment in a warm environment and in both serotonergic and dopaminergic nerve endings at high ambient temperature. Oxidative stress cytotoxicity {{and an increase in}} frontal cortex lipid peroxidation were also reported.|$|E

5|$|The molars are low-crowned (brachydont), with {{relatively}} rounded (bunodont) cusps running lengthwise (selenodont), {{resulting in a}} condition known as bunoselenodonty.
