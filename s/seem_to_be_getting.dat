25|$|Lost in Translation {{director}} Sofia Coppola {{said that}} the central scene of Scarlet Johanssen and Murray {{lying on the bed}} together took multiple takes because the actors did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> along.

500|$|When Leslie {{notes to}} the camera crew that they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> along just like when they made love five years earlier, she realizes he was drunk then too. When the bar closes, the two decide to keep {{drinking}} alongside the pit outside Ann's house, which Leslie plans {{to turn into a}} park. When Leslie asks whether he thinks the park will ever be made, a pragmatic Mark says it will be a difficult process with a lot of red tape, but she remains optimistic. During a fight, Andy admits to Ann that he postponed having the casts removed, but explains it was because, [...] "I really, really like it when you serve me food." [...] Ann throws him out, and Andy sees Mark kiss Leslie. Leslie stops his advances because she does not want to move forward when he is drunk. As Mark starts to leave, he falls into the pit. An amused Andy tells Ann, who rushes out to help him while Andy goes back inside and watches television.|$|E

6000|$|Prescott, {{standing}} shakily in the moonlight, smiled. [...] "It is surprising; but hadn't {{you better}} look after Wandle? He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> up." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Wichita Linebacker" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7.0 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "good". Despite this, he wrote a mixed review, opining that [...] "as far as mysteries go, this was a so-so one," [...] that [...] "the Hearst campus rapist story just doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> the proper weight it requires," [...] and that [...] "there's also some strange tonal issues currently." [...] However, he praised the return of Weevil. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was also relatively critical, while focusing praise on Weevil's storyline. He referred to [...] "Wichita Linebacker" [...] as [...] "what I would expect were the show not so ambitious. Here, Veronica isn't going to Hearst College, she's going to Television College, where things that are college-y happen." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C+". [...] "I don't think it's being overly harsh {{to say that this}} was not one of this show's stronger or more exciting episodes. The writing was oddly flat, in the first place, and the attention to detail was subpar as well." [...] In addition, the reviewer criticized the show's treatment of its relationships. [...] "That's one of the things that's made this show great in the past -- layering in complex and important relationships while not actually being a relationship-centered show. I only hope they go somewhere with the gambling thing, because otherwise, in my opinion, this episode will have been a total waste of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|I soon {{got used}} to this singing; for the sailors never touched a rope without it. Sometimes, when no one {{happened}} to strike up, and the pulling, whatever it might be, did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> forward very well, the mate would always say, [...] "Come, men, can't any of you sing? Sing now, and raise the dead." [...] And then some {{one of them would}} begin, and if every man's arms were as much relieved as mine by the song, and he could pull as much better as I did, with such a cheering accompaniment, I am sure the song was well worth the breath expended on it. It is a great thing in a sailor to know how to sing well, for he gets a great name by it from the officers, and a good deal of popularity among his shipmates. Some sea-captains, before shipping a man, always ask him whether he can sing out at a rope.|$|E
2500|$|Criminal defense {{attorney}} Angelyn Gates of Chase Criminal Defense Attorneys raises concern that citizen groups {{are not subject}} to the same standards as trained law enforcement officials. She notes that laws are designed to keep police officers from violating citizens' rights, and that the same rules don't apply to citizens who may be violating other citizens' rights. [...] "Police officers are trained in theory," [...] Gates said. [...] " [...] are not watching out for themselves by trying to pretend they're a child on the Internet," [...] she said. [...] "They're doing it for the thrill, fun, and notoriety they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> out of it." [...] Detective Mike Burns of Darke County asserts that Perverted-Justice sets stricter criteria than many law enforcement agencies do for arrest. He contends that Perverted-Justice subscribes to protocols well within those followed by law enforcement. He does however concede, [...] "Sometimes it was a fine line, but they provided us with 140 people they were chatting with after 10 days with possibilities of showing up for a meeting. There's no way a department five times our size could have done that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Rum, isn't it? There's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{something}} of a row about it. Norris <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> rather shirty. Hullo! here comes the Deathless Author.' ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{certainly}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> uncomfortably {{near the}} truth. [...] "No doubt," [...] said I; [...] "but {{how do you}} know that he is anywhere upon the moor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> {{about as}} much as he wants," [...] Walter replied, grimly, as he darted forward to assist Sewatis in case it should become necessary.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes. You must fire {{it for me}} {{in about}} ten minutes or so, when the warriors <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> knocked up. Follow me, Hockins, and keep close." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{has great}} resolution,' said Cherry, 'but he {{always seems to}} me a sort of Christian panther of the wilderness; and you <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> him into a cage.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{would like}} to think so. But as we <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> serious, isn't the {{question}} whether it prevails or not another matter from an altruistic point of view?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The second man, Lord Peter Wimsey, says: “Nowhere [...] [...] [...] De mortuis” {{and then}} some [...] [...] [...] Yes, he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> a nice derangement of epitaphs, poor old creature.” ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{little man}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> further away. He said, from the {{distance}} {{to which he had}} withdrawn, [...] "You want {{to go to bed with}} three nightcaps on, like an old-clothes man." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I say, Nelly," [...] he whispered, [...] "Marian {{and that}} young man <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> on uncommonly well together. She looks sentimentally happy, and he seems pleased with himself. Dont you feel jealous?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I guess we'd {{better be}} going, Dolf,' said peaceable Stuffy, {{feeling that it}} would <b>be</b> wise <b>to</b> retreat before another {{skirmish}} took place, as his side <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> the worst of it.|$|R
60|$|Susan and Mrs. Greville <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> on {{very well}} together; but Elizabeth's admiration of Ida <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> speechless, {{for they were}} walking side by side without a word, perhaps too close to their elders to talk.|$|R
