25|$|Much {{of the use}} of and {{research}} on interactive writing takes place in the field of second language learning, whether <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>learning</b> English or another world language (Chinese, French, Spanish, etc.). Dialogue journals are reported as valuable instructional tools in language classes with children and adolescents, with university students, and with adults in adult education programs. The writing can take place between students and the teacher or between language learners and native language speakers. The purposes might be overall language acquisition, development of writing abilities, extension of learning of the language beyond time in class, promotion of ability to transition to academic writing in university classes, and easing of the trauma of transition to life in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The program {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} for students to develop an appreciation for different cultures and promotes greater understanding. They {{can learn a lot}} by asking questions directly to international students from various countries. Some local schools may request specific topics for volunteers to present about their country, especially if the <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>learning</b> it in class. If not, a simple PowerPoint with basic background information including geography, language, food, music, dance, sports, holidays, weather, and celebrations is sufficient. The content and depth of presentations depends on whether volunteers will be presenting to elementary, middle school or high school students or adults. Usually presentations will also include an activity for children to get involved such as learning a dance, song, game or several words and phrases in the language.|$|E

25|$|As {{classroom}} technologies {{become more}} prolific, so do multimodal assignments. Students {{in the 21st century}} have more options for communicating digitally, be it texting, blogging, or through social media. This rise in computer-controlled communication has required classes to become multimodal {{in order to}} teach students the skills required in the 21st-century work environment. However, in the classroom setting, multimodality is more than just combining multiple technologies, but rather creating meaning through the integration of multiple modes. <b>Students</b> <b>are</b> <b>learning</b> through a combination of these modes, including sound, gestures, speech, images and text. For example, in digital components of lessons, there are often pictures, videos, and sound bites as well as the text to help students grasp {{a better understanding of the}} subject. Multimodality also requires that teachers move beyond teaching with just text, as the printed word is only one of many modes students must learn and use.|$|E
25|$|Like acceleration, {{colloquium}} provides {{advanced material}} {{for high school}} students. In colloquium, students take Advanced Placement courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes {{in a different way}} than students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>learning</b> about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from The Scarlet Letter in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take Advanced Placement courses in math and science and vice versa.|$|E
