40|$|Besides {{providing}} position, navigation, {{and timing}} (PNT) to terrestrial users, GPS is currently {{used to provide}} for precision orbit determination, precise time synchronization, real-time spacecraft navigation, and three-axis control of Earth orbiting satellites. With additional Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) coming into service (GLONASS, Beidou, and Galileo), {{it will be possible}} to provide these services by using other GNSS constellations. The paper, "GPS in the <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume," presented at the ION GNSS 19 th International Technical Meeting in 2006 (Ref. 1), defined the <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume, and analyzed the performance of GPS out to 70, 000 km.

40|$|Besides {{providing}} position, navigation, {{and timing}} (PNT) services to traditional terrestrial and airborne users, GPS {{is also being}} increasingly used {{as a tool to}} enable precision orbit determination, precise time synchronization, real-time spacecraft navigation, and three-axis attitude control of Earth orbiting satellites. With additional Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constellations being replenished and coming into service (GLONASS, Beidou, and Galileo), it will become possible to benefit from greater signal availability and robustness by using evolving multi-constellation receivers. The paper, "GPS in the <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume," presented at the ION GNSS 19 th International Technical Meeting in 2006 (Ref. 1), defined the <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume, and analyzed the performance of GPS out to seventy thousand kilometers. This paper will report a similar analysis of the signal coverage of GPS in the space domain; however, the analyses will also consider signal coverage from each of the additional GNSS constellations noted earlier to specifically demonstrate the expected benefits to be derived from using GPS in conjunction with other foreign systems. The <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume is formally defined as the volume of space between three thousand kilometers altitude and geosynchronous altitude circa 36, 000 km, as compared with the Terrestrial Service Volume between 3, 000 km and the surface of the Earth. In the Terrestrial Service Volume, GNSS performance is the same as on or near the Earth's surface due to satellite vehicle availability and geometry similarities. The core GPS system has thereby established signal requirements for the <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume as part of technical Capability Development Documentation (CDD) that specifies system performance. Besides the technical discussion, we also present diplomatic efforts to extend the GPS <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume concept to other PNT service providers in an effort to assure that all space users will benefit from the enhanced interoperability of GNSS <b>services</b> in the <b>space</b> domain. A separate paper presented at the conference covers the individual GNSS performance parameters for respective <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volumes...|$|R
