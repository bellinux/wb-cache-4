40|$|The {{number of}} <b>specimens</b> {{analysed}} by the MBRS {{has been increasing}} for both alcohol and drugs.

In 1947, fossil collectors Charles M. Sternberg and T.P.

5|$|In {{the case}} of {{molecular}} studies, the preservation of a <b>specimen</b> that can vouch {{for the source of}} the tissue sample used to gather genetic data has been recommended, as genetic analysis often yields surprising results that make reexamination of the original <b>specimen</b> crucial.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} noted that the feather, the first <b>specimen</b> of Archaeopteryx described, does not {{correspond}} well with the flight-related feathers of Archaeopteryx. It certainly is a flight feather of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of feathered theropod, of which only this feather is known so far. As the feather had been designated the type <b>specimen,</b> the name Archaeopteryx should then no longer {{be applied to the}} skeletons, thus creating significant nomenclatorial confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London <b>specimen</b> explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype <b>specimen,</b> or neotype. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London <b>specimen</b> was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Madagascan sunset moth {{was first}} {{described}} by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a <b>specimen</b> obtained from a Captain May of Hammersmith. Because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The <b>specimen</b> Drury received had {{the head of a}} different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's <b>specimen</b> was found, the moth was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his <b>specimen</b> as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, William Swainson thought it was a different species than the complete <b>specimen</b> described by Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and the moth Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.|$|E
