The sulphur radical formation measured by {{electron spin resonance}} spectroscopy-spin trapping (EPR-ST) was correlated with the activity of <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase</b> and with the rate of sulphite oxidation to sulphate by PMNs. Sulphite metabolism was studied both in resting, and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated freshly isolated cells. The rate of sulphur trioxide radical formation was demonstrated by use of the spin trapping agent 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyroline- 1 -oxide (DMPO) with subsequent formation of an adduct. The intensity of adduct formation was most intense in cells with low <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity, while a mixture of the adduct and of DMPO hydroxyl radical was mainly observed in cells with high <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity. Furthermore, experiments carried out on purified <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase</b> showed that {{in the presence of}} sulphite the enzyme could also give rise to a DMPO-OH adduct. <b>Sulphite</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity in cells isolated from healthy young and old donors was positive correlated with both rates of sulphur trioxide radical formation and sulphite oxidation to sulphate, respectively. However, <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity in cells isolated from centenarians and patients with Down's syndrome seems to loose partly its rate of oxidising sulphite to sulphate.

On brief treatment of such samples with nitrate, Mo(V) signals reappeared but disappeared again on longer exposure to excess nitrate as the enzyme became fully reoxidized. Detailed investigation of the signals carried out in both 1 H 2 O and 2 H 2 O revealed the presence of two signal-giving species, referred to as 'signal A' and 'signal B', analogous to corresponding signals from nitrate reductase from Escherichia coli and from liver <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase.</b> Signal A has gav. 1. 9767 and shows coupling to a single proton, exchangeable with the solvent, with A(1 H) av. 1. 3 mT, whereas signal B shows no more than weak coupling to protons.

In order to analyse this reactivity and the clinical relevance of anti-SO antibodies in more detail, we produced human recombinant SO. Human recombinant SO (60 kDa) was expressed in Escherichia coli and applied to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Sera from patients with autoimmune liver disorders [primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) n = 96; autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) n = 77; primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) n = 39], and from patients with other hepatic (n = 154) and non-hepatic chronic inflammatory disorders (n = 113) were investigated. Highest incidence and activities of IgG-anti-SO antibodies were observed in PSC patients.

In addition the sera were assayed for anti-mitochondrial antibodies to the M 4 antigen measured by an ELISA to <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase</b> (SO). First, anti-M 2 was detected, not only in 58 out of 60 patients with PBC but also in eight out of 61 patients with ACA. These sera, together with sera from 53 normals and 99 from patients with various connective tissue diseases were then evaluated for anti-SO, which has been proposed by Klein and Berg to be a marker of progressive liver disease. Again, a high proportion (62 %) of sera from patients with PBC were positive for anti-SO, and three of the eight patients who had ACA and anti-M 2 also reacted with SO. We subsequently identified and included for study a further 10 patients positive for ACA and anti-M 2, making a total of 18 patients with this profile. Features of limited cutaneous scleroderma were present in 94 % and evidence of liver disease in 56 %. Eight out of the 18 patients had anti-SO, and of these four had PBC, two had abnormal biochemical liver function tests but two had no evidence of liver disease.

40|$|A low {{volume and}} long optical path spectroelectrochemical cell was {{constructed}} and {{tested in a}} number of applications such as detection of direct electron transfer (DET) between redox enzymes and gold electrodes, determination of the formal potentials of redox centres in proteins and enzymes, as well as mechanistic studies of heterogeneous and intermolecular electron transfer of copper oxidases and succinate:quinine oxidoreductase (Complex II). The existence of DET between enzymes and electrodes was demonstrated for theophylline oxidase, cytochrome P 450 cam, laccase, bilirubin oxidase, <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase</b> and Complex II. Spectroelectrochemical investigations of the ET between blue multi-copper oxidases and gold electrodes demonstrated that the mechanism of heterogeneous ET of laccases on gold is completely different from that usually observed on carbon electrodes. At carbon electrodes laccases are electronically connected to the conducting electrode through the T 1 copper centre. At gold surfaces, by contrast, the electronic connection of the laccase redox centre to the surface is established through the T 2 copper centre. Such an ET connection between the gold surface and the T 2 copper centre, severely disturbs the oxygen reduction reaction catalysed by laccase. Similar observation was made for two bilirubin oxidases. Spectroelectrochemical studies of Complex II in the gold capillary cell showed that DET for intact Complex II is realised through the heme center with a low redox potential, hemeL. The study of DET reactions in combination with specific ET mediators and inhibitors, suggested that a postulated proximal quinone binding site may indeed exist in the Complex II structure.

Deletion mutants constructed in either {{or both of the}} tatA 1 and tatA 2 genes displayed distinct growth and enzyme activity phenotypes. For <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase</b> (SorAB), the multi-copper oxidase (CueO) and alkaline phosphatase (PhoX), complete dependency on TatA 1 for correct periplasmic activity was observed. However, the activities of nitrate reductase (NapA), formate dehydrogenase (FdhA) and trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TorA) were significantly reduced in the tatA 2 mutant. In contrast, the specific rate of fumarate reduction catalysed by the flavoprotein subunit of the methyl menaquinone fumarate reductase (MfrA) was similar in periplasmic fractions of both the tatA 1 and the tatA 2 mutants and only the deletion of both genes abolished activity. Nevertheless, unprocessed MfrA accumulated in the periplasm of the tatA 1 (but not tatA 2) mutant, indicating aberrant signal peptide cleavage. Surprisingly, TatA 2 lacks two conserved residues (Gln 8 and Phe 39) known to be essential in Escherichia coli TatA and we suggest it is unable to function correctly in the absence of TatA 1. Finally, only two TAT chaperones (FdhM and NapD) are encoded in strain NCTC 11168, which mutant studies confirmed are highly specific for formate dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase assembly, respectively. Thus, other TAT substrates must use general chaperones in their biogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Sulphate {{assimilation}} provides reduced sulphur for {{the synthesis}} of cysteine, methionine, and numerous other essential metabolites and secondary compounds. The key step in the pathway is the reduction of activated sulphate, adenosine 5 ′-phosphosulphate (APS), to sulphite catalysed by APS reductase (APR). In the present study, [35 S]sulphur flux from external sulphate into glutathione (GSH) and proteins was analysed to check whether APR controls the flux through the sulphate assimilation pathway in poplar roots under some stress conditions and in transgenic poplars. (i) O-Acetylserine (OAS) induced APR activity and the sulphur flux into GSH. (ii) The herbicide Acetochlor induced APR activity and results in a decline of GSH. Thereby the sulphur flux into GSH or protein remained unaffected. (iii) Cd treatment increased APR activity without any changes in sulphur flux but lowered sulphate uptake. Several transgenic poplar plants that were manipulated in sulphur metabolism were also analysed. (i) Transgenic poplar plants that overexpressed the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-ECS) gene, the enzyme catalysing the key step in GSH formation, showed an increase in sulphur flux into GSH and sulphate uptake when γ-ECS was targeted to the cytosol, while no changes in sulphur flux were observed when γ-ECS was targeted to plastids. (ii) No effect on sulphur flux was observed when the <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase</b> (SO) gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, which catalyses the back reaction of APR, that is the reaction from sulphite to sulphate, was overexpressed. (iii) When Lemna minor APR was overexpressed in poplar, APR activity increased as expected, but no changes in sulphur flux were observed. For all of these experiments the flux control coefficient for APR was calculated. APR as a controlling step in sulphate assimilation seems obvious under OAS treatment, in γ-ECS and SO overexpressing poplars. A possible loss of control under certain conditions, that is Cd treatment, Acetochlor treatment, and in APR overexpressing poplar, is discussed...|$|E

Materials and methods: Fish (the first trophic level) were exposed to both metals (singly and in mixture) using cadmium chloride (CdCl 2) {{as the source of}} cadmium and arsenic trioxide (AS 2 O 3) as the source of arsenic at a concentration of 0. 4  mg of metals/ 100  ml of water for 1 month and then sacrificed. The contaminated fish were then used as a source of protein in compounding the experimental diet to which the rats (the second trophic level) were exposed to for a period of 1 and 3 months. The Cd- and As-load in the feed and tissues of rats as well as the activities of the oxidative enzymes were subsequently analyzed in the various tissues after both period of exposure. Results: Metal analysis on the tissues of rats showed that the metals accumulated more in the liver than in other organs after the 1 month exposure but accumulated more in the kidney after the 3 months exposure. The activities of the oxidative enzymes in the liver were significantly (P <  0. 05) decreased in all test groups after the 1 and 3 months exposure. However, after the 1 month exposure, the kidney, testes and heart showed an initial increase in the activities of these enzymes which were decreased after the 3 months exposure. In the brain, the activities of these enzymes were increased in both duration of study. Conclusion: From the results obtained in the current study, it could be concluded that exposure to cadmium and arsenic through the food chain leads to accumulation of these metals in the tissues of experimental rats leading to the inhibition of oxidative enzymes, thus affecting several normal metabolic processes...|$|E

Detailed studies were made from e. p. r. spectra recorded at about 120 K and more limited studies from spectra of liquid samples at about 295 K and also from enzyme activity measurements. Interconversion between low-pH and high-pH Mo(V) e. p. r. signal-giving species [described by Lamy, Gutteridge & Bray (1980) Biochem. J. 185, 397 - 403] is influenced by chloride concentration, a 10 -fold increase in concentration (in the range of about 1 mM to 100 mM) causing an increase of about 1 pH unit in the apparent pK for the conversion. This suggests that chloride is a constituent of the low-pH species. In support of this, high concentrations of fluoride modified the e. p. r. spectrum. Partial conversion to a Mo(V) species, in which F- has presumably replaced Cl- and showing hyperfine coupling of A(19 F) av. 0. 5 mT, is indicated. It is proposed that interconversion between high-pH and low-pH species is of the form: (formula; see text) No evidence that Cl- is essential for enzymic activity was found. Data relating to equilibria amongst low-pH, high-pH and also the phosphate species are presented. Depending on pH and on concentrations of Cl- and H 2 PO 4 -, one, two, or all three species may be present. Qualitatively, under appropriate conditions, the phosphate species tends to replace {{some or all of}} the low-pH species. Quantitative analysis by a computer procedure permitted an appropriate scheme to be deduced and equilibrium constants to be evaluated. Studies on the e. p. r. signals at 295 K indicated that similar equilibria applied in liquid solution, but with some changes in the values of the constants. The structure of the molybdenum centre in its various states and the nature of the enzymic reaction are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Different {{inhibition}} {{types of}} the saturation kinetics involving a synthesized model complex, [Bu 4 N] 3 [MoVIO 2 (mnt) 2] (E) (where mnt 2 - = 1, 2 -dicyanoethylenedithiolate), and HSO 3 - as the substrate (S) by structurally similar anions SO 4 (2 -), H 2 PO 4 - and H 2 PO 3 - {{have been shown}} {{for the first time}} in relevance to the reductive half reaction of the native enzyme <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase.</b> SO 4 (2 -) acts as a competitive inhibitor. The mixed-type non-competitive inhibition by H 2 PO 4 - and the sigmoidal-type inhibition by H 2 PO 3 - are explained by a diamond-configuration random-order model. This involves a random binding sequence of the substrate and the inhibitor, and forms, in addition to two binary complexes [enzyme-substrate (ES) and enzyme-inhibitor (EI) ], one enzyme-substrate-inhibitor-type ternary complex (ESI) by participation of at least one more binding site in addition to the catalytic site. This is possible in the present case only by co-ordination enhancement of molybdenum in E. This co-ordination expansion is brought about by nucleophilic attack of the substrate or the inhibitor at the molybdenum, forming a hepta-coordinated binary complex with the generation of an oxoanionic functional site, called the allosteric site. Analysis of the experimental data suggests that the inhibition by H 2 PO 4 - is due to the mechanism following either equilibrium conditions or a combination of steady-state and equilibrium conditions. With H 2 PO 3 -, the inhibition is due to the mechanism following the steady-state conditions. It is also shown that the ternary complex involving the enzyme, substrate and H 2 PO 4 - or H 2 PO 3 - is productive, but at a lower rate than that of the enzyme-substrate binary complex. Mixed-type inhibition with H 2 PO 4 - is actually of the type called "partially mixed competitive and non-competitive' as the inhibitor binds both to the catalytic site and to the allosteric site. The sigmoidal-type inhibition by H 2 PO 3 - is similar to heterotropic allosteric effect of mixed V,K type with the distinction, however, that the significance of co-operativity in this case is of kinetic importance only...|$|E
40|$|An {{assay method}} is {{described}} for measurement of absolute concentrations of the molybdenum cofactor, based on complementation of the defective nitrate reductase ('apo nitrate reductase') in extracts of the nit- 1 mutant of Neurospora crassa. A number of alternative methods are described for preparing, anaerobically, molybdenum-cofactor-containing solutions from <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase,</b> xanthine oxidase and desulpho xanthine oxidase. For assay, these were mixed with {{an excess of}} extract of the nit- 1 mutant, incubated for 24 h at 3. 5 degrees C then assayed for NADPH:nitrate reductase activity. In all cases, the specific activity of the molybdenum cofactor, expressed as mumol of NO 2 -formed/min per ng-atom of Mo added from the denatured molybdoenzyme, was 25 +/- 4, a value that agrees with the known catalytic activity of the nitrate reductase of wild-type Neurospora crassa. This indicates that, under our conditions, there was quantitative transfer of the molybdenum cofactor from denatured molybdoenzyme to yield fully active nitrate reductase. Comparable cofactor assay methods of previous workers, apparently indicating transfer efficiencies of at best a few per cent, have never excluded satisfactorily the possibility that cofactor activity arose, not from stoichiometric constituents of the molybdoenzymes, but from contaminants. The following factors were investigated separately in developing the assay:the efficiency of extraction of the cofactor from the original enzyme, {{the efficiency of the}} complementation reaction between cofactor and apo nitrate reductase, and the assay of the resultant nitrate reductase, which must be carried out under non-inhibitory conditions. Though the cofactor is unstable in air (t 1 / 2 about 15 min at 3. 5 degrees C), it is stable when kept anaerobic in the presence of sodium dithionite, in aqueous solution or in dimethyl sulphoxide (activity lost at the rate of about 3 %/ 24 h at 20 - 25 degrees C). Studies of stabilities, and investigations of the effect of added molybdate on the assay, permit conclusions to be drawn about the ligation of molybdenum to the cofactor and about steps in incorporation of the cofactor into the apoenzyme. Though the development of nitrate reductase activity is slow at 3. 5 degrees C (t 1 / 2 1. 5 - 3 h) the complementation reaction may be carried out in high yield, aerobically. This is ascribed to rapid formation of an air-stable but catalytically inactive complex of the cofactor, as a precursor of the active nitrate reductase. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} whether photo-oxidation of Type I or II are the predominant action mechanisms; d-mannitol, a quencher of hydroxyl radical (Type I) and tryptophan or sodium azide, quenchers of singlet oxygen (Type II) were used (Street et al. 2009). The results, resumed in Table  2, show that under these conditions, sodium azide (10  mM), {{which is known}} to react especially with singlet oxygen (Costa et al. 2013) and mainly as a physical quencher of 1 O 2 (Bancirova 2011), failed to show any bacteria protection as the same survival fraction (20 %) for the RB alone was obtained. As shown in Table  2, l-Trp, used as singlet oxygen trapping agent (Street et al. 2009), protected significantly S. aureus against photoactivated RB by 78 % (its survival is more than 99 %; 0.69 log units reduction on bacteria photoinactivation rate) after 10  min of phototreatment (ANOVA, p[*]<[*] 0.05). The same extent of S. aureus protection as obtained by l-Trp, occurred {{in the presence of}} d-mannitol, as an alcoholic sugar which has an antioxidant effect; it reacts especially with hydroxyl free radical (Liang et al. 2008; Al-Omari and Ali 2009). Accordingly, this substance {{is considered to be a}} strong free radical scavenger (Sagone et al. 1983; Kamat et al. 2000). Some experiments have shown that it can prevent enzymes inactivation such as glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD), nitrate-reductase and <b>sulphite</b> <b>oxidase</b> by ionizing radiations (Eichler et al. 1987). d-mannitol can protect supercoiled DNA from hydroxyl radical damage due to ionizing radiation (Peak et al. 1995). The rate of photoprotection powered by l-Trp and d-mannitol was significant (ANOVA, p[*]<[*] 0.05) during the first 10  min of illumination (Table  2). These results prove that the RB photosensitization reaction, was especially proceeded by the Type I pathway generating predominantly hydroxyl radicals (.OH) and Type II (1 O 2 production). For sodium azide as singlet oxygen quencher, there is no bacterial protection than that obtained in the presence of l-Trp which was comparable to that obtained with d-mannitol, used as free radical scavenger. The results obtained for sodium azide and l-Trp with the RB are unexpected since both are considered in the literature, as singlet oxygen quenchers (Tavares et al. 2011). The results obtained show that the selection of l-Trp as singlet oxygen quencher can give, depending on the PS, erroneous information about the type of mechanism involved in the photodynamic inactivation process. Thirty minutes after treatment by RB and light, the sensitized S. aureus lost more than 90 % of its viability (reduction of 1 log unit). The same rate of killing occurred in the presence of quenchers which failed to show any protection (Table  2). On the other hand, the quenchers that proved their protective ability showed that the killing rate in their presence was reduced to almost the same extent as the protection provided by them. We propose two possible explanations. The first one is that RB molecules, in the absence of culture media (in saline), might be in close contact with the bacteria, ROS produced mainly HO. and 1 O 2, might not be stopped efficiently by quenchers with increasing contact time. Consequently, a high percentage of the bacteria population is killed. Similar explanation was reported by Nitzan et al. (1989) under their own experimental conditions. The second explanation concerns the concentration used of the quenchers. In fact, in all the protection experiments, the amount of the proposed quenchers was 500 -fold higher than the amount of the RB added to the culture. According to authors, a plausible explanation can be the use of low quencher concentrations. The choice of the folding between PS and quenchers used was inspired from the work of Nitzan et al. (1989), in all their protection experiments, the amount of the proposed quencher was 70 – 700 -fold higher than the amount of the overall PS added to the culture.|$|E
