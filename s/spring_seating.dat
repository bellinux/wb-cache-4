2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two {{suspension cylinders}} mounted horizontally {{on each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder. The springs are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like bellcranks by pull rods (tie rods). These are connected to <b>spring</b> <b>seating</b> cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front pull rod compresses the front spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear spring assembly and pull rod. When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the axle box housing in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the axle box seating area. the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> sits on the washers. The lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> is a tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> a polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the axle box guide. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide works as a piston in the Lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> filled with oil. This helps in damping the vibrations caused during running train operation.|$|R
50|$|As the {{top portion}} of the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> is not sealed and only covered {{with the help of}} a {{protective}} tube also called the dashpot cover, the rising oil has a tendency to shoot above the top rim of the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> and spill out.|$|R
50|$|The bolster springs are {{supported}} on a lower spring beam. The lower spring beam is a fabricated structure {{made of steel}} plates. It is trapezoidal in shape with small steel tubes on each end. The location of the bolster <b>spring</b> <b>seating</b> is marked by two circular grooves in the center. A rubber washer is placed at the grooved section. The bolster spring sits on the rubber washer. The lower spring beam is also a free-floating structure. It is not bolted or welded either to the bogie frame or the bogie bolster. It {{is attached to the}} bogie frame on the outside {{with the help of a}} steel hanger. They are traditionally called the BSS Hangers (Bogie Secondary Suspension Hangers). A BSS pin is placed in the tubular section in the end portion of the lower spring beam. A hanger block is placed below the BSS pin. The BSS hanger in turn supports the hanger. This arrangement is done on all the four corners of the lower spring beam. The top end of the hanger also has a similar arrangement. However, instead of the BSS pin, steel brackets are welded on the lower side of the bogie frame of which the BSS hanger hangs with the help of hanger block. This arrangement is same for all the four top corners of the hangers. Hence, the lower spring beam also become a floating member hinged to the bogie frame with the help of hangers on the top and the bottom. This allows for the longitudinal movement of the lower spring beam.|$|E

However, the clearances of the protective tube and the outer dia of the proposed conical section {{at the top of the}} lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> needs to be taken care of ...|$|R
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat)</b> and the piston (axle box guide). Axle box springs are placed on the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> placed on the axle box wing of the axle box housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> for cushioning effect. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the axle box guide. The end portion of the axle box guide is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The axle box guide moves in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower <b>Spring</b> <b>seat</b> and the axle box guide is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the axle box guide moves down. The downward movement of the Axle box guide puts pressure on the oil in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat.</b> The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the axle box guide. This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The axle box guide displaces the oil in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the axle box guide, the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|R

30|$|After {{assembly}} of the bogie, {{the upper end of}} the lever-type damper fits closely with one side of the bolster. In application, the lever-type damper rotates by a slight angle around the pivot because of irregularities in the track, and thus only requires a small space for installation. In practice, cracks in the side frame mainly occur on the top of the side frame pedestal and the brake chutes [18]. The lever-type damper is located on the side-frame <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> which, whilst it would slightly decrease the static strength of the <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> would not significantly weaken the fatigue strength of the side frame.|$|R

40|$|A shaker with a Terfenol-D rod {{actuator}} {{includes a}} mass coupled to {{both ends of}} the rod through a <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> a <b>spring</b> seat/adjuster and a spring washer. The actuator is mounted inside a cylindrical coil, which in turn is mounted inside a cylindrical permanent magnet, which in turn is mounted inside a cylindrical housing. An electrical drive system provides a predetermined excitation signal to the coil to cause the rod to vibrate {{under the influence of the}} magnetic field generated by the coil. One embodiment features a vibrating mass on one end of the rod. An implantable shaker includes a seal to leak-proof the shaker and a coating of Biomer™. The implantable shaker can be implanted in an animal to test tissue response to certain vibrations. According to another embodiment, the Terfenol-D rod actuator is held in place on one end with a pre-stress adjusting screw, which is threaded into the end of the housing and fixed in place with a jam nut. In all embodiments, a <b>spring</b> base is <b>seated</b> on one end of the rod actuator and forms an annular coaxial air gap between it and a <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> so that the air gap remains constant when the rod actuator vibrates and the spring base moves coaxially with respect to the <b>spring</b> <b>seat...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{operating}} conditions of “side-load” springs, which are typically employed in McPherson suspensions, were analysed by finite element analysis. The finite element model, including {{the spring and}} {{the upper and lower}} <b>spring</b> <b>seats,</b> is firstly described in the paper; the spring geometry was accurately obtained by a reverse engineering procedure based on two video cameras and a video projector. Surface to surface contact elements were defined between spring and seats; the initial assembling phase of the <b>spring</b> between the <b>seats</b> was also included in the finite element analysis. The experimental rig, employed for spring characterisation, and the performed numerical analyses are then presented; results are discussed in comparison with experimental data, in terms of spring characteristic, side-load force and thrust axis spatial position, as a function of spring compression. A fully satisfactory agreement was generally observed between numerical results and experiments. The effect of lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> orientation on results was also investigated by numerical analysis. A higher inclination of the lower seat appeared to increase the side-load force; at the same time, for a given configuration, the thrust axis orientation, remained almost constant during suspension compression...|$|R
