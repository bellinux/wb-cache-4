Eth-anol-induced oxidative stress appears to be one mecha-nism by which ethanol causes liver injury. The protec-tive effect of aqueous plant extract of Aframomum melegueta on ethanol-induced toxicity was investigated in male Wistar rats. The rats were treated with 45 % ethanol (4. 8 g/kg b. w. t.) for 16 days to induce alcoholic diseases in the liver. The activities of <b>alanine</b> amino-transferase, aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> and triglyceride were monitored and the histological changes in liver examined in order to evaluate the protective effects of the plant extract. Hepatic malondialdehyde and re-duced glutathione, as well as superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase activities were determined for the antioxidant status. Chronic ethanol administration resulted in a statistically significant elevation of <b>serum</b> <b>alanine</b> <b>aminotransferases</b> and triglyceride levels, as well as a decrease in reduced glutathione and super-oxide dismutase which was dramatically attenuated by the co-administration of the plant extract. Histologi-cal changes were related to these indices. Co-adminis-tration of the plant extract suppressed the elevation of lipid peroxidation, restored the reduced glutathion, and enhanced the superoxide dismutase activity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of {{specific}} adhesion molecules in cholestasis-induced leukocyte recruitment {{in the liver}} is not known. Therefore, the aim of our experimental study was to evaluate the role of lymphocyte function antigen- 1 (LFA- 1) in cholestatic liver injury. METHODS: C 57 BL/ 6 mice underwent bile duct ligation for 12 hours. Mice were pretreated with an anti-LFA- 1 antibody or control antibody. Subsequently, hepatic accumulation of leukocytes and sinusoidal perfusion were determined by means of intravital fluorescence microscopy. Hepatocellular damage was monitored by measuring <b>serum</b> levels of <b>alanine</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> and aspartate aminotransferase. CXC chemokines in the liver were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Bile duct ligation provoked clear-cut recruitment of leukocytes and liver damage, as indicated by increased serum activities of liver enzymes and sinusoidal perfusion failure. Neutrophils expressed greater levels of LFA- 1 and inhibition of LFA- 1 significantly decreased <b>serum</b> activity of <b>alanine</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> and aspartate aminotransferase levels in cholestatic mice. Immunoneutralization of LFA- 1 reduced leukocyte adhesion in postsinusoidal venules that had been induced by bile duct ligation, whereas leukocyte rolling and sinusoidal accumulation were not changed. Moreover, blocking LFA- 1 function restored sinusoidal perfusion in cholestatic animals. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate an important role of LFA- 1 in supporting cholestasis-induced leukocyte recruitment in the liver. Thus, targeting LFA- 1 may help to protect against pathologic inflammation and liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases...|$|R
