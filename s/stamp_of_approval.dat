The case was brought to court by the RSPCA and the two men were found guilty. The court's sentence was 200 hours community service.

Her mind had been turned to the subject by reading a manuscript from Broughton's Dictionary giving an account {{of some of the most}} common of the sects. The publication of A View of Religions was published in 1784, in accordance with the custom of the time, after subscriptions had been obtained to the' proposal' of the work, sufficient in number to warrant its issue. It was fairly profitable, but owing to a bad bargain with the printer the author's returns were slight, A second edition with additions, secured by copyright, then newly established by law, was published in 1791, at the instance of influential Boston friends whom the first issue had made for her. This edition was dedicated to John Adams, then Vice-President of the United States, who had headed its list of subscribers, which included such leading names as Samuel Adams, John Hancock, President Joseph Willard of Harvard College, Rt Rev. John Carroll, D.D., the Roman Catholic Bishop of Baltimore, the Rev. Henry Ware, and the Rev. Adoniram Judson. Her father was an enthusiastic seller of the book, traveling about the country on horseback with saddlebags filled with the volumes. A fourth edition of her first work, with further additions, appeared in 1817, under the broader title of A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations.

As Waite wrote, the voices of two great contemporaries, Thomas M. Cooley and Stephen J. Field, must have been echoing in his mind. Cooley′s classic treatise, Constitutional Limitations, first published in 1868, had become a canonical text for jurists, and Cooley’s support of due process in its emerging form gave the <b>stamp</b> <b>of</b> scholarly <b>approval</b> to an interpretation that seemed ethically more and more imperative.” ...|$|R

He stated that:"Far from being a <b>stamp</b> <b>of</b> final <b>approval,</b> a post-(mortem)-script to the game, the jigsaw piece represents the admission of the subject's missing survival instinct, the corporeal body's non-relational or 'snagged' desire. Those marked with jigsaw pieces are the ones that got away, left inert, reduced to the zero intensity of death. It would seem strange that Jigsaw - surely the last figure ever to be deemed sentimental - should choose to extract this symbolic jigsaw piece from these subjects, except that Jigsaw is linguistically consistent in explaining how he 'takes' or 'cuts' the piece of skin. The jigsaw shape marking those who 'fail' is the adding of a subtraction - in effect, the removal of their inability, their unfulfilled potential or their lack - the excision that leaves the whole of the body that is not the closed, inert corporeal body but is, instead, the 'body-without-organs', that is, the nexus point where energy pools amid the flow and fold of forces and durations, existence beyond the living organism." ...|$|R

At the same time, the apparently predictive nature of the inquiry has invited into the courtroom a kind of 2 ̆ 2 expert testimony 2 ̆ 2 on future criminal behavior so discredited that its practitioners have been expelled from the governing bodies of American psychiatry.
