40|$|In this decade, Under Water Sensor Network (UWSN) {{has become}} {{important}} {{in order to}} explore the underwater environment. The characteristics of UWSN such as limited energy, low bandwidth, high propagation delay, and error rate has made the design of clustering protocol challenging, due to the energy constrained sensor nodes. As the unpleasant environmental condition of the underwater, replacement of the battery is neither simple nor cheap. Therefore, energy saving {{is considered to be}} an important issue. A new clustering protocol is proposed which is named as energy ecient SNR based clustering in UWSN with Data Encryption (EESCDE). The residual energy of the nodes is considered for the improvement of the network lifetime of the sensor network. Using the proposed scheme, the improvement in the residual energy is achieved by reducing the number of transmission of the cluster head as well as the sensor nodes. The sensor nodes are partitioned into clusters and the cluster heads (CH) are chosen depending on the SNR values. <b>Symmetric</b> <b>encipherment</b> is implemented using the hill cipher to achieve the security of the sensed data. In Clustered-Underwater Wireless sensor networks (CUWSNs), battery operated sensing devices are grouped and connected with each other through wireless interfaces. Energy and processing eciency are the two important parameters in these systems. CUWSNs with reduced number of transmissions utilize less energy and prolong the lifetime of the network. A new protocol is proposed which is named as selective data transmission in SNR based cluster (SCSD). In this protocol, clustersare formed and the cluster heads (CH) are chosen depending on the SNR values. The number of transmissions of the cluster head and the sensor nodes are reducedby selectively transmitting the data. It also avoids congestion problem. This scheme has been implemented using NS 3 and it is observed that the residual energy of the sensor nodes are improved by 10 percent. as compared to the algorithm, Efficient Secure Routing Protocol For SNR based Dynamic Cluster (ESRPSDC), and by 2 percent as compared to direct data transmission...|$|E
