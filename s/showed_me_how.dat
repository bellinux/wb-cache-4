[...] Cropper later recorded an instrumental version of the song with Booker T. & the M.G.'s for their 1965 Soul Dressing album.|$|E
500|$|Wilde left Portora with a royal {{scholarship}} to read classics at Trinity College, Dublin, from 1871 to 1874, sharing rooms with {{his older brother}} Willie Wilde. Trinity, {{one of the leading}} classical schools, placed him with scholars such as R. Y. Tyrell, Arthur Palmer, Edward Dowden and his tutor, J. P. Mahaffy who inspired his interest in Greek literature. As a student Wilde worked with Mahaffy on the latter's book Social Life in Greece. Wilde, despite later reservations, called Mahaffy [...] "my first and best teacher" [...] and [...] "the scholar who <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to love Greek things". For his part, Mahaffy boasted of having created Wilde; later, he named him [...] "the only blot on my tutorship".|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler, working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, {{learning}} {{to hit the ball}} to right field. Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball. Robinson also noted that [...] "Sisler <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second". The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from [...]296 in 1948 to [...]342 in 1949. In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored. For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player Award for the National League. Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All-Star Game—the first All-Star Game to include black players.|$|E

2500|$|Keyboards {{are also}} known to emit {{electromagnetic}} signatures {{that can be}} detected using special spying equipment to reconstruct the keys pressed on the keyboard. [...] Neal O'Farrell, {{executive director of the}} Identity Theft Council, revealed to InformationWeek that [...] "More than 25 years ago, a couple of former spooks <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> they could capture a user's ATM PIN, from a van parked across the street, simply by capturing and decoding the electromagnetic signals generated by every keystroke," [...] O'Farrell said. [...] "They could even capture keystrokes from computers in nearby offices, but the technology wasn't sophisticated enough to focus in on any specific computer." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{also found}} a {{striking}} contrast with other churches in the common attribution of responsibility for conversion to [...] "a spiritual guide ... the person who acted as the intermediary with the Watchtower movement and who supervised the initial process of learning and reforming". Beckford cited an interview [...] "representative of many" [...] in which a convert recalled initially resisting the Watch Tower Society's teachings until he was [...] "talked into making a serious study of the scriptures ... I had plenty of objections and was sure the Witnesses were wrong, but (the Witness leading the personal Bible study sessions) <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> {{the facts of the}} Bible could not be faulted".|$|E

2500|$|Jinkins {{was also}} very {{involved}} in the show's music. One of the show's most notable elements is its unique soundtrack, which consist of various mouth sounds by voice actor Fred Newman. [...] "Fred <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> you could take out a guitar and use a tuna can filled with water that you'd thump with your finger," [...] said Jinkins. In the series' Doug's favorite rock group is the Beets, a play on the Beatles. The band's members also visually resemble Ringo Starr of the Beatles and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin, and their penchant for endless reunion tours owes to the Who. Jinkins viewed the series' music as an accent to the storytelling.|$|E
2500|$|Tatum played chords with a {{relatively}} flat-fingered technique compared to the curvature taught in classical training. [...] Composer/pianist Mary Lou Williams told Whitney Balliett, [...] "Tatum {{taught me how to}} hit my notes, how to control them without using pedals. And he <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to keep my fingers flat on the keys to get that clean tone." [...] Jimmy Rowles said, [...] "Most of the stuff he played was clear over my head. [...] There was too much going on—both hands were impossible to believe. [...] You couldn't pick out what he was doing because his fingers were so smooth and soft, and the way he did it—it was like camouflage." [...] When his fastest tracks of [...] "Tiger Rag" [...] are slowed down, they still reveal a coherent, syncopated rhythm.|$|E
