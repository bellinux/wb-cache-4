5|$|Gauguin was {{foremost}} a painter; {{he came to}} ceramics around 1886, when he {{was taught}} by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on <b>stoneware</b> pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles.|$|E
5|$|Some locally-made items {{included}} prismatic obsidian blades and a polished nodule of iron pyrite {{for use as}} a mirror. Other {{items included}} weapons and instruments for navigation. A mariner's astrolabe is the oldest such instrument with a confirmed date. Pewter objects from England were found and <b>stoneware</b> from Cologne, Germany. In the end about 1,500 artifacts were retrieved from the San Esteban, 85% of them from the conglomerates.|$|E
5|$|Pipeline transport: The ancient Chinese {{made use}} of {{channels}} and pipe systems for public works. The Han Dynasty court eunuch Zhang Rang (d. 189AD) ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside {{the capital city of}} Luoyang. These chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a <b>stoneware</b> pipe system.|$|E

50|$|The {{porcelain}} from Thailand were {{consisted of}} {{a large bowl with}} a fish design drawn in iron pigment inside made in the Sukhothai kiln. As for the <b>stonewares,</b> it was a black brown glazed four-eared jar and was manufactured in Noi River kiln.|$|R
5|$|Red wares were {{imported}} from southeastern Utah until , when the Chacoans switched to orange ware products originating from northeastern Arizona, near Kayenta. After 1000, almost no pottery {{was fired in}} the canyon, but was instead produced in outlying communities with access to {{a steady supply of}} firewood for their kilns. During the period from 1030 to 1100, significantly more pottery was imported to the canyon than before. The extensive Puebloan trade network that dispersed <b>stoneware</b> products throughout the region suggests that, although evidence of large-scale production is lacking, proficient local artisans supplied distant communities as well as their own.|$|E
5|$|Rococo {{provided}} {{a brief but}} significant interlude in Norway, appearing primarily in the decorative arts, and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and <b>stoneware.</b> In some country districts folk artists produced the distinctly Norwegian craft of decorative painting, rosemaling, and related wood carving style. In polite architecture, a few wooden town houses and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, Damsgård Manor in Bergen being the most significant.|$|E
5|$|Dragon kiln: Dragon kilns were {{traditional}} Chinese kilns {{used for}} Chinese ceramics. According to recent excavations in Shangyu District {{in the northeast}} of Zhejiang province and elsewhere, {{the origins of the}} dragon kiln may go back as far as the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 to 1046 BCE), and is linked to the introduction of <b>stoneware,</b> fired at 1200°C or more. These kilns were much smaller than later examples, at some 5–12 metres long, and also sloped far less. The type had certainly developed by the Warring States period, and by the Eastern Wu kingdom (220–280 CE), there were over 60 kilns at Shangyu. Thereafter it remained the main design used in southern China until the Ming dynasty. The pottery areas of south China are mostly hilly, whereas those on the plains of north China typically lack suitable slopes; here the mantou kiln type predominated. The Nanfeng Kiln in Guangdong province is several centuries old and still functioning. It was a producer of Shiwan ware as well as architectural ceramics, and today also functions as a tourist attraction.|$|E
40|$|Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis {{was used}} for this study of <b>stonewares</b> {{collected}} from the site of the Buena Vista/Oregon Pottery Company (1866 - 1890). The results show significant chemical signatures in the samples tested. Thorium/ytterbium and thorium/chromium ratios within their respective ranges of variation demonstrate a relative conformity among all samples of Buena Vista ceramics...|$|R
5000|$|Longquan celadon wares, {{were first}} {{made during the}} Northern Song, but flourished under the Southern Song, as the capital moved {{to the south and}} the {{northern}} kilns declined. This had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and the bodies increasingly had high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain wares made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than <b>stonewares.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{porcelain}} from Northern Vietnam {{was also}} blue-and-white ware which were manufactured in Chu Dau kiln. These were consisted of bowls, dishes, pots, jarlets, covered boxes and lastly water droppers. Meanwhile, the porcelain and <b>stonewares</b> from Central Vietnam were speculated {{to be produced}} on the Go Sanh kiln in Binh Dinh Province in Central Vietnam. These consisted mainly of celadon saucers and dishes with an unglazed ring portion inside it.|$|R
5|$|Gauguin {{made three}} casts in 1894, each in {{partially}} glazed <b>stoneware.</b> Several other copies exist in plaster or bronze. His {{sale of the}} casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked that {{for one of the}} reproductions to act as a marker for his grave. A cast was not placed there until 1973. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of the Oviri figure he made to Stéphane Mallarmé where he called the figure a strange and cruel enigma; in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard where he referred to it as La Tueuse ("The Murderess"); and in a c. 1899 drawing where he appends an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta. Oviri was exhibited at the 1906 Salon d'Automne (no.57) where it influenced Pablo Picasso, who based one of the figures in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon on it.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set at relatively high rates on a sliding scale, ranging from a penny for pedestrians to 2s6d for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, {{the area around the}} bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts (later Royal Doulton) <b>stoneware</b> factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid to investors were low.|$|E
5|$|Japanese pottery {{is one of}} the country's oldest {{art forms}} dating to the neolithic period, and some of the world's oldest {{earthenware}} from about 14,000BC has been discovered in Japan. Early pottery objects were made of clay, unglazed and without ornamentation. Later, during the Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun periods, simple patterned designs and molded ornamentations were added. Such early techniques were formed by coiling or scratching and firing pieces at low temperatures. High-fired Korean Sue ware, and with it the pottery wheel, arrived in Japan around the 6th century, marking the beginning of major technological advances imported from the mainland. <b>Stoneware</b> originated in Japan with the development of green-glazed and other color glazed pottery {{in the second half of}} the 7th century. The oldest item in this list is a green-glazed funerary pot from the 12th century.|$|E
50|$|Under the Kangxi Emperor's reign (1662-1722) the Chinese {{porcelain}} industry at Jingdezhen was reorganised and the export trade soon flourished again. Chinese export porcelain {{from the late}} 17th century included Blue and white and Famille verte wares (and occasionally Famille noire and Famille jaune). Wares included garnitures of vases, dishes, teawares, ewers, and other useful wares along with figurines, animals and birds. Blanc de Chine porcelains and Yixing <b>stonewares</b> arriving in Europe and gave inspiration to many European potters.|$|R
2500|$|... 1651 – The Antanosy briefly {{took over}} control of Fort Dauphin. After Flacourt was able to drive off {{thousands}} of Antanosy, led by king Ramaka, who attacked the fort, he killed Ramaka {{and one of his}} sons and burned down his village of Fanjahirambe, which {{was the center of the}} Zafiraminy. An archeological dig conducted in the early 1990s at this site found European <b>stonewares,</b> earthenwares, glass bottles, Far Eastern green glaze and blue and white porcelain (Wright et al., 1993).|$|R
50|$|Talc {{is widely}} used in the {{ceramics}} industry in both bodies and glazes. In low-fire art-ware bodies, it imparts whiteness and increases thermal expansion to resist crazing. In <b>stonewares,</b> small percentages of talc are used to flux the body and therefore improve strength and vitrification. It {{is a source of}} MgO flux in high-temperature glazes (to control melting temperature). It is also employed as a matting agent in earthenware glazes and can be used to produce magnesia mattes at high temperatures.|$|R
5|$|Ceramic {{that were}} {{imported}} to Gedi represent either {{direct or indirect}} trade with China, South Asia, and the Islamic world. Islamic pottery found at Gedi was wheel spun, glazed, and kiln fired, which includes sgraffiato, Yemeni black on yellow ceramics, and figured wares frequently depicting floral designs on blue and white panels. Sgraffiato is red-bodied earthenware with yellow or green glaze that was common in modern-day Iraq from the ninth to the sixteenth century. A type of polychrome <b>stoneware</b> from the sixteenth century characterized by grey, green, and brown glazes may {{have been made in}} Persia or India as an attempted imitation of Chinese porcelain. Another type of partially grey glazed bowls with circular decorations on their interior is believed to come from Indochina since the disappearance of the style coincides with the Thai conquest of the region in AD 1467. Various types of Chinese pottery also appear at Gedi, including celadon and blue and white porcelain, which were found in large enough volumes to assume that {{a significant portion of the}} population had access to higher quality wares, while sherds were also found inlayed in the mosques.|$|E
5|$|Technological {{advances}} proceeded in a {{range of}} areas. Watermills to grind grain had existed during most of the Anglo-Saxon period, using horizontal mill designs; from the 12th century on many more were built, eliminating the use of hand mills, with the older horizontal mills gradually supplanted by a new vertical mill design. Windmills began to be built in the late 12th century and slowly became more common. Water-powered fulling mills and powered hammers first appeared in the 12th century; water power was harnessed to assist in smelting by the 14th century, with the first blast furnace opening in 1496. New mining methods were developed and horse-powered pumps were installed in English mines {{by the end of the}} Middle Ages. The introduction of hopped beer transformed the brewing industry in the 14th century, and new techniques were invented to better preserve fish. Glazed pottery became widespread in the 12th and 13th centuries, with <b>stoneware</b> pots largely replacing wooden plates and bowls by the 15th century. William Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde began using the printing press during the late 15th century. Transport links were also improved; many road bridges were either erected or rebuilt in stone during the long economic boom of the 12th and 13th centuries. England's maritime trade benefited from the introduction of cog ships, and many docks were improved and fitted with cranes for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Bodies {{requiring}} higher firing temperatures, such as <b>stoneware</b> {{were introduced}} in the late 1950s {{even though it had}} existed elsewhere for centuries. These wares are considered to be much finer than what can be achieved at lower temperatures. A pioneer in the making of <b>stoneware</b> in Mexico is Jorge Wilmot, who began with Ken Edwards in the 1950s and 1960s. Later, a group in Mexico City began to experiment with <b>stoneware,</b> calling themselves Cono 10. While the group no longer exists, their work, both as a group and later as individuals has had a significant effect in the development of <b>stoneware</b> in Mexico. Ceramics fired at higher temperatures came to the interest of the government, especially FONART, in the 1970s. This agency installed suitable facilities {{in various parts of the}} country and trained potters in the techniques. Many of these later started their own workshops. <b>Stoneware</b> is still relatively rare and unlike other forms of pottery, it is usually made by professionals with education rather than people in rural areas. Some of the best known <b>stoneware</b> workshops include those of Hugo Velazquez in Cuernavaca, Taller Tecpatl in Guanajuato, Alberto Diaz de Cossio, Graziella Diaz de Leon and Francisco Javier Servin M., all of Mexico City.|$|E

He was also invited to write a book, The <b>Stonewares</b> of Yixing which talks aob the Yixing teaware.|$|R
50|$|The museum's Asian art {{collection}} includes works from China, Japan, India, Tibet, Southeast Asia, and the Near East. The collection is particularly {{known for its}} Chinese ceramics, with a particular depth in mortuary wares from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and utilitarian <b>stonewares</b> from the 11th through the 13th centuries. Although more than 1,000 objects are comprised in this collection, because of limited space, {{only a portion of}} the pieces are on display at one time.

Chinese export porcelain was generally decorative, but without the symbolic significance of wares produced for the Chinese home market. Except for the rare Huashi soft paste wares, traditionally Chinese porcelain was made using kaolin and petuntse. [...] While rim chips and hairline cracks are common, pieces tend not to stain. Chinese wares were usually thinner {{than those of the}} Japanese and did not have stilt marks.|$|R
50|$|Josiah Spode {{is known}} to have worked for Thomas Whieldon from the age of 16 until he was 21. He then worked in a number of {{partnerships}} until he went into business for himself, renting a small potworks in the town of Stoke-on-Trent in 1767; in 1776 he completed the purchase of what became the Spode factory until 2008. His early products comprised earthenwares such as creamware (a fine cream-coloured earthenware) and pearlware (a fine earthenware with a bluish glaze) as well as a range of <b>stonewares</b> including black basalt, caneware, and jasper which had been popularised by Josiah Wedgwood. The history and products of the Spode factory have inspired generations of historians and collectors, and a useful interactive online exhibition was launched in October 2010.|$|R

25|$|What {{distinguishes the}} Amami Islands from other island groups was the {{presence}} of the Gusuku Site Complex in Kikai Island. This archaeological site complex lasted for a long time from the 9th century. In its second peak, from {{the latter half of the}} 11th century to the first half of the 12th century, an exceptionally large quantities of sue wares, haji wares, kamuiyaki, and soapstone cauldrons produced in the Nishisonogi Peninsula, Nagasaki Prefecture were used together with Chinese white glazed wares, Chinese celadons, Goryeo ceramics and Goryeo unglazed <b>stonewares.</b> The Gusuku Site Complex is noted for its non-native nature and resemblance to Dazaifu, the administrative center of Kyūshū. It is highly probable that the Gusuku Site Complex was constructed by people under the State of Japan although Amami was not formally incorporated into the administrative system of Japan.|$|R
50|$|Out of this Bornean Tribe of the Dumangsil and Balkasusa Clan {{was born}} the ancestry of Lipa and as later on their {{descendants}} spread out towards Laguna de Bay and Bicol Peninsula.

The flourishing trade relations between these early Batangueños with a number of Chinese merchants prior to the Spanish conquest explained the presence of hundreds of Chinese wares from potteries to <b>stonewares</b> and vases of Song dynasty period to the latter part of the 16th century, in the burial grounds at Calatagan sites of Pulung Bakaw, Kay Tomas, Pinagpatayan I and II at Butong, Taal Batangas.|$|R
5|$|Celadon: Named after a pale-tinted spring green colour, Chinese {{archaeologist}} Wang Zhongshu (1982) {{asserts that}} shards having {{this type of}} ceramic glaze have been recovered from Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb excavations in Zhejiang; he also asserts {{that this type of}} ceramic became well known during the Three Kingdoms (220–265). Richard Dewar (2002) disagrees with Wang's classification, stating that true celadon—which requires a minimum 1260°C (2300°F) furnace temperature, a preferred range of 1285° to 1305°C (2345° to 2381°F), and reduced firing—was not created until the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127). The unique grey or green celadon glaze is a result of iron oxide's transformation from ferric to ferrous iron (Fe2O3 → FeO) during the firing process. Longquan celadon wares, which Nigel Wood (1999) writes were first made during the Northern Song, had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain wares made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than <b>stonewares.</b>|$|R
