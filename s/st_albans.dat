5|$|Chesney {{served as}} a royal justice in Lincolnshire during his bishopric, and {{maintained}} {{a close relationship with}} his nephew, Foliot. He was also an early patron of Thomas Becket, and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by King Stephen of England, including the right to a mint, Chesney was present at the coronation of King Henry II of England in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. Around 1160, Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with <b>St</b> <b>Albans</b> Abbey in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing any right to oversee <b>St</b> <b>Albans.</b>|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the money}} left after Sarah's {{numerous}} bequests was inherited by her grandson, John Spencer, with the condition {{that he could not}} accept a political office under the government. He also inherited the remainder of Sarah's numerous estates, including Wimbledon. Marlborough House remained empty for fourteen years, with the exception of James Stephens, one of her executors, before it became the property of the Dukes of Marlborough upon Stephens's death. In 1817, it became a royal residence, and passed through members of the British royal family until it became the Commonwealth Secretariat in 1959. Wimbledon Park House succumbed to fire in 1785; and Holywell House, Sarah's birthplace in <b>St</b> <b>Albans,</b> was demolished in 1827. Today, much of <b>St</b> <b>Albans</b> is named after the Marlboroughs because of Sarah's influence.|$|E
5|$|Revolt {{began to}} stir in <b>St</b> <b>Albans</b> in Hertfordshire late on 13 June, when news broke {{of the events}} in London. There had been long-running {{disagreements}} in <b>St</b> <b>Albans</b> between {{the town and the}} local abbey, which had extensive privileges in the region. On 14 June, protesters met with the Abbot, Thomas de la Mare, and demanded their freedom from the abbey. A group of townsmen under the leadership of William Grindecobbe traveled to London, where they appealed to the King for the rights of the abbey to be abolished. Wat Tyler, then still in control of the city, granted them authority in the meantime to take direct action against the abbey. Grindecobbe and the rebels returned to <b>St</b> <b>Albans,</b> where they found the Prior had already fled. The rebels broke open the abbey gaol, destroyed the fences marking out the abbey lands and burnt the abbey records in the town square. They then forced Thomas de la Mare to surrender the abbey's rights in a charter on 16 June. The revolt against the abbey spread out over the next few days, with abbey property and financial records being destroyed across the county.|$|E

Sir Roger Bacon was probably arrested before the final battle in Norfolk, and was tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London before finally being pardoned by the Crown. As of September 1381, Thomas Ingleby of Bridgwater had successfully evaded the authorities.|$|E

5|$|In May 1455, Northumberland was {{travelling}} {{with the}} king and Somerset to a great council at Leicester, when the party was intercepted by York and the Nevilles. On 22 May 1455, at the First Battle of <b>St</b> <b>Albans,</b> the royal forces clashed with the forces loyal to the Duke of York, {{in what has been}} described as the first battle of the Wars of the Roses. The battle was a complete victory for the Yorkist side, and led to another reversal of the political situation. The king was taken captive, and Somerset was killed. Northumberland was also among the casualties, and was buried at the nearby <b>St</b> <b>Albans</b> Abbey. A suggestion made by a contemporary chronicler, and supported by modern-day historians, said that the true purpose of the battle was to settle personal scores. Once York and Salisbury had killed Somerset and Northumberland respectively, the battle was effectively over.|$|E
