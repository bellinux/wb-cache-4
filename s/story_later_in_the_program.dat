60|$|One night a young American got {{access to}} Stoddard at the Concert Rooms {{and told him}} a moving tale. He said he was living on the Surrey side, and for some strange reason his {{remittances}} had failed to arrive from home; he had no money, {{he was out of}} employment, and friendless; his girl-wife and his new baby were actually suffering for food; for the love of heaven could he lend him a sovereign until his remittances should resume? Stoddard was deeply touched, and gave him a sovereign on my account. Dolby scoffed, but Stoddard stood his ground.

50|$|The first {{publication}} of the angel tale was apparently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 18th century by Thomas Hutchinson in his History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in which he describes the tale as having originated with John Leverett's family. Subsequent historians picked up and elaborated on <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th-century historians began to examine the story more critically, with George Sheldon specifically debunking it in 1874. Because of the inconsistencies raised by Sheldon, many 20th-century historians have accepted that the tale does not describe an event that actually happened, {{and it has been}} widely propagated as not having occurred. Douglas Wilson carefully reassessed the available evidence, concluding in his 1987 paper on the matter that it might have taken place, and that the event, and Goffe's involvement in it, were covered up by Goffe's protectors.|$|R
