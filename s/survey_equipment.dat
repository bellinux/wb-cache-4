2500|$|But as {{settlers}} {{continued to}} move into the confiscated areas in early 1868, taking possession of greater areas of farmland, tribes faced the option of fighting to retain their cultivable land or starving. Tītokowaru, in response, began to mount campaigns of non-violent resistance to halt further incursions by white settlers. Members of his hapu removed <b>survey</b> <b>equipment</b> and destroyed fences and huts, then began harassing South Taranaki settlers with minor thefts of stock and property to persuade them to leave. On 9 June 1868, Ngāti Ruanui warriors escalated their campaign, shooting and tomahawking three settlers felling and sawing timber {{on the east side of}} the Waingongoro River, between Hawera and Manaia. Soon after, a member of the Armed Constabulary, the colonial regular army, was shot and mutilated by tomahawk near the Waihi Redoubt (at present-day Normanby). The upper part of his body was taken by Hauhau warriors to Te Ngutu o Te Manu, a village 16km north of Hawera, where it was cooked and eaten. Tītokowaru issued a letter threatening that other pākehā intruders on the land would also be killed and eaten, warning: [...] "I have begun to eat the flesh of the white man [...] [...] [...] My throat is continually open for the eating of human flesh by day and night." ...|$|E

40|$|Activities in the {{building}} industry in Europe concentrate increasingly {{on a combination of}} renovation and new-building. A prerequisite for comprehensive IT supported design and planning in the context of existing buildings is both the use of on-site computer- aided surveying techniques and the integration of all professional disciplines in an integrated information and communication system. The starting point is often {{the building}} survey on site. An examination of currently available IT tools and hardware shows insufficient support for planning within existing built contexts. <b>Surveying</b> <b>equipment</b> has been derived from other disciplines without being modified to cater for the specific needs of building surveying.
