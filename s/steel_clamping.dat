30|$|Regarding the {{construction}} of wood stave penstocks, Blass and Fellmoser (2005) and Fellmoser (2007) had carried out preliminary studies {{within the framework of}} the BMBF joint-project which had concentrated on three main topics, namely: (1) The influence of moisture content on basic properties of different timber species, (2) the force transmission from the wood stave pipeline to circumferential spanned <b>steel</b> <b>clamping</b> rings (see Sect. “Construction guidelines and application of <b>steel</b> <b>clamping</b> rings”), as well as (3) adapted connection techniques between wood stave pipelines and steel connectors using a concrete abutment (see Sect. “Connection techniques for wood stave penstocks and steel connectors”).|$|E
30|$|Since the {{swelling}} process {{is essential for}} the pipe’s tightness, it has to be ensured by utilizing wood staves with proper moisture content ranging from 16 to 18  % (Fellmoser 2007). The swelling occurs during the pipe’s filling, wherefore the assembly is circumferentially spanned with <b>steel</b> <b>clamping</b> rings to keep the pipe in shape (Fig.  4 e, f). These rings are arranged in spiral pattern in terms of adapting the distance between single rings according to the hydrostatic pressure gradient inside the pipeline. Thus, a uniform stress distribution can be achieved.|$|E
40|$|Description {{is given}} of a transmission‐type, curved‐crystal {{focusing}} spectrometer for short wave‐length x‐rays, and gamma‐rays having a dispersion of 1. 186 x. u. per mm at short wave‐lengths. The spectrometer utilizes the (310) planes of quartz in a crystalline plate of dimensions 80 × 70 × 1. 0 mm curved cylindrically to a radius of two meters. High luminosity is obtained since the useful aperture in the crystal holder has {{an area of}} 10 cm 2 and subtends 0. 00025 stereradians at the focus. It also affords high resolution since by photographic tests with x‐rays the curved plate {{has been shown to}} focus a specified x‐ray wave‐length to within 0. 06 mm of the same position on the focal circle for all parts of its useful aperture and over the entire operating wave‐length range. The geometry of the mechanism permits absolute measurements with a precision screw of the sine of the Bragg angle {{on both sides of the}} reflecting planes, affording a wave‐length range which includes at longest wave‐lengths the K‐spectrum of silver and goes down to zero wave‐lengths. For short wave‐length gamma‐rays the source is placed at the focus. A multiple‐slit collimator of tapering die‐cast lead partitions spaced apart with tapering separators, is used at short wave‐lengths to transmit the monochromatic diffracted beam and absorb the directly transmitted and scattered heterogeneous beam. The present collimator limits the spectrum that can be studied to a shortest wave‐length of 7. x. u. corresponding to 1. 75 Mev. The intensity of the diffracted beam is to be measured with a special multi‐cellular G. M. counting tube of high efficiency, provided with a number of thin lead partitions through which the beam passes successively. In photographic spectra made with this instrument the tungsten and also the silverKβ_ 1 β_ 3 doublet is completely and clearly resolved. Reproductions of such photographic x‐ray spectra are shown in which the line breadths have substantially the natural breadth. Fluorescence spectra of silver have been made in 10 ‐minute exposures.

Two stainless <b>steel</b> <b>clamps</b> were made to house {{the body and the}} two end-caps by using four stainless steel studdings and wing nuts holding the clamps. This design improved the leakage problem and minimized incidences of breakage. However, this design was inconvenient for packing sediment material because the lower end-cap and the body were not fixed together once the upper end-cap was taken off for packing. Furthermore, manufacturing of the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>clamps</b> was costly.|$|R

However, high-rise buildings and skyscrapers have the potential dangers against earthquakes, even more Indonesia lay on an earthquake-prone areas. There are two main {{things that need to be}} considered in the planning of earthquake-resistant buildings, which is strength and ductility.

40|$|Thick {{composite}} beams {{are used}} as primary structural members in various engineering applications, for example, composite flex beams in a hinge less rotor system of modern helicopters. One end of the flex beam yoke {{is connected to the}} rotor hub through joints and the other end is connected similarly to the rotor blade. A flex beam yoke has to support rotating loads, vibratory bending loads and torsional loads. It should be strong enough to hold the blade yet flexible enough to allow for the flapping motion. Hence, it is essential to understand the mechanism of stress development, crack initiation and propagation in a bolted thick composite beam, which is subjected to axial and flexural loads. A unidirectional glass/epoxy thick composite beam is considered in this study. A common engineering practice is to use bolted joints to attach two structural members and the bolts are pre-tensed. Buffer pads are attached to the composite beam to avoid localized damage. To simulate the real life situation, a CAD model is generated using ABAQUS 1] consisting of a thick composite beam with eight bolt holes, buffer pads, <b>steel</b> <b>clamping</b> blocks, steel washers and steel bolts. The composite beam is attached to a rigid block using a clamping block, washers and bolts. The finite element mesh is generated using 3 -D continuum elements, C 3 D 8 I. Nonlinear stress analysis is performed for bolt pre-tension and bending loads with material and contact nonlinearity. The numerical results depend on the element type in finite element analysis. Parametric study for element selection between SC 8, C 3 D 8 and C 3 D 20 is carried out. The finite element analysis results are compared with the experimental values. Different failure criteria are considered to study the failure behavior of the thick composite beam: Tsai-Wu, Christensen, and Puck, Hashin and quadratic delamination failure criteria. These failure criteria are coded in ABAQUS through user subroutines. The bolt holes act as stress concentration regions in the beam, where the failure behavior is studied utilizing the above criteria. The effect of different loading, such as bolt pre-tension, bending on the failure of the composite thick beam are investigated...|$|E

The mill was initially operated by Herrmann Benecke, but then underwent several changes of ownership. It was bought in 1920 by the mill owner, Heinrich Bornemann, from Luhmühlen, who converted it in 1924 into a motor mill and in 1934 made the millhouse bigger. In 1964 the mill was operated with three rollers and a meal conveyor (Schrotgang). Thereafter it changed hands several times and was gradually closed down and converted into a residence. The internal mill machinery was removed. The present owner has carried out extensive restoration and equipped the mill with sails and a fantail again. Current state of the mill: The cap is covered with wooden shingles and equipped with an additional gallery. Like the four sails it is fixed.
