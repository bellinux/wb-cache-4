50|$|The {{primitive}} {{state of}} the dorsal <b>sutures</b> is proparian. Opisthoparian <b>sutures</b> have developed several times independently. There are no examples of proparian <b>sutures</b> developing in taxa with opisthoparian ancestry. Trilobites that exhibit opisthoparian <b>sutures</b> as adults commonly have proparian <b>sutures</b> as instars (known exceptions being Yunnanocephalus and Duyunaspis). Hypoparian <b>sutures</b> have also arisen independently in several groups of trilobites.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to single layer <b>suturing,</b> two layer <b>suturing</b> generally involves <b>suturing</b> at {{a deeper level}} of a tissue followed by another layer of <b>suturing</b> at a more superficial level.

50|$|One of {{the limits}} of {{expansion}} is the Zygomatic buttress. It is known that this anatomical bony complex limits the maxillary expansion posteriorly. Maxillary expansion does tend to open up Circumaxillary <b>sutures,</b> Circumzygomatic <b>sutures,</b> intermaxillary <b>sutures</b> and midpalatal <b>sutures.</b> Expansion also tends to happen more anteriorly than posteriorly.|$|R
40|$|Background and Design: Postoperative scar {{development}} {{is an important}} problem for patients treated in plastic surgery clinics. Most patients think that continuous intradermal <b>suturing</b> is superior to interrupted <b>suturing</b> because they assume that it creates less scarring. We evaluated scars that form following intradermal and interrupted <b>suturing.</b> This article presents our controlled study that objectively compared the scars on patients' faces using a wound evaluation scale. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five patients, who had undergone operations on the bilateral cheeks, were included in this study. Thirty patients were female; five patients were male. Their mean age was 40. 05 years. The average scar evaluation time after surgery was 9. 05 months. Elliptical excisions were made on the lesions under local anesthesia. The incisions on the right cheeks were <b>sutured</b> with 6 / 0 monofilament nonabsorbable <b>sutures</b> using the continuous intradermal <b>suturing</b> technique. The left cheek incisions were <b>sutured</b> with same <b>sutures</b> using the interrupted <b>suturing</b> method. Results: The patients were evaluated 7 – 11 months after operation (mean: 9. 05 months) using the Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale. A Related Samples T-test was used for statistical evaluation {{of the differences between}} the <b>suturing</b> techniques. No significant differences were noted in scar formation between the two <b>suturing</b> methods (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: We found no differences in scar formation between the two frequently used <b>suturing</b> techniques studied here. We believe that the <b>suturing</b> technique is a less important determinant of scar formation than are other factors...|$|R

5|$|The crests of Corythosaurus {{resemble}} {{that of a}} cassowary, or a Corinthian helmet. They {{are formed}} {{by a combination of}} the praemaxillae, nasals, prefrontals and frontals, as in Saurolophus, but instead of projecting backwards as a spine, they rise up to make the highest point above the orbit. The two halves of the crest are separated by a median <b>suture.</b> In front of the orbit, the crest is made of thick bone.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} occur with treatment; for example a {{granuloma}} can form at the <b>suture</b> site. Also, the sutured wound can tear again, as occurs {{when there is}} excessive pressure in the airways from ventilation. However, {{for people who do}} receive surgery soon after the injury to repair the lesion, outcome is usually good; the long-term outcome is good for over 90% of people who have TBI surgically repaired early in treatment. Even when surgery is performed years after the injury, the outlook is good, with low rates of death and disability and good chances of preserving lung function.|$|E
5|$|During the Silurian period (444–419 Ma) the {{continent}} of Laurentia gradually collided with Baltica, joining Scotland to the area that would become England and Europe. Sea levels rose as the Ordovician ice sheets melted, and tectonic movements created major faults which assembled the outline of Scotland from previously scattered fragments. These faults are the Highland Boundary Fault, separating the Lowlands from the Highlands, the Great Glen Fault that divides the North-west Highlands from the Grampians, the Southern Uplands Fault and the Iapetus <b>Suture,</b> which runs from the Solway Firth to Lindisfarne and which marks {{the close of the}} Iapetus Ocean and the joining of northern and southern Britain.|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristics}} of the circumcision scar depend on the technique that was used. Open surgical techniques using <b>sutures</b> cause uneven scarring where the <b>sutures</b> were placed. Newborn circumcisions do not require <b>sutures</b> and result in a fine, even scar. Circumcisions after the newborn period that are performed without <b>sutures</b> (techniques that use cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive instead of <b>sutures</b> and techniques like Plastibell that heal by secondary intention) result in an even, circumferential scar.|$|R

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their back margin not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the <b>suture</b> (line of fusion) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with that between the frontal and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E

5|$|The {{shell of}} Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is ovate, slender, acute, and of {{moderate}} thickness. The shell <b>suture</b> is deep. The spire is gently convex, laterally compressed, with 3¼ whorls. The spire is long, {{slightly less than}} half the shell length, and the aperture is very oblique. The shell color is subtranslucent, calcareous pale yellow to white. The surface is somewhat glossy and marked with growth wrinkles and lines. The size varies somewhat, but adult specimens of the type lot averaged 20.9millimeters (mm) in shell length. Various adult specimens measured during the summer of 1981 and 1982 ranged from 19 to 24mm.|$|E

Cultures were not performed on the corneal infiltrate in these cases, and no patients were reported to develop endophthalmitis or severe keratitis resulting in vision loss. <b>Sutures</b> eroded for 24 h or more before removal were statistically {{more likely to be}} culture positive in this study (p = 0.043).|$|R
5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part {{is short and}} broad. The broad interorbital region (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A postorbital ridge is present, obscuring the <b>suture</b> (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front. The jugal bone is small.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} {{has occurred in}} parts of Iran since the Cretaceous period.

There, after a previous episode of rifting and subsequent formation of an ocean, the Neh and Lut tectonic blocks collided during the Eocene epoch after a subduction episode that commenced in the Maastrichtian age.|$|E
5|$|Another {{prominent}} early anthropologist, Thomas Wingate Todd, {{was primarily}} responsible {{for the creation of}} the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912.

Todd's contributions to the field of anthropology remain in use in the modern era and include various studies regarding <b>suture</b> closures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the mandible. Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the pubic symphysis. Though the standards have been updated, these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists to narrow down an age range of skeletonized remains. These early pioneers legitimized the field of anthropology, {{but it was not until}} the 1940s, with the help of Todd's student, Wilton M. Krogman, that forensic anthropology gained recognition as a legitimate subdiscipline.|$|E
40|$|In “Knots, <b>sutures,</b> and excision” (J. Differential Geom. 84, 301 – 364), Kronheimer and Mrowka defined invariants of {{balanced}} <b>sutured</b> manifolds using monopole and instanton Floer homology. Their invariants assign isomorphism {{classes of}} modules to balanced <b>sutured</b> manifolds. In this paper, we introduce refinements of these invariants which assign much richer algebraic objects called projectively transitive systems of modules to balanced <b>sutured</b> manifolds and isomorphisms of such systems to diffeomorphisms of balanced <b>sutured</b> manifolds.

40|$|We {{define a}} <b>sutured</b> cobordism {{category}} of surfaces with boundary and 3 –manifolds with corners.

We extend the definition of bordered Floer homology to these objects, giving a functor from a decorated version of the <b>sutured</b> category to A∞–algebras, and A∞–bimodules. As an application we give a way to recover the <b>sutured</b> homology SFH(M, Γ) of a <b>sutured</b> manifold from either of the bordered invariants ĈFA(M) and ĈFD(M) of its underlying manifold M.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} the in vitro plaque inhibitory effect of triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 <b>sutures</b> {{in the absence}} and presence of an additional antiplaque agent commonly used after oral surgery. Materials and Methods: Triclosan-coated <b>sutures</b> were incubated for 4 hours in freshly collected human saliva and, when appropriate, subsequently treated with an antiplaque rinse containing chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium as active components. <b>Sutures</b> without a triclosan-coating served as a control. Results: Triclosan-coated <b>sutures</b> harbored similar amounts of plaque as did uncoated <b>sutures.</b> Exposure to the antiplaque rinse caused significant decreases in viable organisms for uncoated and triclosan-coated <b>sutures.</b> However, after application of the antiplaque rinse, more micro-organisms were found on triclosan-coated than on uncoated <b>sutures.</b> Conclusion: <b>Sutures</b> coated with triclosan do not provide a sufficient antimicrobial effect to prevent in vitro colonization by oral bacteria, whereas use in combination with a chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium-containing antiplaque rinse appears to be counterproductive.

5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of the shell is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss on {{the margin of the}} outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present {{on the outside of the}} shell. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the <b>suture.</b> The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E
5|$|The ant has pubescence (soft short hair) {{abundant}} throughout some {{certain parts}} of the body, including the funiculi and tarsi. It is more sparse on the coxae, genae (an area {{on both sides of the}} head below the eyes), gaster and gula (the reduced sternite of the first segment of the thorax). Hairs on the scapes point downwards. Erect and suberect hair are seen all over the body in sparse numbers, although this varies. These hairs are not as abundant in comparison to other Novomessor species. The head and thorax are both -colored, and the epinotal spines, legs and node are yellowish red. The antennal scapes are reddish brown and the abdomen is piceous brown. The hair exhibits a gold-like color. The <b>suture</b> is absent from the thorax, and the mesonotum is wider than the epinotum. The front portion of the mesonotum is narrow whereas the back is rectangular. The node is evenly round and oval shaped, the postpetiole is narrow at the front and the dorsum is feebly convex. The gaster is large and oval shaped.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar to}} the cervical vertebrae, but have taller and more prong-like neural spines. The rest are amphiplatyan, meaning that they are flat at both ends. They also have postzygapophyses which are less elongate and more pedestal-like, in addition to taller and more rectangular neural spines. The parapophyses, which are depressions instead of projections, have moved off from the transverse processes to the neural arch, between the transverse processes and the articular processes known as the prezygapophyses {{at the front of the}} vertebrae. However, they move back onto the base of the transverse processes in the last few dorsals. In the third or fourth dorsal, the parapophysis is located very close to the <b>suture</b> between the neural spine and the centrum, which is unlike the other dorsals but similar to the first few dorsals in Edmontosaurus. Also like Edmontosaurus, the median ridge separating the prezygapophyses become more pronounced in the rear dorsals.|$|E
