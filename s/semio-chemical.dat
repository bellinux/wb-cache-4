40|$|In {{response}} to an epidemic of Douglas-fir beetle (Den-droctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins) a strategy emphasizing integrated pest management principles was developed and is being implemented on the Cascade Ranger District in west-central Idaho. By the end of 1991, more than 75 epi-centers encompassing over 1, 000 acres will have been treated. Treatment techniques employed included: (1) redirecting the beetle flight to uninfested host trees via the use of <b>semio-chemical</b> baits or fallen trap trees (simulated windthrow), followed by harvest and (2) cultural treatments that harvest currently infested host trees. Preliminary results indicate that these treatments deployed in a strategic manner are effective on an operational basis at reducing the local beetle populations and susceptible host. The spread of beetle in-festation into available host stands appears to have slowed in the areas treated...|$|E
40|$|Orientation of {{haematophagous}} insects {{towards a}} potential host is largely mediated by kairomones that, in some groups or species may include chemicals produced during feeding by the insects themselves, {{the so called}} 'invitation' effect.; The 'invitation' effect in blood-feeding diurnally active Stegomyia albopicta was investigated over 33 days in secondary forest in Mondolkiri Province, Cambodia. Two human volunteers sitting inside a shelter collected mosquitoes and noted where and when they landed. A 10 % emanator of a synthetic pyrethroid with high vapour action was in use on alternate days.; Overall, 2726 mosquitoes were collected, 1654 of which had the landing site recorded. The heads of the volunteers were the locations with the highest density of landings per surface area whilst the knees and elbows accounted {{for most of the}} landings received on the arms and legs. Landings recorded within three minutes of each other on a collector were about 2. 5 {{times more likely to be}} on the same body part than on a random body part, weighted for landing site preference. This preference did not vary with collector or pyrethroid.; The 'invitation' effect may be due to a <b>semio-chemical</b> produced early in the feeding process. Incorporation of such a chemical into traps designed to control this important vector of dengue and chikungunya viruses might potentially improve their attractiveness...|$|E
40|$|The {{attractiveness}} of oviposition site for malaria vector mosquitoes {{is dependent upon}} a number of physical and chemical factors. Many aspects of mosquito behavior, including host location and oviposition, are mediated by volatile semiochemicals. It is anticipated that selection of oviposition site by <b>semio-chemicals</b> {{in the form of}} attractants or stimulants can be used in oviposition traps to monitor or possibly in combination with insecticides to control gravid mosquito populations for mass trapping. So far, volatile compounds identified as oviposition attractants for mosquitoes include phenol, 4 -methyl phenol, 4 -ethyl phenol, indole, skatole, and p-cresol from hay infusions; 3 -carene, terpinene, copaene, cedrene, and d-cadinene released by copepods; alcohol and terpenoids including p-cresol fromplants; ethyl acetate and hydrocarbon substances, probably released by filamentous algae; 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol identified frombacteria. Research priorities should be directed at identifying more oviposition attractants to determine the properties of these <b>semio-chemicals</b> for possible use in designing control tools. This would aim at luring females to lethal traps or stimulants to increase their exposure to insecticide-impregnated substrates. ...|$|R
40|$|Leaves {{normally}} release {{small quantities}} of volatile chemicals, {{but when a}} plant is damaged by herbivorous insects, many more volatiles are released. The chemical identity of the volatile compounds varies with the plant species and with the herbivorous insect species. These volatiles attract both parasitic and predatory insects that are natural enemies of the herbivores. They may also in-duce defense responses in neighboring plants. Such chem-icals, which function in communication between and among species, {{as well as those}} that serve as messengers between members of the same species, are called <b>semio-chemicals</b> (from the Greek “semeion, ” a mark or signal) (Law and Regnier, 1971).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Plant {{volatiles}} play {{an important}} role in defending plants against insect attacks by attracting their natural enemies. For example, green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and terpenoids emitted from herbivore-damaged plants were found to be important in the host location of parasitic wasps. However, evidence of the functional roles and mechanisms of these <b>semio-chemicals</b> from a system of multiple plants in prey location by the parasitoid is limited. Little is known about the potential evolutionary trends between herbivore-induced host plant volatiles and the host location of their parasitoids. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present study includes hierarchical cluster analyses of plant volatile profiles from seven families of host and non-host plants of pea leafminer, Liriomyza huidobrensis, and behavioral responses of a naive parasitic wasp, Opius dissitus, to some principal volatile compounds. Here we show that plants can effectively pull wasps, O. dissitus, towards them by releasing a universally induced compound, (Z) - 3 -hexenol, and potentially keep these plants safe from parasitic assaults by leafminer pests, L. huidobrensis. Specifically, we found that volatile profiles from healthy plants revealed a partly phylogenetic signal, while the inducible compounds of the infested-plants did not result from the fact that the induced plant volatiles dominate most of the volatile blends of the host and non-host plants of the leafminer pests. We further show that the parasitoids are capable of distinguishing the damaged host plant from the non-host plant of the leafminers. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that, as the most passive scenario of plant involvement, leafminers and mechanical damages evoke similar <b>semio-chemicals.</b> Using ubiquitous compounds, such as hexenol, for host location by general parasitoids could be an adaptation of the most conservative evolution of tritrophic interaction. Although for this, other compounds may be used to improve the precision of the host location by the parasitoids...|$|R
40|$|Chemosensory {{proteins}} (CSPs) {{have been}} proposed to transport hydrophobic chemicals from air to olfactory or taste receptors. They have been isolated from several sensory organs {{of a wide range}} of insect species. The x-ray structure of CSPMbraA 6, a 112 -aa antennal protein from the moth Mamestra brassicae (Mbra), was shown to exhibit a novel type of α-helical fold. We have performed a structural and binding study of CSPMbraA 6 to get some insights into its possible molecular function. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching demonstrates the ability of CSPMbraA 6 to bind several types of <b>semio-chemicals</b> or surrogate ligands with μM Kd. Its crystal structure in complex with one of these compounds, 12 -bromo-dodecanol, reveals extensive conformational changes on binding, resulting in the formation of a large cavity filled by three ligand molecules. Furthermore, binding cooperativity was demonstrated for some ligands, suggesting a stepwise binding. The peculiar rearrangement of CSPMbraA 6 conformation and the cooperativity phenomenon might trigger the recognition of chemicals by receptors and induce subsequent signal transduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{geographic}} {{range of the}} Douglas-fir twig beetle, Pityophthorus orarius Bright, was extended beyond the original provenance of southern British Columbia to northern California. A survey of 457 Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] trees in 1985 revealed that those with heavy cone crops {{were more likely to}} be infested by twig beetles than were those with a light crop. Furthermore, attack rates differed among clones. A second survey done in 1987 confirmed the importance of clone and cone crop in attack rate. In this survey, stressed trees were attacked at a higher rate than unstressed trees. Beetle distributions appeared clumped in both surveys, possibly because of <b>semio-chemicals</b> or oviposition behavior. Rappaport, N. G., et D. L. Wood. 1994.

40|$|Recent {{recordings}} of the stridulations of Myrmica ants revealed that their queens made distinctive sounds from their workers, although the acoustics of queens and workers, respectively, were the same in different species of Myrmica. Queen recordings induced enhanced protective behavior when played to workers in the one species tested. Larvae and pupae of the butterfly genus Maculinea inhabit Myrmica colonies as social parasites, and both stages generate sounds that mimic those of a Myrmica queen, inducing similar superior treatments from workers as their model. We discuss how initial penetration and acceptance as a colony member is achieved by Maculinea through mimicking the species-specific <b>semio-chemicals</b> of their hosts, and how acoustical mimicry is then employed to elevate the parasite’s membership of that society towards the highest attainable level in their host’s hierarchy. We postulate that, if acoustics is as well developed a means of communication in certain ants as these studies suggest, then others among an estimated 10, 000 species of ant social parasite may supplement their well-known use of chemical and tactile mimicry to trick host ants with mimicry of host acoustical systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—As a {{first step}} in a study {{of the role of the}} {{secretion}} of the supplemen-tary sacculi (buccal secretion) of the dwarf hamster, Phodopus sungorus sun-gorus, almost complete chemical characterization of the secretion was achieved. The 35 compounds identified include carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, a large number of carboxylic acids (representing the bulk of the organic volatile fraction of the secretion), phenol, 2 -piperidone, indole, two long-chain hydroxyesters, cholestrol, desmosterol, and lanosterol. The position of the double bonds in °-icosadienyl- °-butyrolactone and °-henicosadienyl- °-butyrolactone could not be determined, and these two compounds remained only partially characterized. Large variations were found in the relative concentrations in which the short-chain carboxylic acids are present in the secretions of individual animals, and although this aspect was not investigated in sufficient detail in the present in-vestigation, the difference in the carboxylic acid profiles of the secretions of individual animals could play a role in individual recognition in this animal.

40|$|Plants produce <b>semio-chemicals</b> that {{directly}} influence insect attraction and/or repulsion. Generally, this attraction is {{closely associated with}} herbivory and has been studied mainly under atmospheric conditions. On the other hand, the relationship between aquatic plants and insects has been little studied. To determine whether the roots of aquatic macrophytes release attractive chemical mixtures into the water, we studied the behaviour of mosquito larvae using olfactory experiments with root exudates. After testing the attraction on Culex and Aedes mosquito larvae, we chose to work with Coquillettidia species, which have a complex behaviour in nature {{and need to be}} attached to plant roots in order to obtain oxygen. This relationship is non-destructive and can be described as commensal behaviour. Commonly found compounds seemed to be involved in insect attraction since root exudates from different plants were all attractive. Moreover, chemical analysis allowed us to identify a certain number of commonly found, highly water-soluble, low-molecular-weight compounds, several of which (glycerol, uracil, thymine, uridine, thymidine) were able to induce attraction when tested individually but at concentrations substantially higher than those found in nature. However, our principal findings demonstrated that these compounds appeared to act synergistically, since a mixture of these five compounds attracted larvae at natural concentrations (0. 7 nM glycerol, < 0. 5 nM uracil, 0. 6 nM thymine, 2. 8 nM uridine, 86 nM thymidine), much lower than those found for each compound tested individually. These results provide strong evidence that a mixture of polyols (glycerol), pyrimidines (uracil, thymine), and nucleosides (uridine, thymidine) functions as an efficient attractive signal in nature for Coquillettidia larvae. We therefore show for the first time, that such commonly found compounds may {{play an important role in}} plant-insect relationships in aquatic eco-systems...|$|R
40|$|The 2006 {{bluetongue}} (BT) {{outbreak in}} northwestern Europe had devastating effects on cattle and sheep in that intensively farmed area. The role of wind in disease spread, through {{its effect on}} Culicoides dispersal, is still uncertain, and remains unquantified. We examine here the relationship between farm-level infection dates and wind speed and direction {{within the framework of}} a novel model involving both mechanistic and stochastic steps. We consider wind as both a carrier of host <b>semio-chemicals,</b> to which midges might respond by upwind flight, and as a transporter of the midges themselves, in a more or less downwind direction. For completeness, we also consider midge movement independent of wind and various combinations of upwind, downwind and random movements. Using stochastic simulation, we are able to explain infection onset at 94 per cent of the 2025 affected farms. We conclude that 54 per cent of outbreaks occurred through (presumably midge) movement of infections over distances of no more than 5 km, 92 per cent over distances of no more than 31 km and only 2 per cent over any greater distances. The modal value for all infections combined is less than 1 km. Our analysis suggests that previous claims for a higher frequency of long-distance infections are unfounded. We suggest that many apparent long-distance infections resulted from sequences of shorter-range infections; a ‘stepping stone’ effect. Our analysis also found that downwind movement (the only sort so far considered in explanations of BT epidemics) is responsible for only 39 per cent of all infections, and highlights the effective contribution to disease spread of upwind midge movement, which accounted for 38 per cent of all infections. The importance of midge flight speed is also investigated. Within the same model framework, lower midge active flight speed (of 0. 13 rather than 0. 5 m s− 1) reduced virtually to zero the role of upwind movement, mainly because modelled wind speeds in the area concerned were usually greater than such flight speed. Our analysis, therefore, highlights the need to improve our knowledge of midge flight speed in field situations, which is still very poorly understood. Finally, the model returned an intrinsic incubation period of 8 days, in accordance with the values reported in the literature. We argue that better understanding of the movement of infected insect vectors is an important ingredient in the management of future outbreaks of BT in Europe, and other devastating vector-borne diseases elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Pest insects cause great {{financial}} {{losses in}} the forest and food industry every year. To fight these pests industries have used insecticides, which are sometimes harmful to nature and humans. One potential way of avoiding insecticides {{is the use of}} integrated pest management based on insect communication, which would offer species-specific methods for protecting forest and food resources. Insects use chemicals known as semiochemicals for both intra- and interspecies communication. By learning how insects use these <b>semio-chemicals</b> {{to talk to each other}} we can eavesdrop and mimic their communication for our benefit. One research area dealing with these questions is chemical ecology, which is an interdisciplinary area as knowledge in chemistry and biology is required. Collaborations between groups within and outside of Sweden are essential in order to make progress in this field of research. This thesis presents the identification and synthesis of semiochemicals from several insect species, most of which are considered to be pests. Synthesised compounds have been sent to collaboration partners around Sweden and Europe for biological evaluations. Studies of the African butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, have unravelled particular biological phenomena that may aid in the understanding of the Bicyclus genus, though recognizing individual species variation is crucial. In 2008 the putative male sex pheromone of B. anynana was determined to consist of three compounds: hexadecanal, (Z) - 9 -tetradecenol and 6, 10, 14 -trimethylpentadecan- 2 -ol, and the specific stereoisomer for 6, 10, 14 -trimethylpentadecan- 2 -ol has been determined in this thesis. The ratio of 6, 10, 14 -trimethylpentadecan- 2 -ol and the corresponding ketone were investigated for seventeen Bicyclus species (including B. anynana) that live in overlapping regions in Africa. The stereochemistry was determined for most of the species and may provide a way to chemically distinguish them. The orchid bees, Euglossa spp, are important pollinators of many orchids in Central America. Insight about pollination and conservation of endangered orchid species may be possible by gathering more information about the Euglossa genus. Males of the Euglossa genus have pouch-like structures on their hind legs where they store compounds collected from their surroundings. 6, 10, 14 -Trimethyl-pentadecan- 2 -one is a common component of leg extracts from Euglossa imperialis, E. crassipunctata and E. allosticta, the specific stereochemistry of which has been determined in this thesis. Another, different compound was found in high amounts in E. viridissima and its structure has been elucidated; several synthetic pathways are under investigation to obtain the target compound. Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius and C. hemipterus) are an ectoparasite that feed on human blood, and the number of reported infestations of these parasites has increased considerably during the last decade. Two 5 th instar nymph-specific compounds, 4 -oxo-hexenal and 4 -oxo-octenal, were identified and synthesised. Utilizing domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in the identification of bed bug infestations has become popular during recent years. Their training is usually conducted using live bed bugs, however this thesis describes an alternative method of teaching dogs to find infestations. This alternative method is based on synthetic compounds and dogs trained in this manner have achieved a high positive indication rate. Two species of the tiny, Acacia leaf-eating insect pests in Australia known as thrips, Kladothrips nicolsoni and K. rugosus, have been investigated by means of larval extracts and have been shown to contain large amount of (Z) - 3 -dodecenoic acid which was synthesised and tested in bioassays. Fruit flies are common pests on fruit in almost every private household. Even though fruit flies has been investigated extensively, their chemical communication has not been completely elucidated. (Z) - 4 -undecenal was identified as a compound emitted by females, it was synthesised in high stereoisomeric purity and evaluated in biological assays. FOR...|$|R
40|$|Harmonia axyridis {{has been}} used as an {{efficient}} biological control agent worldwide but is causing concern because of adverse impact on native species biodiversity predominantly through intra-guild predation and competition. There is thus a need to understand the ecological, biological and physiological factors that primarily contributed to the accelerated invasiveness and establishment of this species over a wide range of agricultural systems. The main focus of this project was to investigate various life-history traits and their interaction with external environments cues. The first part of this project was designed to investigate various biological aspects of this ladybird under controlled environmental measures and fixed prey availability. First, it demonstrated the sexual body size-dimorphism and highlighted which traits showed greater dimorphism than others between sexes. In addition, the reproductive performance and the association between the body size and the life-time fecundity, egg hatchability and non-viable eggs was investigated. Several hypotheses were revaluated by this study by direct experiments. The developmental responses of the juveniles were performed under similar controlled measures by monitoring both the stage weight and duration in order to abstract the intra-specific variations among females as well as the significance of each larval stage relative to the final adult size. This species has gained additional advantage due to the presence of the 5 th instar reflecting an elevation in fitness and the evolution of the predation and competitive proficiency. Although the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of this ladybird were only covered theoretically, a number of experiments has revealed the intra-specific variability among female body mass, nutrient allocation to reproduction strategies, and growth patterns that might be partially constrained by genetic background. Another important aspect of this project was to emphasize the influence of mating choice and frequency on lifespan, egg hatchability and viability of singly mated, multiply mated as well as virgin females. It was shown that H. axyridis is able to be fertile throughout their life-span from a single mating without significant costs on either longevity or life time fecundity. Nevertheless, multiple mating was found to impose some constraints on the proportion of fertile eggs. These reproductive features may help to understand the success of population establishment and persistence under constantly fluctuating environment. A novel method was described in this study in which the sex of pupae could be easily identified prior to adult emergence based on pupal pattern dimorphism when pupae were reared in the laboratory or directly collected from the field. This simple method is highly effective and could be implemented in several studies without manipulating adults although care must be taken when inspecting the patterns of colouration. Behavioural characteristics of this species that facilitated intra-guild dominancy and interference competitions were also investigated by simple methods. This was performed by testing the avoidance responses mediated by olfactory organs and <b>semio-chemicals</b> towards the presence of tracks of con- and hetero-specific-larvae and adults as well as con-specific adults. The results suggest that H. axyridis has a highly specialized sense organ that functions efficiently in selecting suitable patches and tends to refrain larvae or adults from foraging in contaminated patches by certain species. In the second part of this project, the characteristics of developmental and behavioural traits were also investigated by subjecting successive larval instars to a brief period of food manipulation protocols. This unravelled the compensation patterns, and short- and long-term trade-offs on life-history traits across generations. The results suggest that H. axyridis is able to exhibit phenotypic plasticity in several traits that are important for successful adaptation and colonizing a new habitat. In summary, {{the results of this study}} showed that H. axyridis is a highly competitive species owing to their reproductive tactics and unique immediate strategies in regulating reproductive performance and in optimizing off-spring fitness after food restoration. Females were able to optimize their fecundity after one mating and possess evolved defence strategies to avoid being attacked by other species. Nevertheless, the results of this study may contribute in understanding the evolution of life-history traits in this species and could be incorporated in intra- and inter-specific comparative studies. In conclusion, the study predicts that this species will continue to spread and become more widely distributed with more ecological consequences if effective control measures and protocols are not incorporated almost immediately.
