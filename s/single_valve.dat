5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a <b>single</b> <b>valve</b> to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E
25|$|Bass trombones {{also very}} {{commonly}} have F-attachments, which serve {{exactly the same}} function as on the tenor trombone. Some <b>single</b> <b>valve</b> bass trombones have E-attachments instead of F-attachments, or sometimes there is extra tubing on the F-attachment {{to allow it to}} be used as an E-attachment if desired. However, many bass trombones have a second valve attachment instead, which increases their range downward even more. The most common second valve attachment is the G-attachment, which changes the instrument's key to D when used in combination with the F-attachment (or D if used with the less common E-attachment). There are other configurations other than the G-attachment however.|$|E

5000|$|Increasing {{the size}} of the poppet valves in the engine, thus {{decreasing}} the restriction {{in the path of the}} fuel-air mixture entering, and the exhaust gases leaving the cylinder. Using multiple valves per cylinder results in the same effect - it is often more difficult to fit several small valves than to have larger <b>single</b> <b>valves</b> due to the valve gear required. However, it is difficult to find space for one large valve in the inlet and a large valve on the outlet side. Sometimes a large exhaust valve and two smaller inlet valves are fitted for improved flow. As the pressure generated during combustion provides more force to exhaust the waste gases than the force available to inlet clean charged gas, a larger inlet valve area is needed to provide easier flow. The two smaller inlet valves' total area is larger than that of the <b>single</b> exhaust <b>valve</b> and thus provides that easier inlet flow. This is why exhaust valves are typically smaller in area than the inlet valves.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the pentagrid or heptode (seven-electrode) valve was a novel development in the mixer story.
