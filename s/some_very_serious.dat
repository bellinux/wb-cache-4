The film was {{written and directed by}} Akiva Goldsman and based on Helprin's 1983 novel, and co-starred Jessica Brown Findlay, Russell Crowe, and Will Smith. Farrell won the lead role over younger actors Garrett Hedlund, Tom Hiddleston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Although the film generally received negative reviews due to the overly romantic nature of the film, writers such as The Village Voices Stephanie Zacharek had nothing but praise for Farrell. She described him as [...] "an extraordinary appealing actor" [...] who [...] "has always made a terrific bad boy, but ... seems to be settling into <b>some</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious,</b> responsible-adult roles." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed, writing that the actor [...] "holds the movie together" [...] and is part of [...] "the most beautiful [...] so far of 2014." ...|$|E

Traditionally, these sorts of performances involve the actor/actress wearing tight black and white clothing with white facial makeup. However, contemporary mimes often perform without whiteface. Similarly, while traditional mimes have been completely silent, contemporary mimes, while refraining from speaking, sometimes employ vocal sounds when they perform. Mime acts are often comical, but <b>some</b> can be <b>very</b> <b>serious.</b>|$|R

I charged them with being disguised, and you saw how it told on them, clever as the Hindoo people are in concealing their feelings. There is a mystery about their conduct that I can't explain. They have doubly sacrificed their caste--first, in crossing the sea; secondly, in disguising themselves as jugglers. In the land they live in that is a tremendous sacrifice to make.

60|$|In {{the first}} place, I wish to record my own {{personal}} conviction that no blame whatever, {{in connection with the}} events which I have now related, attaches to Count Fosco. I am informed that a dreadful suspicion has been raised, and that <b>some</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> constructions are placed upon his lordship's conduct. My persuasion of the Count's innocence remains, however, quite unshaken. If he assisted Sir Percival in sending me to Torquay, he assisted under a delusion, for which, as a foreigner and a stranger, he was not to blame. If he was concerned in bringing Mrs. Rubelle to Blackwater Park, it was his misfortune and not his fault, when that foreign person was base enough to assist a deception planned and carried out by the master of the house. I protest, in the interests of morality, against blame being gratuitously and wantonly attached to the proceedings of the Count.|$|E

5000|$|Foxman has {{received}} criticism from Jewish and non-Jewish quarters for his antagonist {{approach to the}} 2004 film The Passion of the Christ and its director Mel Gibson. In September 2003, during the pre-release controversy, Foxman called Gibson [...] "the portrait of an anti-Semite". The next day he said, [...] "I'm not ready to say he's an anti-Semite", but that Gibson [...] "entertains views {{that can only be}} described as anti-Semitic". In November 2003, Foxman said of Gibson, [...] "I think he's infected, seriously infected, with <b>some</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> anti-Semitic views." [...] When Diane Sawyer asked him in February 2004 if Mel Gibson is an anti-Semite and whether The Passion of the Christ is an anti-Semitic movie, Foxman said no to both questions. Foxman was also criticized for his initial response to Gibson's apology for his behavior during his 2006 DUI arrest and for giving second billing to the Seattle Jewish Federation shooting that occurred on the same day. Foxman accepted Gibson's second apology, although he continued to censure Gibson publicly, saying in 2008, [...] "In his heyday, he was No. 1 in Hollywood, the most sought-after star, the people's choice, the icon. Then he revealed himself as an anti-Semite, and look where he is today. That's the beauty of America."Foxman continued to condemn Gibson for The Passion of the Christ, saying in 2008, [...] "What he was doing was giving credibility, on film, in our lifetime, to deicide. Where is Mel Gibson today? He did his movie, and one day he revealed himself to the American people. He's no icon anymore." ...|$|R
40|$|While {{many health}} {{services}} {{strive to be}} equitable, accessible and inclusive, peoples' right to health often goes unrealized, particularly among vulnerable groups. The extent to which health policies explicitly seek to achieve such goals sets the policy context in which services are delivered and evaluated. An analytical framework was developed - EquiFrame - to evaluate 1) {{the extent to which}} 21 Core Concepts of human rights were addressed in policy documents, and 2) coverage of 12 Vulnerable Groups who might benefit from such policies. Using this framework, analysis of 51 policies across Malawi, Namibia, South Africa and Sudan, confirmed the relevance of all Core Concepts and Vulnerable Groups. Further, our analysis highlighted <b>some</b> <b>very</b> strong policies, <b>serious</b> shortcomings in others as well as country-specific patterns. If social inclusion and human rights do not underpin policy formation, it is unlikely they will be inculcated in service delivery.

Everything had gone satisfactorily, and it was most unlikely that Winthrop would be further troubled by the police.

He had no means, he said, of crossing at Dobbs' Ferry, and the round by King's Ferry would be so great that he could not get there in time to answer any purpose.

They had been together at the first station to which Bathurst was appointed when he came out, and he had come to like him greatly; but his evident disinclination to join in any society, his absorption in his work, and a certain air of gravity unnatural in a young man of twenty, had puzzled him.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{endogenous}} money supply forms {{one of the}} cornerstones of postkeynesian economics. It has been developing rapidly during the last twenty years, but is still neglected as a theoretical background for practical central bank policy. This {{may be due to}} the existence of different approaches to money endogeneity within postkeynesian economics. Postkeynesian economics thus lacks a general formulation of money endogeneity. Naturally, we may ask whether reinterpretation of current approaches to endogeneity - structuralism and horizontalism - into more general theoretical framework is possible. This thesis aims at finding answer to this question. It is critical to Fontana's attempt to reinterpret structuralism and horizontalism into more general theory. In my opinion, Fontana misinterprets differences between the two approaches and focuses on their graphical representation too much. Regrettably, the second approach to reinterpretation based on detailed analysis of cross-differences shows that differences, <b>some</b> of them <b>very</b> <b>serious,</b> between horizontalists and structuralists still prevail. I come to the conclusion that so far the reinterpretation of structuralism and horizontalism into more general theory is not possible, thus rejecting my initial hypothesis.

40|$|As the {{construction}} industry faces increased pressures {{to act in a}} more socially responsible way, the concept of "supplier diversity" is one of several topics that have found its way to the corporate social responsibility agenda.
