40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we propose}} two simple and {{efficient}} schemes for establishing anonymity in Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks (CWSNs). The first scheme Simple Anonymity Scheme (SAS), uses {{a range of}} pseudonyms as identifiers for a node to ensure concealment of its true identifier (ID). After deployment, neighbouring nodes share their individual pseudonyms and use them for anonymous communication. The second scheme Cryptographic Anonymity Scheme (CAS), uses a Keyed Cryptographic one way Hash Function (KCHF) for ID concealment. In CAS, neighbouring nodes securely share the information used by the KCHF to generate pseudonyms. Even when many nodes in a neighbourhood are compromised and are colluding, our schemes guarantee complete anonymity to non-compromised nodes during their mutual communication. Our schemes have reasonably low memory and computation costs. They can be embedded into any wireless sensor <b>setwork</b> routing protocol to ensure anonymity and privacy during node discovery...|$|R
40|$|Information on the {{conversion}} efficiency of sawing machines {{is important to}} {{those involved in the}} management, maintenance, and design of sawmills. Little information on {{the conversion}} characteristics of hardwood sawing machines has been available. This study, based on 266 studies of 6 machine types, provides an analysis of the machine characteristics of kerf width, within-board, between-board, and total sawing variations and wood loss per sawline. Machine conversion efficiency was found to be explained by feedworks and <b>setworks</b> type, and sawblade thickness and type. This analysis of machine characteristics provides information for a rational choice of sawing machines for hardwood sawmills...|$|E

40|$|This Research Report critiques the English Home Language Literature setwork {{selection}} {{for the period}} 2009 - 2011 {{in terms of the}} National Curriculum Statement for English Home Language for Grades 10 - 12 to establish whether there is consonance between policy and practice in this section of the syllabus and to determine whether the new national syllabus offers a traditional or a transformational approach to the subject. In order to do this, the National Curriculum Statement is analysed in terms of the principles and outcomes which it intends to be actualised in the study of English and selects those that seem applicable to literature studies. Questions are formulated encapsulating these principles and used as the tools to critique the new national literature syllabus both as regards its individual constituent parts and as regards the syllabus as a whole. A brief comparison between the current prescribed literature selection and <b>setworks</b> set from 1942 to the present day establishes whether the new syllabus has departed from old syllabus designs, whether it acknowledges the new target group of pupils in multiracial English Home Language classrooms by offering a revised, wider and more inclusive selection of novels, dramas, poems and other genres such as short stories, or whether it remains traditionally Anglocentric in conception. The conclusions reached are that although the <b>setworks</b> conform to the letter of the requirements set down in the NCS, the underlying spirit of transformation is not realised. The inclusion of some poets from Africa and South Africa is merely content addition to a Eurocentric core curriculum, a form of tokenism which does not reorientate the syllabus significantly or move it away from its traditional trajectory. The report suggests that literature of merit from both Africa and South Africa be included in every part of the syllabus so that it reflects in some degree the contributions that the continent makes to English literature, in this way including in its scope the interests and identities of the wide range of learners studying English Home Language in the South African context...|$|E
40|$|This article briefly {{sketches}} {{the history}} of African-language literatures as initiated by missionaries and formed by Bantu education. Against this background {{the aim of this}} article is to establish what the objectives of Zulu dramatists were when they presented historical fact, flawed history, as well as ideological sentiment in their historical plays. Are history plays in Zulu simply the products of writers whose objective was to meet a publisher’s requirements, namely to extend the dramatic genre by writing history plays? Did authors perhaps only have an educational objective, that is, to provide learners with <b>setwork</b> material? If, on the other hand, the history play is the creation of a memory for a specific purpose, as post-colonial theorists suggest, the next objective {{of this article is to}} establish what kind of memory Zulu dramatists have created and for what purpose. The history plays will be discussed under the following topics: UNodumehlezi kaMenzi – He who is famous as he sits, son of Menzi (King Shaka). In exploring aspects of Shaka’s rule, it becomes clear that writers express their pain about the great loss the Zulu nation suffered when the Shakan era passed. The second topic treats Izwe lidungekile – The land is in turmoil. The dramas dealt with here vividly depict the pitiful state of the Zulu after their subjugation by the British empire, leading eventually to an inevitable option – armed resistance. The third and last topic, Izwe ngelethu – The land is ours – treats the issue of land...|$|R

40|$|The thesis investigates optical {{measuring}} {{and statistical}} data processing, and presents {{a method to}} understand and reduce sawing variation by examination of sawn timber sizes. Continuous timber size control offers improved opportunities for analysing saw machines or even individual sawblades. The thesis is illustrated with seven saw machine case studies {{that relate to the}} development of the technique. Log and cant breakdown is examined in single- and double-arbor circular saws and bandsaws. The first analysis of each saw machine is made in normal production, and the second using a controlled benchmarking test. A total of 44350 logs were sawn in the study. The behaviour of a saw machine is described using such descriptors as total, within-board and between-board standard deviations, and sawblade bend. Based on observations in benchmarking, an equation y=αeβx±R, where α and β are constants, R the process reproducibility, and x a variable that expresses sawing time and saw load, can be established for each of the saw machine descriptors. An example is the total standard deviation descriptor function s= 0. 21 e 0. 58 x± 0. 11, established for a single-arbor circular saw in a 4 -piece saw set-up. The method will help a sawmill to establish descriptors and equations used to describe the behaviour of their saw machines, to baseline saw machine performance and to compare it to best practices in the industry. The descriptors may be used to establish current, short- or long-term capabilities and characteristics. The method can be used to examine various production conditions and tooling, such as effects of log size, feed speed, and sawing time. Other factors include saw speed, sawblade parameters, operation of <b>setworks</b> and feedworks, and effects of seasons. The results of the study show that sawblade behaviour, feedworks and work piece holding problems, and previous saw machines may be causes of large sawing variation. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project is mainly {{a study of}} attitudes towards Afrikaans and its <b>setworks</b> by non-mother-tongue speakers in Grades 10 - 12 in an English Government school. The approach taken to this research was a combined one. This was {{as a result of}} gathering information through both qualitative and quantitative methods. Grade 10 - 12 learners completed questionnaires in which they indicated their attitudes which were then arranged according to qualitative research. Focus groups were also allocated that can be viewed as qualitative research. The Grade 10 - 12 learners were questioned in smaller groups as to their attitudes to language and their preferences regarding the teaching of poetry. The main research aims, answered in Chapter 4, are the following: to determine whether non-mother-tongue learners in Grades 10 - 12 are negative towards the language Afrikaans, to determine the attitude of non-mother-tongue learners towards poetry, to determine the attitudes of non-mother-tongue learners regarding teaching methods, and to recommend which aims are acceptable when teaching poetry within a South African context to non-mother-tongue learners. The research that involved the learners was completed in July 2006. One hundred Grade 12 learners were involved in the pilot study towards the end of their academic year in 2005. This study required the learners to indicate their feelings regarding their set poems. In 2006, two hundred-and-forty Grade 10 - 12 learners at the same school were involved in answering a more comprehensive questionnaire. This included: the themes they prefer; whether they ever read poetry by choice; and whether the teaching that they received at school, inspired them enough to become life-long poetry readers. The questionnaire also contained an attitude indicator which allowed learners to demonstrate whether they enjoyed something, felt neutral, or did not like it at all. This allowed their attitudes regarding teaching and assessment methods, as well as the compilation of a poetry syllabus with possible themes to be made known. After the information had been processed by the researcher’s statistic analyst, it was found that learners are generally more positive towards the language Afrikaans (61. 59 %), but are negative towards certain aspects of the poetry syllabus. The learners demonstrated that they did not enjoy group work. This is, however, a problem because this is a prerequisite for the Grades 10 – 12 syllabi. A recommendation was made that the educator must give thought to how he or she is going to implement group work. When learners are led in a meaningful way during group work sessions, they will feel that their interpretation is also validated. A further issue that the research highlighted as problematic are the types of poem that are currently prescribed. Learners did, for example, indicate that they did not enjoy analysing poems about death and war. However, the two poems “Begrafnis van ‘n ouma” and “Foto van man wat val” relating to these themes were positively received during the research. A recommendation is made that educators should not necessarily shy away from themes that learners dislike, but perhaps educators could spend the time looking at the type of poem on these themes that could be set. Chapter 5 suggests a model for the teaching of poetry to non-mother-tongue speakers. It offers questions suitable for Afrikaans First Additional Language and the poems were selected according to popular themes as indicated by learners. This {{research project}} suggests that non-mother-tongue learners can be motivated to enjoy Afrikaans poetry. This is dependent on the teaching methodology employed; the type of prescribed poems taught; and learners’ attitudes towards Afrikaans as a language. These factors influence their attitude towards Afrikaans in general. Dissertation (MA (Afrikaans)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Afrikaansunrestricte...|$|E
