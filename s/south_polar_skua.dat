5|$|The {{occurrence}} in Britain of southern (i.e. south polar/brown) skuas is also unresolved. A {{series of reports}} of <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua,</b> from 1982 to 1993, were all eventually rejected after being assessed for several years. Two other birds (from the Isles of Scilly in 2001, and Glamorgan in 2002 have been accepted (by the BOURC) as belonging to one or other of these two species, while a bird from Dorset in 1996 remains under consideration.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's predators include {{birds and}} aquatic mammals. Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) are the {{predominant}} land predator of chicks, responsible {{for up to}} 34% of chick deaths in some colonies though they often scavenge dead penguins as well. The <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua</b> (Stercorarius maccormicki) mainly scavenges for dead chicks, as the live chicks are too large to be attacked {{by the time of}} its annual arrival in the colony. Occasionally, a parent may defend their chick from attack, although it may be more passive if the chick is sickly.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} been {{designated}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as {{a breeding ground for}} seabirds. In 1978–79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of macaroni penguin and, to a lesser extent, chinstrap penguin and Adélie penguin, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989–90. Nyrøysa is the most important colony for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Larsøya. Southern fulmar {{is by far the most}} common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of Cape petrel, Antarctic prion, Wilson's storm petrel, black-bellied storm petrel, subantarctic skua, southern giant petrel, snow petrel, slender-billed prion and Antarctic tern. Kelp gull is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the king penguin, wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, Campbell albatross, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross, sooty albatross, light-mantled albatross, northern giant petrel, Antarctic petrel, blue petrel, soft-plumaged petrel, Kerguelen petrel, white-headed petrel, fairy prion, white-chinned petrel, great shearwater, common diving petrel, <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua</b> and parasitic jaeger.|$|E

40|$|<b>South</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>skuas</b> (Catharacta maccormicki) breed on Ardery Island in {{the absence}} of a local {{breeding}} population of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). Assessment was made of the food remains in skua feeding territories in 1995 / 1996. The diet of <b>South</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>skuas</b> largely consisted of fulmarine petrel species which bred on Ardery Island. Southern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides) remains were the predominant prey items found, and skuas appeared to feed preferentially on this species...|$|R
50|$|Explorers {{have seen}} <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skuas</b> (Catharacta maccormicki). The birds nest close to moist and vegetated areas. Also, snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) {{have been found}} {{breeding}} close to the Ablation Point.|$|R
500|$|There {{are three}} types of birds around Troll: the Antarctic petrel, the snow petrel and the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua.</b> The Antarctic petrel lives on the sea ice {{for most of the}} year, with the {{exception}} of its breeding season (in Antarctica, from November to February), when it moves to the inland mountains and nunataks. The [...] area of ice-free cliffs in Princess Astrid Coast called Svarthamaren Mountain hosts Antarctica's largest known inland colony of breeding seabirds, almost 1 million (250,000 pairs) Antarctic petrels. Many snow petrels and south polar skuas also breed in this area. Snow petrels are generally spread out in smaller colonies throughout the mountainous areas of Queen Maud Land. During the breeding season, the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua</b> feeds exclusively upon the eggs, as well as both young and adult birds, of both petrel species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua</b> (Stercorarius maccormicki) {{was named}} for him by Howard Saunders. McCormick shot the type {{specimen}} on 12 January 1841, on Possession Island, Victoria Land, Antarctica.|$|E
50|$|Seabirds of {{the coast}} include {{southern}} fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides), the scavenging southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus), Cape petrel (Daption capense), snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea), the small Wilson's storm-petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), the large <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua</b> (Catharacta maccormicki), and Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica).|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{exceptionally}} harsh climate, {{there are}} no native resident plants or animals at the South Pole. Remarkably, though, off-course <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skuas</b> and snow petrels are occasionally seen there.|$|R
50|$|A circular, 500 ha site on {{the island}} has been {{designated}} an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding colony of about 135 pairs of imperial shags.

50|$|In the {{southern}} oceans and Antarctica region, some skua species (especially the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua)</b> will readily scavenge the carcasses at breeding colonies of penguins and pinnipeds, sometimes taking live penguin chicks. In these areas, skuas seem {{to defer to}} the considerably larger giant petrels.|$|E
50|$|Muller-Schwarze and {{her husband}} studied the {{behaviour}} of the predetor-prey relationships between the leopard seal and the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua</b> {{as well as the}} prophylactic and defensive behaviour of Adelie penguins, showing that when dispersed by a leopard seal attack, the penguins remain motionless for long periods.|$|E
50|$|The <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua</b> eats mainly {{penguins}} and fish.It {{will also}} eat other birds, rabbits, and carrion.Like most other skua species, it continues this piratical behaviour throughout the year, showing less agility and more brute force than the smaller skuas (jaegers) when it harasses its victims.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:We {{surveyed}} <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skuas</b> (Catharacta maccormicki Saunders) in Antarctica for {{antibodies to}} a series of viral agents using blood serum and cloacal swabs from 124 adult skuas. There were no ticks on the subjects and we were unable to isolate virus from any individual. Skuas, however, were seropositive to some avian viruses: 16. 9 % (20 / 118) had antibodies to infectious bursal disease virus and 10. 5 % (11 / 105) were seropositive for Newcastle disease. We found 1. 0 % (1 / 98) had antibodies to avian influenza, no evidence of egg drop syndrome (0 / 48), but 27. 8 % (10 / 36) had antibodies to flaviviruses. Clearly <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skuas</b> encounter a variety of pathogens either in Antarctica or during their migration in the non-breeding season. There was no evidence of disease in skuas, but the presence of antibodies to pathogens indicates the need to continue to search for the origins of these immunological challenges...|$|R
50|$|The <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua</b> (Stercorarius maccormicki) {{is a large}} seabird in the skua family Stercorariidae. An older {{name for}} the bird is MacCormick’s skua, after {{explorer}} and naval surgeon Robert McCormick, who first collected the type specimen. This species and the other large southern hemisphere skuas, such as the great skua, are sometimes placed in a separate genus Catharacta.|$|E
50|$|Schlatter Glacier is {{a glacier}} {{descending}} from the Asgard Range toward Lake House in Pearse Valley, Victoria Land. Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Roberto P. Schlatter, Chilean biologist {{who worked in}} the United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP) bird-banding program relative to the Adelie penguin and the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua,</b> at Cape Crozier in the 1969-70 and 1970-71 seasons.|$|E
50|$|It breeds on Antarctic coasts, usually laying two eggs in November and December. It is a migrant, {{wintering}} at sea in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans. In {{the eastern}} North Atlantic it {{is replaced by}} the great skua. South polar skuas have been seen at the actual South Pole itself. Megalestris Hill, on Petermann Island in the Wilhelm Archipelago of Antarctica, is named after an obsolete generic name for the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua.</b>|$|E
50|$|The nunatak {{supports}} the largest known seabird colony in Antarctica. Over 250,000 pairs of Antarctic petrels nest there annually, with about 500,000 non-breeding birds also present during the breeding season. Other birds breeding {{at the site}} include snow petrels (up to 1000 pairs) and <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skuas</b> (about 80 pairs).

It also hosts several rare species of lichens. It has been designated an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 124).|$|E
50|$|The Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) is {{a species}} of penguin common along the entire Antarctic coast, which is their only residence. They {{are among the most}} southerly {{distributed}} of all seabirds, along with the emperor penguin, the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skua,</b> the Wilson's storm petrel, the snow petrel, and the Antarctic petrel. They are named after Adélie Land, in turn named for Adèle Dumont D'Urville, the wife of French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville who discovered these penguins in 1840.|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding colony of about 50 pairs of <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skuas.</b> Other birds nesting at the site include brown skuas, southern giant petrels, Wilson's storm petrels, Antarctic terns and kelp gulls. Formerly, some 1000 pairs of Adélie penguins also bred there. Southern elephant seals and Antarctic fur seals commonly haul out on the island.|$|R
40|$|Seabirds in {{seasonal}} environments {{are often}} long-distance migrants and, for many species and populations, their ranges throughout the non-breeding period are unknown. As conditions during the non-breeding season often affect subsequent performance, {{the choice of}} migration strategy can have major implications for timing of breeding and success and, ultimately, population dynamics. We tracked <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skuas</b> Catharacta maccormicki from a single breeding population at King George Island in the South Shetland Islands (Antarctica). Overall, 27 birds (69 %) migrated to the northern Atlantic (3 regions), 10 birds (26 %) to the northern Pacific Ocean (2 regions), and 2 birds wintered in the southern hemisphere. Individuals tracked in consecutive non-breeding seasons chose the same ocean for wintering. Despite migrating to different oceans, birds showed a similar figure-of-eight flight pattern and equivalent residency periods in the main wintering areas. In addition, 87 % of the migrants used terminal stop-over sites off South America shortly {{before returning to the}} breeding site. High diversity of migration patterns may buffer <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>skuas</b> from climate change and other anthropogenic threats...|$|R
