5|$|Gimmick!, known outside Japan as Mr. Gimmick, is a {{platform}} video game developed {{and published by}} Sunsoft, and originally released in Japan for the Family Computer on 31 January 1992. The story follows a <b>small</b> <b>green</b> character named Yumetaro who was given to a young girl as a birthday present. One night, the girl's other toys become jealous of the attention he is receiving, and whisk the girl away to another dimension. Playing as Yumetaro, the player must maneuver {{through a variety of}} levels, using the protagonist's star-shooting power to defeat enemies and progress through the game.|$|E
5|$|Gimmick! is a {{platform}} game that places the player {{in control of}} a <b>small</b> <b>green</b> blob named Yumetaro. The story begins during an unnamed young girl's birthday. Her father is normally busy with work but {{he is able to}} spend time with his family for the special occasion. Earlier, he had went to the store to purchase a new toy for his daughter. Yumetaro had been wandering the toy store and became confused when the father came in. He hid with stuffed toys that looked like him, but was picked up by the girl's father. When the girl opens the Yumetaro gift, she is delighted. Yumetaro becomes the girl's favorite, and so her other toys no longer feel loved. One night, the toys come alive and take the girl to another dimension. The only one left is Yumetaro, who follows the toys in search of the girl.|$|E

5|$|The eighth season {{featured}} Tom Kenny as {{the voice}} of the title character SpongeBob SquarePants and his pet snail Gary. SpongeBob's best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star, was voiced by Bill Fagerbakke, while Rodger Bumpass played the voice of Squidward Tentacles, an arrogant and ill-tempered octopus. Other members of the cast were Clancy Brown as Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money who is SpongeBob's boss at the Krusty Krab; Mr. Lawrence as Plankton, a <b>small</b> <b>green</b> copepod and Mr. Krabs' business rival; Jill Talley as Karen, Plankton's sentient computer sidekick; Carolyn Lawrence as Sandy Cheeks, a squirrel from Texas; Mary Jo Catlett as Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob's boating school teacher; and Lori Alan as Pearl, a teenage whale who is Mr. Krabs' daughter.|$|E
5|$|Another {{close friend}} of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a {{squirrel}} from Texas. She is a scientist and an expert in karate. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a <b>small</b> <b>green</b> copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less conceited than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which is why he almost always walks around town.|$|E
5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a <b>small</b> <b>green</b> room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E

25|$|A Gin Pennant {{means that}} the wardroom is {{inviting}} officers from ships in company to drinks. The origins of the Gin Pennant are uncertain, {{but it seems to}} have been used since the 1940s and probably earlier. Originally it was a <b>small</b> <b>green</b> triangular pennant measuring approximately , defaced with a white wine glass, nowadays the gin pennant is a Starboard pennant defaced with a wine or cocktail glass. Its colour, size and position when hoisted were all significant as the aim was for the pennant to be as inconspicuous as possible, thereby having fewer ships sight it and subsequently accept the invitation for drinks. The Gin Pennant is still in regular use by Commonwealth Navies, such as the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Within the RAN it is common practice, whilst in port, for junior officers of one ship to attempt to raise the Gin Pennant on the halyard of another ship, thereby forcing that ship to put on free drinks for the officers of the ship that managed to raise the pennant. If, however the junior officers are caught raising the pennant, then it is their ship that must put on free drinks within their Wardroom. Usually this practice is restricted to Commonwealth Navies; however, prior to increased force protection, RAN officers have successfully raised the Gin Pennant on a number of units in the USN.|$|E
25|$|Figure 3 {{shows the}} crystal {{structure}} of YAlB14 viewed along the x-axis. The large black spheres are Y atoms, the small blue spheres are Al atoms and the <b>small</b> <b>green</b> spheres are the bridging boron sites; B12 clusters are depicted as the green icosahedra. Boron framework of YAlB14 {{is one of}} the simplest among icosahedron-based borides – it consists of only one kind of icosahedra and one bridging boron site. The bridging boron site is tetrahedrally coordinated by four boron atoms. Those atoms are another boron atom in the counter bridge site and three equatorial boron atoms of one of three B12 icosahedra. Aluminium atoms are separated by 0.2911nm and are arranged in lines parallel to the x-axis, whereas yttrium atoms are separated by 0.3405nm. Both the Y atoms and B12 icosahedra form zigzags along the x-axis. The bridging boron atoms connect three equatorial boron atoms of three icosahedra and those icosahedra make up a network parallel to the (101) crystal plane (x-z plane in the figure). The bonding distance between the bridging boron and the equatorial boron atoms is 0.1755nm, which is typical for the strong covalent B-B bond (bond length 0.17–0.18nm); thus, the bridging boron atoms strengthen the individual network planes. On the other hand, the large distance between the boron atoms within the bridge (0.2041nm) suggests weaker interaction, and thus the bridging sites contribute little to the bonding between the network planes.|$|E

500|$|Persoonia levis, {{commonly}} known as the broad-leaved geebung, is a shrub native to New South Wales and Victoria in eastern Australia. It reaches 5m (16ft) in height and has dark grey papery bark and bright green asymmetrical sickle-shaped leaves up to 14cm (5.5in) long and 8cm (3.2in) wide.

A. brownii is monoecious; that is, {{the male and female}} flowers are found together on the same plant.
