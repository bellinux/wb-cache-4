500|$|In early February, ECB {{president}} Mario Draghi {{agreed that}} {{expansionary monetary policy}} like QE have not been undertaken to deliberately cause devaluation. Draghi's statement did however hint that the ECB may take action if the Euro continues to appreciate, and this saw {{the value of the}} European currency fall considerably. A mid February statement from the G7 affirmed the advanced economies commitment to avoid currency war. It was initially read by the markets as an endorsement of Japan's actions, though later clarification suggested the US would like Japan to tone down some of its language, specifically by not linking policies like QE to an expressed desire to devalue the Yen. Most commentators have asserted that if a new round of competitive devaluation occurs it would be harmful for the global economy. [...] However some analysts have stated that Japan's planned actions could be in the long term interests {{of the rest of the}} world; just as he did for the 2010–11 incident, economist Barry Eichengreen has suggested that even if many other countries start intervening against their currencies it could boost growth worldwide, as the effects would be similar to semi-coordinated global monetary expansion. Other analysts have expressed skepticism about the risk of a war breaking out, with Marc Chandler, chief currency <b>strategist</b> <b>at</b> Brown Brothers Harriman, advising that: [...] "A real currency war remains a remote possibility." ...|$|E

In his article, he narrated that [...] "Weak trade data out of China, released over the weekend, weighed on the currencies of Australia and New Zealand on Monday. But the yuan didn’t budge. Indeed, the Chinese currency, {{also known as the}} renminbi, has been remarkably steady over the past month despite the huge selloff in China’s stock market and a spate of disappointing economic data. Market strategists, including Simon Derrick, chief currency <b>strategist</b> <b>at</b> BNY Mellon, and Marc Chandler, head currency <b>strategist</b> <b>at</b> Brown Brothers Harriman, said that’s because China’s policy makers have effectively re-pegged the yuan. “When I look at the dollar-renminbi right now, that looks like a fixed exchange rate again.

2500|$|French and Haig were sceptical {{about the}} riding {{abilities}} of Mounted Infantry, {{and felt that}} Roberts was wasting too many horses on them (Haig letter to his sister 16 March 1900) and that the cavalry had been [...] "practically starving" [...] since 11 February. Bloemfontein fell on 13 March, and soon suffered an outbreak of typhoid. In an implicit criticism of Roberts, French recorded (22 March 1900) that there [...] "would be a grand opportunity for a great <b>strategist</b> <b>at</b> the head of affairs". With Roberts’ main army immobilised by disease at Bloemfontein, de Wet was still active making raids around the British periphery. Roberts eventually (20 March) sent French with a single cavalry brigade and some guns and MI in a vain attempt to intercept Olivier’s column (numbering 6,000–7,000 men) at Thabanchu. French made another raid to Karee Siding (29 March)—but {{until the middle of}} April he devoted most of his energies to inspecting the horses, many of them Argentinian, with which his division was being remounted.|$|E
2500|$|In mid January 2013, Japan's {{central bank}} {{signaled}} {{the intention to}} launch an open ended bond buying programme which would likely devalue the yen. This resulted in numerous senior central bankers and finance ministers warning of a possible fresh round of currency war. First to raise the alarm was Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy chairman at Russia's central bank. He was later joined by many others including Bahk Jae-wan, the finance minister for South Korea, and by Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank. Weidmann held the view that interventions during the 2009-11 period were not intense enough to count as competitive devaluation, but that a genuine currency war is now a real possibility. Japan's economy minister Akira Amari {{has said that the}} Bank of Japan's bond buying programme is intended to combat deflation, and not to weaken the yen. Most commentators have asserted that if a new round of competitive devaluation occurs it would be harmful for the global economy. [...] However some analysts have stated that Japan's planned actions could be in the long term interests {{of the rest of the}} world; just as he did for the 2010-11 incident, [...] economist Barry Eichengreen has suggested that even if many other countries start intervening against their currencies it could boost growth worldwide, as the effects would be similar to semi-coordinated global monetary expansion.

50|$|The {{military}} {{connection between}} Argentina and Prussia {{has often been}} emphasized, and sympathy for Germany among the general staff in Buenos Aires contributed to establishing Argentina's policy of neutrality during the two world wars. From {{the point of view}} of Argentine <b>strategists</b> <b>at</b> the end of the nineteenth century, it was a clever move to fall in line with the strongest European war machine. Great Britain and North America became aware of the threat that Argentina's German-speakers, which were a quarter million strong, acted as the Reich's agent. There was indeed widespread support for Nazi Germany among the Argentines, not least under the aspect of counterbalancing Anglo-US influence in the region.|$|R

The key principles of scenario planning include thinking from the outside in about the forces in the contextual environment that are driving change, engaging multiple perspectives to identify and interpret those forces, and adopting a long view.|$|R
