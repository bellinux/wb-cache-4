Exports to the United States and European Union fell 15.4 percent and 11.2 percent respectively. The decline in exports and increase in imports cut Japan's trade surplus $1.28 billion a decline of 90 percent from the previous year.

He recommended that Newton hire Betty Van Patter as bookkeeper; she was then working for Ramparts.

500|$|... "Ghost of a Chance" [...] {{continues}} {{a common}} motif repeated throughout {{the first season}} of Crosetti discussing various conspiracy theories about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States. Crosetti <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> the killing was arranged by the highest ranks of the Confederate States of America. Crosetti's fascination with the Lincoln assassination was based on Tom Fontana's real-life obsession with it.

500|$|The {{character}} has placed in numerous [...] "best villain" [...] lists over the years, including AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains. Spacey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, turning {{him from a}} character actor into a star. Since {{the release of the}} film, the {{character has}} become synonymous with infamous criminals. Analysis of the character has focused on the ambiguity of his true identity and whether he even exists inside the story's reality. Though the filmmakers have preferred to leave the character's nature to viewer interpretation, Singer has <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> Kint and Söze are the same person.|$|E

500|$|Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club {{said the}} faux-documentary {{style of the}} show, and Leslie's naive faith about her project and {{department}} in this episode, draw unflattering comparisons to The Office, which was also made by the Park and Recreation creators. Tobias said the Scrabble subplot brought [...] "the few good laughs" [...] in the episode. Jason Hughes of TV Squad said {{he was having trouble}} connecting to the Leslie character, but felt [...] "The Reporter" [...] allowed for further development of supporting characters like Ron, Tom and Mark, who is portrayed as self-absorbed and [...] "a bit of a douche." [...] Brigid Brown of Cinema Blend <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> Rashida Jones is being underutilized by the show.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige {{said that}} both this film and Thor would be {{released}} in 3-D. Johnston did a one-day test shooting with a 3-D rig, rather than shooting in 2-D and converting, and found it [...] "a nightmare" [...] due to bulky gear, calibration issues and restricted filmmaking options. Nevertheless, he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> 3-D is [...] "a new challenge and it's exciting". Feige insisted that the conversion would not compromise the film's image quality, as the decision to release the film in 3-D was made early in development, and that [...] "an unprecedented amount of time" [...] would be devoted to the conversion process, to render all the film's visual effects in true 3-D.|$|E

500|$|Season five {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between Martha and Lionel. Both Annette O'Toole and Al Gough said Lionel was slightly attracted to Martha, but {{that she would never}} act on that feeling. The producers had no intentions to create a romantic relationship between the two characters. Most of Lionel's motivations in season five are shrouded in mystery. Glover said he could not determine whether his character is good or bad, so when he is portraying him in season five he tried to present everything as if it was [...] "good". Glover <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> Lincoln Cole's (Ian Tracey) actions in [...] "Mercy" [...] made Lionel rethink everything his past behavior and his own character. By the end of the fifth season, Lionel has learned that people have a responsibility to each other.|$|E
500|$|Morrison has <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> in {{the jazz}} improvisational {{technique}} of never performing a song {{the same way}} twice and except for the unique rendition of the Astral Weeks songs live, doesn't perform a concert from a preconceived set list. Morrison has said he prefers to perform at smaller venues or symphony halls noted for their good acoustics. His ban against alcoholic beverages, which made entertainment news during 2008, {{was an attempt to}} prevent the disruptive and distracting movement of audience members leaving their seats during the performances. In a 2009 interview, Morrison stated: [...] "I do not consciously aim to take the listener anywhere. If anything, I aim to take myself there in my music. If the listener catches the wavelength of what I am saying or singing, or gets whatever point whatever line means to them, then I guess as a writer I may have done a day's work." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison's {{music has}} been {{described}} by music journalist Alan Light as [...] "Celtic soul", or what biographer Brian Hinton referred to as a new alchemy called [...] "Caledonian soul." [...] Another biographer, Ritchie Yorke quoted Morrison as believing that he has [...] "the spirit of Caledonia in his soul and his music reflects it." [...] According to Yorke, Morrison claimed to have discovered [...] "a certain quality of soul" [...] when he first visited Scotland (his Belfast ancestors were of Ulster Scots descent) and Morrison has <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> there is some connection between soul music and Caledonia. Yorke said Morrison [...] "discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale (without sevenths) which of course is the same scale as that used by bagpipe players and old Irish and Scottish folk music." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{development}} {{seems to}} have been supported by the Nazi regime: it may have got him conveniently out of the way, {{yet at the same time}} he propagated a German view of musical history and education.

500|$|While Hemingway {{painstakingly}} describes seemingly extraneous minutiae from Nick's fishing trip, he avoids or barely {{hints at}} {{the driving force of}} the work: the emotional turmoil wrought on Nick by his return home from a catastrophic war. Hemingway has <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute, writing [...] "'Big Two-Hearted River' is about a boy beat to the wide coming home from the war.... beat to the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat, since those who had been were unable to comment on this condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence. So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war is omitted." [...] Flora believes that in [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] the concept of the iceberg theory is more evident than in any other piece written by Hemingway.|$|E
500|$|The final {{few minutes}} of [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{introduced}} major developments for several of the characters, including Leslie being approached with the idea to run for elected office, {{which has been a}} lifelong dream for her. Additionally, Tom decides to leave city hall to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions, a progression of his character that had been building throughout the third season. Series co-creator Michael Schur <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> characters should change and their situations should change throughout the season, so he wanted them to be in a very different place {{at the end of the}} season than where they were from the beginning. Schur also described his fellow co-creator Greg Daniels' theory about finale episode as: [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and then you have all summer to figure out how to get yourself out of it". Although Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet and the writers would be brainstorming how to handle them over the summer.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} website for The Office included three cut scenes from [...] "Blood Drive" [...] {{within a week}} of its original release.

Later, while giving blood himself, he asks the hospital employee, [...] "How do I know it's not going to go into a person who will later come back to kill me?" [...] The second clip was two minutes of extended footage from the singles party. Meredith talks about her husband leaving her for a garbage-woman whom her kids now consider their real mother instead of herself, and Dwight <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> his soulmate, [...] "probably died 700 years ago in feudal Japan after having impersonated a samurai, {{or at the very least}} she lives somewhere outside the Scranton Wilkes-Barre corridor." [...] In the final 90-second clip, Dwight shows off his bobblehead doll collection to a woman, Creed tries unsuccessfully to pick up Lynne, and Dwight gets rid of an attractive male visitor who Michael fears could be competition.
