5000|$|The {{archetype}} {{of the modern}} form of the two-stroke diesel is the (high-speed) Detroit Diesel Series 71 engine, designed by Charles F. [...] "Boss" [...] Kettering {{and his colleagues at}} General Motors Corporation in 1938, in which the blower pressurizes a chamber in the engine block that {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "air box". The (very much larger medium-speed) Electro-Motive Diesel engine is used as the prime mover in EMD diesel-electric locomotive, marine and stationary applications, and was designed by the same team, and is built to the same principle. However, a significant improvement built into most later EMD engines is the mechanically assisted turbo-compressor, which provides charge air using mechanical assistance during starting (thereby obviating the necessity for Roots-blown scavenging), and provides charge air using an exhaust gas-driven turbine during normal operations—thereby providing true turbocharging and additionally increasing the engine's power output by at least fifty percent.In a two-stroke diesel engine, as the cylinder's piston approaches the bottom dead centre exhaust ports or valves are opened relieving most of the excess pressure after which a passage between the air box and the cylinder is opened, permitting air flow into the cylinder. The air flow blows the remaining combustion gases from the cylinder—this is the <b>scavenging</b> <b>process.</b> As the piston passes through bottom centre and starts upward, the passage is closed and compression commences, culminating in fuel injection and ignition. Refer to two-stroke diesel engines for more detailed coverage of aspiration types and supercharging of two-stroke diesel engines.|$|E

The effectiveness of the scavenging systems was defined by means of qualitative scavenging efficiency. A special testing device for the model engine has been developed and a liquid working media (instead of gaseous) is used.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{cycle in}} Arctic aerosol is typified by {{high concentrations of}} large aged anthropogenic particles transported from lower latitudes in the late Arctic winter and early spring followed by a sharp transition to low concentrations of locally sourced smaller particles in the summer. However, multi-model assessments show that many models fail to simulate a realistic cycle. Here, we use a global aerosol microphysics model (GLOMAP) and surface-level aerosol observations to understand how wet <b>scavenging</b> <b>processes</b> control the seasonal variation in Arctic black carbon (BC) and sulphate aerosol. We show that the transition from high wintertime concentrations to low concentrations in the summer {{is controlled by the}} transition from ice-phase cloud scavenging to the much more efficient warm cloud scavenging in the late spring troposphere. This seasonal cycle is amplified further by the appearance of warm drizzling cloud in the late spring and summer boundary layer. Implementing these processes in GLOMAP greatly improves the agreement between the model and observations at the three Arctic ground-stations Alert, Barrow and Zeppelin Mountain on Svalbard. The SO 4 model-observation correlation coefficient (R) increases from: − 0. 33 to 0. 71 at Alert (82. 5 ° N), from − 0. 16 to 0. 70 at Point Barrow (71. 0 ° N) and from − 0. 42 to 0. 40 at Zeppelin Mountain (78 ° N).

During these campaigns, suspended matter was collected by different techniques in order to analyze the spatial and vertical distribution of several particulate trace elements {{in relation to the}} global biogeochemical cycle of carbon. It appears that horizontal distribution varies strongly from one element to another and is mainly influenced either by anthropogenic and terrigenous inputs or by <b>scavenging</b> <b>processes.</b> On the other hand, the vertical distribution seems mainly linked to the primary production. In parallel to these trace element measurements, experiments were carried out to estimate the transfer rates of these elements from the dissolved to the particulate phase using radioactive tracers. The results clearly indicate that biological activity {{plays an important role in}} these transfers...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} eight rotamers of 3 ′-Methyl-quercetin {{have been}} optimized by using density functional theory (DFT) at B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G∗ level of theory. The molecular structure and molecular {{properties of the}} most stable rotamers have been investigated {{at the same level}} of theory. We have computed the descriptors; electronegativity (χ), hardness (η), electrophilicity (ω), softness (S) and electrophilicity index (ωi) by DFT approach. We have shed light on the structure–property relationship. The absorption spectrum has been computed by time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at TD-B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G∗ level of theory. Radical scavenging activity has been explained on the basis of bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) and the adiabatic ionization potential (IP). Two mechanisms have been explained for the radical <b>scavenging</b> <b>processes,</b> i. e., hydrogen atom transfer and one-electron transfer...|$|R
