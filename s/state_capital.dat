5|$|During {{and after}} the Revolutionary War, Albany County saw a great {{increase}} in real estate transactions. After Horatio Gates' win over John Burgoyne at Saratoga in 1777, the upper Hudson Valley was generally at peace as the war raged on elsewhere. Prosperity was soon seen all over Upstate New York. Migrants from Vermont and Connecticut began flowing in, noting the advantages of living on the Hudson and trading at Albany, while being only a few days' sail from New York City. Albany reported a population of 3,498 in the first national census in 1790, an increase of almost 700% since its chartering. In 1797, the <b>state</b> <b>capital</b> of New York was moved permanently to Albany. From statehood to this date, the Legislature had frequently moved the <b>state</b> <b>capital</b> between Albany, Kingston, Hurley, Poughkeepsie, {{and the city of}} New York. Albany is the tenth-oldest <b>state</b> <b>capital</b> in the United States, but only the second-oldest <b>state</b> <b>capital</b> that is a city, after Santa Fe, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|As the {{northern}} tribal lands gradually opened to white settlement, Indiana's population rapidly increased {{and the center}} of population shifted continually northward. Indianapolis was selected to be the site of the new <b>state</b> <b>capital</b> in 1820 because of its central position within the state. The city founders assumed the White River would serve as a major transportation artery; however, the waterway was too sandy for navigation. In 1825, Indianapolis replaced Corydon as the seat of government. The government became established in the Marion County Courthouse as the second <b>state</b> <b>capital</b> building.|$|E

5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} <b>state</b> <b>capital.</b> Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the <b>state</b> <b>capital</b> contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E

50|$|The library {{has failed}} to {{effectively}} expand to the 36 <b>state</b> <b>capitals</b> of the federation as designated by the library decree of 1970. In concert {{with the lack of}} facilities in the <b>state</b> <b>capitals,</b> a lack of adequate social amenities for the library staff in some <b>state</b> <b>capitals</b> is another obstacle to the library's development. There is also a lack of sufficient professional librarians; the library failed to effectively protect itself by training students in library science, today the few graduates of library science gravitate towards jobs in the publishing business. The lack of adequate amenities provided by the library also does not help in recruitment. There are also insufficient storage devices for audio or visual collections.|$|R
