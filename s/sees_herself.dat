5|$|Gaga grew up {{listening}} to artists such as the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Mariah Carey, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Blondie, and Garbage, who have all influenced her music. Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers like Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists like David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater. The singer has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> reflected in Gaga. Gaga says that she wants to revolutionize pop music like Madonna. Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, including Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath. She credits Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E
25|$|Lucious' outspoken {{ex-wife and}} mother of his three sons. She serves a 17-year stretch in prison for drug dealing and <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> as the {{sacrificial}} lamb for Empire Entertainment, which she built with Lucious, but then took the fall for him while running the very drugs that financed Lucious' early career. Upon her return from prison, she is determined to bring the Lyon family back together and reclaim her share of Empire Entertainment. In the second season, Cookie leaves the Empire group and starts her own record label, Lyon Dynasty. After allowing Empire Entertainment to acquire Lyon Dynasty, she returns to Empire as co-CEO and Head of A. Cookie's lovers were Malcolm Deveaux (Season 1), Laz Delgado (Season 2) and Angelo DuBois (Season 3).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{protection}} spell is causing Regina {{to believe that}} Emma trapped her inside, and as she <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> in the mirror Regina changes her clothes to those she used to wear as the Evil Queen. When Emma and Elsa arrive and unseal the Vault, Regina uses her pyrokinetic powers against them and they shield themselves with the ribbons on their wrists; the ribbons free Emma and Elsa, and Emma uses her powers to stall Regina from going after them. Regina, believing that Emma went to the Sheriff's station, shows up there, only {{to set up a}} battle between her and Mary Margaret. Regina then makes Anna and Kristoff disappear, and they end up on the beachfront. As Kristoff argues with Anna, she trips her leg on a bottle. Anna picks up the bottle and hits Kristoff on his head knocking him out, allowing the letter that was inside the bottle to fall into Anna's hands. Anna then reads the letter and she races off to the Snow Queen's lair.|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{becomes more}} politicized and {{develops}} {{a new sense}} of Black identity. Even Angelou's decision to leave show business is political. She <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> as a social and cultural historian of her time, and of the civil rights and Black literary movement of the late 1950s and early 1960s. She becomes more attracted to the causes of Black militants in the US and Africa, to the point of entering into a relationship with a significant militant, and becomes more committed to activism. During this time, she becomes an active political protester, but she does not think of herself in that way. She places the focus upon herself and uses the autobiographical form to demonstrate how the civil rights movement influenced her. According to Hagen, Angelou's contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and [...] "eminently effective".|$|E
500|$|Lisa, {{despite being}} a child prodigy, often <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> as a misfit within the Simpson family and other {{children}} {{due to her}} extremely high level of intelligence. She shows characteristics rarely seen in Springfield, including spirituality and commitment to peaceful ways, and is notably more concerned with world affairs than her life in Springfield, with her rebellion against social norms being depicted as constructive and heroic, yet she can be self-righteous at times. In [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", an increasing sense of moral righteousness leads her to disrupt her father's roast-pig barbecue, an act for which she later apologizes. Episodes often take shots at Lisa's idealism and virtue signalling. In [...] "Bart Star", (season nine, 1997) Lisa, departs from her typically more genuine nature and apparently {{looking for a new}} cause to crusade over, defiantly declares that she, a girl, would like to join the football team. In the 1990s, it was considered odd to allow a girl to play football. However, when coach Ned Flanders reveals that several girls already play for the team, she hesitates and claims football is [...] "not really [...] thing". She then expresses distaste about a ball made of pig's skin, but one of the girls informs her that their footballs are synthetic and that proceeds are donated to Amnesty International. Upset by being unable to gain moral superiority, Lisa runs off.|$|E
500|$|When New Directions starts {{planning}} a setlist for the impending Nationals competition, Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) is frustrated that Rachel (Lea Michele) is again singing lead while she remains {{stuck in the}} background, and walks out. When Rachel tries to bribe her to withdraw her objections, she tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} experience a standing ovation of her own. Tina later falls into a fountain and strikes her head, which causes her to experience a vision in which all of the glee club members have switched roles,—most notably, she <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> as Rachel and Rachel as Tina. [...] "Rachel" [...] performs [...] "Because You Loved Me", and the club gives her a standing ovation. She thanks [...] "Tina" [...] for her support, and [...] "Tina" [...] in turn gives [...] "Rachel" [...] advice on how to salvage her failed NYADA audition. After Tina comes back to reality, she conveys that advice: Rachel should see NYADA dean Carmen Tibideaux (Whoopi Goldberg) in person—she is conducting a master class at Oberlin. Tina drives Rachel there, but Carmen has been annoyed by Rachel's repeated messages and says she does not deserve any special attention. Tina disagrees, telling Carmen that although Rachel gets whatever she wants and is [...] "a pain in the ass", Rachel gets it all because she is exceptional. Rachel invites Carmen to attend their Nationals performance, and pledges to audition for NYADA every year until she is accepted.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Susan {{developed}} retrograde amnesia. The storyline saw Susan slip on some spilt {{milk and}} sustain a minor head injury. After {{she goes to}} sleep, she wakes up and has lost three decades of her life. Woodburne told Inside Soap's Jason Herbison that Susan believes the year is 1972 and the night before was her sixteenth birthday, where she drank too much champagne. She does not recognise her house and thinks she passed out and ended up somewhere else. Susan's family {{take her to the}} hospital, where she is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia. Karl becomes determined to tell her the truth about her condition, while her nephew, Darcy (Mark Raffety), insists they treat her [...] "with kid gloves." [...] Woodburne revealed [...] "Susan keeps asking when she's going to be allowed home to see her parents, and eventually Karl breaks the news - her parents are long dead and she's actually 45, not 16 as she believes. And on top of that, Karl is her husband!" [...] Susan turns to her daughter Libby – who she believes is her sister Carmel (Kirsty Child) – for comfort. But when Libby confirms what Karl has told her, Susan leaves the hospital. Susan spots some students in Seventies clothes and she follows them to a Seventies themed party at Erinsborough High. However, the students recognise Susan as their principal, which distresses her. Susan ends up in the bathroom and she <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> in the mirror {{for the first time since}} the accident, and is shocked to see a middle-aged woman staring back at her.|$|E
500|$|When Lisa {{develops}} stomach aches, she visits Dr. Hibbert, who {{suggests he}} could prescribe 'harsh Antacids' but says herbal tea could also work. Lisa wants the tea but Homer, scoffs at the tea and demands the antacids. While leaving the office Lisa {{has had enough}} and snaps at her father for belittling everything she believes in. When Lisa sees how she upset him, she says that they are just too different and will eventually drift apart. To make things up to her, Homer takes her to a local New Age store which introduces Homer and Lisa to water-filled sensory deprivation tanks, where they experience their own spiritual journey. On her journey, Lisa <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> from Homer's perspective, reprimanding him for snoring during a ballet recital. Lisa realizes that despite his boorish personality, Homer loves Lisa enough {{to take her to}} events and places that he does not personally like just so she can be happy. Meanwhile, a pair of repo men start to clean out the store despite the lease not being up for months, taking the tank that Homer is in. Homer's [...] "journey" [...] becomes a real one, as his tank falls {{out of the back of}} the van. Mistaken by the Flanders' as a coffin, they bury him, only for the tank to fall through the soil and into a pipe where it is washed up onto the beach. Chief Wiggum finds it and returns it to the store. Lisa decides to go and do something they both enjoy. But they end up at a demolition derby together, even though Homer is the only fan.|$|E

2500|$|The show offers {{few details}} of the Sacred Scrolls. One {{important}} feature mentioned is the Book of Pythia, which chronicles an ancient prophetess (similar to the Oracle of Delphi named Pythia) who journeyed with the Thirteenth Tribe on their voyage to Earth. Pythia also described the exodus of the other Twelve Tribes, {{and the things that}} happened to them. She describes a dying leader who would guide the tribes to salvation. President Roslin <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> as playing the part of the leader in the texts, as she has terminal breast cancer. Another important quotation from the scrolls is the recurring phrase [...] "this is not all that we are," [...] a phrase considered the foundational statement of faith.|$|E

This caused controversy, because L'Oréal {{is involved}} in animal testing and because the company is part-owned by Nestlé, which has been criticised for its treatment of third world producers. Anita Roddick addressed it directly {{in an interview with}} The Guardian, which reported that [...] "she <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> as a kind of 'Trojan horse' who by selling her business to a huge firm will be able to influence the decisions it makes.

Meanwhile, personal revelations contained within the flashforwards occupy the personal lives of the principal characters. Mark Benford sees himself relapsing into alcoholism; his wife <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> with another man; Demetri Noh sees nothing, which could mean {{that he will not}} be alive to see the day everyone else has glimpsed or, perhaps, that his future wasn't set {{on the day of the}} flashforward.

Halsey has stated her debut album wasn't supposed to be [...] "a radio album," [...] but expects Hopeless Fountain Kingdom to generate some airplay, [...] "I am more than capable of writing radio music... and hopefully I'll put my money where my mouth is on this album." [...] However, she still <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> as [...] "an alternative artist."

2500|$|Schopenhauer Ending (1856) – {{following}} his {{discovery of the}} philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer and his growing interest in Buddhist philosophy, Wagner once again changed {{the ending of the}} Ring. The Schopenhauer ending stressed self-overcoming, resignation and the illusory nature of human existence, in keeping with the notion of negation of the Will. Brünnhilde <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> redeemed from the endless cycle of birth, suffering, death and rebirth; enlightened by love, she achieves the state of non-being, or Nirvana. Wagner wrote out a prose sketch of this new ending in 1856 (WWV 86D Text VIIIb), but he did not set it to verse until 1871 or 1872, adding the text and its fair copy to his personal copy of the 1853 printing of the Ring libretti.
