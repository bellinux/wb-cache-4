40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} outcomes including operating time, blood loss, {{length of}} stay (LOS), return to work and complications of laparoscopic hysterectomy performed with automatic <b>stapling</b> <b>devices.</b> Methods: Between 6 / 11 / 91 and 11 / 23 / 95, 127 laparoscopic hysterectomies were performed with automatic <b>stapling</b> <b>devices.</b> On an average, 6 firings with the stapler were done per case. Postoperative telephone survey and retrospective review of records were done. Results: Data averages for operating time, blood loss, LOS and return to work, respectively, were 90 minutes, 190 cc’s, 1. 1 day and 2 weeks. Significant complications included delayed postoperative bleeding in 4 patients, all of which occurred within the first 35 cases. One was controlled laparoscopically and 3 others required exploratory laparotomies. Since certain precautionary measures as described were taken, hemorrhagic complications were eliminated. Conclusions: Laparoscopic hysterectomy can be performed safely and effectively with automatic <b>stapling</b> <b>devices</b> in properly selected patients.

40|$|Abstract Background Laparoscopic live donor {{nephrectomy}} {{has become}} the preferred method of donor nephrectomy at many transplant centers. The laparoscopic <b>stapling</b> <b>device</b> is commonly used for division of the renal vessels. Malfunction of the <b>stapling</b> <b>device</b> can occur, and is often due to interference from previously placed clips. We report our experience with a clipless technique in which no vascular clips are placed on tributaries of the renal vein {{at or near the}} renal hilum in order to avoid laparoscopic <b>stapling</b> <b>device</b> misfires. Methods From December 20, 2002 to April 12, 2005, 50 patients underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic left donor nephrectomy (LDN) at our institution. Clipless management of the renal vein tributaries was used in all patients, and these vessels were divided using either a laparoscopic <b>stapling</b> <b>device</b> or the LigaSureTM device (Valleylab, Boulder, CO). The medical and operative records of the donors and recipients were reviewed to evaluate patient outcomes. Results The mean follow-up time was 14 months. Of the 50 LDN procedures, there were no laparoscopic <b>stapling</b> <b>device</b> malfunctions and no vascular complications. All renal allografts were functioning at the time of follow-up. Conclusion Laparoscopic <b>stapling</b> <b>device</b> failure due to deployment across previously placed surgical clips during laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy can be prevented by not placing clips on the tributaries of the renal vein. In our series, there were no vascular complications and no device misfires. We believe this clipless technique improves the safety of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. </p...|$|E

The maximum pressure resistance of the anastomotic site of a porcine aortic specimen and a Dacron graft was examined (n= 10). A porcine aorta with Dacron graft was anastomosed to a beating heart, and pressure overload was induced by adrenaline (n= 5). Specimens of the anastomotic sites were harvested after 14 days and examined histologically. ResultsThe maximum pressure resistance of the anastomotic site was 427. 3 ± 34. 4 (375 – 511) mmHg. No anastomotic sites leaked as a result of pressure overloading at 227. 6 ± 21. 1 (201 – 260) mmHg. Histologically, good incorporation and cell coverage were observed, and the inner surfaces of the anastomotic sites were smooth and without stenoses.

40|$|Aim: To analyze {{outcomes}} of intrathoracic esophageal anastomosis performed using mechanical <b>stapling</b> <b>devices.</b> Methodology: We retrospectively analyzed {{the records of}} 56 consecutive patients who underwent esophagectomy, total gastrectomy, or degastro-gastrectomy with mechanical intrathoracic esophageal anastomosis between 1995 and 2006. The mean age of patients according to procedure were 62. 5, 67. 4, and 69. 6 years, respectively. Results: We observed only one anastomotic leak (1. 6 %), which we treated medically.

We retrospectively reviewed 11 patients with above-knee amputation cases using a linear cutting <b>stapling</b> <b>device</b> over a 10 -year period and compared those to 13 patients in whom we used electrocautery.

40|$|Abstract Purpose Distal rectal {{stapling}} {{is often}} challenging because of limited space and visibility. We compared two <b>stapling</b> <b>devices</b> in the distal rectum in a cadaver study: the iDrive™ right angle linear cutter (RALC) (Covidien, New Haven, CT) and the CONTOUR ® curved cutter (CC) (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH). Methods Twelve male cadavers underwent pelvic dissection by 4 surgeons. After rectal mobilization as {{in a total}} mesorectal excision, the staplers were applied to the rectum as deep as possible in both the coronal and sagittal positions. The distance from the pelvic floor was measured for each application. A questionnaire rated the visibility and access of the <b>stapling</b> <b>devices.</b> Measurements were taken between pelvic landmarks to see what anatomic factors hinder the placement of a distal rectal stapler. Results The median (range) distance of the stapler from the pelvic floor in the coronal position for the RALC was 1. 0 cm (0 - 4. 0) vs. 2. 0 cm (0 - 5. 0) for the CC, p = 0. 003. In the sagittal position, the median distance was 1. 6 cm (0 - 3. 5) for the RALC and 3. 3 cm (0 - 5. 0) for the CC, p Conclusions The RALC is superior to the CC in terms of access, visibility, and ease of placement in the deep pelvis.

40|$|<b>Stapling</b> <b>devices</b> {{are used}} in gastrointestinal, gynecologic, thoracic, and many other {{surgeries}} to resect organs, transect tissues, and anastomose different structures. These devices became widely accepted standard practice in many gastrointestinal operations, especially since the successful advent of minimally invasive surgery. Despite the relevant advantages related {{to the use of}} a surgical stapler, we must also consider that these instruments may be at risk of failure. When any component fails, the patient is at risk of operative morbidity. Gastrointestinal surgical stapling technique still needs refinement in order to increase its reliability. Staple line reinforcement has been widely used and seems to effectively reduce anastomotic complications. Literature provides us with examples of studies supporting both bleeding and leakage reduction after staple line reinforcement, but high-quality evidence is not available to date. Semi-absorbable and nonabsorbable materials have been the earliest available. The use of bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement materials has recently become more widespread, and these materials are more widely used these days.

Few data are available regarding the application of energy-based tissue fusion technology during anatomic lung resection. In the present study, we evaluated the use of energy-based instruments for {{the division of the}} pulmonary arterial and venous branches during anatomic lung resection. MethodsAnatomic lung resection (segmentectomy or lobectomy) was performed using energy-based coagulative fusion technology. A low-profile jaw can be used to facilitate dissection in both open and video-assisted thoracic surgery cases, applying a seal 6 mm wide by 22 mm in length. Two energy applications were applied to the arterial and venous branches before vessel division. ResultsThe bipolar tissue fusion system was used in 211 patients between 2008 and 2010 (104 lobectomies and 107 anatomic segmentectomies). Initially, we used a device with a smaller, curved jaw (n =  12), producing a 3. 3 - to 4. 7 -cm seal. No arterial dehiscences and 2 partial venous dehiscences that were recognized and controlled intraoperatively occurred. For the remaining cases, we used a new device with a larger jaw that applied a seal 6 mm wide by 22 mm in length. No arterial or venous dehiscences (vessel size range, 0. 4 - 1. 2 cm) occurred. ConclusionsThe bipolar tissue fusion system provided safe and reliable control of pulmonary arterial and venous branches during anatomic lung resection.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To compare {{effectiveness}} {{in terms of}} blood loss and operative time of <b>stapling</b> <b>devices</b> among surgeons with different levels of surgical volume. METHODS We evaluated a group of 29 male patients with invasive bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy by two groups of surgeons. The first group included two high-volume surgeons, and the second group two low-volume surgeons. All cystectomies were performed using the multifire autosuture articulated vascular Endo-GIA. We compared patients {{with a series of}} 28 patients who had undergone radical cystectomy during the same period using standard technique by the same surgeons. Blood loss was defined as the difference between the hemoglobin at the beginning {{and at the end of}} cystectomy. RESULTS In the group of high-volume surgeons, the mean operative time was 81. 4 +/- 17 minutes and 79. 3 +/- 20 minutes for the classical and stapler arm, respectively (P = 0. 551). In the low-volume surgeons group, the mean operative time was 114. 3 +/- 22 minutes and 92. 4 +/- 12 minutes for the two methods (P = 0. 003). The mean intraoperative blood loss in the experienced surgeons was 2. 3 +/- 0. 82 g/dL and 1. 49 +/- 0. 66 g/dL for the classical and stapler arm, respectively (P = 0. 008).
