50|$|<b>Squaring</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> is <b>the</b> {{problem of}} tiling an {{integral}} square using only other integral squares. (An integral square is a square whose sides have integer length.) The name was coined in a humorous analogy with <b>squaring</b> <b>the</b> circle. <b>Squaring</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> {{is an easy}} task unless additional conditions are set. The most studied restriction is that <b>the</b> <b>squaring</b> be perfect, meaning that the sizes of <b>the</b> smaller <b>squares</b> are all different. A related problem is <b>squaring</b> <b>the</b> plane, which can be done even with the restriction that each natural number occurs exactly once as a size of a <b>square</b> in <b>the</b> tiling. The order of a squared square is its number of constituent squares.|$|R

50|$|Why {{does this}} work? Moving along the {{diagonal}} doesn't change the value; {{the value of}} <b>the</b> <b>square</b> on <b>the</b> intersectionis still the dividend. But we also know it {{is the product of}} <b>the</b> <b>squares</b> along <b>the</b> bottom and right edge. Since <b>the</b> <b>square</b> on <b>the</b> bottom edge is <b>the</b> divisor, <b>the</b> <b>square</b> on <b>the</b> right edge is the quotient.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} Georgian {{buildings}} survive, including St Philip's Cathedral, Soho House, Perrott's Folly, the Town Hall {{and much of}} St Paul's <b>Square.</b> <b>The</b> Victorian era saw extensive building across the city. Major civic buildings such as the Victoria Law Courts (in characteristic red brick and terracotta), the Council House and the Museum & Art Gallery were constructed. St Chad's Cathedral was the first Roman Catholic cathedral {{to be built in}} the UK since the Reformation. Across the city, the need to house the industrial workers gave rise to miles of redbrick streets and terraces, many of back-to-back houses, some of which were later to become inner-city slums.|$|E
5|$|Another part of Tech <b>Square,</b> <b>the</b> {{privately owned}} Centergy One complex, {{contains}} the Technology Square Research Building (TSRB), holding faculty and graduate student offices for the College of Computing and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, {{as well as}} the GVU Center, a multidisciplinary technology research center.

5|$|Benjamin Grayson {{constructed}} Grayson's Tavern in Danville {{sometime around}} 1785. The asymmetrical, ell-shaped building faces south onto Walnut Street with a front entrance {{on the south}} and a side entrance on the west, which opens onto Constitution <b>Square.</b> <b>The</b> Mary Akin Memorial Herb Garden, located behind Grayson's Tavern, features a variety of herbs that were commonly cultivated in the area during the late 18th and early 19th century, including chives, fennel, honeysuckle, lavender, rosemary, sage, and thyme. The garden is maintained by the Garden Club of Danville and named for one of its long-time members.|$|E

50|$|The {{special case}} in which the {{integers}} whose reciprocals are taken must be square numbers appears in two ways in the context of right triangles. First, the sum of the reciprocals of <b>the</b> <b>squares</b> of <b>the</b> altitudes from the legs (equivalently, of <b>the</b> <b>squares</b> of <b>the</b> legs themselves) equals the reciprocal of <b>the</b> <b>square</b> of <b>the</b> altitude from the hypotenuse. This holds whether or not the numbers are integers; there is a formula (see here) that generates all integer cases. Second, also in a right triangle the sum of <b>the</b> <b>squared</b> reciprocal of <b>the</b> side of one of <b>the</b> two inscribed <b>squares</b> and <b>the</b> <b>squared</b> reciprocal of <b>the</b> hypotenuse equals <b>the</b> <b>squared</b> reciprocal of <b>the</b> side of <b>the</b> other inscribed <b>square.</b>|$|R
