500|$|Conversely, LA Weekly Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "It isn't that Spider-Man is {{inherently}} unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated." [...] Giving it 2.5/4 stars, Roger Ebert felt the film lacked a decent action element; [...] "Consider {{the scene where}} Spider-Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of <b>school</b> <b>kids.</b> He tries to save both, so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea." [...] Stylistically, there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin's costume, which led IGN's Richard George to comment years later, [...] "We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from Spider-Man is almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression." ...|$|E

There is a lot of authority and a lot of strict regiment, and the kids lash out and take over the school and destroy the place." [...] The band's main goal for the video was for it to resemble an art piece, much in the same way they viewed the production of the album, to keep in line with tone. To this end, they enlisted director David LaChapelle. LaChapelle's input—which [...] "ranges from an evil prison warden cracking a whip at marching <b>school</b> <b>kids</b> to escapees ripping their uniforms and doing acrobatic moves down the hallways"—was regarded by the band as [...] "completely wacked out and twisted, which is exactly what we love." ...|$|E

In that game, West Catholic quadruple-teamed Chamberlain the entire game, and despite the center's 29 points, the Panthers lost 54–42. In his second Overbrook season, Chamberlain continued his prolific scoring, among them scoring a high school record 71 points against Roxborough. The Panthers comfortably won the Public League title after again beating Northeast in which Chamberlain scored 40 points, and later won the city title by defeating South Catholic 74–50. Chamberlain scored 32 points and led Overbrook to a flawless 19–0 season. During summer vacations Chamberlain worked as a bellhop in Kutsher's Hotel. Subsequently, owners Milton and Helen Kutsher kept up a lifelong friendship with Wilt, and according to their son Mark, [...] "They were his second set of parents."

Born, elected the Most Valuable Player of the 1953 NCAA Finals. Chamberlain won 25–10; Born was so dejected that he gave up a promising NBA career and became a tractor engineer ("If there were high <b>school</b> <b>kids</b> that good, I figured I wasn't going {{to make it to the}} pros"), and Auerbach wanted Chamberlain to go to a New England university, so he could draft him as a territorial pick for the Celtics, but Chamberlain did not respond.|$|E

I scouted quite a few pools, but when I saw this pool in the YMCA in Central London, which was dark blue tiled with light blue lane stripes instead of the normal reverse colors, I knew it was the ideal location. I wanted to give it an eerie underwater night-time feel, and this setting was perfect. We used a number of 1000K and 2000K lights around the pool edge.
