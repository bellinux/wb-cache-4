As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct.

Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear the bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E
