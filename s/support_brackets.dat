2500|$|After 37 {{years the}} cross {{had to be}} taken down after {{suffering}} numerous lightning strikes; its <b>support</b> <b>brackets</b> were also badly damaged. In the winter of 1881–1882 it was therefore brought down into the valley and repaired. On 25 August 1882 seven mountain guides and [...] 15 bearers took the cross back to the top. Because an accommodation shed had been built on the West Summit, the team placed the cross on the East Summit. There it remained for about 111years, until it was removed again on 18 August 1993. This time the damage was not only caused by the weather, but also by American soldiers who used the cross as target practice in 1945, {{at the end of the}} Second World War. Because the summit cross could no longer be repaired, a replica was made that was true to the original cross. After two months the rack railway carried the new cross on 12 October to the Zugspitzplatt, from where it was flown to the summit by helicopter. The new cross has a height of 4.88metres. It was renovated and regilded in 2009 for 15,000euros and, since 22 April 2009, has stood once again on the East Summit.|$|E

50|$|The Daniel Hunt Three-Decker is a {{historic}} triple decker house at 9 Wyman Street in the Main South neighborhood of Worcester, Massachusetts. It is well preserved representative of the housing boom {{that took place in}} the area in the 1880s and 1890s, with significant early Queen Anne styling. It was built in 1890, and its first owner was Daniel Hunt, a machinist who lived next door. The building follows a typical side hall plan, with a side wall jog and an asymmetrical facade. The left side is a row of porches with turned balusters and posts, and the right consists of a bay that projects the full depth of the porch. The roof is a shallow hip roof, with an extended eave that has curved <b>support</b> <b>brackets.</b>|$|E

50|$|The slab lifter uses two safety devices. Safety {{chains and}} a <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> allow safe lifting of large slabs. This lifting {{appliance}} {{also has a}} safety locking device that is engaged when the gripping pads are activated {{by the weight of}} the stone. This prevents any jerking movement from releasing the stone. It is easily disengaged once the slab is secured at its destination.|$|R
50|$|The Monument {{was closed}} in June 2010 by the City of Baltimore for safety reasons, {{according}} to {{articles in the}} Baltimore Sun and Washington Post newspapers. Missing mortar and rusted <b>support</b> <b>brackets</b> were among specific safety concerns. Several months later, a driver ran a 1997 Chrysler van through the southeast corner on October 30, 2010 and damaged roughly 15 feet of the fence. While reports initially indicated the Monument's closure would last three months, it was later determined that reopening would not take place until a renovation was completed. In 2012 the City of Baltimore entered into a partnership agreement with the Mount Vernon Place Conservancy to restore, maintain, and manage the Monument and parks squares of Mount Vernon Place.|$|E
50|$|The forward torpedo {{tubes are}} {{constructed}} in two sections bolted together across the bulkhead at the fore {{end of the}} torpedo compartment. The 116-in long inner section is constructed of 0.5-in rolled steel fitted with welded flanges and <b>support</b> <b>brackets.</b> The outer section is constructed of a similar tube 175 in long but with a reinforced 1.125 inch thick section behind the main bulkhead. The internal door hinges at one side with two locking mechanisms, a swing bolt opposite the hinge and a rotating locking ring attached to the tube which presses down on the ten projecting lugs around the door. The outer end of the tube is sealed with a domed bow cap. Bow shutters close across the bow caps so as to preserve the streamlined shape of the bow when the cap is closed.|$|E
50|$|Beriev {{realised}} {{that the}} Be-10 {{would be ready}} for trials {{during the winter of}} 1955, but Taganrog, where the OKB was located, is ice-bound in winter, so an alternative site was chosen at Gelendzhik on the Black Sea coast, which is clear of ice all year round. The completed components of the first prototype were transported to Ghelendjik where they were assembled and trials begun on 20 December 1955. Initial ground running of the engines revealed potentially disastrous vibration of the rear fuselage, which caused cracking of skin and structural components as well as loosening nuts and fasteners, also the fracture of pipeline and wiring loom <b>support</b> <b>brackets.</b> To reduce the vibration caused by the jet exhaust, the jet-pipes were splayed outboard by a further 3° to 6°. The prototype also underwent trial installation of raised extended air intakes to reduce water ingestion, but they were not adopted for in-service aircraft due to the degradation in performance.|$|E
50|$|A {{floating}} shelf {{is designed}} to fit within a minimalist decor by hiding the <b>supporting</b> <b>brackets</b> within the shelf. The shelf has at least two symmetrical channels into which slide brackets attached to the wall. Screws are inserted through {{the bottom of the}} shelf to hold it on the brackets. Though usually constructed of light-weight material such as MDF and laminated, these shelves can often hold considerable weight.|$|R
50|$|Adjustable {{shelving}} allows {{more flexible}} use of shelves to hold items of value for storage, display or sale. Like fixed shelves, the horizontal planes are normally made of strong {{materials such as}} wood or steel (occasionally glass or other materials), but their exact vertical positioning can be varied - usually {{through the use of}} uprights into which <b>supporting</b> <b>brackets</b> or the shelves themselves can be fixed at different heights.|$|R
