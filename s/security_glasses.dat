40|$|In this paper, the {{physical}} {{background and the}} usability aspects of the expert software BREAS (Blast Response Assessment of Structures) are presented. This comprehensive tool evaluates the structural initial response of buildings to blast loading neglecting the impact of potential fragments. The results are visualized in a user-friendly three dimensional graphical user interface. Arbitrary building configurations can be considered. Typical application areas are field camp situations or military operations in urban terrain (MOUT). Different building materials and pre-defined object types are implemented, such as masonry, reinforced concrete, (<b>security)</b> <b>glass</b> and wall panels or window elements of typical used residential buildings or containers. The tool includes an optional application of security enhancement measures, e. g. blast resistant walls or innovative retrofit materials. State-of-the-art engineering models are used for the nonlinear structure evaluation. For the hazard analysis of an arbitrary blast loading scenario, two different approaches are implemented. The first one uses semi-empirical assumptions and allows a fast assessment of the external blast loading. The second option includes an interface to an explicit finite volume scheme with automatic mesh refinement. This CFD tool has been seamlessly incorporated into the software and offers more precise information concerning complex blast wave propagation. The calculation of an actual conducted terroristic explosive event in an urban environment is used for validation of the software and underlines the forecasting ability of the software. The tool BREAS is developed for/in cooperation with the Technical Center for Protective and Special Technologies (WTD 52) and the German Armed Forces (BAIUDBw Infra II 2) ...|$|R

50|$|In practice, the {{interlayer}} provides three {{beneficial properties}} to laminated glass panes: first, the interlayer functions to distribute impact forces across a greater {{area of the}} glass panes, thus increasing the impact resistance of the glass; second, the interlayer functions to bind the resulting shards if the glass is ultimately broken; third the viscoelastic interlayer undergoes plastic deformation during impact and under static loads after impact, absorbing energy and reducing penetration by the impacting object as well as reducing {{the energy of the}} impact that is transmitted to impacting object, e.g. a passenger in a car crash. Thus, the benefits of laminated glass include safety and <b>security.</b> Laminated <b>glass</b> also has decorative applications. The interlayer can be colored or patterned.|$|R

40|$|Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) {{systems are}} used in modern {{buildings}} for different purposes. By the use of smart cameras, dedicated safety or security-critical events {{that may lead to}} an alarm condition can be detected autonomously (e. g., safety events like fire or <b>security</b> events like <b>glass</b> break). Integrating CCTV systems into building automation systems provides the opportunity to react to critical events by, for example, informing the operator about the occurrence of such events, providing relevant video data, and most important concurrently initiating appropriate actions (e. g., smoke extraction in case of fire). This paper focuses on the integration of such smart camera systems into BACnet based networks. At first, a short introduction to BACnet and its interworking model is given. Afterwards, a possible way of integrating CCTV systems into BACnet is presented. The functionality of this model is shown by a proof-of-concept implementation which is also described in this paper. 1...|$|R

40|$|Color {{modulation}} {{has been}} a topic of longstanding interest {{in science and engineering}} given its multiple applications in display technology, smart <b>glass,</b> <b>security</b> marks and active optical components. [1, 2] Passive elements such as optical coatings employing a wide range of materials, multilayer configurations or structured films have been extensively used in optical systems to obtain a full range of colors and spectral windows in both reflective and transmissive devices. [1 – 6] Moreover, active materials with unique physical or chemical properties such as electrochromism,[7 – 9] piezochromism,[10] plasmonic effect,[11] photoluminescence[12, 13] and volatile phase-change materials[14] have been exploited for color modulation purposes. The dynamic modulation of optical properties by such materials has given rise to remarkable resolution, low dimensionality and low energy operation of displays. [15] However, a combination of both, i. e. a device with high resolution featuring offline color retention while still allowing full-gamut modulation, had been elusive or had required external chemical agents[16] until recently, when an optoelectronic framework using nonvolatile nucleation dominated phase-change materials (PCMs) was proposed to fill this gap by employing Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST) as the active bistable component.

50|$|Other {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} regarding legality of Google Glass {{in a number of}} countries, particularly in Russia, Ukraine, and other post-USSR countries. In February 2013, a Google+ user noticed legal issues with Google Glass and posted in the Google Glass community about the issues, stating that the device may be illegal to use according to the current legislation in Russia and Ukraine, which prohibits use of spy gadgets that can record video, audio or take photographs in an inconspicuous manner. Concerns were also raised in regard to the privacy and <b>security</b> of Google <b>Glass</b> users in the event that the device is stolen or lost, an issue that was raised by a US congressional committee. As part of its response to the governmental committee, Google stated in early July that is working on a locking system and raised awareness of the ability of users to remotely reset Google Glass from the web interface in the event of loss. Several facilities have banned the use of Google Glass before its release to the general public, citing concerns over potential privacy-violating capabilities. Other facilities, such as Las Vegas casinos, banned Google Glass, citing their desire to comply with Nevada state law and common gaming regulations which ban the use of recording devices near gambling areas.|$|R
5000|$|Hugely {{intelligent}} and equally immoral (believes in {{doing what is}} morally evil, as opposed to amorality, which would mean not believing in a moral good or evil), Acheron Hades {{started out as a}} lecturer in English, teaching, among others, Thursday Next, before he turned to a life of crime. Believed by some to be only half-human, the other half being allegedly demonic or vampiric in nature (he casts no shadow), Acheron possesses a number of mysterious powers (as, indeed, do most of his siblings). He cannot be photographed or recorded in any way, and has shown the ability to know when his name is uttered within a considerable distance (a radius of 1000 yards, and possible further), hence his name is not often spoken aloud (compare Lord Voldemort, or The Chandrian). He has shown an immunity to the effects of most weapons, his only confirmed vulnerability being to silver. Said {{to have the ability to}} [...] "lie in thought, word, action and appearance" [...] he also possesses formidable powers of deception, including the ability to assume the shape of others and hypnotic persuasive abilities on the [...] "weaker minded" [...] (he is unable to hypnotise Thursday). Another ability that possibly follows in this vein is his ability to pass through glass barriers by making the glass soft and pliable through heated touch; after he withdraws his hand the glass reverts to its original state, the only sign of his trespass being the slightly mottled surface of the glass where his hand passed through (show when Thursday examines the empty Chuzzlewit <b>glass</b> <b>security</b> casing). He appears to possess great strength, at one point easily smashing his way through a wall, although inertia still has an effect on him. Time does not seem to have a proper hold on him either, as when it is stopped around him by Colonel Next, he remains unaffected (this might possibly be why he does not seem to age). He is either very good at guessing or possesses some form of telepathy as he can figure out the personality faults and mental weaknesses of a person within moments.|$|R
