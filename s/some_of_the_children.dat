5|$|During {{the march}} through {{vineyards}} and cornfields, the emaciated children ate {{as much as}} they could. Lukić states that the Partisans rested the remaining children at Žumberak for a day, before arranging for them to be transferred across the Kupa river into liberated areas of the Bosanska Krajina. According to one survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> who were liberated from the camp by the Partisans inAugust 1942 were placed with families in the Žumberak district and were subsequently re-captured by the Ustaše. Some were killed and others were returned to the camp.|$|E
5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} growth {{abnormalities}} associated with 1p36 deletion syndrome. One common problem is delayed growth or difficulty in gaining weight. Even though <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> may eat well, they still may not grow normally. In contrast, some children may develop hyperphagia, which is overeating, and may become obese. These children clinically resemble children with Prader-Willi syndrome.

25|$|Just {{before the}} retraction, {{criticism}} arose {{over the fact}} that the Royal Free Hospital had received £55,000 in August 1996 from lawyers preparing to sue MMR manufacturers for support of Wakefield's research. Wakefield asserted that the donation was to fund a second clinical study; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> involved were subjects in both studies. However, it was subsequently revealed by The Sunday Times of London that Wakefield had personally been paid more than £400,000.|$|E
25|$|The self-declared Emperor of the Central African Empire, Jean-Bédel Bokassa (Emperor Bokassa I), {{was tried}} on October 24, 1986, for several cases of {{cannibalism}} {{although he was}} never convicted. Between April 17, and April 19, 1979, a number of elementary school students were arrested after they had protested against wearing the expensive, government-required school uniforms. Around 100 were killed.

25|$|Beethoven was {{introduced}} in these years to several people who became important in his life. Franz Wegeler, a young medical student, {{introduced him to the}} von Breuning family (one of whose daughters Wegeler eventually married). Beethoven often visited the von Breuning household, where he taught piano to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> Here he encountered German and classical literature. The von Breuning family environment was less stressful than his own, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline. Beethoven also {{came to the attention of}} Count Ferdinand von Waldstein, who became a lifelong friend and financial supporter.|$|E
50|$|Lunch Time Heroes {{was shot}} in Lagos for 16 days. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> actors used in the film were sourced through local churches, and none had a {{previous}} professional acting experience.

25|$|In a {{language}} with records and references, binary trees are typically constructed {{by having a}} tree node structure which contains some data and references to its left child and its right child.

25|$|Throughout their history, Steeleye Span {{have seen}} many {{personnel}} changes. Their typical album {{is a collection}} of mostly traditional songs with one or two instrumental tracks of jigs and/or reels added; the traditional songs often include <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Child</b> Ballads. In their later albums there has been an increased tendency to include music written by the band members, but they have never moved completely away from traditional music, which draws upon pan-British traditions.|$|R
25|$|On 6 December 2006, the {{influential}} science journal Nature published {{a new study}} which examined the mutation history of the HIV found in blood samples from <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> and concluded {{that a number of}} those children had been infected well before the six defendants arrived in Libya. In addition, a common ancestor of the strains that infected the children was already present in Libya. The study was based on statistical models of the rate of evolution in HIV derived from previous outbreaks. The publication was reported in newspapers world-wide and sparked an editorial campaign by Nature calling for the acquittal of the defendants.|$|E
25|$|Botham {{has been}} a prodigious fundraiser for {{charitable}} causes, undertaking a total of 12 long-distance charity walks. His first, in 1985, was a 900-mile trek from John o' Groats to Land's End. His efforts were inspired after a visit to Taunton's Musgrove Park Hospital in 1977 whilst receiving treatment for a broken toe. When he took a wrong turn into a children's ward, he was devastated to learn that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> had only weeks to live, and why. At the time, he was an expectant father himself. Since then, his efforts have raised more than £12million for charity, with leukaemia research the main cause to benefit. In recognition of this work, Botham in 2003 became the first-ever President of Bloodwise, the UK's leading blood cancer charity.|$|E

Robert Sklyarov witnesses the Wave destroying semi-automatic charybdis and tries to pilot one manually to give his friends time to flee. In the end, his charybdis is destroyed, too, but Sklyarov manages to escape and sets off (on a flier) for the Children Village, where his fiancée, Tatiana Turchina, works as a governess. He finds the Village already empty but {{on the way to the}} Capital, he locates a crashed aerobus that was carrying <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> from the Village as well as Turchina herself. Having to choose whom to take with him (his flier can only carry two people), Sklyarov decides for his fiancée even though he knows that she would hate him for leaving the children behind.|$|E

25|$|After Marks’ death, {{his widow}} and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> {{lived in the}} house until the death of the last one in 1981. After a period of {{standing}} vacant, the family realised it was in need of maintenance and a suitable tenant was sought. In 1984 an agreement was reached with the National Cultural History Museum according to which the Government was to buy the contents of the house from the estate, restore the house and rent it from the family trust. In 1986 the Sammy Marks Museum opened its doors to the public. In 1995 roughly 73ha surrounding the house and upon which all of the historical buildings are situated, was cut {{from the rest of the}} farm and sold to the National Cultural History Museum.

25|$|Professor Montagnier, the co-discoverer of the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (H.I.V), {{testified that}} the virus in the 393 {{children}} studied is a rare type found mostly in West Africa, but also throughout the continent. Montagnier told the court that the outbreak was probably started by an infected child admitted for treatment at the hospital. He said that injection {{was not the only}} possible means of infection, any other manipulation involving penetration of the skin, or even multiple use of the same oxygen mask, could have transmitted the virus. Montagnier was certain that the epidemic at the hospital started about a year before the Bulgarian nurses were hired. He said he was familiar with the case before his first visit to Libya in 1999 because he {{was in the process of}} studying the cases of hundreds of HIV-positive children from El-Fatih that were being examined or treated in hospitals in Switzerland, France, and Italy. At the time he was working on these cases, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> did not yet have the symptoms because the incubation period of the virus is about 10 years.|$|E
25|$|In other cities, class {{conflict}} was more evident. Over {{a quarter of}} London's population had left the city by November 1940. Civilians left for more remote areas of the country. Upsurges in population in south Wales and Gloucester intimated where these displaced people went. Other reasons, including industry dispersal {{may have been a}} factor. However, resentment of rich self-evacuees or hostile treatment of poor ones were signs of persistence of class resentments although these factors did not appear to threaten social order. The total number of evacuees numbered 1.4 million, including a high proportion from the poorest inner-city families. Reception committees were completely unprepared for the condition of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> Far from displaying the nation's unity in time of war, the scheme backfired, often aggravating class antagonism and bolstering prejudice about the urban poor. Within four months, 88% of evacuated mothers, 86% of small children, and 43% of school children had been returned home. The lack of bombing in the Phoney War contributed significantly to the return of people to the cities, but {{class conflict}} was not eased a year later when evacuation operations had to be put into effect again.|$|E
30|$|Elicker {{and colleagues}} (2005) {{examined}} child care settings used by low-income working families in four urban counties in Indiana. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> care centers examined were unlicensed registered child care ministries.

500|$|Halvorsen's actions {{during the}} Berlin Airlift had a {{substantial}} impact on German-American {{relations in the}} years to come. For his efforts, he has also been extensively honored by the German people. In 1974 he was decorated with the Großes Bundesverdienstkreuz (Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany), Germany's highest award. In 2015 he was awarded the General Lucius D. Clay medal by the Federation of German-American Clubs. The medal is the highest honor granted to an individual who has contributed significantly to the development of German-American relations. In addition, he has had numerous German schools named in his honor, including a secondary school in Berlin and the Gail S. Halvorsen Elementary school at Rhein-Main Air Base, Frankfurt, Germany. He has appeared many times on German television over the years, often paired with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> (now adults) who received his candy parachutes. On February 8, 2002 for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, he carried the German national placard into the Rice-Eccles Stadium.
