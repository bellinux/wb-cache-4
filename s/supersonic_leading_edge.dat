The configurations are composed of slender pointed bodies with circular cross section, plane or cruciform delta wings, and tails which are not specified. For fin-fin interference (no body) general multi-fin delta wings are studied for the roll problems. Three types of interferences are studied. They are (1) fin-fin interference, (2) fin-fin and wing-body interferences combined, and (3) wing-body-tail interference. Where possible, three aerodynamic problems are studied under each of these interferences. They are (1) lift and incidence, (2) roll due to aileron deflection, and (3) damping in roll. A survey of the theoretical work on supersonic interference problems is included. Linearized theory is used throughout for all problems treated by the writer.
