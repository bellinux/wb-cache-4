5|$|Conspiracy theorists {{concerned}} with surveillance abuse {{believe that the}} New World Order is being implemented by the cult of intelligence {{at the core of}} the surveillance-industrial complex through mass surveillance and the use of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>numbers,</b> the bar-coding of retail goods with Universal Product Code markings, and, most recently, RFID tagging by microchip implants.|$|E
5|$|The biggest off-the-field {{incident}} was revealed {{on the final}} weekend before the Sugar Bowl. Texas reserve defensive back Ron McKelvey was revealed to be using an assumed name. In reality, he was a 30-year-old man named Ron Weaver who had played for a junior-college team and a small-college team under other assumed names. Weaver disappeared prior to the Sugar Bowl, but stated that he had used the assumed name in order to gather information for {{a book about the}} inner workings of Texas football. Weaver later pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misusing <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>numbers,</b> but he avoided jail and paid no fine. Texas was not sanctioned by the NCAA, but Longhorns players later said the event was a severe distraction from pre-game preparations.|$|E
5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>numbers</b> all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance {{and the rise of the}} surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.|$|E

50|$|U.S. {{lawmakers have}} paid special {{attention}} to the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>number</b> because it can be easily used to commit identity theft. The (proposed) <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Number</b> Protection Act of 2005 and (proposed) Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2005 each sought to limit the distribution of an individual's <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>number.</b>|$|R
50|$|Example: Wendy's {{name and}} <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>number</b> were stolen by {{identity}} thieves who hacked a stolen laptop. They take her <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>number</b> and {{combine it with}} another stolen name, {{and use it to}} open a series of new accounts, including credit cards and retail gift cards. An identity protection system that used identity scoring would alert Wendy that her <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>number</b> had been compromised.|$|R
25|$|Because <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Numbers</b> {{have become}} useful in {{identity}} theft {{and other forms}} of crime, various schemes have been perpetrated to acquire valid <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Numbers</b> and related identity information.|$|E
25|$|However, on April 26, 2006, Blackwell's office {{disclosed}} Ohio <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>numbers</b> again, mailing out computer disks {{containing the}} names, addresses, and the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>numbers</b> of 5.7 million registered voters in Ohio (80% of all registered {{voters in the}} state). The list was released as a standard practice under the Freedom of Information Act and Help America Vote Act. Blackwell's office apologized, indicating that {{the release of the}} <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>numbers</b> was accidental and attempted to recall all 20 of the disks. At least one recipient of the disks has refused to comply.|$|E

50|$|The <b>social</b> <b>security</b> card is a card {{issued by}} the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> Administration {{containing}} a person's <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>number</b> (SSN). Although it is not mandatory, in modern practice parents almost universally file for a <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>number</b> shortly {{after the birth of}} a child. In the absence of a national identity card (and concordant national identity <b>number),</b> the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>number</b> has become the de facto national identifier for a large variety of purposes, both governmental and non-governmental.|$|R
2500|$|Although the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> Act {{itself does}} not require a person to have a <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Number</b> (SSN) to live and work in the United States, the Internal Revenue Code does {{generally}} require the use of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>number</b> by individuals for federal tax purposes: ...|$|R
25|$|With few exceptions, {{all legal}} {{residents}} {{working in the}} United States now have an individual <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>number.</b> Indeed, nearly all working (and many non-working) residents since <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> 1935 inception have had a <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>number</b> because it is required to do {{a wide range of}} things, e.g., paying taxes and getting a job.|$|R

25|$|Media {{investigations}} {{generated by}} the incident brought to light that ChoicePoint had suffered a previous similar ID theft in 2002.

25|$|In November 2007, {{the company}} {{reported}} that hackers gained access to most of its clients' names, <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>numbers,</b> dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers and trading activity. In 2011, after being sued in a class action lawsuit, the company settled by agreeing to compensate customers that were victim to identity theft between $50 and $2,500 each.

50|$|When the Roys {{refused to}} provide a <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>number</b> for their daughter, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare cut {{benefits}} for Little Bird of the Snow to comply with federal guidelines.

Preventing or limiting the usage of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>numbers</b> online, being wary and respectful of emails including spam messages, being mindful of personal financial details, creating and managing strong passwords, and intelligent web-browsing behaviours are recommended, among others.|$|E
25|$|According to an {{inspector}} general's report, released in November 2013, identity theft in the United States is blamed for US$4 {{billion worth of}} fraudulent 2012 tax refunds by the IRS. Fraudulent claims were made {{with the use of}} stolen taxpayer identification and <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>numbers,</b> with returns sent to addresses both in the US and internationally. Following the release of the findings, the IRS stated that it resolved most of the identity theft cases of 2013 within 120 days, while the average time to resolve cases from the 2011/2012 tax period was 312 days.|$|E
25|$|Between October 2005 and November 2006, an {{experienced}} hacker {{broke into a}} university database containing approximately 800,000 files of personal information.

On November 21, 2006, the system administrators noticed unauthorized activity and blocked further access to the database.
