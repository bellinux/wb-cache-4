5|$|At about 23:00 on August 26, {{the first}} {{shots were fired}} in the Battle of Long Island, near the Red Lion Inn (near present-day 39th Street and 4th Avenue). American pickets from Samuel John Atlee's Pennsylvania {{regiment}} fired upon two British <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> foraging in a watermelon patch near the inn.|$|E
5|$|In a November 2004 Zogby International poll of 987 people, 79% of {{respondents}} thought the U.S. chemical companies which produced Agent Orange defoliant should compensate U.S. <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> {{affected by the}} toxic chemical used {{during the war in}} Vietnam. Also, 51% said they supported compensation for Vietnamese Agent Orange victims.|$|E
5|$|Mount Royal Cemetery {{contains}} more than 162,000 graves and is the final resting place {{for a number of}} notable Canadians. It includes a veterans section with several <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> awarded the British Empire's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross. In 1901 the Mount Royal Cemetery Company established the first crematorium in Canada.|$|E
50|$|On legend {{states that}} a <b>soldier</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> wounded when an {{arrowhead}} was embedded in his head. The <b>soldier,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> in great pains, invoked the intercession of St. Ludolph, and the soldier was soon able {{to remove the}} arrow and was healed.|$|R

5|$|Since then Kasahara has {{proposed}} a definition between these two. He agrees with Hata that Chinese soldiers actively engaged in combat were not massacre victims, but he also includes in his definition of the massacre any Chinese <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> killed on the battlefield but not actively resisting, noting that many confrontations between the Chinese and Japanese Armies were more like one-sided slaughters than battles. For instance, after routing the Chinese in Nanking, Japanese soldiers fired upon and killed {{a large number of}} Chinese <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> attempting to escape the battlefield by swimming across the Yangtze River. Many historians including Kasahara view incidents like these where the Japanese fired upon retreating troops to be atrocities, whereas Hata sees them as extensions of combat and not massacres.|$|E
5|$|The last {{sentence}} {{of the passage}} is similar to one from the Republican era Biography of Song Yue, Prince of E. But instead of teaching them his own technique, it states Yue taught what he had learned from Zhou to his <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> victorious in battle.|$|E
5|$|Ealdred was an {{advisor to}} King Edward the Confessor, and was often {{involved}} in the royal government. He was also a military leader, and in 1046 he led an unsuccessful expedition against the Welsh. This was in retaliation for a raid led by the Welsh rulers Gruffydd ap Rhydderch, Rhys ap Rhydderch, and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Ealdred's expedition was betrayed by some Welsh <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> serving with the English, and Ealdred was defeated.|$|E

5|$|Kouma, {{along with}} Dodd and Pittman, {{were the first}} {{soldiers}} to be awarded the Medal of Honor in the Korean War who were present for the presentation of their medals. It was reported the other nine <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> awarded the medal, were done so posthumously. Unbeknownst to the public, Major General William F. Dean, who had been awarded the medal for actions in the Battle of Taejon, was actually {{a prisoner of war}} in North Korea.|$|E
5|$|McNair was {{inducted}} into the Fort Leavenworth Hall of Fame, which was created in 1969 and is managed by the United States Army Combined Arms Center. The Fort Leavenworth Hall of Fame honors <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> stationed at Fort Leavenworth, and significantly contributed to the Army's history, heritage, and traditions. In 2005, McNair {{was inducted}} into the U.S. Army's Force Development Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|SAS Flight 347 was a scheduled, {{domestic}} flight from Bardufoss Airport via Bodø Airport to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Check-in and boarding ran as normal, without any security check. At Bardufoss, 122 people boarded the aircraft, including {{a large group}} of <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> on leave of absence and on their way home to Southern Norway. Representatives from the ground handlers stated that none of the passengers acted suspiciously.|$|E

5|$|The Memorial Grove honors Bronxites {{who served}} in World War II and the Korean War. It is located by {{the road to the}} Van Cortlandt House, close to Broadway. Created in 1949, the grove {{contained}} a tree and a bronze plaque for each of the 39 <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> memorialized. By the time the grove was renovated in 2011, there were only 18 plaques left. Restoration was completed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Model 1897 {{was used}} by American troops for {{purposes}} in World War I other than a force multiplier. American <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> skilled at trap shooting were armed with these guns and stationed where they could fire at enemy hand grenades in midair. This would deflect the grenades from falling into the American trenches and therefore protect American soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.

5|$|An Army report {{released}} in 2001 blamed {{the breakdown of}} the 65th on the following factors: a shortage of officers and noncommissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactics that led to high casualties, an ammunition shortage, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of continental <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{declared}} victory. On {{a tactical}} level, the battle went in Israel's favor, and {{the aim of}} destroying the Karameh camp was achieved. On the other hand, the relatively high casualties sustained came as a considerable surprise for the Israelis. Israel failed to retrieve three dead <b>soldiers,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks—later paraded in Amman by the Jordanians. The engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian fighters. Although the Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties, King Hussein allowed them to take credit.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} similar casualties {{during the}} previous day. Russian victories gave their artillery a clear line of fire into the suburbs of Czyste and Wola. They also strengthened the morale of Russian <b>soldiers,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> convinced that the battle was over once Fort 54 fell. The battle was far from lost for the Polish side though: although the Russians could now attack the third line of Polish defences in Wola (Forts 23 and 24) or Czyste (Forts 20–22), their attacks could easily be flanked by forts of the second line still in Polish hands. Also, {{in order to support}} the advance with artillery, the Russian guns would have to be stationed in open field.|$|E

5|$|Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith, two United States Army <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> in {{the lead}} train and were uninjured in the collision, helped passengers, most of whom {{appeared}} to have minor injuries, evacuate from their train. Oglesby and Griffith then noticed that six to eight people from the other train had been ejected {{by the force of}} the collision and were more seriously injured. One person from the overtaking train had been thrown onto the roof of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound. The soldiers gave first aid to the more seriously injured victims until help arrived, and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, SS-Obersturmbannführer Joachim Peiper left {{a path of}} destruction, which {{included}} Waffen-SS soldiers under his command murdering American POWs and unarmed Belgian civilians in the Malmedy massacre. Captured SS <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> part of Kampfgruppe Peiper were tried during the Malmedy massacre trial following the war for this massacre and several others in the area. Many of the perpetrators were sentenced to hang, but the sentences were commuted. Peiper was imprisoned for eleven years {{for his role in}} the killings.|$|E
5|$|Lance Corporal Jose Francisco Jimenez (1946–1969) was {{assigned}} to Company K, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division. On August 28, 1969, his unit came under heavy attack by North Vietnamese Army soldiers concealed in well-camouflaged emplacements at Quang Nam Province. Jimenez personally destroyed several enemy personnel and silenced an antiaircraft weapon. He then maneuvered to within ten feet of hostile <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> firing automatic weapons from a trench and, {{in the face of}} vicious enemy fire, destroyed the position. As he moved to attack another enemy soldier, he was mortally wounded.|$|E
