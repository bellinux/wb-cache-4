Primers were designed in the conserved region of the 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene; amplification was visualized by the pre-amplification addition of fluorescent detection reagent (FDR) and a simple UV lamp. By using a reverse-transcriptase step, the system detected infections between 10 and 100 parasites per mL. The assay was tested {{on a range of}} nucleic acid extracts from Leishmania species, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients from Sudan, and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients from Suriname.

40|$|A loop-mediated {{isothermal}} amplification (LAMP) assay {{was developed}} to detect Vero toxin (VT) -producing Escherichia coli rapidly (within 60 min). The 24 strains of VT-producing E. coli were successfully amplified, but 6 strains of non-VT-producing E. coli and 46 bacterial species other than E. coli were not. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was found to be> 0. 7 c. f. u. per test using serogroups O 157, O 26 andO 111 of VT-producing E. coli; this sensitivity is greater than that obtained by PCR assay. Furthermore, the LAMP assay was examined {{for its ability to}} detect VT-producing E. coli in food because of the difficulty of detection in food samples. The recovery of VT-producing E. coli by LAMP assay from beef and radish sprouts inoculated with the pathogen was high, similar to that obtained using culture methods with direct plating and/or plating after immunomagnetic separation. Although PCR assay was unable to recover VT-producing E. coli from half of the radish <b>samples,</b> <b>LAMP</b> assay was successful in most samples. In addition, VT-producing E. coliwas successfully detected in cultures of the beef <b>samples</b> by <b>LAMP</b> assay, but not by the culture method. The LAMP products in naturally contaminated beef samples were analysed to confirm the specific amplification of the VT-encoding gene, and were found to show a specific ladder band pattern on agarose gel after electrophoresis. Additionally the sequences of the LAMP products coincided well with the expected sequences of the VT-encoding gene. These results indicate that the proposed LAMP assay is a rapid, specific and sensitive method of detecting the VT-producing E. coli...|$|R

The sample preparation procedure includes an overnight incubation of strawberry tissues in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by a quick sample concentration and a boiling step to extract DNA for amplification.

40|$|Scope of {{this paper}} is to report results of an {{experimental}} research aiming to characterize emergency lighting equipment behavior during switch on transients with static CSS supply. Emergency lighting equipment inrush current peak values and waveforms are typically very dispersed depending on technology and manufacturers and can create problems when sizing or operating CSS equipments. High peak values can lead to CSS electronic protection tripping. Emergency lighting centralized systems are nowadays becoming a growing issue due to higher safety level requirements in addition to higher lighting power needed. Considering the lack of available reliable data on lighting equipment behavior, inrush current issue is currently approached by CSS over sizing. The research aims to fill this gap providing statistical data obtained with a proper scientific approach. Given the importance of CSS cost, the availability of such data will allow system designers to optimize CSS sizing, reducing both operative (maintenance and losses) and installation costs. The key factor for an optimal CSS sizing is the knowledge of the behavior of lighting equipments during switch on phase: the cool start phase is typically considered the most critical condition. Measurements described in this paper have been carried out on different types of lamps typically used in emergency installations around Europe mains supplied. Further investigations have been done with <b>sample</b> <b>lamps</b> CSS supplied.

The epidemiological investigation of PCV 2 infection was usually conducted by PCR, nested PCR, PCR-RFLP, TaqMan-based assay and nucleotide sequencing. However, there is still no rapid, sensitive and practical method for detecting PCV 2 genotypes. As a novel nucleic acid amplification method, the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method (LAMP) has been used to detect a variety of pathogenic microorganisms. Results Herein, a LAMP method is developed to detect the genotypes of PCV 2. The diagnostic sensitivity of LAMP is 1 copy/reaction for differentiating genotypes PCV 2 a and PCV 2 b. The reaction process was completed at 65 °C for 1 hour in a water bath. Cross-reactivity assay shows that this method is specific for PCV 2 a and PCV 2 b and no reactive for PCV 2 c and other swine-origin viruses (i. e. CSFV, PRRSV, BVDV, TGEV and PEDV, etc). Identity between LAMP and nested PCR was 92. 3 % on 52 field clinical <b>samples.</b> Conclusions <b>LAMP</b> method provides a rapid, sensitive, reliable way to detect PCV 2 a and PCV 2 b, and a better means for the large scale investigation of PCV 2 a and PCV 2 b infection. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{standardize}} a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the detection of Vibrio harveyi, the causative agent of vibriosis in Asian seabass, Lates calcarifer. The dnaJ gene of the bacterial pathogen was used as the target gene for the LAMP assay. It was optimized at an incubation time of 1 h at 63 Â°C. The assay was highly specific for V. harveyi and did not cross-react with other bacterial pathogens offish. However, the assay was able to detect V. harveyi that was isolated from infected shrimps. The limit of detection of the LAMP assay was 40 pg of DNA mL - 1 or 40 fg of the genomic DNA per LAMP reaction and was 10 times more sensitive than conventional PCR in detecting the bacterial pathogen from infected <b>samples.</b> The <b>LAMP</b> products can be quantified spectrophotometrically using hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) dye and showed positive correlation with the amount of the pathogen. These results demonstrated that LAMP is a simple and sensitive detection technique that has potential application for routine diagnosis of vibrosis caused by V. harveyi in Asian seabass and other aquatic species.
