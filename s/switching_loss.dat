50|$|The major {{limitation}} of the IGBT for low voltage applications is the high voltage drop it exhibits in the on-state (2-to-4 V). Compared to the MOSFET, the operating frequency of the IGBT is relatively low (usually not higher than 50 kHz), mainly because of a problem during turn-off known as current-tail: The slow decay of the conduction current during turn-off results from a slow recombination {{of a large number}} of carriers that flood the thick 'drift' region of the IGBT during conduction. The net result is that the turn-off <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> of an IGBT is considerably higher than its turn-on loss. Generally, in datasheets, turn-off energy is mentioned as a measured parameter; that number has to be multiplied with the switching frequency of the intended application in order to estimate the turn-off loss.|$|E

50|$|The current {{focus in}} R&D is on cost reduction, {{increase}} of power density, increase of reliability and reduction of parasitic lumped elements. These parasitics are unwanted capacitances between circuit parts and inductances of circuit traces.

Another problem connected to parasitics is their {{negative impact on the}} switching behavior and the <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> of the power semiconductors. Therefore, manufacturers work on minimizing the parasitic elements of their modules while keeping cost low and maintain a high degree of interchangeability of their modules with those of a second source (other manufacturer).A further aspect for optimization is the so-called thermal path between the heat source (the dies) and the heat-sink. The heat has to pass through different physical layers as solder, DCB, baseplate, thermal interface material (TIM) and the bulk of the heat-sink, until it is transferred to a gaseous medium as air or a fluid medium as water or oil. Since modern silicon-carbide power semiconductors show a larger power density, the requirements for heat transfer are rising.|$|E
50|$|When a {{transistor}} is {{switched on}} or off, {{it does not}} immediately switch from a non-conducting to a conducting state; and may transiently support both a high voltage and conduct a high current. Consequently, when gate current is applied to a transistor to cause it to switch, {{a certain amount of}} heat is generated which can, in some cases, be enough to destroy the transistor. Therefore, it is necessary to keep the switching time as short as possible, so as to minimize <b>switching</b> <b>loss.</b> Typical switching times are in the range of microseconds. The switching time of a transistor is inversely proportional to the amount of current used to charge the gate. Therefore, switching currents are often required in the range of several hundred milliamperes, or even in the range of amperes. For typical gate voltages of approximately 10-15V, several watts of power may be required to drive the switch. When large currents are switched at high frequencies, e.g. in DC-to-DC converters or large electric motors, multiple transistors are sometimes provided in parallel, so as to provide sufficiently high switching currents and switching power.|$|E

40|$|Voltage source {{inverters}} (VSI) {{are popular}} in variable speed induction motor drive applications. Pulse width modulation (PWM) is employed to achieve variable voltage variable frequency output from a fixed DC bus voltage. The modulation method greatly influences the harmonic distortion in line current and the inverter <b>switching</b> <b>loss.</b> This thesis evaluates a few space vectorbased PWM techniques which reduce the harmonic distortion and/or the inverter <b>switching</b> <b>loss,</b> compared to conventional space vector PWM (CSVPWM), {{at a given}} average switching frequency. In space vector-based PWM, the average voltage vector applied over a sub-cycle equals the commanded reference vector, thereby maintaining voltsecond balance. The given average vector can be realized by applying the voltage vectors of the inverter in different sequences. CSVPWM employs a switching sequence {{in which all the}} phases switch once in a sub-cycle. Sequences, in which a phase is clamped, while the other two phases switch once in a sub-cycle have been reported in literature. Further, certain special switching sequences have also been reported recently. These special sequences involve switching a phase twice, while switching the second phase once and clamping the third phase in a sub-cycle. This work investigates the use of such special switching sequences to reduce line current distortion and inverter <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> in an induction motor drive. The influence of various switching sequences on line current ripple and inverter <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> is discussed in the thesis. Comparison of the sequences in terms of <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> leads to a hybrid PWM technique, which deploys the best sequence to reduce <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> under a given operating condition. This technique is referred to as minimum <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> PWM (MSLPWM). Further, a procedure for design of hybrid PWM techniques to achieve reduced line current distortion as well as inverter <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> is elaborated. Four such specially designed hybrid PWM techniques are discussed. Analytical methods are presented for the evaluation of total RMS harmonic distortion factor of line current and inverter <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> corresponding to different PWM techniques. The MSLPWM and the hybrid PWM techniques are evaluated analytically in terms of harmonic distortion and <b>switching</b> <b>loss.</b> It is observed that the <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> corresponding to MSLPWM is considerably less than that with CSVPWM over the entire range of power factor. The reduction in <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> with MSLPWM is as high as 36 % at high power factors close to unity, while it is not less than 22 % at power factors close to zero. MSLPWM also reduces the harmonic distortion for power factors close to unity at high modulation indices. Compared to CSVPWM, the hybrid PWM techniques result in a maximum reduction of about 40 % in the harmonic distortion at fundamental frequencies close to 50 Hz, and about 30 % reduction in <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> at power factors close to unity. The various PWM techniques are tested on a constant V /f induction motor drive with a digital control platform based on ALTERA Cyclone II field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. With a 10 kVA IGBT based inverter feeding a 2. 2 kW, 415 V, 50 Hz, three-phase induction motor, the total RMS harmonic distortion factor of line current (IT HD) is measured at different fundamental frequencies for the various PWM techniques. The average switching frequency is 2. 44 kHz. The measured values of IT HD show a reduction in distortion with the hybrid PWM techniques over CSVPWM at high speeds of the drive. The relative values of IT HD corresponding to different PWM techniques agree with the theoretical predictions. With the 10 kVA IGBT based inverter feeding a 6 kW, 400 V, 50 Hz, 4 pole, three-phase induction motor, the switching losses corresponding to CSVPWM and MSLPWM are evaluated and compared. This is done by measuring the steady state temperature rise of the heat sink over the ambient for the two techniques under different conditions. The thermal measurements are carried out at different loads with power factor ranging from 0. 14 to 0. 77. The measurements are also carried out at different fundamental frequencies (or modulation indices). Further, to separate conduction (constant) losses and switching (variable) losses, the heat sink temperatures are measured at two different switching frequencies, namely 2. 44 kHz and 4. 88 kHz. It is observed that the temperature rise due to MSLPWM is less than that due to CSVPWM consistently under various operating conditions. The thermal measurements confirm the theoretical prediction of reduction in <b>switching</b> <b>loss</b> with MSLPWM. Measurements of heat sink temperature rise corresponding to CSVPWM, MSLPWM and the hybrid PWM techniques are carried out at a higher power factor of 0. 98 (lag) with the inverter feeding an RL load (instead of an induction motor). The hybrid PWM and MSLPWM result in lower switching losses as indicated by the reduction in temperature rise...|$|E

Demand of low voltage power supply for telecom system leads to narrow duty cycle which compels to increase operating switching frequency. Design of conventional buck converter under narrow duty cycle is quite objectionable since it leads to poor utilization of components as well as it degrades the system efficiency.
