5|$|However, Shakespeare {{soon began}} to adapt the {{traditional}} styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III {{has its roots in}} the <b>self-declaration</b> of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.|$|E

About 12,000 Poles in total were forced to leave the region and flee to Poland in the aftermath of the division of Cieszyn Silesia. The local Polish population felt that Warsaw had betrayed them and they were not satisfied with the division. It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Zaolzie in Czechoslovakia. Estimates range from 110,000 to 140,000 people in 1921. The 1921 and 1930 census numbers are not accurate since nationality depended on <b>self-declaration</b> and many Poles declared Czech nationality mainly as a result of fear of the new authorities and as compensation for some benefits. Czechoslovak law guaranteed rights for national minorities, but the reality in Zaolzie was quite different. The local Czech authorities made it more difficult for local Poles to obtain citizenship, while the process was expedited when the applicant pledged to declare Czech nationality and send his children to a Czech school. Newly built Czech schools were often better supported and equipped, thus inducing some Poles to send their children there. This and other factors contributed to the assimilation of Poles and also to significant emigration to Poland. After a few years, the heightened nationalism typical of the period around 1920 receded and local Poles increasingly co-operated with the Czechs. Still, Czechization was supported by Prague, which did not abide by certain laws related to language, legislative, and organizational issues. Polish deputies in Czechoslovak National Assembly frequently tried to put that issues on agenda. One way or the other, increasingly local Poles thus assimilated into the Czech population.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt is well {{established}} in litterature that popular saying "money whitens" is a strong mechanism of skin color <b>self-declarations</b> in Brazil. It was indeed observed comparing <b>self-declarations</b> and declarations by a third – mainly the interviewer – that the higher the educational level, the lighter the declaration by respondents. The same link was assessed for wages and income. These researches do not include a full analysis of darkening and chromatic immobility. Admittedly darkening is sometimes mentioned, but it is rather a strict counterpart of lightening than a choice for itself: if "money whitens", "poverty darkens". But contemporary evolutions of representations in brazilian society lead notably to a valorization of darkening. In this paper, I construct a chromatic mobility model to analyse lightening, darkening and chromatic immobility together. In this model, the mobility is realized by the respondent {{in relation to the}} perception of a third. Each individual realizes a trade-off to maximizes its satisfaction. This trade-off calls together personal identity and social identity. The empirical application of this chromatic mobility model relies on original data collected during a field research conducting in São Paulo (november 2006 – august 2007). I conclude that the link between chromatic mobility and educationnal level has to be nuanced. Indeed, it exists a threshold above which darkening is prefered to lightening.

The provision {{and use of}} environmental information is generally considered an essential element in addressing the environmental impacts associated with {{the life cycle of}} products. Environmental product declarations (EPD) are one of the much promoted informative instruments. A wide range of <b>self-declarations</b> as well as third-party certified EPDs have accordingly been established on a voluntary basis by various industries. This dissertation contains a review and analysis of the current development and use of environmental product declarations in business-to-business communication. The analysis focuses on the use of EPD in the building,energy and automotive industries. In order to utilise the potential of EPD to influence the awareness and behaviour of anufacturers and customers, a number of obstacles need to be overcome. Identified obstacles include the complexity of the information in its current form, as well as a lack of commitment among the actors to the overall goal of promoting design of, and shifting consumption to, environmentally preferable goods and services...|$|R

25|$|Due to the {{multitude}} of different ethnic and religious identities of the Muslim Bulgarians, {{it is extremely difficult}} to calculate the exact number {{of the members of the}} community in Bulgaria. An inquiry conducted by the Bulgaran Ministry of the Interior in 1989 estimated their number at 269,000. A summation of the different groups with different religious and ethnic identities (approximately 130,000 Muslim Bulgarians, approximately 55,000-65,000 non-religious Bulgarians, up to 50,000 Muslim Turks, 15,000 to 20,000 undeclared and an unclear number, probably at least several thousands, of Christian Bulgarians) yields approximately the same number. Despite {{the multitude}} of different ethnic and religious affiliations, the predominant ethnic identity would be Bulgarian (approximately 200,000 or three-quarters of the total population) and the predominant religious identity would be Muslim (again approximately 200,000 or three-quarters of the total population). However, if only self-consciousness and <b>self-declaration</b> are taken into consideration, the number of Muslim Bulgarians would be only 131,531, i.e. the ones who have declared as such at the 2001 census.|$|E

On 17 January he gathered 30,000 supporters at a public park and declared it renamed Place de la democratie.

40|$|Radical left-libertarian {{movements}} are often regarded as primarily seeking ways to accom-plish {{social and political}} change outside the framework of institutionalized politics. Previous research, however, has paid little or {{no attention to the}} question of these activists’ actual interactions with institu-tionalized politics, nor has it addressed the ways these interactions could be understood in relation to their overall strategies and ideology. This article therefore explores whether, and to what extent, such interaction actually occurs and analyzes the meanings and motives radical left-libertarian activists – from anarchist, autonomist, and anarcho-syndicalist groups – attribute to various types of political actions, ranging from voting and lobbying to protests and direct action. We furthermore compare activists in Po-land and Sweden, in order to scrutinize whether cross-country differences in “political opportunities” affects the activists’ political strategies and ideas about how social and political change can best be ac-complished. Contrary to popular beliefs and many activists’ own <b>self-declarations,</b> our analysis shows that radical left-libertarian groups do in fact try to achieve political change by interacting with institution-alized politics. While radical left-libertarian activists do in most cases prefer “direct action”, this article explores how a more complex relationship to institutionalized politics allows them to accomplish real and immediate changes at the grassroots level. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Mormonism is {{an early}} nineteenth-century restorationist {{movement}} that is convinced it is the preeminent Christian form. Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, emerged on the local religious scene in northern New York declaring that God told him that all other Christian forms were wrong, their creeds were an abomination, and their professors were corrupt. Because of this strong message, Smith had to simultaneously provide justification to insiders and outsiders as to why Mormonism was true and why all other churches were untrue. Initially, justification {{took the form of}} <b>self-declarations</b> of divine communication as well as biblical texting. As Smith 2 ̆ 7 s movement grew, other arguments developed {{that could be used to}} assert divine validity. One of these arguments was the use of extra-biblical patristic literature. Mormons have sought patristic differences and similarities to their current beliefs. They argue that similarities show a pure strain of Christianity (proto-Mormonism) which disappeared as mainstream patristic Catholicism (reflected through patristic differences to Mormon belief) pushed it into marginalization and eventual extinction. The use of extra biblical ancient literature in comparison to Mormonism has developed into a significant construct in Mormon claims of self-validation. Mormon scholarship in patristic study has deepened and significantly grown in twentieth-century Mormon and non-Mormon contexts. Despite this growth, a continuing apologetic agenda informs Mormon patristic work, generating a faulty methodology in examining ancient sources, causing frequent misinterpretations of sources, and often producing questionable patristic validation of modern Mormonism. Most non-Mormon patristics scholars seem unaware of either the energetic apologetic motive of modern Mormon patristic scholarship, or how this has influenced various interpretations that Mormons have advanced. This dissertation argues that Mormons entered the field of Patristics in the late nineteenth-century to apologetically validate their denomination. Prior to this time, they did not recognize patristic material as advantageous to their church. Despite possessing scholars who have received appropriate degrees at reputable institutions in the post WWII era, most Mormon work in the field uses a distorted methodology and faulty logic, and has manipulated evidence to produce unnatural or incorrect conclusions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we present {{the results of a}} generational {{accounting}} for Hungary. The analysis extends to the entire government including the central budget, social security funds, local governments and separate government funds. We used three sources of data for constructing the tax profiles. The first one consists of two samples of personal income tax returns provided by the National Tax Office (APEH). One of them is a 0. 45 % random sample of tax returns declared by the employer, the other one is a 1 % random sample of <b>self-declarations.</b> The second source is the Household Budget Survey of the Central Statistical Office (KSH). This contains data about consumption and income of 7, 531 households. The third source is the government’s 1996 Budget Report, which contains the macro-data on taxes. Besides these, we used several further studies and statistical data in order to make micro- and macro-level data consistent. According to the base assumptions of the model (1. 5 % productivity growth per annum, 5 % discount rate), those born in 1996 can expect a total of $ 8, 400 net taxes through their entire lifetime at the 1996 present value. If modifications of the tax system were implemented {{in such a way that}} any tax increase or any reduction of expenses would only affect future generations, they could expect $ 43, 900 of net life-time tax (also at the 1996 present value), which means a 5. 25 -fold (425 %) increase. In international comparison, this is one of the highest values. If the productivity growth rate were only 1 %, the degree of the imbalance would increase further, 5. 93 -fold (493 %), and even with 2 % annual productivity growth, it would only go down to a factor of 4. 77 (377 %). The main reason for the imbalance is the expected demographic deficit. If the age composition remain the same as in 1996, the 5. 25 -factor would go down to 2. 19 (119 %). ...|$|R

In [...] Jesus states: [...] "For unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins", and later the crowd attempts to stone Jesus {{in response to his}} statement in : [...] "Before Abraham was, I am.". Many other translations including the ASV have rendered John 8:24 as something like [...] "... For unless you believe that I am , you will die in your sins.". Some consider the phrase in John 8:58 to be grammatically different from that in John 8:24, as the copulative verb can be used with any predicative expression and not only a predicate nominative, such as in [...] "ὅπου εἰμὶ ἐγὼ καὶ ὑμεῖς ἦτε" [...] ("where I am, you also may be") in [...] [...] "πρὶν Ἀβραὰμ γενέσθαι" [...] ("before Abraham was") can be taken as a predicative prepositional phrase, thus [...] "ἐγώ εἰμὶ" [...] ("I am") in John 8:58 does not grammatically require a predicate nominative, however it is rather unusual for a present tense verb to be used with a temporal adverb like πρὶν in a declarative statement, though there are rare exceptions outside the New Testament. Thus explanations of John 8:58 generally depend on theology and not Greek grammar.|$|E
40|$|All three {{chapters}} of my dissertation {{belong to the}} general topic of transaction costs to export. In chapter 1 we explore empirically how export delays and export monetary costs relate over time. We find evidence that suggest that countries increase pecuniary exports costs to fund innovations that decrease export delay. This implies that international organisations' singular preoccupation with export delays (at the exclusion of export costs) {{has the potential to}} retard rather than facilitate the cause of globalisation. The study also shows how domestic delays and monetary costs to export affect the volume of trade, with special focus on developing countries. Our main findings suggest that export delays are not as significant for developing countries as previously thought, while pecuniary costs - largely neglected in the literature, have a significant negative effect on how much countries trade. Anecdotal evidence in the form of countries’ <b>self-declarations</b> and the statistical evidence provided in Chapter 1 suggest that the monetary costs generated by governmental initiatives to reduce export delays are largely transferred to exporters. However, it is unclear why governments choose this course of action, given that increasing export pecuniary costs hinders trade. To shed relevant light, in the second chapter we provide one theoretical explanation. In our model the government objective is to maximise social welfare. We show that, by passing the costs of reductions in delays to exporting firms, governments generate market incentives that optimise economic efficiency. The third chapter complements chapters 1 and 2 by examining the impact of export time sensitivity across industries on the patterns of trade. My findings show evidence in support of the hypothesis that, in the last decades, the supply of exports in more time sensitive industries tended to agglomerate near the demand centre. The study also shows evidence of an increase in the share of time sensitive industries in total trade. These results may be explained by the recent introduction of new technologies, which have not only increased the demand for timeliness in trade but have also facilitated the international commercialisation of time sensitive products. The geographical agglomeration effect of time sensitivity coupled with the relative growth of trade in time sensitive industries may explain, at least in part, the fact that the average negative effect of distance on trade, in spite of recent improvements in transportation and communication technologies, has not declined, and may have even strengthened over time. Finally, my findings show that, independently of their geographical location, high-income countries not only tend to specialise in the production of time sensitive industries but also that this pattern of specialisation is consolidating over time...|$|R
6000|$|It {{has been}} my {{conviction}} for many years that the Russian and the Englishman are as it were the complementary halves of a man. What the Russian lacks the Englishman has; what the Englishman lacks, that has the Russian. The works of Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoievsky, Tolstoi, Tchekov--the amazing direct and truthful revelations of these masters--has let me, I think, into some secrets of the Russian soul, so that the Russians I have met seem rather clearer to me than {{men and women of}} other foreign countries. For their construing I have been given what schoolboys call a crib. Only a fool pretends to knowledge--the heart of another is surely a dark forest; but the heart of a Russian seems to me a forest less dark than many, partly because the qualities and defects of a Russian impact so sharply on the perceptions of an Englishman, but partly because those great Russian novelists in whom I have delighted, possess, before all other gifts, so deep a talent for the revelation of truth. In following out this apposition of the Russian and the Englishman, one may well start with that little matter of [...] "truth." [...] The Englishman has what I would call a passion for the forms of truth; his word is his bond--nearly always; he will not tell a lie--not often; honesty, in his idiom, is the best policy. But he has little or no regard for the spirit of truth. Quite unconsciously he revels in self-deception and flies from knowledge of anything which will injure his intention to [...] "make good," [...] as Americans say. He is, before all things, a competitive soul who seeks to win rather than to understand or to [...] "live." [...] And to win, or, shall we say, to maintain to oneself the illusion of winning, one must carefully avoid seeing too much. The Russian is light hearted about the forms of truth, but revels in self-knowledge and frank <b>self-declaration,</b> enjoys unbottoming the abysses of his thoughts and feelings, however gloomy. In Russia time and space have no exact importance, living counts for more than dominating life, emotion is not castrated, feelings are openly indulged in; in Russia there are the extremes of cynicism, and of faith; of intellectual subtlety, and simplicity; truth has quite another significance; manners are different; what we know as [...] "good form" [...] is a meaningless shibboleth. The Russian rushes at life, drinks the cup to the dregs, then frankly admits that it has dregs, and puts up with the disillusionment. The Englishman holds the cup gingerly and sips, determined to make it last his time, not to disturb the dregs, and to die without having reached the bottom.|$|E
