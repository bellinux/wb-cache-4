50|$|The Ayres Economy Basement concept {{dates back}} to the opening of its Indianapolis {{flagship}} store in 1905. The Economy Basement, later known as the Downstairs Store, Discount Shop, and <b>Budget</b> <b>Store,</b> operated differently than other retail department stores. The Ayres basement store did not offer cheaply made, inferior goods. Instead, it sold lower-priced items of good quality that served as an entry point for less-affluent customers until they could afford full-priced goods on the upper floors. It also served as a training ground for Ayres managers. By the 1960s the <b>Budget</b> <b>Store</b> had declined and was eclipsed by Ayr-Way, the Ayres discount subsidiary, and changes in shopping trends and pricing. The <b>Budget</b> <b>Store</b> concept was eliminated in the mid-1980s.|$|R

On June 14, 1988, Safeway agreed to sell its Houston division to Texas Supermarkets Inc., a holding company formed by local investors Duncan Cook & Co. and the Sterling Group. The deal included 50 stores in Houston, 20 in Austin, stores in 23 other communities in East and Central Texas, along with a distribution center, frozen food warehouse, bread manufacturing plant and milk processing plant. At the time of the $174 million transaction, Safeway's 18 percent market share ranked third in the Houston market behind Kroger, with 27 percent, and Randall's Food Markets, with 21 percent. M.

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are complex mixtures of organic compounds {{that are often}} found as environmental pollutants. In 2005, the German Stiftung Warentest (a product testing NGO) had detected high levels of PAHs in some tool handles and cable sheaths [1]. To reduce the health risks, guidance values for technically unavoidable PAH levels were proposed for manufacturers to comply on a voluntary basis. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was asked to assess these guidance values and the occurrence of PAHs in consumer products. In the spring of 2009 TÜV Rheinland examined the PAH concentrations in various products like tool handles, beach sandals and ball horns from do-it-yourself <b>stores</b> and low <b>budget</b> <b>stores.</b> The result: {{in some cases the}} guidance values are still considerably exceeded in the consumer products examined for PAHs. According to the knowledge currently available, the BfR must assume that defective products are still being marketed. Such products do not comply with good manufacturing practice and constitute a risk for human health. In general, manufacturers should reduce PAH concentrations in their products as much as possible since no threshold values can be given for some PAHs below which health risks can be excluded. In order to protect consumers from health risks, BfR proposes the setting of statutory limit values for PAHs and BaP. Compliance should be a precondition for the marketability of consumer products that come into contact with the skin...|$|R

A field study and two laboratory studies offer four key generalizations about budget shoppers in grocery stores: (1) They predominantly use mental computation strategies to track their in-store spending, (2) they adapt their mental computation strategy to the dominant range of price endings of items in their shopping baskets, (3) those who try to calculate the exact total price of their basket are less accurate than those who estimate the approximate price, and (4) motivated shoppers are less accurate than less motivated shoppers (because they tend to calculate instead of estimate the total basket price).

Research/practical implications: First, to briefly detail the strategic regulatory motivations and location planning implications of the major UK food retailers entering this market.
