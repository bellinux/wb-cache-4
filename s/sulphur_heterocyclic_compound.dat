3000|$|Although, several organic {{compounds}} {{have been used}} as inhibitors in different corrosive environment, choosing an appropriate inhibitor for specific environment and metal is of great importance. Generally, oxygen, nitrogen and <b>sulphur</b> containing <b>heterocyclic</b> organic <b>compounds</b> with multiple bonds have a tendency to resist corrosion [10, 11]. Compounds rich in heteroatoms can be regarded as environmental friendly inhibitors because of their characteristic strong chemical activity and low toxicity [12]. The adsorption characteristics of organic [...] molecules are also affected by sizes, electron density at the donor atoms and orbital character of donating electrons [13, 14, 15, 16]. Organic compounds containing hetero atoms in the functional groups, pi-electron in triple or conjugated double bonds and presence of aromatic rings in their structure are the major adsorption centres and are usually good inhibitors [17]. Several <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> such as methylthiophenyl derivatives [18], isoxazolium cationic Schiff base compounds [19], quinoline derivatives [20], sulphonamide compounds [21], thiadiazoles derivatives [22], imidazole derivatives [23], fluoroquinolones [24], pyrazole derivatives [25], pyridazine derivatives [26] and pyridine derivatives [27] have been reported as anticorrosion substances in various corrosive environments.|$|R
40|$|Kerogens {{isolated}} from four rocks of Ordovician age from North America have been analysed by combined pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to {{compare and contrast}} the type and distribution of sulphur-containing compounds and aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons present in the pyrolysates. When pyrolysed, all of the kerogens released several series of <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> including alkylthiophenes, alkylthiolanes, alkylthianes and alkylbenzothiophenes together with n-alkanes, n-alklenes and alkylcyclohexanes as well as alkyl-substituted benzenes and naphthalenes. One of the kerogens, {{isolated from}} the Guttenberg oil rock, consisted predominantly of the alga Gloeocapsomorpha prisca, which produced sulphur compounds and hydrocarbons with fingerprint pyrograms that were {{different from those of}} the other three kerogens. The data provide prima facie evidence that these distributions may act as pseudo “biological markers” for this species of alga, namely that unsaturated kerogen moieties available for the uptake of sulphur, or which can cyclise to form hydrocarbons, distinguish Gloeocapsomorpha prisca from the contributing organisms of the other kerogens analysed...|$|R

Flax fiber and seed have industrial significance as a source of cellulosic fiber for textile and paper industry and seed oil for pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry.

The influence of low molecular weight five and sixmembered nitrogen-containing <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> on organogenesis of Linum usitatissimum L. cultivar heavenly in vitro has been studied. It was found that <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> derivatives pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazole and isoflavones revealed high stimulating effect on direct shoot organogenesis of Linum usitatissimum L. in vitro. The maximal shoot regeneration frequency was obtained on the MS media containing <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> at the concentration 10 - 8 M/l as compared to lower regeneration frequency obtained on the control MS medium containing 1 mg/l BAP and 0. 05 mg/l NAA. The maximal index of explants with regeneration (in %) that exceeded almost twice the same index in control MS medium was obtained on the MS medium containing <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>compound</b> derivative of isoflavones.
