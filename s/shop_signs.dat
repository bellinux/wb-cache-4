25|$|Although in both {{countries}} the use of simplified characters is universal among the younger Chinese generation, {{a large majority of}} the older Chinese literate generation still use the traditional characters. Chinese <b>shop</b> <b>signs</b> are also generally written in traditional characters.|$|E
25|$|As {{there is}} no {{restriction}} {{of the use of}} traditional characters in the mass media, television programmes, books, magazines and music CD's that have been imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan are widely available, and these almost always use traditional characters. Most karaoke discs, being imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan, have song lyrics in traditional characters as well. Many <b>shop</b> <b>signs</b> continue to be written in traditional characters. Menus in hawker centres and coffeeshops are also commonly seen in traditional characters.|$|E
5000|$|L'Enseigne de Gersaint, or [...] "The <b>Shop</b> <b>Sign</b> of Gersaint", (1720-21) is a {{painting}} by Jean-Antoine Watteau, which {{is considered to be}} his last masterpiece. It was painted as a <b>shop</b> <b>sign</b> for the marchand-mercier, or art dealer, Edme François Gersaint. According to Daniel Roche the sign functioned more as an advertisement for the artist than the dealer.|$|R

25|$|Non-television {{advertising}} campaigns {{were still}} {{allowed in the}} UK but came under stricter guidelines in 1986, which in particular, prevented adverts from actually showing a person smoking. The tobacco producers responded with increasingly indirect and abstract campaigns, among which those of Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut became particularly recognisable. Until about the mid-1990s many corner shops, newsagents and off licences had on their <b>shop</b> <b>signs</b> prominent branding by cigarette brands such as Benson & Hedges, Silk Cut, Regal etc. until the practice was outlawed.|$|E
25|$|The British {{presence}} {{culminated in}} the winter of 1892 (21 March - 25 April) when Queen Victoria came for a stay of three weeks at the Albion Hotel. At that time, the British influence was so strong that <b>shop</b> <b>signs</b> were in both French and English. There was an English butcher, a chemist, two banks, and two golf courses. There were also two English churches (plus one at the Grand Hôtel in Costebelle), whose buildings still exist: All Saint's Church at Costebelle and Saint Paul's English Church, Avenue Beauregard.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{promoted}} a bilingual system of English with Japanese as a communication {{link between the}} locals and the occupying forces. English <b>shop</b> <b>signs</b> and advertisements were taken away, and in April 1942, streets and buildings in Central were renamed in Japanese. For example, Queen's Road Central became Meiji-dori and Des Voeux Road became Shōwa-dori. Similarly, the Gloucester Hotel became the Matsubara. The Peninsula Hotel, the Matsumoto; Lane Crawford, Matsuzakaya. The Queen's Theatre was renamed first the Nakajima-dori, then the Meiji. Their propaganda also pointed to the pre-eminence of the Japanese way of life, of Japanese spiritual values and the ills of western materialism.|$|E

500|$|Street and <b>shop</b> <b>signs</b> are a {{particularly}} challenging aspect of written Chinese layout, since {{they can be}} written either left-to-right, or right-to-left (the latter {{can be thought of}} as the traditional layout with each [...] "column" [...] being one character high), as well as from top to bottom. [...] It is not uncommon to encounter all three orientations on signs on neighboring stores.|$|E
2500|$|Old Town is now {{considered}} an affluent and historic neighborhood, home to many of Chicago's older Victorian-era buildings. However, in the 1950s, most of this area was an enclave to the first emigrants from Puerto Rico to Chicago, who {{referred to it as}} part of [...] "La Clark" [...] until commercialization decorated late 1960s <b>shop</b> <b>signs</b> with the name of Old Town. The neighborhood is home to St. Michael's Church, originally built to serve German immigrants, and one of only 7 to survive the great Chicago fire. St. Michael's, Holy Name Cathedral, Immaculate Conception, and St. Joseph's Catholic churches all catered to Latinos with a Mass in Spanish.|$|E
2500|$|Esperanto {{has been}} used in a number of films and novels. Typically, this is done either to add the exotic flavour of a foreign {{language}} without representing any particular ethnicity, or to avoid going to the trouble of inventing a new language. The Charlie Chaplin film The Great Dictator (1940) showed Jewish ghetto <b>shop</b> <b>signs</b> in Esperanto. Two full-length feature films have been produced with dialogue entirely in Esperanto: , in 1964, and Incubus, a 1965 B-movie horror film. A language school teaching [...] "Entrenationo" [...] (representing a satire on Esperanto) is featured in Graham Greene's novel The Confidential Agent, which was made into a film starring Charles Boyer and Lauren Bacall (1945). Other amateur productions have been made, such as a dramatization of the novel [...] (Gerda Has Disappeared). In Stamboul Train, Greene used Esperanto as the language on signs at the main train station in Budapest. A number of mainstream films in national languages have used Esperanto in some way.|$|E

60|$|You {{know our}} ineradicable {{tendency}} to damn {{everything in the}} mofussil. Calcutta professes astonishment that Allahabad has a good dancing floor; Allahabad wonders {{if it is true}} that Lahore really has an ice-factory; and Lahore pretends to believe that everybody in Peshawar sleeps armed. Very much in the same way I was amused at seeing a steam tramway in Rangoon, and after we had quitted Moulmein fully expected to find the outskirts of civilisation. Vanity and ignorance were severely shocked when they confronted a long street of business--a street of two-storied houses, full of ticca-gharies, <b>shop</b> <b>signs,</b> and above all jinrickshaws.|$|E

50|$|One of {{his more}} {{interesting}} works of art existing today is the double-sided tin <b>shop</b> <b>sign</b> he painted for his own business. On one of the sides, the artist has depicted himself painting. On {{the rear of the}} sign one can see a still-life painting. This proclaimed to the potential customers that he was open to conduct business and receive orders of both still life and portraits. In a way this <b>shop</b> <b>sign</b> is also proof that a painter in late 19th and early 20th century Istanbul was {{at the same time a}} tradesman. Similarly this fact suggests that paintings during that period were seen as objects. They were ordered and considered as goods in the Ottoman society and economy, especially among the non-Muslim minorities.|$|R
