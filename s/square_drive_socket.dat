30|$|The 5  mm borer {{requires}} smaller torque for coring. Due to its smaller reaction force, we used thinner reaction bar {{of smaller}} diameter and a lighter <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> <b>socket,</b> reducing the total weight to 6.0  kg (Table  1). Due {{to the larger}} torque required for sampling 12  mm cores, we had to increase the total weight of the device for sampling 12  mm cores to 9.5  kg. The rotation speed of the bit stayed almost constant irrespective of penetration depth and the wood species sampled. Using the gear ratios of 1 : 24 and 1 : 118, the penetration speeds of the 5 and 12  mm bits were approximately 50  cm and 12  cm per min, respectively (Table  1).|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching <b>square</b> <b>socket</b> <b>drive</b> a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon <b>drive</b> (hex <b>socket)</b> shortly followed in 1911.|$|R

5000|$|Socket {{wrenches}} {{are most}} commonly hexagonal, or more {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "6-point" [...] in lay terms. <b>Sockets</b> are <b>driven</b> by being attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the <b>square</b> <b>drive).</b> Standard sizes of <b>square</b> <b>drives</b> around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] <b>square</b> <b>drive,</b> and both #4 and #5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to <b>drive</b> the <b>socket</b> wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|R

50|$|According to one source, New Britain Machine {{was founded}} in New Britain, Connecticut in 1887. However, {{according}} to Archives & Special Collections at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, it {{was founded in}} 1895 subsequent to the J.T. Case Engine Company, a manufacturer of steam engines. The first product the new company produced was a chainsaw mortising machine. In 1917, it registered the None Better trademark to sell its line of sockets and tools. Much of New Britain Machine's early tool production was done under the None Better line. Many of the early tools were carbon steel, offering a lower cost alternative to the higher price alloy steels of the day. Early tool sets consisted of hex <b>drive</b> <b>sockets</b> and an ell bar for the drive tool. Beginning in the 1930s, the None Better line consisted {{of a wide variety of}} 1/2 <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> tools with a Cadmium finish. At this time, New Britain Machine was also supplying tools for Sears in their Craftsman line of tools. These tools are easy to distinguish as they either have a BE or an H in a circle stamped into the tools. The New Britain Machine line was also created at this time as a higher priced alloy steel alternative.|$|R

The difference between the cut and the <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> is the height of the ball at contact: the cut is played to a ball bouncing waist high or above with the batsman standing tall, whereas the <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> is played to a wide ball of shin height with the batsman bending his knees and crouching low to make contact.|$|R

5000|$|Headless {{set screws}} {{have been around}} for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless set screws experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the hex <b>socket</b> <b>drive,</b> noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching <b>square</b> <b>drive)</b> holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless set screws on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the hex <b>socket</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the numerical simulation of internal recirculating flows encompassing a two-dimensional viscous incompressible flow generated inside a regularized <b>square</b> <b>driven</b> cavity {{and over a}} backward-facing step. For this purpose, the simulation is performed by using the projection method combined with a Chebyshev collocation spectral method. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are formulated {{in terms of the}} primitive variables, velocity and pressure. The time integration of the spectrally discretized, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is performed by a second-order mixed explicit/implicit time integration scheme. This scheme is a combination of the Crank-Nicolson scheme operating on the diffusive terms and a second-order Adams-Bashforth scheme acting on the advective terms. The projection method is used to split the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two decoupled problems: the Burgers equation to predict an intermediate velocity field and the Poisson equation for the pressure, which is used to correct the intermediate velocity field and satisfy the continuity equation. Numerical simulations for flows inside a two-dimensional regularized <b>square</b> <b>driven</b> cavity for Reynolds numbers up to 10000 and over a backward-facing step for Reynolds numbers up to 875 are presented and compared with numerical results previously published, where good agreement is demonstrated...|$|R
