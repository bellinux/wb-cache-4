40|$|Minor {{differences}} in colour perception between pseudophakic, phakic, and spectacle aphakic eyes {{were identified by}} the Pickford-Nicholson anomaloscope and the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 -hue test. The results suggest that pseudophakic eyes are more sensitive to red and less sensitive to blue than aphakic eyes corrected with spectacles. Spectrophotometer measurements reveal that the Rayner-Pearce posterior chamber intraocular lens {{used in this study}} transmits an evenly balanced colour spectrum, whereas an aphakic <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens</b> exhibits significant colour distortion, reducing the red and enhancing the blue transmission. This distortion may possibly be attributed to the increased chromatic aberration in the <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens</b> compared with the intraocular lens...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{response}} of the mouse eye to two methods for the induction of experimental myopia. MethodsGrowth patterns of eyes were determined by axial length measurements from birth to adult in eyes of both sexes of normal mice examined on post-natal day 1 to 6 months and at 1 year. For the induction of experimental myopia, Balb/cJ mice were prepared with either unilateral lid suture or by a − 10 D <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens</b> placed over one eye at post-natal day 10. Other mice received a plano lens as a control for lens wear. Refraction was carried out at post-natal days of 28, 42 and 56 in lid suture and <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens</b> wear group by streak retinoscopy. Axial length was measured by a combination of video image photography, digital caliper, or Optical Low Coherence Interferometry (OLCI). Corroborative optical modeling of the mouse eye was carried out using ZEMAX ray tracing software. ResultsAxial length (AL) increased linearly between post-natal day 1 to day 56, plateauing at about 140 days. After 18 days of unilateral lid suture initiated 10 days after birth, the AL of experimental eyes was 3. 032 ± 0. 003 mm, while AL in contra-lateral control eyes was 2. 981 ± 0. 005 mm (mean±sem, p< 0. 05, n= 40), after 32 days, the AL of experimental eyes was 3. 290 ± 0. 004 mm, and the AL of control eyes was 3. 104 ± 0. 002 mm (p< 0. 001, n= 60). After 46 days of lid closure AL of experimental eyes was 3. 592 ± 0. 003 mm, while AL of control eyes was 3. 363 ± 0. 003 mm (p< 0. 001, n= 80). <b>Spectacle</b> <b>lens</b> wear of 46 days duration increased AL in experimental eyes to 3. 721 ± 0. 002 mm, while AL in control eyes was 3. 354 ± 0. 003 mm (p< 0. 001, n= 100). Refraction and ray tracing analysis substantiated the dimensional changes to be consistent with increased AL. ConclusionsTwo procedures to induce experimental myopia, initiated at eye opening, produced significant myopic shifts corresponding to increases in axial lengths after 32 and 46 days of lid suture and after 46 days wearing a − 10 D <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens...</b>|$|R
50|$|Back vertex {{distance}} (BVD) is {{the distance}} between the back of the <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens</b> and the front of the cornea (the front surface of the eye). This is essential in higher prescriptions (usually above ±4.00D) as slight changes in {{the distance between}} the spectacles and the eyes above this level can cause the patient to perceive a different power, leading to blur and/or other symptoms.|$|R
50|$|Treatment {{is done by}} {{changing}} the optical magnification properties of the auxiliary optics (corrective lenses). The optical magnification properties of <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> can be adjusted {{by changing}} parameters like the base curve, vertex distance, and center thickness.

The difference in magnification can also be eliminated {{by a combination of}} contact lenses and glasses (creating a weak telescope system). The optimum design solution will depend on different parameters like cost, cosmetic implications, and if the patient can tolerate wearing a contact lens.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the peripheral retina, responding to local optical defocus, contributes to myopia and associated altered eye growth in humans. To test this hypothesis, we measured the changes in central (on-axis) and peripheral ocular dimensions in guinea pigs wearing a concentric bifocal <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens</b> design with power restricted to the periphery. METHODS. Five groups of guinea pigs (n = 83) wore either a unifocal (UF) <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens</b> (- 4, 0, or + 4 Diopters [D]), or a peripheral defocus (PF) <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens</b> that had a plano center (diameter of 5 mm) with either - 4 or + 4 D in the surround (- 4 / 0 or + 4 / 0 D). The overall optical diameter of all lenses was 12 mm. Lenses were worn over one eye from 8 to 18 days of age for negative and plano lenses, or from 8 to 22 days of age for positive lenses. Refractive error was measured centrally and 30 degrees off-axis in the temporal and nasal retina. The shape of the eye was analyzed from images of sectioned eyes. RESULTS. Lenses of - 4 D UF induced myopia, reflecting enhanced ocular elongation, which was centered on the optic nerve head and included the surrounding peripapillary zone (PPZ, 188 in diameter). Some ocular expansion, including within the PPZ, also was recorded with - 4 / 0 and + 4 / 0 D PF lenses while the + 4 D UF lens inhibited rather than enhanced elongation, centrally and peripherally. CONCLUSIONS. Peripheral defocus-induced ocular expansion encompasses the PPZ, irrespective of {{the sign of the}} inducing defocus. Understanding the underlying mechanism potentially has important implications for designing multifocal lenses for controlling myopia in humans and also potentially for understanding the link between myopia and glaucoma.
