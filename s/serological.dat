5|$|The triterpenes 3α-carboxyacetoxyquercinic acid, 3α-carboxyacetoxy-24-methylene-23-oxolanost-8-en-26-oic acid, and 5α,8α-epidioxyergosta-6,22-dien-3β-ol (ergosterol peroxide) {{have been}} {{isolated}} from D.confragosa. Lectins from D.confragosa, tested against rabbit and human erythrocytes, {{were determined to}} have anti-H <b>serological</b> specificity.|$|E
5|$|B. bufo {{is part of}} {{a species}} complex, a group of closely related species which cannot be clearly demarcated. Several modern species are {{believed}} to form an ancient group of related taxa from preglacial times. These are the spiny toad (B. spinosus), the Caucasian toad (B. verrucosissimus) and the Japanese common toad (B. japonicus). The European common toad (Bufobufo) seems to have arisen more recently. It is believed that the range of the ancestral form extended into Asia but that isolation between the eastern and western species complexes occurred {{as a result of the}} development of the Central Asian Deserts during the Middle Miocene. The exact taxonomic relationships between these species remains unclear. A <b>serological</b> investigation into toad populations in Turkey undertaken in 2001 examined the blood serum proteins of Bufoverrucosissimus and Bufospinosus. It found that the differences between the two were not significant and that therefore the former should be synonymized with the latter.|$|E
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or <b>serological</b> markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to evaluate for damage to the nerves or muscles.|$|E
25|$|Anti-gliadin {{antibodies}} {{were one}} of the first <b>serological</b> markers for coeliac disease. Problematic with AGA is the typical sensitivity and specificity was about 85%. Gliadin peptides which are synthesized as the deamidated form have much higher sensitivity and specificity, creating 2 <b>serological</b> tests for CD that approach biopsy diagnostic in performance.|$|E
25|$|A <b>serological</b> {{test for}} {{melioidosis}} (indirect haemagglutination) is available, but not commercially in most countries. A high background titre {{may reduce the}} positive predictive value of <b>serological</b> tests in endemic countries. A specific direct immunofluorescent test and latex agglutination, based on monoclonal antibodies, are used widely in Thailand, but are not available elsewhere. Cross-reactivity with B.thailandensis is almost complete. A commercial ELISA kit for melioidosis appears to perform well. but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.|$|E
25|$|Enteric E. coli (EC) are {{classified}} {{on the basis}} of <b>serological</b> characteristics and virulence properties. The major pathotypes of E. coli that cause diarrhea are listed below.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{made using}} medical history and {{cutaneous}} and <b>serological</b> tests to exclude other causes, but to obtain final confirmation a Double Blind Controlled Food Challenge must be performed.|$|E
25|$|Immunologic disorder: Positive anti-Smith, anti-ds DNA, antiphospholipid antibody, and/or false {{positive}} <b>serological</b> test for syphilis; sensitivity = 85%; specificity = 93%. Presence of anti-ss DNA in 70% of cases (though also positive with rheumatic disease and healthy persons).|$|E
25|$|There {{are eight}} <b>serological</b> {{varieties}} of the bacterium denoted by the letters A to H. The toxin {{from all of}} these acts {{in the same way}} and produces similar symptoms: the motor nerve endings are prevented from releasing acetylcholine, causing flaccid paralysis and symptoms of blurred vision, ptosis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, cramps, and respiratory difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Three <b>serological</b> {{tests are}} also {{available}} for detection of the parasite: the micro-CATT, wb-CATT, and wb-LATEX. The first uses dried blood, while the other two use whole blood samples. A 2002 study found the wb-CATT {{to be the most}} efficient for diagnosis, while the wb-LATEX is a better exam for situations where greater sensitivity is required.|$|E
25|$|The {{adeno-associated virus}} (AAV), {{previously}} {{thought to be}} a contaminant in adenovirus preparations, was first identified as a dependovirus in the 1960s in the laboratories of Bob Atchison at Pittsburgh and Wallace Rowe at NIH. <b>Serological</b> studies in humans subsequently indicated that, despite being present in people infected by helper viruses such as adenovirus or herpes virus, AAV itself did not cause any disease.|$|E
25|$|The BK {{virus was}} first {{isolated}} in 1971 from the urine of a renal transplant patient, initials B.K. The BK virus {{is similar to}} another virus called the JC virus (JCV), since their genomes share 75% sequence similarity. Both of {{these viruses can be}} identified and differentiated from each other by carrying out <b>serological</b> tests using specific antibodies or by using a PCR based genotyping approach.|$|E
25|$|Methods used in {{laboratory}} diagnosis include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on a nutrient medium (Bordet-Gengou medium), {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), and <b>serological</b> methods (e.g. complement fixation test). The bacteria can be recovered from the person only {{during the first three}} weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks.|$|E
25|$|Minor {{reactions}} to subregions that show similarity to other types {{can be observed}} to the gene products of alleles of a serotype group. The sequence of the antigens determines the antibody reactivities, and so having a good sequencing capability (or sequence-based typing) obviates the need for <b>serological</b> reactions. Therefore, different serotype reactions may indicate the need to sequence a person's HLA to determine a new gene sequence.|$|E
25|$|Specific helminths can be {{identified}} through microscopic examination of their eggs (ova) found in faecal samples. The number of eggs is measured in units of eggs per gram. However, it does not quantify mixed infections, and in practice, is inaccurate for quantifying the eggs of schistosomes and soil-transmitted helmiths. Sophisticated tests such as <b>serological</b> assays, antigen tests, and molecular diagnosis are also available; however, they are time-consuming, expensive and not always reliable.|$|E
25|$|SeV induces lesions {{within the}} {{respiratory}} tract, {{usually associated with}} bacterial inflammation of the trachea and lung (tracheitis and bronchopneumonia, respectively). However, the lesions are limited, and aren't indicative solely of SeV infection. Detection, therefore, makes use of SeV-specific antigens in several <b>serological</b> methods, including ELISA, immunofluorescence, and hemagglutination assays, with particular emphasis on use of the ELISA for its high sensitivity (unlike the hemagglutination assay) and its fairly early detection (unlike the immunofluorescence assay).|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of {{autoimmune}} disorders largely rests on accurate history and physical {{examination of the}} patient, and high index of suspicion {{against a backdrop of}} certain abnormalities in routine laboratory tests (example, elevated C-reactive protein). In several systemic disorders, <b>serological</b> assays which can detect specific autoantibodies can be employed. Localised disorders are best diagnosed by immunofluorescence of biopsy specimens. Autoantibodies are used to diagnose many autoimmune diseases. The levels of autoantibodies are measured to determine the progress of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} in culturing Borrelia bacteria in the laboratory, diagnosis of Lyme disease is typically based on the clinical exam findings {{and a history of}} exposure to endemic Lyme areas. The EM rash, which does not occur in all cases, is considered sufficient to establish a diagnosis of Lyme disease even when serologic blood tests are negative. <b>Serological</b> testing can be used to support a clinically suspected case, but is not diagnostic by itself.|$|E
25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} {{diagnosed}} clinically based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as EM, facial palsy, or arthritis), or {{a history of}} possible exposure to infected ticks, as well as <b>serological</b> blood tests. The EM rash {{is not always a}} bull's eye, i.e., it can be solid red. When making a diagnosis of Lyme disease, health care providers should consider other diseases that may cause similar illnesses. Not all individuals infected with Lyme disease develop the characteristic bull's-eye rash, and many may not recall a tick bite.|$|E
25|$|Five species infect horses: S. asinus, S. bertrami, S. equicanis, S. fayeri and S. neurona (S. falcatula). All utilize canids as {{definitive}} hosts: transplacental infection {{has also}} been reported. S. neurona causes equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. Exposure to this parasite appears to be common in the United States with <b>serological</b> surveys indicating that 50-60% percent of all horses in the Midwest United States {{have been exposed to}} it. Clinical signs include gait abnormalities including ataxia, knuckling and crossing over. Muscle atrophy, usually unilateral, may occur. The lesions are typically focal. Brain-stem involvement is common. Depression, weakness, head tilt and dysphagia also occur.|$|E
25|$|To be able {{to perform}} a proper {{diagnosis}} of this pathogen is it important to take samples from the suspected infected individuals such as a stool, throat, or nasopharyngeal sample. There are various tests that can be done on these samples to see if a person is infected. Viral antigen can be detected by performing an assay. A <b>serological</b> assay can also be performed on the sample to look for virus-specific antibodies present in the sample, thus showing that the person is trying to combat the virus. The virus can be isolated in culture through the use of mouse-L fibroblasts, green monkey kidney cells, as well as HeLa cells.|$|E
25|$|There {{appears to}} be an {{association}} of autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis (ARA) both with GSE and gluten allergies. ARA in GSE/CD may be secondary to tTG autoimmunity. In a recent study in Turkey, 8 of 20 ARA patients had wheat reactivities on the RAST tests. When this allergic food and all other patient specific RAST+ foods were removed half of the patients had improved ARA by <b>serological</b> markers. In patients with wheat allergies, rye was effectively substituted. This may indicate that some proportion of RA in GSE/CD is due to downstream effects of allergic responses. In addition, cross-reactive anti-beef-collagen antibodies (IgG) may explain some rheumatoid arthritis (RA) incidences.|$|E
25|$|Before a {{recipient}} receives a transfusion, compatibility testing between {{donor and recipient}} blood must be done. The first step before a transfusion is given is to type and screen the recipient's blood. Typing of recipient's blood determines the ABO and Rh status. The sample is then screened for any alloantibodies that may react with donor blood. It takes about 45 minutes to complete (depending on the method used). The blood bank scientist also checks for special requirements of the patient (e.g. need for washed, irradiated or CMV negative blood) {{and the history of}} the patient to see if they have previously identified antibodies and any other <b>serological</b> anomalies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Serological</b> {{testing is}} much more {{frequently}} used in areas where leishmaniasis is endemic. A 2014 Cochrane review evaluated different rapid diagnostic tests. One of them (the rK39 immunochromatographic test) gave correct, positive results in 92% of the people with visceral leishmaniasis and it gave correct, negative results in 92% {{of the people who}} did not have the disease. A second rapid test (called latex agglutination test) gave correct, positive results in 64% of the people with the disease and it gave correct, negative results in 93% of the people without the disease. Other types of tests have not been studied thoroughly enough to ascertain their efficacy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>serological</b> {{laboratory}} tests most widely available and employed are the Western blot and ELISA. A two-tiered protocol is {{recommended by the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, {{and if it is}} positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. The reliability of testing in diagnosis remains controversial. Studies show the Western blot IgM has a specificity of 94–96% for people with clinical symptoms of early Lyme disease. The initial ELISA test has a sensitivity of about 70%, and in two-tiered testing, the overall sensitivity is only 64%, although this rises to 100% in the subset of people with disseminated symptoms, such as arthritis.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, human fasciolosis occur {{mainly in}} France, Spain, Portugal, {{and the former}} USSR. France is {{considered}} an important human endemic area. A total of 5863 cases of human fasciolosis were recorded from nine French hospitals from 1970 to 1982. Concerning the former Soviet Union, almost all reported cases were from the Tajik Republic. Several papers referred to human fasciolosis in Turkey. Recently, <b>serological</b> survey of human fasciolosis was performed {{in some parts of}} Turkey. The prevalence of the disease was serologically found to be 3.01% in Antalya Province, and between 0.9 and 6.1% in Isparta Province, Mediterranean region of Turkey. In other European countries, fasciolosis is sporadic and the occurrence of the disease is usually combined with travelling to endemic areas.|$|E
25|$|Serum {{blood tests}} are an {{important}} marker of disease severity, and are also useful for the primary diagnosis of ABPA. When serum IgE is normal (and patients are not being treated by glucocorticoid medications), ABPA is excluded {{as the cause of}} symptoms. A raised IgE increases suspicion, though there is no universally accepted cut-off value. Values can be stated in international units (IU/mL) or ng/mL, where 1 IU is equal to 2.4ng/mL. Since studies began documenting IgE levels in ABPA during the 1970s, various cut-offs between 833–1000 IU/mL have been employed to both exclude ABPA and to warrant further <b>serological</b> testing. Current consensus is that a cut-off of 1000 IU/mL should be employed, as lower values are encountered in SAFS and asthmatic sensitization.|$|E
25|$|In North America, {{the disease}} is very sporadic. In Mexico, 53 cases have been reported. In Central America, fasciolosis is a human health problem in the Caribbean islands, {{especially}} in zones of Puerto Rico and Cuba. Pinar del Río Province and Villa Clara Province are Cuban regions where fasciolosis was hyperendemic. In South America, human fasciolosis {{is a serious problem}} in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. These Andean countries are considered to be the area with the highest prevalence of human fasciolosis in the world. Well-known human hyperendemic areas are localized predominately in the high plain called altiplano. In the Northern Bolivian Altiplano, prevalences detected in some communities were up to 72% and 100% in coprological and <b>serological</b> surveys, respectively. In Peru, F. hepatica in humans occurs throughout the country. The highest prevalences were reported in Arequipa, Mantaro Valley, Cajamarca Valley, and Puno Region. In other South American countries like Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia, human fasciolosis appear to be sporadic, despite the high prevalences of fasciolosis in cattle.|$|E
500|$|With the {{development}} of <b>serological</b> typing, medical researchers were able to sort bacteria into different strains, or types. [...] When a person or test animal (e.g., a mouse) is inoculated with a particular type, an immune response ensues, generating antibodies that react specifically with antigens on the bacteria. [...] Blood serum containing the antibodies can then be extracted and applied to cultured bacteria. [...] The antibodies will react with other bacteria of the same type as the original inoculation. Fred Neufeld, a German bacteriologist, had discovered the pneumococcal types and <b>serological</b> typing; until Frederick Griffith's studies bacteriologists believed that the types were fixed and unchangeable {{from one generation to}} the next.|$|E
500|$|Until the 1980s <b>serological</b> {{tests for}} {{antibodies}} to HSV were rarely useful to diagnosis and not routinely used in clinical practice. [...] The older IgM serologic assay could not differentiate between antibodies generated {{in response to}} HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection. [...] However, a glycoprotein G-specific (IgG) HSV test introduced in the 1980s is more than 98% specific at discriminating HSV-1 from HSV-2.|$|E
500|$|N. {{gonorrhoea}} and C. trachomatis are {{the most}} common organisms. The least common were infections caused exclusively by anaerobes and facultative organisms. Anaerobes and facultative bacteria were also isolated from 50 percent of the patients from whom Chlamydia and Neisseria were recovered; thus, anaerobes and facultative bacteria were present in the upper genital tract of nearly two-thirds of the PID patients. PCR and <b>serological</b> tests have associated extremely fastidious organism with endometritis, PID, and tubal factor infertility. [...] Microorganisms associated with PID are listed below.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{surface antigen}} (HBsAg) is most {{frequently}} used to screen {{for the presence of}} this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection. However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. The infectious virion contains an inner [...] "core particle" [...] enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core particle is made of 180 or 240 copies of the core protein, alternatively known as [...] core antigen, or HBcAg. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies specific to the [...] core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only <b>serological</b> evidence of disease. [...] Therefore, most [...] diagnostic panels contain HBsAg and total anti-HBc (both IgM and IgG).|$|E
500|$|Griffith's experiment, {{reported}} in 1928, identified that some [...] "transforming principle" [...] in pneumococcal bacteria could transform them from one type to another. Griffith, a British medical officer, had spent years applying <b>serological</b> typing to cases of pneumonia, a frequently fatal {{disease in the}} early 20th century. [...] He found that multiple typessome virulent and some non-virulentwere often present {{over the course of}} a clinical case of pneumonia, and thought that one type might change into another (rather than simply multiple types being present all along). [...] In testing that possibility, he found that transformation could occur when dead bacteria of a virulent type and live bacteria of a non-virulent type were both injected in mice: the mice would develop a fatal infection (normally only caused by live bacteria of the virulent type) and die, and virulent bacteria could be isolated from such infected mice.|$|E
500|$|... virus DNA [...] {{persists}} {{in the body}} after infection, and in some people the disease recurs. Although rare, reactivation is seen most often following alcohol or drug use, or in people with impaired immunity. HBV goes through cycles of replication and non-replication. Approximately 50% of overt carriers experience acute reactivation. Males with baseline ALT of 200 UL/L are {{three times more likely}} to develop a reactivation than people with lower levels. Although reactivation can occur spontaneously, people who undergo chemotherapy have a higher risk. [...] Immunosuppressive drugs favor increased HBV replication while inhibiting cytotoxic T cell function in the liver. The risk of reactivation varies depending on the <b>serological</b> profile; those with detectable HBsAg in their blood are at the greatest risk, but those with only antibodies to the core antigen are also at risk. The presence of antibodies to the surface antigen, which are considered to be a marker of immunity, does not preclude reactivation. [...] Treatment with prophylactic antiviral drugs can prevent the serious morbidity associated with HBV disease reactivation.|$|E
500|$|Moderate {{or heavy}} {{clinical}} infection of fish with whirling disease can be presumptively diagnosed {{on the basis}} of changes in behavior and appearance about 35 to 80 days after initial infection, though [...] "injury or deficiency in dietary tryptophan and ascorbic acid can evoke similar signs", so conclusive diagnosis may require finding myxospores in the fish's cartilage. [...] In heavy infections, only examining cartilage microscopically may be needed to find spores. In less severe infections, the most common test involves digestion of the cranial cartilage with the proteases pepsin and trypsin (pepsin-trypsin digest—PTD) before looking for spores. [...] The head and other tissues can be further examined using histopathology to confirm whether the location and morphology of the spores matches what is known for M. cerebralis. <b>Serological</b> identification of spores in tissue sections using an antibody raised against the spores is also possible. [...] Parasite identity can also be confirmed using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the 415 base pair 18S rRNA gene from M. cerebralis. Fish should be screened at the life stage most susceptible to the parasites, with particular focus on fish in aquaculture units.|$|E
