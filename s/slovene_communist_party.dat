40|$|Precis The Bachelor's Thesis "Slovenian Road to Independence and its Milestones" {{deals with}} the process of democratization and {{independence}} of Slovenia during the years 1986 to 1991. After the summary of the country development within the Habsburg monarchy and then in Yugoslavia the thesis focuses on the events after 1986 as a crucial milestone of the Slovenian road to independence. In Slovenia won in 1986 in <b>Slovene</b> <b>communist</b> <b>party</b> liberal wing led by Milan Kučan, advocating a democratic political system and gradual economic reforms. In Serbia became one year later the leader of the Serbian communist party Slobodan Miloševič, the propagator of the idea of Great Serbia. In Serbia thus won a conception of a centralized state based on nationalism. In this situation, {{it was not possible to}} agree on the basic functioning of the federation, let alone the future orientation of Yugoslavia. After the Yugoslav People's Army took up Serbian's quarrel and began to militarily threaten Slovenia, there had been a gradual convergence of Ljubljana government with the opposition, which culminated in January 1989 when the <b>Slovene</b> <b>communist</b> <b>party</b> renounced its political monopoly.

After the Congress of Livorno of 1921, {{when most of the}} socialists of Trieste and the Julian March, both Italian and <b>Slovene,</b> joined the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Italy, he withdrew from active politics. During the Fascist regime, he remained faithful to his democratic principles, although refusing to engage in any subversive action.

As the very existence of the Slovene nation was threatened, the Slovene support for the Partisan movement was much more solid than in Croatia or Serbia. An emphasis on the defence of ethnic identity was shown by naming the troops after important Slovene poets and writers, following the example of the Ivan Cankar battalion. Slovene Partisans were the armed wing of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation, a resistance political organization and party coalition for what the Partisans referred to as the Slovene Lands. The Liberation Front was founded and directed by the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Yugoslavia (KPJ), more specifically its <b>Slovene</b> branch: the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Slovenia.|$|R
40|$|This book {{focuses on}} the Yugoslav nation {{building}} project in the 1950 s. The author argues that after World War Two, the Yugoslav Communist, in compliance with Marxist-Leninist though, tried to build a Yugoslav socialist nation. This became visible especially after the Tito-Stalin split in 1948 when the Cominform countries sought to harm Yugoslavia by instigating internal national frictions. This pushed the Communist Party of Yugoslavia {{to speed up the}} project inherent in the thesis of "the merging of nations" by trying to abolish national conflicts and create a Yugoslav socialist nation. This process can be seen in several different fields: the creation of the Serbo-Croatian standard language in 1954, the attempts to define Yugoslav culture and by bringing a "Yugoslav" category into the national census of 1953. In addition, Yugoslavism was promoted in schools, literature and popular culture. With the constitutional reform of 1953, the Party downgraded the republics' role, which was accentuated by the new commune economic system of 1956. The Party also used other methods, like rewriting history, reshaping memory, building Yugoslav institutions, etc. All of this was necessary to fit Edvard Kardelj's definition of nation. Kardelj proceeded from Stalin's definition of a nation, adding social division of labor as an additional criterion. Through careful research of stenographical records of the Yugoslav and <b>Slovene</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and of printed media, the author argues that Socialist Yugoslavism had a clear national connotation and that Slovene Communists started to oppose this project by the late 1950 s.
