5000|$|For {{the next}} forty years, from 1939 until 1979, the New York Cocoa Exchange {{was one of}} the primary tenants in the Beaver Building, with the trading room on the first story and mezzanine. The Cocoa Exchange was {{established}} in New York in 1925 (at 124 Water Street), by cocoa users seeking to eliminate risk due to price fluctuations, as the world's first cocoa futures market. As the production and consumption of cocoa and chocolate products expanded rapidly in the twentieth century and cocoa developed as a leading international commodity, the United States emerged as the world's largest cocoa consumer. When the Cocoa Exchange moved into the Beaver Building in April 1931, the New York Times noted that [...] "the Exchange has grown to be the largest market {{of its kind in the}} world, and transactions on its floor usually equal and frequently have exceeded the world's crop of cocoa." [...] Many of the other commodities exchanges were also located in the immediate vicinity of Beaver and Broad Streets at this time. The Beaver Building additionally housed a number of commercial tenants and organizations associated with the cocoa industry over the years, including the New York Cocoa Clearing Association and Cocoa Merchants Association of America. The Cocoa Exchange moved from the Beaver Building to new quarters (127 John Street) in 1972; it merged with the New York Coffee & <b>Sugar</b> <b>Exchange</b> to form the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in 1979.|$|E
40|$|The product {{sugar is}} studied in detail with special {{emphasis}} on supply and demand factors, {{in an attempt to}} better understand the abnormal sugar market of 1963 - 1964. The unusual market fluctuations of that period appear to have been initiated by a statistical imbalance in world supply and demand of sugar. The extent of price fluctuations {{in the united states during}} 1963 - 1964 we accentuated by the inability of current sugar legislation to shield the U. S. market from the world market, and by the openly aggressive purchasing policies followed by the U. S. department of agriculture which further aggravated an already thin and inflated world sugar market. There is also evidence that excessive market activity on the New York Coffee and <b>Sugar</b> <b>Exchange</b> by the nonprofessional group of buyers contributed additional instability to the sugar market, along with the scare buying and hoarding which were common in the U.

40|$|Background: Preterm {{birth is}} one of the major factors {{responsible}} for neonatal mortality and morbidity. In this study, we have to see the role of various tocolytics in preventing preterm labour. Methods: The observational study was conducted on 200 patients admitted in Upper India <b>Sugar</b> <b>Exchange</b> Maternity Hospital, Kanpur. Results: In our study calcium channel blocker were associated with statistically and clinically significantly better neonatal outcome and fewer maternal side effects than any other tocolytic. So calcium channel blocker would be preferred first line tocolytic with regard to several important outcomes. Conclusions: Preterm birth continued to be problem for obstetrician. Administration of short term tocolytic agents can prolong pregnancy for women in pre-term labor. Prolonging pregnancy may have benefits because it allows for other proven interventions, such as antenatal corticosteroid administration to be accomplished. The reviews proven an overview currently utilize tocolytic agents and the evidence of demonstrating their efficacy for prolonging pregnancy by at least 48 hours.

25|$|The carbon-bonded {{hydrogen}} {{isotopic composition}} of cellulose, as inherited from leaf water, {{has the potential}} of preserving the original meteoric water signal. This was first demonstrated in the 1970s. In a systematic survey across North America, tree cellulose δD was found to have a temperature sensitivity of 5.8‰/°C, similar to precipitation δD sensitivity of 5.6‰/°C. This spatial correlation may be complicated by local effects of soil evaporation and leaf transpiration, and the spatial gradient may not be representative of temporal changes in tree ring cellulose at a single place. The mechanism that generates the δD signal in cellulose from meteoric water is not completely understood, but at least includes leaf water transpiration, synthesis of carbohydrates, synthesis of cellulose from photosynthetic <b>sugars,</b> and <b>exchange</b> of <b>sugars</b> with xylem water. Modeling studies show that observed tree ring cellulose δD can be produced when 36% of the hydrogen in <b>sugars</b> can <b>exchange</b> with xylem water, and effects such as humidity and rainfall seasonality may complicate the cellulose δD proxy. Despite these complications, tree ring δD have been used for paleoclimate reconstructions of the past few millennia. For example, a tree ring cellulose δD records from pine trees in the White Mountains, California shows a 50‰ depletion from 6800 year ago to present. The cooling trend since the mid-Holocene thermal maximum is consistent with ice core and pollen records, but the corresponding magnitude of cooling is elusive due to complicated influences from local effects such as humidity and soil water composition.

40|$|Background: Hypertension {{is one of}} the commonest medical {{complications}} {{during pregnancy}} and a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of color Doppler in predicting pregnancy induced hypertension at early gestation by assessing blood flow velocity profile and to assess the role of antioxidants in reducing the oxidative stress of the disease by their effect on pregnancy outcome. Methods: The study was carried as a blind prospective study in 310 antenatal patients attending the outpatient department and indoor cases of upper India <b>sugar</b> <b>exchange</b> maternity hospital, GSVM Medical College, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India for a period of 18 months. Results: Early trimester colour Doppler ultrasonography has an excellent role to play as a predictor of pregnancy induced hypertension.

40|$|The blood-perfused choroid plexuses {{from the}} lateral ventricles {{of the sheep}} were used to {{determine}} the nature of <b>sugar</b> <b>exchanges</b> between blood and cerebrospinal fluid (c. s. f.). There was a net entry of sugars from blood to c. s. f. at all concentrations of sugars which were used and this net entry was seen when the sugars were measured either directly by enzymic analysis or by the use of isotopically labelled sugars. From competition experiments the order of affinity of the transporting system from both blood to c. s. f. and c. s. f. to blood was the same, i. e. 2 -deoxy-D-glucose much greater than D-glucose greater than 3 -O-methyl-D-glucose much greater than D-galactose. The transport of sugars from c. s. f. to blood and blood to c. s. f. consists in both cases of a non-saturable and a saturable component. However, the affinity of the two systems is markedly different, the blood to c. s. f. being a system of low affinity and high capacity while that of the c. s. f. to blood has a high affinity and a low capacity. The concentration of glucose in the newly formed c. s. f. was estimated from the rate of c. s. f. secretion and the net flux of glucose across the choroid plexus. The concentration of glucose in this fluid was some 45 - 60 % of that in plasma and so the low glucose concentration observed in bulk c. s. f. would appear to be a result of the entry process and not that of cerebral metabolism...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{acquisition}} of photosynthesis by eukaryotic cells through enslavement of a cyanobacterium {{represents one of}} the most remarkable turning points in the history of life on Earth. In addition to endosymbiotic gene transfer, the {{acquisition of}} a protein import apparatus and the coordination of gene expression between host and endosymbiont genomes, the establishment of a metabolic connection was crucial for a functional endosymbiosis. It was previously hypothesized that the first metabolic connection between both partners of endosymbiosis was achieved through insertion of a host-derived metabolite transporter into the cyanobacterial plasma membrane. Reconstruction of starch metabolism in the common ancestor of photosynthetic eukaryotes suggested that ADP-glucose, a bacterial specific metabolite, was likely to be the photosynthate which was exported from the early cyanobiont. However, extant plastid transporters that have evolved from host-derived endomembrane transporters do not transport ADP-glucose but simple phosphorylated <b>sugars</b> in <b>exchange</b> for orthophosphate. We now show that those eukaryotic nucleotide sugar transporters, which define the closest relatives to the common ancestor of extant plastid envelope carbon translocators, possess an innate ability for transporting ADP-glucose.

40|$|International audiencePlants are {{exemplified}} by high plasticity in resource allocation strategies which {{allows them to}} maximize their fitness under changing resource conditions. In many plant species, obtaining resources involves mutualistic interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), where plants provide the AMF with <b>sugars</b> in <b>exchange</b> for soil nutrients like phosphorus (P). These nutrient exchange rates have high context dependency, influenced by both the cooperative level of the AMF species involved (a qualitative trait) and the ambient nutrient concentrations in the soil (a quantitative value). Because this context dependency arises from a mix of both quantitative and qualitative factors, standard ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling methods often complicate the representation of resource allocation strategies. Here, we explore the utility of a hybrid automata modeling framework that can intuitively combine the qualitative AMF traits and quantitative nutrient concentrations. This allows for a better analysis and understanding of phenotypic plasticity in resource allocation in the plant–AMF, and other nutrient exchange mutualisms. We consider a focal strategy in which nutrients are allocated to growth at times of nutrient limitations, and to storage otherwise and ask how this changes plant allocation to growth vs. storage. We first model this system dynamically {{to show how the}} plant responds to different environmental conditions and interacts with AMF and show that our hybrid automata model can replicate experimental data from the plant–AMF system. From our work, novel perceptions into the well-studied plant–AMF symbiosis and testable hypotheses can be underlined: (1) leaf biomass does not increase proportionally with the level of AMF cooperation; (2) in the context of multiple AMF simultaneously colonizing a host–plant, a narrow variance of response is observed and explained by an auction-like mechanism of the AMF to acquire C from the plant...|$|R
