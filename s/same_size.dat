5|$|Despite {{periodic}} fluctuations, populations remain {{roughly the}} <b>same</b> <b>size</b> (fact).|$|E
5|$|Being {{relatively}} small, Knoetschkesuchus {{would have}} mainly fed on invertebrates and possibly small vertebrates (including amphibians and mammals). The same diet is observed in modern juvenile crocodilians of the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> class.|$|E
5|$|It {{is among}} the most sexually dimorphic of all cetaceans. At birth both sexes are about the <b>same</b> <b>size,</b> but mature males are {{typically}} 30% to 50% longer and three times as massive as females.|$|E

50|$|The four modern {{horseshoe}} crabs are {{of roughly}} the <b>same</b> <b>sizes,</b> with females measuring up to 60 cm {{in length and}} 5 kg in weight.|$|R
5|$|Kepler-10 is a G-type star located 173 parsecs (564 light years) from Earth. It is 0.895 {{solar masses}} and 1.056 solar radii, making it {{slightly}} less massive than the Sun, but approximately the <b>same</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pugs {{that live}} a mostly {{sedentary}} {{life can be}} prone to obesity, though this is avoidable with regular exercise and a healthy diet. The median life span of Pugs is 11 years, which {{is in line with}} other breeds of the <b>same</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the maturation of the reproductive organs {{and the production}} of gametes and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> and thus age.|$|E
50|$|The Swedish and German D series {{basically}} {{contain the}} <b>same</b> <b>sizes,</b> but are offset by one, i.e. DIN D4 equals SIS D5 and so on.|$|R

50|$|VA {{ratings are}} also {{often used for}} transformers; maximum output current is then VA rating divided by nominal output voltage. Transformers with the <b>same</b> <b>sized</b> core usually have the same VA rating.|$|R
5|$|Also {{called the}} Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus, this species was {{originally}} classified as Hippopotamus along with H. lemerlei, {{and indeed the}} two species were roughly the <b>same</b> <b>size.</b> A review of their morphology and habitat, however, suggested a closer relationship to the modern pygmy hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|An ancient {{solution}} to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time, without singularities. All of the self-similar solutions that shrink or stay the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense; they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing the self-similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim reaper, and Abreschâ€“Langer curves are all ancient solutions.|$|E
5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy {{may be the}} <b>same</b> <b>size</b> as the Milky Way but has {{a visible}} star count of only 1% of the Milky Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} is {{because there is a}} lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{flag of the}} College {{is three}} <b>same</b> <b>sized</b> strips of clothes in blue and white. The white colour {{is in the middle}} while blue colour is on either side. On the white strip of cloth is placed the crest of the College.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966, coins were {{introduced}} {{in the name of}} Qatar and Dubai for 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 dirham. In 1973, a new series of coins was introduced in the <b>same</b> <b>sizes</b> and compositions as the earlier pieces but in the name of Qatar only.|$|R
6000|$|... "And," [...] said Claude, smiling, [...] "the {{descendants}} of mediaeval trout snap at the {{descendants of}} mediaeval flies, spinning about upon just the <b>same</b> <b>sized</b> and coloured wings on which their forefathers spun a thousand years ago; having become, in all that while, neither bigger nor wiser." ...|$|R
5|$|Both of the mansion's {{two floors}} consist of four large rooms with high ceilings, {{and each of}} these rooms is exactly the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> and shape. A grand {{stairway}} {{is located at the}} end of the mansion's central hall, extending from the first floor to the attic. The stairway's handrail is crafted of walnut, and it is connected to the stairway's shallow steps by a balustrade consisting of three small balusters per step.|$|E
5|$|Chickenpox was {{commonly}} {{confused with}} smallpox {{in the immediate}} post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption: smallpox pustules are all very nearly the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.|$|E
5|$|Colonels wore three gold {{stars of}} the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> on their collar; the same as generals, but without the wreath. While {{lieutenant}} colonels wore two stars on their collars, majors wore one star, which {{was placed in the}} middle of the collar. Captains had three gold horizontal bars, first lieutenants wore two bars, and second lieutenants wore one bar. However, the Confederate Congress often created new commissions, and did not always standardize rank insignia immediately.|$|E
50|$|The 12 cm type is a {{standard}} DVD, and the 8 cm variety {{is known as a}} MiniDVD. These are the <b>same</b> <b>sizes</b> as {{a standard}} CD and a mini-CD, respectively. The capacity by surface (MiB/cm2) varies from 6.92 MiB/cm2 in the DVD-1 to 18.0 MiB/cm2 in the DVD-18.|$|R
50|$|Friction Volkswagen Beetles and Porsches and {{different}} kinds of trucks also appeared in about the <b>same</b> <b>sizes.</b> Some of the truck offerings, among them a cement mixer, a tow truck, a log hauling truck, a forklift and a dump truck. These were about the same length as the cars discussed above.|$|R
40|$|For {{the weight}} saving {{potential}} analysis, a novel anisogrid structure concept and an orthogrid structure, both with load bearing skin, are sized and compared for different pure and combined load cases with the <b>same</b> <b>sizing</b> criteria including panel stiffness, strength criteria, local skin and stiffener stability and global panel stability...|$|R
5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> as the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only {{a small percentage of}} these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E
5|$|Fewer deck {{officers}} are employed on bulkers than on similarly sized ships of other types. A mini-bulker carries {{two to three}} deck officers, while larger Handysize and Capesize bulkers carry four. Liquid natural gas tankers of the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> have an additional deck officer and unlicensed mariner.|$|E
5|$|Fossil (or subfossil) black {{vultures}} cannot {{necessarily be}} attributed to the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information: the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative. Thus, in 1968, Hildegarde Howard separated the Mexican birds as Coragyps occidentalis mexicanus as opposed to the birds from locations farther north (such as Rancho La Brea) which constituted the nominate subspecies C. o. occidentalis. The southern birds were of the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> as present-day north black vultures and can only be distinguished by their somewhat stouter tarsometatarsus and the flatter and wider bills, and even then only with any certainty if the location where the fossils were found is known. As the Pleistocene and current black vultures form an evolutionary continuum rather than splitting into two or more lineages, some include the Pleistocene taxa in C. atratus.|$|E
50|$|Pirelli Diablo Rosso tyres are {{fitted in}} the <b>same</b> <b>sizes</b> {{used on the}} Hypermotard 1100, but the 796 uses less substantial, {{non-adjustable}} 43 mm Marzocchi forks and has Sachs rear suspension. The single-sided swinging arm and fold-out mirrors of the 1100 model are retained. The aluminium wheels are made by Enkei.|$|R
50|$|Women's shinty is a sport, played {{almost entirely}} within Scotland, {{identical}} to the men's game - with the <b>same</b> rules, <b>same</b> <b>sized</b> pitch and <b>same</b> equipment. However, its history is significantly different. Social pressures - along with the broader game's self-image - resulted in a largely hidden history until comparatively recently.|$|R
5000|$|Shark {{barriers}} work on {{the principle}} of excluding sharks from a designated swimming area. Shark barriers form an [...] "underwater fence" [...] from seabed-to-surface, beach-to-beach. Shark barriers are seen as a more environmentally friendly option as they largely avoid bycatch, however they cannot protect the <b>same</b> <b>sized</b> area as culling methods.|$|R
5|$|Haumea (43.13AU average) is in {{an orbit}} similar to Makemake except {{that it is in}} a 7:12 orbital {{resonance}} with Neptune. It is about the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> as Makemake and has two natural satellites. A rapid, 3.9-hour rotation gives it a flattened and elongated shape. It was named and designated a dwarf planet in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{tuition fees}} are capped at Â£9,250 {{a year for}} UK and EU students, with around 76% of all {{institutions}} charging the full amount in 2015-16. A loan of the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> is available for most universities, although students of private institutions are only eligible for Â£6,000 a year loans.|$|E
5|$|Just {{as it is}} {{possible}} for a circle to be surrounded by six congruent circles that touch it, it is also possible to arrange seven congruent Reuleaux triangles so that they all make contact with a central Reuleaux triangle of the <b>same</b> <b>size.</b> This is the maximum number possible for any curve of constant width.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates {{is in terms of}} size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the <b>same</b> body <b>size,</b> and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the <b>same</b> body <b>size.</b>|$|R
50|$|Desertification often causes rural {{lands to}} become unable {{to support the}} <b>same</b> <b>sized</b> populations that {{previously}} lived there. This results in mass migrations out of rural areas and into urban areas, particularly in Africa. These migrations into the cities often cause large numbers of unemployed people, who end up living in slums.|$|R
50|$|In 1908, Edison {{introduced}} {{a new line of}} cylinders (called Amberol) playing 4 rather than 2 minutes of music on the <b>same</b> <b>sized</b> record, achieved by shrinking the grooves and spacing them twice as close together. New machines were sold to play these records, as were attachments for modifying existing Edison phonographs.|$|R
