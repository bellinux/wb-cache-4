25|$|The Green Goblin {{sits at a}} piano {{at the top of}} the Chrysler Building and humorously boasts to the {{audience}} of his plan to destroy New York City ("I'll Take Manhattan"). Spider-Man arrives ready to fight, but is soon unmasked when the Goblin reveals he knows Spider-Man's true identity. Peter attempts to revive the good-natured Norman within the Goblin, but to no avail. Peter engages the Goblin in combat, but before he can finish him the Goblin reveals that he has Mary Jane, who now dangles from the Chrysler Building. A flying battle over {{the audience}} takes place and when it seems all hope is lost, Spider-Man webs the Green Goblin to his piano. The Green Goblin, not realizing this, thrusts the piano over the side of the Chrysler Building, taking him down to his death. After Spider-Man saves Mary Jane, she tells him not to leave and reveals that she has guessed who he is. Peter removes his mask and they embrace. The two contemplate their new life together before sirens begin wailing and Spider-Man <b>swings</b> <b>away</b> ("Finale: A New Dawn").|$|E
25|$|Arachne kidnaps Mary Jane, and the Geek Chorus appears once again. They {{argue about}} who Spider-Man's true nemesis is, {{the one he}} can never beat, with some {{thinking}} it must be MJ. But Miss Arrow assures them that it is Arachne, since she is an expert of weaving illusion. Back in the story, we see that Miss Arrow is right: Arachne has trapped Peter in her giant web. MJ is suspended in a cocoon and will die unless Peter pledges to be with Arachne, to share her darkness forever ("Love Me or Kill Me*"). They fight, and eventually Peter agrees to be with Arachne if it means saving MJ. Arachne has a sudden change of heart, realizing {{that there is still}} humanity left in the curse of the spider. She finds her own humanity and spares MJ's life. Arachne spares Peter of a life with her, as she knows he will always only love MJ and will never truly be hers; but in realizing his humanity, she has found her own and is released of her burden of darkness in the shadows. Peter watches as Arachne ascends into the heavens by the same piece of thread she used to take her life. With his suit at the Daily Bugle, MJ sees Peter and finally realizes his secret. She agrees to stand by him as sirens begin wailing and Peter <b>swings</b> <b>away</b> ("Finale").|$|E

2500|$|The {{surface of}} Mars {{has a very}} low thermal inertia, which means it heats quickly when the sun shines on it. Typical daily {{temperature}} <b>swings,</b> <b>away</b> from the polar regions, are around 100K. On Earth, winds often develop in areas where thermal inertia changes suddenly, such as from sea to land. There are no seas on Mars, but there are areas where the thermal inertia of the soil changes, leading to morning and evening winds akin to the sea breezes on Earth. The Antares [...] project [...] "Mars Small-Scale Weather" [...] (MSW) has recently identified some minor weaknesses in current global climate models (GCMs) due to the GCMs' more primitive soil modeling [...] "heat admission {{to the ground and}} back is quite important in Mars, so soil schemes have to be quite accurate. [...] " [...] Those weaknesses are being corrected and should lead to more accurate future assessments, but make continued reliance on older predictions of modeled Martian climate somewhat problematic.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Cape Point is not {{the fixed}} [...] "meeting point" [...] of the cold Benguela Current, running northwards along {{the west coast of}} Africa, and the warm Agulhas Current, running south from the equator along the east coast of Africa. In fact the south flowing Agulhas Current <b>swings</b> <b>away</b> from the African {{coastline}} between about East London and Port Elizabeth, from where it follows the edge of the Continental shelf roughly as far as the southern tip of the Agulhas Bank, 250km (155miles) south of Cape Agulhas. From there it is retroflexed (turned sharply round) in an easterly direction by the South Atlantic, South Indian and Southern Ocean currents, known as the [...] "West Wind Drift", which flow eastwards round Antarctica. The Benguela Current, on the other hand, is an upwelling current which brings cold, mineral-rich water from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to the surface along the west coast of Southern Africa. Having reached the surface it flows northwards {{as a result of the}} prevailing wind and Coriolis forces. The Benguela Current, therefore, effectively starts at Cape Point, and flows northwards from there, [...] although further out to sea it is joined by surface water that has crossed the South Atlantic from South America as part of the South Atlantic Gyre. [...] Thus the Benguela and Agulhas currents do not strictly [...] "meet" [...] anywhere, although eddies from the Agulhas current do from time to time round the Cape to join the Benguela Current.|$|E
