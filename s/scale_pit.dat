James Ennis, who was well known in Cuba hotel circles, as the managing director. Lansky's official title was [...] "kitchen director," [...] but he controlled every aspect of the hotel, especially the casino which was operated by Frank Erickson, Giordino Cellini, Ed Levenson and Dusty Peters. He had initially appointed Dino Cellini from Ohio to run the casino but replaced him with Erickson who was serving as Frank Costello’s representative in Cuba. Since Cubans had never been trained for gambling operations on such a large <b>scale,</b> <b>pit</b> bosses, dealers and stickmen were brought from the States as [...] "technicians" [...] and in that category were allowed to stay on two-year visas. These men, veterans of the working class of illicit U.S. gambling, eventually turned into tutors for the Cubans. The casino would make over $3 million in its first four months of operation.|$|E
40|$|Lava caves {{could be}} useful as {{outposts}} for the human exploration of the Moon. Lava caves or lava tubes are formed when the external surface of the lava flows cools more quickly to make a hardened crust over subsurface lava flows. The lava flow eventually ceases and drains out of the tube, leaving an empty space. The frail part of the ceiling of lava tube could collapse to expose {{the entrance to the}} lava tubes which is called a pit crater. Several pit craters with the diameter of around 100 meters have been found by analyzing the data of SELENE and LRO lunar missions. It is hard to use these pit craters for outposts since these are too large in scale. In this study, small <b>scale</b> <b>pit</b> craters which are fit for outposts have been investigated using the NAC image data of LROC. Several topographic patterns which are believed to be lunar caves have been found and the similar pit craters of the Earth were compared and analyzed to identify caves. For this analysis, the image data of satellites and aerial photographs are collected and classified to construct a database. Several pit craters analogous to lunar pit craters were derived and a morphological pit crater model was generated using the 3 D printer based on this database...|$|E
40|$|Design of {{open pit}} slope angles is {{becoming}} more and more important as the mining depths of open pits continuously increase. Small changes in the overall pit slope angle have large consequences on the overall economy of the mining operation. A case in particular is the Aitik open pit mine in northern Sweden, which currently faces the design of the overall slope angles for continued mining toward a depth of around 500 meters. This report constitutes the first phase in a research project aimed at developing design methods for large <b>scale</b> <b>pit</b> slopes. In this report, the stability and design of large <b>scale</b> <b>pit</b> slopes in open pit mining is reviewed, with special reference to slopes in hard, jointed, rocks, similar to the rock types found at the Aitik mine. The review covers the mechanics of pit slopes, existing design methods for large scale slopes, remedial measures and mining strategy to cope with slope failures, and a compilation of case studies from open pits worldwide. Finally, suggestions for future research in this area are presented. The factors governing large scale slope stability are primarily: (1) the stress conditions in the pit slopes, including the effects of groundwater, (2) the geological structure, in particular the presence of large scale features, (3) the pit geometry, and (4) the rock mass strength. Observed failure modes in rock slopes are of a wide variety. On a bench scale, structurally controlled failures such as plane shear and wedge failures are common. However, as the scale increases, simple structurally controlled failures are less dominate, and more complex failures such as step-path failures start to develop. From observations, it appears that for large scale slopes, two failure modes are especially important to consider. These are (1) rotational shear failure, and (2) large scale toppling failure. Rotational shear failure in a large scale slope involves failure both along pre-existing discontinuities and through intact rock bridges, but where the overall failure surface follows a curved path. Large scale (or deep seated) toppling failures have been observed in several large scale natural slopes and high open pit slopes. The mechanisms behind large scale failures are, however, not well known, in particular for hard, strong rocks. Criteria for the shape and location of the failure surface are lacking, as is detailed knowledge regarding failure through intact rock versus failure along discontinuities. Knowledge of the kinetic behavior of failing rock slopes is mostly empirical and requires more studies, in particular for hard and brittle rock masses in which rapid failures can be expected. This review has shown that the strength of a large scale rock mass is very difficult to assess. At the same time, the required accuracy for the strength parameters which are needed for the design is very high. For large scale rock masses, back-analysis of previous failures proves to be the only practical means of obtaining relevant strength parameters. However, the interpretation and translation of such data from one geological environment to another, is very cumbersome and lined with problems. Design methods for rock slopes can divided into mainly four categories, namely: (1) limit equilibrium methods, (2) numerical modeling, (3) empirical methods, and (4) probabilistic methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are discussed in the review. For the design of large scale slopes, it appears that the choice of design method is less important than the choice of input parameters to the design, in particular the rock mass strength parameters. Remedial measures for controlling the stability of slope include support and drainage. While support can work for small scale slopes, only drainage is feasible for increasing the stability of large scale slopes. Monitoring of displacements, preferably using survey networks, should be carried out routinely in all open pit mining. Provided that the failure is slow and stable, it is also possible to continue to mine a failing slope. This requires that contingency plans are being made at an early stage in the mine planning process. From the collection of a number of case studies from North and South America, Africa, Asia and Europe, several examples of large scale failures were found, although mostly occurring in weak rocks. There are much fewer examples of slope failures in hard, brittle rocks. The few cases found indicate that failures in this type of rock is more uncontrollable. A compilation of slope height, slope angles, rock strength, and stability conditions for the studied cases concludes this chapter. Future research in the field of large scale slope design must be focused on quantifying the mechanisms for large scale slope failures. Once the mechanisms are better known, design methods based on the actual slope mechanics can be employed. Also, better and more reliable methods for determining the strength of large scale rock masses are important to develop. Godkänd; 1996; 20080527 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany {{studies showed}} that Fe and Al oxides {{stabilise}} organic carbon (OC) in soil. However, none of them examined the influence of spatial scale on the relations linking OC to metal oxides in soil.

The aim {{of the study was to}} compare OC-metal relationships at two spatial scales: the field <b>scale</b> and pedological <b>pit</b> <b>scale.</b> The conceptual approach included sampling of soil horizons from 27 pits to a depth of 2 m in a 22 ha area. At <b>pit</b> <b>scale,</b> 146 samples were collected from a grid over the surface of a selected profile to obtain a high spatial resolution. Samples were analyzed for OC, Fe, Al, and Si originating from amorphous and crystalline oxides. For both sampling scales, relations between OC and metal oxides were statistically investigated per profile and per single horizon. We observed positive relationships involving amorphous Fe and Al oxides for horizons at <b>pit</b> <b>scale</b> suggesting that at this scale amorphous metal oxides may be involved in processes leading to OC storage in near neutral soils. However, such relationships were no longer observable at field scale. These results show that at larger scales, where the abundance of controls for OC storage is increasing, the empirical relationships established at <b>pit</b> <b>scale</b> are not powerful enough to predict the behaviour of a whole landscape. Mechanistic knowledge established at <b>pit</b> <b>scale</b> may thus not easily be scaled up in soils where interaction with metal oxides is not the only control on OC storage...|$|R

However, there are few anti-icing techniques for insulators which consume energy or manpower. Considering the water repelling property, the superhydrophobic surface is introduced for anti-icing of insulators. Among the icing forms, the glaze icing owns the highest density, strongest adhesion, and greatest risk to the power transmission system but lacks researches on superhydrophobic surface. In this paper, superhydrophobic surfaces with contact angle of 166. 4 °, contact angle hysteresis of 0. 9 °, and sliding angle of less than 1 ° are prepared by nanoparticle filling combined with etching method. The coated glass slide and glass insulator showed excellent anti-icing performance in the glaze icing test at − 5 °C.

The tests in a steel plant have demonstrated, that the magnetic filtration with the electromagnetic filter and also with a permanent magnetic filter is successful for clarifiction of waste water from VOD-plants. The impurities can be separated as a mud with concentrations of Fe-oxides of 100 g/l. Great magnetic filters with electromagnetic circuits are more economical as such with permanent magnetic circuits.
