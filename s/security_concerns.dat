5|$|Lansdale had <b>security</b> <b>concerns</b> {{about the}} head of the weapons laboratory, J. Robert Oppenheimer, because of his {{communist}} connections, but Lansdale and Groves agreed that Oppenheimer was loyal and cooperative on security matters. Nonetheless, Lansdale had Oppenheimer's movements followed, his telephones tapped, and his mail opened. Lansdale interrogated Oppenheimer over the latter's relationship with Haakon Chevalier.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a pattern representation of <b>security</b> <b>concern</b> solutions and their interactions that support aspect-oriented risk-driven development (AORDD). <b>Security</b> <b>concern</b> solutions are specified {{early in the}} development process, using UML as a rigorous notation for sets of patterns. A profile consisting of stereotypes and tagged values supports <b>security</b> <b>concern</b> requirement traceability throughout solution design refinement. The profile also supports riskdriven analysis. The additional concepts {{that are part of}} the risk-driven analysis component of AORDD are described in this paper, and the use of profile tags in this analysis is explained. ...|$|R

5|$|The ACLU was at {{the center}} of several legal aspects of the Vietnam war: {{defending}} draft resisters, challenging the constitutionality of the war, the potential impeachment of Richard Nixon, and the use of national <b>security</b> <b>concerns</b> to preemptively censor newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Although no HV attack {{occurred}} in the area during the UNPROFOR mandate, elements of the plan were used by the 3rd Battalion of the PPCLI as the HV clashed with the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK) in the January 1993 Operation Maslenica. The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI implemented the plan in March 1993 to demonstrate UNPROFOR resolve. The UNPROFOR Sector West deputy commander considered the plan impractical except for deterrence, due to <b>security</b> <b>concerns.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the appeal}} hearing at the {{regional}} court in Dresden, in the morning 1 July 2009, nine people {{were present in the}} courtroom: three judges, the prosecutor, Wiens as the defendant, his court-appointed defence counsel, El-Sherbini as witness for the prosecution, and her husband and son as observers. No security personnel were present and no security searches of individuals and their possessions were carried out; this was a common procedure for cases without anticipated <b>security</b> <b>concerns</b> or detained persons present.|$|E

5|$|David Childs, one of Silverstein's {{favorite}} architects, {{joined the}} project after Silverstein {{urged him to}} do so. He developed a design proposal for One World Trade Center, initially collaborating with Daniel Libeskind. In May 2005, Childs revised the design to address <b>security</b> <b>concerns.</b> He is {{the architect of the}} tower, and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day design and development.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states. For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because many {{do not want to}} live in the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over <b>security</b> <b>concerns</b> that the city would not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency.|$|E
5|$|Inside the LBC, {{visitors}} {{pass through}} a number of exhibits about the bell before reaching the Liberty Bell itself. Due to <b>security</b> <b>concerns</b> following an attack on the bell by a visitor with a hammer in 2001, the bell is hung out of easy reach of visitors, who are no longer allowed to touch it, and all visitors undergo a security screening.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>security</b> <b>concern</b> is {{when the}} {{implemented}} specifications are ill-designed and allow for security compromise. Because Wine implements these specs, it will also implement any security vulnerabilities they contain.|$|R
50|$|The 19th {{national}} congress was originally {{planned to be}} held on 29 September 2013 at National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei, but later changed to Taichung due to <b>security</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|R
40|$|In 1976, Diffie and Hellman {{in their}} path {{breaking}} paper [5] proposed a two party key agreement protocol based on finite field. Diffie – Hellman Key Exchange Protocol [DH protocol] has unique importance in two party wireless communication scenarios. After this protocol several protocols have been proposed which were based on DH protocol but the Man in the middle attack raises a serious <b>security</b> <b>concern</b> on this protocol. Researchers have been working to overcome this <b>security</b> <b>concern</b> to design a new protocol. This paper proposes an authenticated key agreement protocol which is secure against Man in the middle attack. The authors also prove security issues of this protocol...|$|R
5|$|On 8 October 1991, as the {{independence}} declaration moratorium expired, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. That particular {{session of the}} parliament {{was held in the}} INA building on Pavao Šubić Avenue in Zagreb due to <b>security</b> <b>concerns</b> provoked by the recent air raid; Specifically, it was feared that the Yugoslav Air Force might attack the parliament building.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2004 the {{monument}} closed for a $15 million renovation, which included numerous security upgrades and redesign of {{the monument}} grounds by landscape architect Laurie Olin. The renovations were due partly to <b>security</b> <b>concerns</b> following the September 11 attacks {{and the start of}} the War on Terror. The monument reopened April 1, 2005, while the surrounding grounds remained closed until the landscape was finished later that summer.|$|E
5|$|Second-generation {{technologies}} include {{solar heating}} and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics. These are now entering markets {{as a result}} of research, development and demonstration (RD) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by energy <b>security</b> <b>concerns</b> linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.|$|E
50|$|Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai {{does not}} see Street View as a <b>security</b> <b>concern,</b> stating that {{numerous}} terrorist attacks have already occurred {{without the aid of}} Street View, and therefore, Street View is not needed as a terrorist tool.|$|R
50|$|Also in June, the President {{transferred}} the Immigration and Naturalization Service from the Department of Labor to the Department of Justice (DOJ), demonstrating {{that the federal}} government viewed its alien population as a <b>security</b> <b>concern</b> as war grew more likely.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the {{management}} and <b>security</b> <b>concerning</b> fuel purchases is greatly improved via the use of fuel cards. These features often prove themselves attractive to businesses, especially with those operating large fleets which can sometimes be in the thousands of vehicles.|$|R
5|$|<b>Security</b> <b>concerns</b> {{dominated}} Soviet decisions {{concerning the}} Far East. Chief among these was gaining unrestricted {{access to the}} Pacific Ocean. The year-round ice-free areas of the Soviet Pacific coastline—Vladivostok in particular—could be blockaded by air and sea from Sakhalin island and the Kurile Islands. Acquiring these territories, thus guaranteeing free access to the Soya Strait, was their primary objective. Secondary objectives were leases for the Chinese Eastern Railway, Southern Manchuria Railway, Dairen, and Port Arthur.|$|E
5|$|<b>Security</b> <b>concerns</b> {{related to}} crime and {{terrorism}} were not {{high on the}} agenda of the system's planners at its inception. After the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the foiled plot to bomb the Yishun MRT Station in 2001, the operators deployed private, unarmed guards to patrol station platforms and conduct checks on the belongings of commuters, especially those carrying bulky items.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 Cricket World Cup {{was awarded}} to South Africa, however they decided to award six of the group stage matches to Zimbabwe, and two to Kenya. Due to <b>security</b> <b>concerns</b> in Zimbabwe, the British and Australian governments both advised their players against {{travelling}} to Zimbabwe. In the end, England forfeited their match, whilst Australia played and won their match.|$|E
50|$|A badly {{configured}} {{open proxy}} can also allow {{access to a}} private subnetwork or DMZ: this is a high <b>security</b> <b>concern</b> for any company or home network because computers that usually are out of risk or firewalled can be directly attacked.|$|R
50|$|Treasury Regulations {{provide for}} an {{additional}} type of transportation benefit. The value of a special vehicle design (such as bulletproof glass) intended to provide security is excludable from gross income if the design is for a bona fide business-oriented <b>security</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|R
50|$|His father became {{successful}} in finance {{as a partner}} in Hornblower & Weeks, a <b>securities</b> <b>concern</b> in New York. The young Sargent attended the private St. Mark's School and a year at Harvard College before enlisting in the Navy during World War II.|$|R
5|$|The {{second phase}} was revived under the Siddaramaiah administration. It {{proposed}} tunneling NH 766 beneath the runway, which requires less land than deviating the highway; but the Central Government rejected this proposal, citing <b>security</b> <b>concerns.</b> In August 2016, however, the Deccan Chronicle {{reported that the}} Ministry of Civil Aviation had directed airport officials to have a study conducted regarding tunneling of the highway.|$|E
5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political and territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the <b>security</b> <b>concerns</b> of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E
5|$|A paper {{documenting the}} {{discovery}} was {{prepared by the}} team {{and sent to the}} journal Physical Review in March 1941, but publication was delayed until a year after the end of World War II due to <b>security</b> <b>concerns.</b> At the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. They calculated that element 94 would be fissile, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and could easily be separated from it.|$|E
50|$|The {{research}} has shown that the most vulnerable point in most information systems is the human user, operator, designer, or other human: so humans should be considered in their different roles as asset, threat, information resources. Social engineering is an increasing <b>security</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} <b>security</b> <b>concern</b> {{with certain}} {{simultaneous}} multithreading implementations. Intel's hyperthreading implementation has a vulnerability through which {{it is possible for}} one application to steal a cryptographic key from another application running in the same processor by monitoring its cache use.|$|R
50|$|Another <b>security</b> <b>concern</b> {{is that a}} VVPAT could print {{while no}} voter is observing the paper trail, a form of ballot stuffing. Even if {{additional}} votes were discovered through matching to the voters list, {{it would be impossible}} to identify legitimate ballots from fraudulent ballots.|$|R
