A laboratory experiment to study the effect of amelioration and K fertilization on K Q-I parameters was carried out on three <b>soil</b> <b>families</b> of acid upland mineral soil from Cigudeg, Kentrong, and Papanrejo. The experiment was arranged using completely randomized design with 2 factors. The first factor was three kinds of ameliorant and the second factor was three levels of K fertilization. The result suggested that amelioration with dolomite and steel slag increased K buffering capacity (PBCK) due {{to the increase in}} cation exchange capacity (CEC) and Ca and Mg concentration of the soil solution. Conversely, amelioration decreased equilibrium activity ratio of K (ARKe) due to alteration of K-Ca–Mg equilibrium. Amelioration, however, did not affect labile-K, except for Cigudeg soil. The application of K fertilizer increased K availability in terms of ARKe and labile-K. Those three <b>soil</b> <b>families</b> performed different changes in K availability effect, where soil with higher CEC showed smaller change than the lower one, also tended todecrease K buffering capasity (PBCK).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Forests with Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. Kuntze {{trees are}} {{endangered}} in Brazil, {{and information on}} the diversity of <b>soil</b> spider <b>families</b> associated to these environments is practically inexistent. The present study {{was set up to}} evaluate the abundance and diversity of <b>soil</b> spider <b>families</b> in natural and reforested Araucaria forests, impacted or not by fire, and to identify the most efficient method to collect these organisms. The study was conducted in four areas: native forest with predominance of Araucaria (NF); Araucaria reforestation (R); Araucaria reforestation submitted to an accidental fire (RF); and native grass pasture with native Araucaria and submitted to an intense accidental fire (NPF). Considering both sampling methods (Monolith and Pitfall traps), 20 spider families were identified. The pitfall trap method was more effective as it captured 19 out of the 20 recorded families, while the Monolith method extracted only ten spider families. Spider family abundance and Shannon’s diversity index (H) were affected by the employed collection method; the values for these attributes were always higher for the NF and lower for the NPF. Correspondence analysis (CA) showed a spatial separation among spider familiy assemblages from the different studied areas. It is suggested that changes in the abundance of <b>soil</b> spider <b>families</b> in Araucaria forests are mainly caused by recurrent human intervention over the last few years...|$|R

The map series is now being converted from its current paper form to a digital format. The digital data base for the 1 : 1, 000, 000 soil map of China will consist of three parts: spatial soil data, soil attributes and "reference system for Chinese soils. " The spatial data is based on the "soil genetic classification of China" consisting of 12 orders, 61 great groups, 235 sub-great groups, 909 families and 2, 469 soil families. The 1 : 1, 000, 000 soil maps are delineated based on the <b>soil</b> <b>family</b> definitions. The sampled soil attributes included physical, chemical and fertility properties measured for the 2, 469 soil series. The "reference system for Chinese soils" will use the attributed data for each soil series to correlate with soil names in three other soil classification systems, namely, "Soil Genetic Classification of China", USDA Soil Taxonomy and the FAO World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB).

Microfiche. xvi, 216 leaves, bound ill. 28 cmTwo {{fundamentally}} different approaches namely, the conventional critical concentration and "diagnosis and recommendation integrated system" (DRIS) were evaluated {{to determine their}} applicability in assessing the nutrient requirements of maize grown on a thixotropic, isothermic <b>soil</b> <b>family</b> of Hydric Dystrandept. Results of 15 fertilizer experiments (eight N x P and seven CaC 03 x P) were used in this evaluation. In the conventional critical concentration approach, five methods were evaluated to determine the critical or optimum tissue concentration or range for each nutrient element. The methods were (1) graphical determination {{of the range of}} tissue concentrations associated with high yields, (2) determination of the mean nutrient concentration of the highest-yielding 15 % of the plots, (3) determination of the nutrient concentration which, when used as the critical concentration, resulted in the highest percentage of correct diagnoses of nutrient deficiency, (4) determination of the nutrient concentration at which the mean yield response to additional fertilizer approaches 0. 0, and (5) determination of the nutrient concentration at which yield is maximized (calculated using a quadratic regression model). Methods (1) and (2) were used to determine optimum concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, A 1, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn. Method (3) was used for N, P, and Ca while methods (4) and (5) were used for N and P. Both methods (1) and (2) gave critical or optimum values as a range of tissue nutrient concentrations. For most nutrient elements, however, method (1) gave a comparatively wider range of tissue concentrations, and estimates of optimum ranges from this technique appear to be highly subjective. Except for N, Mg, and S the optimum nutrient concentrations determined with these two methods are within the sufficiency ranges suggested by either Jones (1967) or Neubert et al. (1969). For N, Mg, and S, high maize grain yields were associated with slightly lower concentrations than those previously reported. The critical or optimum nutrient concentrations obtained with the other three methods are similar and fall well within the published values. In most N x P experiments, highly significant positive correlation was found between tissue N and P concentrations as well as with grain yield. Likewise, the concentrations of tissue K, S, Cu, and Zn were positively correlated with tissue N and P and also with grain yield. Only in the case of Mn was the correlation negative. Since application of fertilizer N and P gave significant yield responses it is unclear whether the optimum ranges of these covariant elements are accurate, or whether they are artifacts of tissue N and P. In the DRIS approach, the percentage of correct diagnoses was the criterion used to determine the diagnostic accuracy for N, P, and Ca. Several variations in the various steps of the DRIS approach were evaluated to determine their effects on diagnostic accuracy. The diagnostic accuracy for N was improved (1) by judicious selection of the high-yielding subpopulation, (2) by selecting the "critical" DRIS index based on its effect on diagnostic accuracy, (3) by using DRIS indices calculated by experiment rather than by replicate, and (4) by using 10 rather than 3 or 36 ratios to calculate DRIS indices. For P and Ca, however, no marked difference in diagnostic accuracy was observed among the several DRIS approaches. Using the percentage of correct diagnoses technique, a critical DRIS index of 0. 5 was chosen for N while a value of 0. 0 was found for P and Ca. Similar values were obtained when maize grain yield was plotted against DRIS indices for these elements. For most other elements, the plot showed that 0. 0 was the critical DRIS index. DRIS norms (optimum values of nutrient ratios and their corresponding coefficients of variation) independently derived from this study gave greater diagnostic accuracy for N, P, and Ca than when using published norms. Both the conventional critical level and DRIS approach were more accurate when the critical or optimum values of nutrient concentrations or nutrient concentration ratios were independently derived from our own experimental data. In the final analysis, the DRIS approach was judged to be better than the conventional critical level approach for diagnosing the N requirements of maize...|$|E
40|$|The grasslands of South Africa are the {{foundation}} of commercial and subsistence agriculture yet they are being degraded at an alanning rate. The coastal grasslands of the Eastern Cape are no exception and they suffer added pressure of coastal resort development because of their proximity to an attractive coastline. In {{order to determine the}} degree of conservation necessary for any area it is essential to know what species occur there in order to determine if protection from habitat destruction is required. Four aims were defined for this studv. The initial aim was a phytogeographical classification of the grasslands in the coastal region west of the Kei River. This was done by vegetation sampling followed by computer based analysis with TWINSPAN. This analysis defined ten grassland associations. five being located in the area west of the Keiskamma River and five occurring east of it. The associations in the eastern half are termed mesic while those in the western balf are xeric. The second aim was to determine the presence of any underlying ecological gradients affecting the distribution of tbe associations. Indirect gradient analysis was carried out where samples are analysed irrespective of environmental factors. Direct gradient analysis was then carried out using scores per sample of various environmental factors. Environmental factors whicb migbt produce such gradients are both naturally-ocurring and man-induced. Natural factors which were recorded in the field include depth of soil at sample site, <b>soil</b> <b>family,</b> aspect and distance from the shore. An important factor is the land / sea interface. Natural factors analysed in the laboratory include soil pH. conductivity. percent organic matter, calcium, magnesium, phosphate and potassium. Man-induced factors are land use history e. g. Ploughing and grazing. Both direct and indirect gradient analysis were carried out with the computer based programme CANOCO. The third aim {{of the study was to}} determine the presence of any successional trends between the ten defined associations. This was done using several characteristics of the associations. Alpha and beta diversity were the first factors compared between associations. The percentage contribution of the Cyperaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae and Poaceae to each association was assessed and compared. The presence of various life forms of the species occurring in each association was determined together with the cover abundance of different classes of grass species. These results were then combined and analysed in the light of the results from CANOCO analvsis. They show that the mesic Themeda Iriandra - Anthospermum herhoceum, association which occurs closest to the shore and with the least disturbance is a depauperate form of the mesic climax Themeda triandra association. The mesic Hyparrhenia hirta - Dtheteropogon amplectens association may be a secondary grassland on account of phosphate and potassiun poor soils and land-use. The mesic Hyparrhenia hirta - Themedo triandra association is a slightly degraded form of the climax association due to grazing. The severely disturbed Stenotaphrum secundatum - C'entella coriacea association, which is located close to the shore, is a secondary grassland. Analysis of the xeric associations indicates a clearly defined ordination of associations on the basis of land-use. The Cynodon daclylon - Helictolrichon hirtulum and Sporobolis africanus - Setaria sphacelata associations which occur where ploughed lands have been left to lie fallow are secondary in nature. The Themeda triandra - Ehrharta calycina association is thought to be the closest representati ve of a climax xeric association but the presence of E. calycina indicates that some disturbance has occurred. The vegetation is subject to moderate grazing. The Cynodon dactylon - Ehrharla calycina and Diheleropogon filifolius - Ehrharla calycina associations are subject to varying intensities of trampling and grazing and are degraded forms of the Themeda triandra - Ehrharla calycina association. Because of tbe overriding influence of the land-use gradient separation along gradients of the remaining eight factors was limited. The effect of fire and temporal change in the mesic Themeda triandra and Hyparrhenia hirta - Themeeia trianda associations was assessed via long-term studies at Potter's Pass outside East London. The results show a quick response to burning with a return to 100 % cover within six months by both associations. During spring the two associations could not be separated by either TWINSPAN or DECORANA. indicating a temporal shift from the Hyparrhenia hirta - Themeda triandra association to the Themeda triandra association. The fourth and final aim was to identify plants requiring protection from habitat destruction and to make recommendations for further conservation areas and management of the coastal grasslands. Through the collection and identification of as many plants as possible a species checklist was prepared and the status of each was determined through reference to the Red Data Book of threatened and endangered species. Kniphofia rooperi is vulnerable in the Cape and Euphorbia hupleuroides is considered rare in kwazulu-Natal. Ten species are endemic to the Cape and / or South Africa. The richness of the vegetation lies in the presence of species representative of the four major floras which converge in the eastern Cape. i. e. The Cape, NamaKarroo, Tongoland-Pondolaod floras and the Kalahari Highveld Regional Transitional Zone. Suggestions are made for the conservation of the grassland associations at various sites within the study area based on the present area conserved. Less than 2 % of the coastline in the study area is conserved and it is felt that the area under conservation should be increased. Management suggestions based on the available literature are given for both farmed and conserved areas. There is a great potential for further studies on grassland dmamics within the areas surveyed. In terms of management, the grasslands require careful examination to determine the most effective season in which to burn if at all. As with most agricultural systems in South Africa. grazing strategies will benefit from further research. Any additional research on the dynamics of these grasslands can only be of benefit to the sustained utilisation of this vital resource. ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{development}} of a liming program for the acid soils of the Hawaiian Islands, it was found that soils of the various great soil groups varied greatly in their lime requirement for correction of similar degrees of acidity. This variation in lime requirement appeared {{to be associated with the}} differences in the buffering capacities of the soils. Titration curves were made on more than a hundred soils selected from the typical profiles of the <b>soil</b> <b>families</b> belonging to the various great soil groups. The results of this study have justified the following conclusion regarding the nature of the titration curves and buffering capacities of the tropical and subtropical soils of the Hawaiian Islands: The buffering capacity of Hawaiian soils was much lower than that found for soils of the temperate regions. The buffering capacity of the soils of the different great soil groups varied greatly; however, there was very little variation in the degree of buffering exhibited by the soils of the different <b>soil</b> <b>families</b> of each group. Each soil group has a typical titration curve. The soils of the low humic latosol and humic ferruginous latosol have the lowest buffering capacity, and the soils of the hydroI humic latosol and brown forest groups exhibit the greatest degree of buffering. The organic matter fraction of the soil affects the degree of buffering above soil reaction of pH 5. 5. It is most "active" in neutral and alkaline portions of the titration curves. However, the organic matter fraction does not influence the nature of the curve. The general character of the titration curve is determined by the nature of the clay minerals. The kaolinite and iron oxide clays give rise to titration curves having a low buffering capacity and montmorillonite and hydrated aluminum oxide clays give titration curves having a high buffering capacity. The silica-sesquioxide ratio of the clay fraction of the soil or the quantity of clay in the soil was not related to the degree of buffering exhibited by the titration curve of the soil. This is probably due to the large amount of "free oxides" found in these soils. There is a direct relation ship between the cation exchange capacity of the soil and its buffering capacity. The higher the cation exchange capacity the greater buffering would be exhibited by the titration curve of the soil...|$|R

There were noticeable differences in the properties of the flood plain soils particularly in the contents of organic matter, texture and salinity. Available Fe, Mn and Cu in flood plain soils range from low in subsurface layers to high or medium in surface layer while Zn and P was generaly low. Soils were classified into nine great soil groups, ten sub-great groups and 15 <b>soil</b> <b>families.</b> The criteria used for differentiation was the classes of particle size distribution, mineralogy, and soil temperature regime. The main soil limitations were the dominance of coarse textured soils in wadi bottom and some flood plain soils, low organic matter content and inherent fertility particularly in the coarse textured soils...|$|R

50|$|Confident {{that the}} Union was winning the war, Owen {{resigned}} from the army {{at the end of}} 1863. He moved to Bloomington, Indiana, and accepted a natural sciences chair at Indiana University. Within weeks of his arrival, he sold the university a collection of stones, fossils, and <b>soil</b> that his <b>family</b> had collected. Owen was also active in the local Presbyterian church, where he taught Sunday school classes.|$|R
50|$|Clostridial {{species are}} one of the major causes of food poisoning/gastrointestinal illnesses. They are anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming rods that occur {{naturally}} in the <b>soil.</b> Among the <b>family</b> are: Clostridium botulinum, which produces one of the most potent toxins in existence; Clostridium tetani, causative agent of tetanus; and Clostridium perfringens, commonly found in wound infections and diarrhea cases. The use of toxins to damage the host is a method deployed by many bacterial pathogens.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that the name Chengalam came from the word chenkulam (ed <b>soiled</b> ponds). Chempakaseri <b>family</b> were staying in this place. The place was once completely paddy fields. Now so many houses and buildings are in this village. The place is now easier to build big buildings since paddy fields were converted to land. During flood time this village was completely under water. Now the road has been rebuilt and floods are not affecting transportation.|$|R
5000|$|That trail led {{others to}} the area, {{including}} the Wood brothers from Kentucky. After the War of 1812, Illinois in general became known for its rich <b>soil,</b> and many <b>families</b> moved there. Around 1816 the Woods camped in the vicinity while looking for home sites. The name of the eventual town that would spring up in that area {{is said to have}} come from someone watching the Wood brothers' camp fire burning. They called the area [...] "Wood Burn", which eventually was combined into one word.|$|R

Jeeter Lester, the patriarch, lives in squalor with his wife Ada, their two children, 16-year-old Dude and 18-year-old Ellie May, and his mother. Ada is suffering from pellagra and Ellie May has a harelip, Jeeter and Dude are thin and emaciated, and the family wears tattered clothing.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the morphological pattern of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) {{as well as to}} study the microbiological activity of the <b>soil</b> on <b>family</b> farms where Barbados cherry was cultivated. Soil and root samples were selected from four areas in the municipality of Maranguape-CE where Barbados cherry was grown, which were named according to the age of plants in the following manner: A 1 - 3, A 2 - 3, and A 3 - 3 (3 years), and A 4 - 2 (2 years). After sampling, the arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization, morphological colonization pattern, basal soil respiration (SBR), and density of mycorrhizal spores (DS) were analyzed. The Paris-type morphological pattern was predominant in the root system of Barbados cherry; the affinity of this pattern in the culture was clear. Time of installation and management of Barbados cherry orchards in family farming areas promoted reduction in SBR. P levels in the soil may have negatively influenced root colonization and density of mycorrhizal spores...|$|R
40|$|Rwandan {{agriculture}} {{is not able}} to meet its population’s food needs from its own production, which results in food insecurity. Land degradation is a serious problem which contributes to a low and declining agricultural productivity and consequently to food insecurity. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a bio-economic model capable of analysing the impacts of <b>soil</b> erosion, <b>family</b> planning and land consolidation policies on food security in Rwanda. The results of the bio-economic model show that a higher availability of good farm land would increase the farm income. Additionally, preserving soils against erosion and reducing risk would allow for releasing more marginal land which would increase food production for home consumption and for the market. Increasing the opportunities for off-farm employment can also increase farm household income. The outcomes of the model support the Rwanda policy on family planning, while the policy on land consolidation is not endorsed. Key words: Rwanda, land degradation, food security, bioeconomic model, family planning policy...|$|R
60|$|In {{contrast}} to these {{was the family}} of a wealthy citizen, who had amassed a vast fortune, and, having purchased the estate and mansion of a ruined nobleman in the neighborhood, was endeavoring to assume all the style and dignity of an hereditary lord of the <b>soil.</b> The <b>family</b> always came to church en prince. They were rolled majestically along in a carriage emblazoned with arms. The crest glittered in silver radiance from every part of the harness where a crest could possibly be placed. A fat coachman, in a three-cornered hat richly laced and a flaxen wig, curling close round his rosy face, was seated on the box, with a sleek Danish dog beside him. Two footmen in gorgeous liveries, with huge bouquets, and gold-headed canes, lolled behind. The carriage rose and sunk on its long springs with a peculiar stateliness of motion. The very horses champed their bits, arched their necks, and glanced their eyes more proudly than common horses; either because they had caught a little of the family feeling, or were reined up more tightly than ordinary.|$|R
