5|$|The Turk {{was in fact}} a {{mechanical}} illusion that allowed a human chess master hiding inside to operate the machine. With a <b>skilled</b> <b>operator,</b> the Turk won most of the games played during its demonstrations around Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years, playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. The device was later purchased in 1804 and exhibited by Johann Nepomuk MÃ¤lzel. The chess masters who secretly operated it included Johann Allgaier, Boncourt, Aaron Alexandre, William Lewis, Jacques Mouret, and William Schlumberger, but the operators within the mechanism during Kempelen's original tour remain a mystery.|$|E
25|$|Alpha {{particles}} {{have the}} shortest range, and to detect these the window should ideally be within 10mm of the radiation source due to alpha particle attenuation in free air. However, the G-M tube produces a pulse output {{which is the}} same magnitude for all detected radiation, so a Geiger counter with an end window tube cannot distinguish between alpha and beta particles. A <b>skilled</b> <b>operator</b> can use varying distance from radiation source to detector to differentiate between alpha and high energy beta particles, but with the detector in close contact with the radiation source the two types are both detected and are indistinguishable.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical calculators {{continued}} to be sold, though in rapidly decreasing numbers, into the early 1970s, {{with many of the}} manufacturers closing down or being taken over. Comptometer type calculators were often retained for much longer to be used for adding and listing duties, especially in accounting, since a trained and <b>skilled</b> <b>operator</b> could enter all the digits of a number in one movement of the hands on a Comptometer quicker than was possible serially with a 10-key electronic calculator. In fact, it was quicker to enter larger digits in two strokes using only the lower-numbered keys; for instance, a 9 would be entered as 4 followed by 5. Some key-driven calculators had keys for every column, but only 1 through 5; they were correspondingly compact. The spread of the computer rather than the simple electronic calculator {{put an end to the}} Comptometer. Also, by the end of the 1970s, the slide rule had become obsolete.|$|E

500|$|A tangent bar {{mechanism}} {{was used}} to adjust the monochromator. [...] The mechanism was highly sensitive and required a <b>skilled</b> <b>operator.</b> Only two Model B prototypes were made. [...] One was sold: in February 1941, to the University of California Chemistry department in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Three Model C {{instruments}} were then built, improving the instrument's wavelength resolution. The [...] Model B's rotary cell compartment {{was replaced with}} a linear [...] sample [...] chamber. The tangent bar mechanism {{was replaced by a}} scroll drive mechanism, which could be more precisely controlled to reset the quartz prism and select the desired wavelength. With this new mechanism, results could be more easily and reliably obtained, without requiring a highly <b>skilled</b> <b>operator.</b> This set the pattern for all of Beckman's later quartz prism instruments. [...] Although only three Model B prototypes were built, all were sold, one to Caltech and the other two to [...] companies in the food industry.|$|E
2500|$|AEDs are {{designed}} to be used by laypersons who ideally should have received AED training. However, sixth-grade students have been reported to begin defibrillation within 90 seconds, as opposed to a trained operator beginning within 67 seconds. [...] This is in contrast to more sophisticated manual and semi-automatic defibrillators used by health professionals, which can act as a pacemaker if the heart rate is too slow (bradycardia) and perform other functions which require a <b>skilled</b> <b>operator</b> able to read electrocardiograms.|$|E
5000|$|Manual {{prototype}} assembly or component-level repair is {{more difficult}} and requires <b>skilled</b> <b>operators</b> and more expensive tools, due to the small sizes and lead spacings of many SMDs.|$|R

50|$|Shaving {{green wood}} with the {{drawknife}} or spokeshave {{along the grain}} is far quicker and easier work than turning across it. <b>Skilled</b> <b>operators</b> can produce very fine results with a drawknife and shavehorse, requiring minimal lathe finishing.|$|R
2500|$|Bolt preload {{can also}} be {{controlled}} by torquing the bolt {{to the point of}} yielding. Under some circumstances, a <b>skilled</b> <b>operator</b> can feel the drop off of the work required to turn the torque wrench as the material of the bolt begins to yield. At that point the bolt has a preload determined by the bolt area and the [...] yield strength of the bolt material. This technique can be more accurately executed by specially built machines. Because this method only works for very high preloads and requires comparatively expensive tooling, it is only commonly used for specific applications, primarily in high performance engines.|$|E
60|$|However, he {{had first}} to send the despatches. In one Mr. Macrae {{informed}} Gianesi and Giambresi of the condition of their instrument, and bade them send another at once with a <b>skilled</b> <b>operator,</b> and {{to look out for}} probable tamperers in their own establishment. This despatch was in a cypher which before he got the new invention, and while he used the old wires, Mr. Macrae had arranged with the electricians. The words of the despatch were, therefore, peculiar, and the Highland lass who operated, a girl of great beauty and modesty, at first declined to transmit the message.|$|E
60|$|Rut not {{infrequently}} these playful brutes {{get themselves}} tethered in some fashionable promenade, and the consequence is demoralizing to white people. We speak {{within the limits}} of possibility when we say that we have seen no less than seven women and children in the air at once, impelled heavenward by as many consecutive kicks of a single <b>skilled</b> <b>operator.</b> No longer ago than we can remember we saw an aged party in spectacles and a clawhammer coat gyrating through the air like an irregular bolt shot out of a catapult. Before we could ascertain from him the site of the quadruped from whom he had received his impulsion, he had passed like a vague dream, and the equine scoundrel went unwhipped of justice.|$|E

40|$|The {{operations}} of a reactor furnace {{such as a}} blast furnace still depend on the experiences and intuitions of <b>skilled</b> <b>operators</b> due {{to the complexity of}} internal furnace phenomena and high temperature. There is a great demand for stable operations under the circumstances of a {{decrease in the number of}} <b>skilled</b> <b>operators</b> and difficulty in technology inheritance. This paper aims to construct mathematical description for control of a reactor furnace. Further, the linear-quadratic-gaussian control system for a reactor furnace is proposed, which estimates inner furnace temperature distribution using measured data near furnace wall. Temperature distribution of a furnace is controlled based on the estimated inner temperature distribution changing of boundary conditions of a furnace. The practicability of the proposed control method was checked through numerical experiments...|$|R
30|$|This {{study shows}} {{acceptable}} bias but wide limits of agreement for {{the comparison of}} TVD, PVD and PPV between the automated CC system and <b>skilled</b> <b>operators.</b> Further software improvements may be needed before real time point of care testing of the microcirculation can be used at the bedside.|$|R

50|$|Though the Chief {{could produce}} superlative work, unlike the highly popular A.B.

5000|$|The camera {{operator}} could simply hold the camera. This manual grip allows speed and flexibility, {{but even the}} most <b>skilled</b> <b>operator</b> cannot entirely prevent shaking. Hand-held camera footage has traditionally been considered suitable mostly for documentaries, news, reportage, live action, unrehearsable footage, or the evocation of authentic immediacy or cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ© during dramatic sequences.|$|E
50|$|In {{industrial}} engineering, {{the standard}} {{time is the}} time required by an average <b>skilled</b> <b>operator,</b> working ata normal pace, to perform a specified task using a prescribed method.

50|$|This {{works by}} flow coating the {{material}} onto {{the board and}} is suitable for low volume application, finishing and repair. The finish tends to be inferior cosmetically and can be subject to many defects such as bubbles. The coating also tends to be thicker and unless <b>skilled</b> <b>operators</b> applied the coating, highly subjective in quality.|$|R
5000|$|The {{importance}} of operator skill cannot be overstated. A high-quality, well-calibrated pipette {{in the hand}} of an uninterested or untrained operator is an unreliable instrument.

40|$|A new noise {{measuring}} method is outlined {{that is based}} on electronic analysis of the radiated noise. Non-relevant components are suppressed, while the differential phonogram displayed on the oscilloscope screen discloses the information carrying components.

5000|$|However, {{scintillation}} probes can {{be affected}} by high gamma background levels, which must therefore be checked by the <b>skilled</b> <b>operator</b> to allow the instrument to compensate. A common technique is to remove the counter from any proximity to alpha and beta emitters and allow a [...] "background" [...] count of gamma. The instrument can then subtract this in subsequent readings.|$|E
5000|$|Hand-tapper: A simple fixture {{analogous}} to an arbor press in its basic shape. Its spindle is thus held accurately {{perpendicular to the}} work. Standard taps are held in the spindle, and the operator turns the spindle manually via a handlebar. This fixture obviates {{the need for the}} operator to carefully and skillfully approximate perpendicularity, which even for a <b>skilled</b> <b>operator</b> can easily result in a 2-5Â° error.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} {{prominent}} methods of medical imaging, ultrasound has several advantages. It provides images in real-time, it is portable {{and can be}} brought to the bedside, it is substantially lower in cost, and it does not use harmful ionizing radiation. Drawbacks of ultrasonography include various limits on its field of view including patient cooperation and physique, difficulty imaging structures behind bone and air, and its dependence on a <b>skilled</b> <b>operator.</b>|$|E
30|$|Point-of-care {{ultrasonography}} (POCUS) is {{a widely}} used tool in emergency and critical care settings, useful {{in the decision-making process}} as well as in interventional guidance.
