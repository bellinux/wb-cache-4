5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that giant North American fruits of plants such as the Osage-orange, Kentucky coffeetree and honey locust evolved in tandem with now-extinct American megafauna such as mammoths and other proboscideans, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> extant endemic herbivores able to ingest these fruits and disperse their seeds. Introduced cattle and horses have since taken over this ecological role.|$|E
5|$|The outer, {{light-emitting}} {{layer of}} a star {{is known as the}} photosphere. Temperature estimates of the photosphere of Wolf 359 range from 2,500 K to 2,900 K, which is sufficiently cool for equilibrium chemistry to occur. The resulting chemical compounds survive long enough to be observed through their spectral lines. Numerous molecular bands appear in the spectrum of Wolf 359, including those of carbon monoxide (CO), iron hydride (FeH), chromium hydride (CrH), water (H2O), magnesium hydride (MgH), vanadium(II) oxide (VO), titanium(II) oxide (TiO) and possibly the molecule CaOH. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> lines of lithium in the spectrum, this element must have already been consumed by fusion at the core. This indicates the star must be at least 100 million years old.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Persian wars in 299, co-emperors Diocletian and Galerius traveled from Persia to Syrian Antioch (Antakya). The Christian rhetor Lactantius records that, at Antioch some time in 299, the emperors were engaged in sacrifice and divination in an attempt to predict the future. The haruspices, diviners of omens from sacrificed animals, were unable to read the sacrificed animals and failed to do so after repeated trials. The master haruspex eventually declared that this failure was the result of interruptions in the process caused by profane men. Certain Christians in the imperial household had been observed making {{the sign of the cross}} during the ceremonies and were alleged to have disrupted the haruspices divination. Diocletian, enraged by this turn of events, declared that all members of the court must make a sacrifice themselves. Diocletian and Galerius also sent letters to the military command, demanding that the entire army perform the sacrifices or else face discharge. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> reports of bloodshed in Lactantius's narrative, Christians in the imperial household must have survived the event.|$|E
