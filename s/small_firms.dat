5|$|Ingham (1991) {{shows how}} small, {{independent}} {{iron and steel}} manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. <b>Small</b> <b>firms</b> concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed {{a higher percentage of}} highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.|$|E
5|$|The club {{succeeded in}} a further legal {{challenge}} bought by <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> in January 2005 as the High Court upheld {{a decision by}} then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to grant a compulsory purchase order {{in support of the}} scheme. The stadium later became issue in the local elections in May 2006. The Metropolitan Police restricted supporters' coaches to being parked in the nearby Sobel Sports Centre rather than in the underground stadium car park, and restricted access to 14 streets on match days. These police restrictions were conditions of the stadiums' health and safety certificate which the stadium requires to operate and open. The road closures were passed at a council meeting in July 2005.|$|E

Historically the industry had been dominated by individuals and <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> who combined the roles of architect and engineer, but this broke down in Chicago during the period, being replaced by a partnership between specialist architects who focused on {{the appearance of the}} skyscraper, and specialist engineers who focused on the structures that enabled it to be built. Chicago architectural firms grew to be large, hierarchical and with numerous specialist staff; the D. H. Burnham & Company, for example, felt like a small factory to visitors, and ultimately expanded to employ 180 staff.|$|E

Here we consider {{the potential impact of}} this on <b>smaller</b> <b>firms</b> as the first step in assessing how they may adapt to this regulatory change. We use textual data consisting of recent media and blogs that highlight key stakeholders’ perceptions of the purpose and outcomes of harmonisation on <b>smaller</b> <b>firms.</b> The narratives perpetuate the negative discourse of regulation, not only for <b>smaller</b> <b>firms,</b> but for other key stakeholders. Critical analysis of stakeholders’ views of the effects of harmonisation articulates constraints and possibilities of regulatory change for <b>smaller</b> <b>firms.</b> Recommendations for ways in which <b>smaller</b> <b>firms</b> can be engaged and supported in this change are made...|$|R

40|$|Simulation {{tools and}} {{technology}} are now commonplace {{in the high}} technology environments of many large-scale companies. However, this is not yet the case in many <b>smaller</b> <b>firms.</b> Furthermore, the <b>smaller</b> <b>firm</b> may have a highly individual approach to its design and manufacture. The paper focuses upon the specific example of small and medium sized enterprises engaged {{in the design and}} manufacture of bicycles from the United Kingdom. Conversely, the <b>smaller</b> <b>firms</b> are synonymous with high technical standards in terms of the traditional engineering qualities of strength, durability and manufacturing tolerances. The <b>smaller</b> <b>firms</b> compete against much larger firms with greater technical and manufacturing resources. Interestingly, the <b>smaller</b> <b>firms</b> can introduce innovative designs faster and sometimes carry out design work for larger firms.

25|$|Economic {{freedom in}} terms of technoliberalism {{involves}} small scale capitalism, that is capitalism for small and medium-sized businesses, rather than corporate organizations created by major interest groups. Ideally, localized systems and community ties will {{pave the way for}} a new capitalist economy, undoing the power of global capitalism. Implemented trust regulations will compliment this, meaning more rules for big companies to create better competition, whereas smaller companies will be enforced with fewer rules. Technoliberalism places an emphasis on these small and medium-sized businesses because it can help boost economic growth. Money spent by local authorities with <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> is re-spent into the local economy, compared to that spent with large businesses in the same area. Doing business this way then, is better value for money.|$|E
25|$|Piotroski and Srinivasan (2008) {{examine a}} {{comprehensive}} sample of international companies that list onto U.S. and U.K. stock exchanges {{before and after}} the enactment of the Act in 2002. Using a sample of all listing events onto U.S. and U.K. exchanges from 1995–2006, they find that the listing preferences of large foreign firms choosing between U.S. exchanges and the LSE's Main Market did not change following SOX. In contrast, they find that the likelihood of a U.S. listing among small foreign firms choosing between the Nasdaq and LSE's Alternative Investment Market decreased following SOX. The negative effect among <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> is consistent with these companies being less able to absorb the incremental costs associated with SOX compliance. The screening of smaller firms with weaker governance attributes from U.S. exchanges is consistent with the heightened governance costs imposed by the Act increasing the bonding-related benefits of a U.S. listing.|$|E
40|$|This study {{considers}} the behaviour of the size, price earnings and book value anomalies in <b>smaller</b> <b>firms.</b> It does so by first separately, and then simultaneously, examining {{the effect of}} all three firm variables in the Australian stock market, where large firms are no bigger than the <b>smaller</b> <b>firms</b> in the United States. Of the three effects only the book value and (previously confirmed) <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> main effect, but not the P/E effect, is present for Australian stocks. This result suggests that the P/E effect reported in the U. S. literature may disappear in (very) small U. S. stocks. With regard to possible subsumptions and interactions between the effects, our results indicate, though inconclusively, that the <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> effect is driving the book value main effect...|$|R

40|$|Access to {{complementary}} resources through strategic equity alliance networks is {{an important}} activity for both <b>smaller</b> and larger <b>firms.</b> In the literature, there is an intensive debate {{on the impact of}} alliance resources for <b>smaller</b> <b>firms.</b> We submit that the effect of alliance resources on the <b>smaller</b> <b>firm</b> financial performance depends on the attributes of these resources. Specifically, we argue that the attributes of partner organizational capital are negatively related and the attributes of partner production factor resources are positively related to the <b>smaller</b> <b>firm</b> financial performance. We test our theoretical framework by applying a longitudinal analysis to a dataset of 1730 firm-year observations of strategic equity alliances in the software industry in 25 countries over an 11 -year period.

Critics of large-scale remediation argued during 1999 that the absence of significant reported problems in non-compliant <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> was evidence that there had been, and would be, no serious problems needing to be fixed in any firm, and that the scale of the problem had therefore been severely overestimated. However, this can be countered with the observation that large companies had significant problems requiring action, that Y2K programmers were fully aware of the variable timescale, and that they were working to a series of earlier target dates, rather than a single fixed target of 31 December 1999.|$|E

On April 28, the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Ministry of Finance billed the case as the best investigation and assessment order of the year. The team picked up accounts of 30 Chikpet traders who were into penny stocks and found bogus claims through capital gains.|$|E
