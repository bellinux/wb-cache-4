25|$|In {{addition}} to normal breakdown {{ratings of the}} device, power BJTs are subject to a failure mode called secondary breakdown, in which excessive current and normal imperfections in the <b>silicon</b> <b>die</b> cause portions of the silicon inside the device to become disproportionately hotter than the others. The electrical resistivity of doped silicon, like other semiconductors, has a negative temperature coefficient, meaning that it conducts more current at higher temperatures. Thus, the hottest {{part of the die}} conducts the most current, causing its conductivity to increase, which then causes it to become progressively hotter again, until the device fails internally. The thermal runaway process associated with secondary breakdown, once triggered, occurs almost instantly and may catastrophically damage the transistor package.|$|E
25|$|Widlar {{disposed}} with hybrid technology, {{and used}} only diffused resistors formed within the <b>silicon</b> <b>die.</b> Each {{of the nine}} NPN transistors was sized and shaped according to its function, contrary to an earlier practice of employing standard minimal-area patterns. Widlar introduced three innovations: interfacing a long-tail with a single-ended stage without losing half of the gain, shifting the DC level using only NPN transistors, and optional frequency compensation with an external capacitor. Compensation increased bandwidth of the device to 25-30MHz, an unprecedented breakthrough for monolithic amplifiers at that time. Widlar did not consider the μA702 prototype good enough for production, but Fairchild decided otherwise and rushed the chip into production in October 1964. The device set the direction for the industry for decades, despite poor common-mode rejection ratio, weak output drive capabilities, and a price of $300. According to Jack Gifford, the top management of Fairchild noticed the novelty and learned of Widlar's existence only after receiving enthusiastic feedback from the market.|$|E

[...] Like the waffle-iron, these structures have good suppression of unwanted transmission modes. [...] A filter operating in the [...] band has been built using parallel-plate waveguide (PPWG) technology with [...] of rejection in the stopband. [...] The filter was constructed of two plates of highly polished aluminium spaced [...] apart. [...] The teeth consisted of gold-sputtered aluminium cylinders on a <b>silicon</b> <b>die.</b> [...] In this design it is not convenient to provide a gap through the centre of the teeth as is done in the microwave version.

The displacement experienced by the dies, due to bending, at fracture strength is called the fracture displacement. The strength properties of thin, bare <b>silicon</b> <b>dies</b> have already been reported. This work extends the study further to demonstrate the improvement in the fracture strength of thin <b>silicon</b> <b>dies,</b> of three different thicknesses (30, 65 and 130 mu m), when integrated in flexible foil substrates. The fracture strength of the dies was measured using uniaxial (3 -point-bending test) and biaxial (Ring-ball test) bending tests. Experimental results of the fracture strength of thin, bare <b>silicon</b> <b>dies</b> were in good agreement with simulation results obtained from Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Experimental results showed {{that there was an}} increase of the fracture strength up to about 190 % and an increase in the curvature of bending up to about 85 % when <b>silicon</b> <b>dies</b> were integrated in flexible foil substrates. This increase in the fracture strength and curvature of bending can be useful in designing and manufacturing more mechanically robust flexible electronic devices...|$|R
