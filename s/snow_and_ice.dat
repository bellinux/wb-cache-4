5|$|In road <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> control, brine {{is often}} used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E

40|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> {{superimposed}} <b>ice</b> formation on landfast sea ice in a Svalbard fjord, Kongsfjorden, {{was investigated}} with a high-resolution thermodynamic <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea-ice model, applying meteorological weather station data as external forcing. The model shows that sea-ice formation occurs {{both at the}} <b>ice</b> bottom <b>and</b> at the snow/ice interface. Modelling {{results indicated that the}} total <b>snow</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> superimposed <b>ice,</b> which formed at the snow/ice interface, was about 14 cm during the simulation period, accounting for about 15 % of the total <b>ice</b> mass <b>and</b> 35 % of the total ice growth. Introducing a time-dependent snow density improved the modelled results, and a time-dependent oceanic heat flux parameterization yielded reasonable ice growth at the ice bottom. Model results suggest that weather conditions, in particular air temperature and precipitation, as well as <b>snow</b> thermal properties <b>and</b> surface albedo are the most critical factors for the development of <b>snow</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> superimposed <b>ice</b> in Kongsfjorden. While both warming air and higher precipitation led to increased <b>snow</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> superimposed <b>ice</b> forming in Kongsfjorden in the model runs, the processes were more sensitive to precipitation than to air temperature...|$|R

40|$|The optical {{properties}} of snow/sea ice vary {{with age and}} by the processes they were formed, giving characteristic types of <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice.</b> The response of albedo and light penetration depth (e -folding depth) to increasing mass ratio of black carbon is shown {{to depend on the}} <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice</b> type <b>and</b> the thickness of the snow or sea ice. The response of albedo and e -folding depth of three different types of snow (cold polar <b>snow,</b> wind-packed <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> melting <b>snow)</b> <b>and</b> three sea <b>ice</b> (multi-year <b>ice,</b> first-year <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> melting sea <b>ice)</b> to increasing mass ratio of black carbon is calculated using a coupled atmosphere–snow/sea ice radiative-transfer model (TUV-snow), over the optical wavelengths of 300 – 800 nm. The <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice</b> types are effectively defined by a scattering cross-section, density and asymmetry parameter. The relative change in albedo and e -folding depth of each of the three <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> three sea <b>ice</b> types with increasing mass ratio of black carbon is considered relative to a base case of 1 ng g − 1 of black carbon. The relative response of each <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice</b> type is intercompared to examine how different types of <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice</b> respond relative to each other. The relative change in albedo of a melting snowpack is a factor of four more responsive to additions of black carbon compared to cold polar snow over a black carbon increase from 1 to 50 ng g − 1, while the relative change in albedo of a melting sea ice is a factor of two more responsive to additions of black carbon compared to multi-year ice for the same increase in mass ratio of black carbon. The response of e -folding depth is effectively not dependent on snow/sea ice type. The albedo of sea ice is more responsive to increasing mass ratios of black carbon than snow...|$|R

5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The more <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> <b>ice,</b> the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E

40|$|Reflection and {{transmission}} of irradiance by the combined <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice</b> layer were measured at an ice camp (ca. 10 days) and several short-term stations (ca. 2 h) {{established in the}} western sector of the Arctic Ocean above 80 &#x 00 B 0;N during the 2010 summer. These measurements were made with an intention to quantify the apparent optical properties of <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> to evaluate their roles in the mass balance of snow-covered sea ice in the High Arctic. The integrated 350 &#x 2013; 920 nm albedo ranged from 0. 54 to 0. 88, and was primarily dependent on the geophysical properties of snow, but not those of sea ice. This implies that all snow cover was still optically thick, even though snow melting had commenced at all measurement sites. For sea ice about 1. 66 m thick and covered by 2. 5 &#x 2013; 8. 5 cm of snow at the ice camp, the integrated 350 &#x 2013; 920 nm transmittance ranged from 0. 017 to 0. 065. Rapid snow melting resulting from an event of slight drizzle doubled the available solar irradiance under the ice (from ca. 3. 6 to 7. 2 W&#x 00 B 7;m&#x 2212; 2), which further accelerated ice-bottom decay. During the measurement at the camp, the temporally averaged incident solar irradiance at 320 &#x 2013; 950 nm was 110. 6 &#x 00 B 1; 33. 6 W&#x 00 B 7;m&#x 2212; 2, 29. 2 &#x 00 B 1; 2. 9 % of which was absorbed by <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> utilized to melt <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice.</b> The melting of <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice</b> had a distinctly greater effect on the spectral reflection {{and transmission}} for the near-infrared spectrum than for the ultraviolet and visible spectra...|$|R

5|$|Earth has {{undergone}} periodic climate {{shifts in the}} past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include {{the positions of the}} continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.|$|E

The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the cost of the scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in flood prevention, brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56million and the total cost of the project to $91million.|$|E

60|$|It {{was long}} {{a matter of}} {{uncertainty}} as to where and how those immense mountains, that are met with occasionally at sea, were formed. We {{are now in a}} position to tell definitely where they originate, and how they are produced. They are not masses of frozen sea water. Their birth-place is in the valleys of the far north, and they are formed by the accumulation of the <b>snows</b> <b>and</b> <b>ice</b> of ages. This is a somewhat general way of stating the matter; but our subsequent explanations will, we trust, make our meaning abundantly clear.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of light-absorbing aerosol particles deposited on arctic <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice</b> influences the surface albedo, causing greater shortwave absorption, warming, <b>and</b> loss of <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice,</b> lowering the albedo further. The Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM 1) now includes the radiative effects of light-absorbing particles in <b>snow</b> on land <b>and</b> sea <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> in sea <b>ice</b> itself. We investigate the model {{response to the}} deposition of black carbon and dust to both <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice.</b> For these purposes we employ a slab ocean version of CESM 1, using the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM 4), run to equilibrium for year 2000 levels of CO 2 and fixed aerosol deposition. We construct experiments with and without aerosol deposition, with dust or black carbon deposition alone, and with varying quantities of black carbon and dust to approximate year 1850 and 2000 deposition fluxes. The year 2000 deposition fluxes of both dust and black carbon cause 1 – 2 °C of surface warming over {{large areas of the}} Arctic Ocean and sub-Arctic seas in autumn and winter and in patches of Northern land in every season. Atmospheric circulation changes are a key component of the surface-warming pattern. Arctic sea ice thins by on average about 30 cm. Simulations with year 1850 aerosol deposition are not substantially different from those with year 2000 deposition, given constant levels of CO 2. The climatic impact of particulate impurities deposited over land exceeds that of particles deposited over sea ice. Even the surface warming over the sea <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice</b> thinning depends more upon light-absorbing particles deposited over land. For CO 2 doubled relative to year 2000 levels, the climate impact of particulate impurities in <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ice</b> is substantially lower than for the year 2000 equilibrium simulation...|$|R
