5|$|The 1970s {{also saw}} <b>Stoke</b> compete at European Level {{for the first}} time in its history. <b>Stoke</b> {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup in 1972–73 as a result of their League Cup triumph. In the first round, <b>Stoke</b> played Kaiserslautern of Germany: <b>Stoke</b> won the first leg 3–1 at the Victoria Ground, with a crowd of over 22,000. However, the club lost the second leg 4–0, therefore losing 5–3 on aggregate. <b>Stoke</b> qualified for the UEFA Cup two years later, due to their fifth-place finish in the First Division in the 1973–74 season. In the 1974–75 competition, <b>Stoke</b> were again knocked out at the first stage. <b>Stoke</b> drew both legs against Dutch side Ajax, 1–1 and 0–0 respectively, but went out due to the away goals rule.|$|E

Hughes led <b>Stoke</b> to a ninth-place finish in 2013–14, their highest position in the Premier League and best finish since 1974–75. <b>Stoke</b> again finished in ninth position in 2014–15, which ended with a 6–1 victory against Liverpool. Despite breaking their transfer record twice (on Xherdan Shaqiri and then Giannelli Imbula), in 2015–16, <b>Stoke</b> did not make any progression and finished in ninth position for a third season running. <b>Stoke</b> declined in 2016–17, finishing in 13th position.|$|E

Pulis received criticism from some supporters after he fielded a weakened team in the second leg. <b>Stoke</b> ended the 2011–12 season in 14th position in what was perceived to be a disappointing season. The 2012–13 season saw <b>Stoke</b> make little progress, finishing in 13th position. Pulis subsequently left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.|$|E

5|$|<b>Stoke</b> City {{went into}} their first FA Cup Final as underdogs {{according}} to their manager Tony Pulis, while Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini saw in-form Stoke's underdog tag as a risk for complacency from his side. There were fitness doubts over key players for both teams, Carlos Tevez for Manchester City, and Matthew Etherington for <b>Stoke</b> City, who suffered a hamstring tear only 17 days prior to the final, but both were able to start the match. However, <b>Stoke</b> City's underdog tag proved true as Mancini's Manchester City side had the better of the match, with a 59percent share of ball possession and 23 attempts on goal to <b>Stoke</b> City's nine, only {{one of which was}} on target.|$|E

5|$|<b>Stoke</b> {{are also}} a Premier League side and thus entered the {{competition}} at the third round stage, where they were drawn at home to Welsh side Cardiff City. <b>Stoke</b> City made seven changes to the team that played their previous match. Michael Chopra gave Cardiff an early lead, but Stoke's Tuncay Şanlı levelled the score just before half time. <b>Stoke</b> {{had a number of}} chances in the later stages of the match, but Cardiff held out for a replay. In the replay at the Cardiff City Stadium <b>Stoke</b> again used several reserves, changing {{all but one of the}} players from the previous league match. Few chances occurred during the game; the score was 0–0 after 90 minutes, prompting extra time. In the added period, Jonathan Walters scored twice to secure a 2–0 <b>Stoke</b> City win; the first goal was a header from a corner, the second a near-post rebound. <b>Stoke</b> City then travelled to fellow Midlands team Wolverhampton Wanderers for the fourth round, in one of five all-Premier League ties. <b>Stoke</b> defender Robert Huth was a central figure in the match. Ten minutes from time he gave <b>Stoke</b> a 1–0 lead with a header from a free-kick, but in the final minute he conceded a penalty for tripping Nenad Milijaš. Milijaš took the spot-kick himself, but his effort was saved by Thomas Sørensen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stoke</b> {{improved}} {{after the}} break, but Manchester City {{had a key}} opportunity in the 56th minute when a counter-attack led by Carlos Tevez, who drifted out to the right flank, allowed David Silva to find space outside the <b>Stoke</b> City penalty area as the <b>Stoke</b> defence vanished. Tevez managed to pass to Silva, but Silva was guilty of over-elaboration instead of shooting first-time, and the <b>Stoke</b> City defence managed to regroup, dispossessing Silva before he could adjust himself to shoot at goal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stoke</b> made a {{push for}} the title in 1974–75.

Smith scored the only goal of the match against Leicester City on 30 November 1974 to take <b>Stoke</b> top of the table. However, Smith broke his leg {{for the fifth time}} in his career making a red-card {{challenge}} on Mick Lambert in a 2–1 defeat to Ipswich on 18 March 1975; he was the fourth <b>Stoke</b> player to break a leg that season. <b>Stoke</b> ended the season again in fifth place, picking up just two points from their final three matches to finish four points behind champions Derby County.|$|E

5|$|Ball {{struggled}} {{in his first}} season in charge, 1989–90, and his <b>Stoke</b> side were relegated to the third tier of English football after finishing bottom of the Second Division.

Ball kept his job for the start of this campaign but departed in February 1991 {{in the midst of an}} indifferent season that saw <b>Stoke</b> finish in their lowest league position of 14th.|$|E
5|$|Ball's successor, Lou Macari, was {{appointed}} in May 1991, {{prior to the}} start of the 1991–92 season. The improvement was immediate, as <b>Stoke</b> narrowly missed out on promotion in his first season in charge, finishing fourth in the Third Division. He also clinched a cup for the club; the Football League Trophy was won with a 1–0 victory against Stockport County at Wembley; Mark Stein scored the only goal of the game. The following season, 1992–93, promotion was achieved from the third tier, with <b>Stoke</b> finishing as league champions. Stein, a £100,000 purchase from Oxford United, scored 26 goals during the season as <b>Stoke</b> amassed a total of 93 points.

5|$|Born in Meir, Stoke-on-Trent, {{he joined}} local club <b>Stoke</b> City {{as an amateur}} in 1964, making his first-team debut in September 1968.

His bravery as a player meant that he also entered the Guinness Book of Records as the most injured man in football, although he was never able to fully recover after breaking his leg for the fifth time in his career in March 1975.

5|$|Brian Little, {{formerly}} {{manager of}} Aston Villa, took {{charge for the}} 1998–99 season, and <b>Stoke</b> began the season impressively, holding first place until December with six straight wins. The team's form tailed off in the latter stages of the season, leading to Little's departure {{at the end of}} the season. His successor, Gary Megson, was only in the job for four months. Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by <b>Stoke</b> Holding, an Icelandic consortium that purchased a 66 percent share in <b>Stoke</b> City F.C. for £6.6m. The club's new owners appointed the club's first foreign manager, Icelander Gudjon Thordarson, in November 1999.|$|E
5|$|By 1960 <b>Stoke</b> were {{struggling}} to attract supporters to the Victoria Ground, with the average attendance dropping below 10,000 {{for the first time}} in 40 years. Tony Waddington was appointed as the club's manager in June 1960. He joined the club in 1952 as a coach, before being promoted to assistant manager in 1957. In his first season in charge, 1960–61, <b>Stoke</b> finished 18th in the Second Division. Crowds were still low; a match against Preston North End attracted 8,409 in 1961. However, Waddington pulled off a significant coup by enticing Stanley Matthews—now 46 years old—back to the club, 14 years after he had left. A crowd of 35,974 witnessed Matthews' return to the club, only a fortnight after the poor crowd against Preston. The return of Matthews helped <b>Stoke</b> to rise to eighth position in 1961–62. Promotion was achieved in the next season, when <b>Stoke</b> finished as champions. In their first season back in the First Division, 1963–64, Waddington guided <b>Stoke</b> to a mid-table finish. Matthews remained influential, as he helped the club to the Football League Cup final in 1964, although this ended in a 4–3 defeat to Leicester over two legs.|$|E
