The resistance of electroless Ni-P resistors i decreased by pulse heating. It {{was confirmed by}} a micro x-ray diffraction analysis of the resistors after the <b>step</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> that this resistance decrease is due to crystallization of the resistor films.

30|$|The <b>step</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> was {{originally}} used in ERT {{to detect the}} working limits and defects of products. Nelson [7, 75] introduced the hypothesis of cumulative damage, which states {{that the development of}} product damage under the same type of stress and failure mechanism was only related to the current state and current stress level, and was independent of the history of stress loading. Based on this hypothesis, Nelson established a rule of equivalent conversion between the life distributions and test times at different stress levels, and proposed the theory and method of applying the <b>step</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> to the SRT. In SSALT, the main method of estimating the model parameters is still the MLE [7, 75]. Bai [76, 77] and Khamis [78, 79] gradually established the theory and method of planning the V-optimal SSALT with type-I censoring. Although it is theoretically possible to find the optimal stress levels and stress switching times on each step of a SSALT with finite multiple steps, the “simple SSALT” that has only two steps was generally used in practice [76]. However, if one needs to check whether the stress-life relationship is linear or not, he should use a three-step SSALT [78].|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of asymmetrical partial edge disconnection on the Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) of Metalized polypropylene capacitors an experimental study has been made. Theoretical analysis made using PSPICE simulation package reveals that electrode resistance of individual turn rises from 10 to 30 % depending on {{the location of the}} turn. This rise is not measureable at all the frequencies as ESR is frequency dependent and it includes resistance due to electrodes and dielectric losses. Metalized polypropylene capacitors were made with partial edge disconnection at one end (asymmetrical) with different magnitudes of edge disconnection by masking during the process of zinc spraying.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} model the {{relationship}} between failure time and degradation for a simple <b>step</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> where underlying degradation path is linear and different causes of failure are possible. It is assumed that the intensity function depends only on the degradation value. No assumptions are made about {{the distribution of the}} failure times. A simple step-stress test is used to shorten failure time of products and a tampered failure rate (TFR) model is proposed to describe the effect of the changing stress on the intensities. We assume that some of the products that fail during the test have a cause of failure that is only known to belong to a certain subset of all possible failures. This case is known as masking. In the presence of masking, the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the model parameters are obtained through an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm by treating the causes of failure as missing values. The effect of incomplete information on the estimation of parameters is studied through a Monte-Carlo simulation. Finally, a real example is analyzed to illustrate the application of the proposed methods...|$|E
40|$|A {{misunderstanding}} of the failure mechanism of tantalum capacitors has created the fear of using these capacitors in high current applications. A capacitor depends on the dielectric as an insulative material and the plates as a conductive material. If the current was the trigger mechanism for failure, then the plates should be suspect throughout {{the life of the}} capacitor. This is not the case as the failures with this capacitor are normally related to initial power-on occurrences. As such, the failure mechanism is most likely the breakdown of the dielectric when exposed to a specific critical strain for the first time. The high available current ensures that the failure does not heal itself, but breaks down the dielectric so catastrophically that the dielectric loses most of its insulative properties. This Surge <b>Step</b> <b>Stress</b> <b>Test</b> (SSST) is intended to identify the critical stress level of any batch of capacitors to give some predictability to the power-on failure mechanism. Surge Current Failure Reputation Tantalum capacitors have a reputation whereby a great deal of concern is focused on the inrush current magnitude. We have been repeatedly exposed to catastrophic failures in circuits where the current is unlimited and the device fails short and then continues to generate extreme heat as current continues into the fault. The exposure to this failure has led us to recommend that the device have some series resistance as a current limiting function, eliminating almost all of these types of experiences. We associate the failure with high current and we define the fault development as related to current; but we have only identified a secondary characteristic of these failures. The test that was used to support this theory consisted of power-on voltage applications to samples of capacitors using various resistor values to limit the peak current. Because the higher values of series resistance created fewer failures, the conclusion was that the magnitude of the current created the differentiating point of failures...|$|E

The challenge of developing reliable high technology products in a rapid-paced, highly competitive marketplace is discussed. Specific examples of accelerated <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> applied to the Digital Micromirror Device ™ (DMD™) and other Digital Light Processing™ (DLP™) components are reviewed. Delivering reliable products is always a challenge. Further constraints on product development include low cost, rapid time-to-market and limited samples for evaluation. To meet these challenges, innovative and aggressive reliability development techniques must be implemented. The approach implemented by Texas Instruments Digital Imaging program {{is referred to as}} “accelerated <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> ” or AST.

40|$|Power-on failure {{has been}} the {{prevalent}} failure mechanism for solid tantalum capacitors in decoupling applications. A surge <b>step</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> (SSST) has been previously applied to identify the critical stress level of a capacitor batch to give some predictability to the power-on failure mechanism [1]. But SSST can also {{be viewed as an}} electrically destructive test under a time-varying stress (voltage). It consists of rapidly charging the capacitor with incremental voltage increases, through a low resistance in series, until the capacitor under test is electrically shorted. When the reliability of capacitors is evaluated, a highly accelerated life test (HALT) is usually adopted since it is a time-efficient method of determining the failure mechanism; however, a destructive test under a time-varying stress such as SSST is even more time efficient. It usually takes days or weeks to complete a HALT test, but it only takes minutes for a time-varying stress test to produce failures. The advantage of incorporating a specific time-varying stress profile into a statistical model is significant in providing an alternative life test method for quickly revealing the failure mechanism in capacitors. In this paper, a time-varying stress that mimics a typical SSST has been incorporated into the Weibull model to characterize the failure mechanism in different types of capacitors. The SSST circuit and transient conditions for correctly surge testing capacitors are discussed. Finally, the SSST was applied for testing Ta capacitors, polymer aluminum capacitors (PA capacitors), and multi-layer ceramic (MLC) capacitors with both precious metal electrodes (PME) and base metal electrodes (BME). The test results are found to be directly associated with the dielectric layer breakdown in Ta and PA capacitors and are independent of the capacitor values, the way the capacitors were built, and the capacitors manufacturers. The test results also show that MLC capacitors exhibit surge breakdown voltages much higher than the rated voltage and that the breakdown field is inversely proportional to the dielectric layer thickness. The SSST data {{can also be used to}} comparatively evaluate the voltage robustness of capacitors for decoupling applications...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE The real {{insulation}} {{systems are}} often heterogeneous and some times nonlinear. Quality of insulation is accessed {{in terms of}} break down strengths. Partial discharge caused in insulation system by local defects and the resultant overstressing caused by them ultimately lead to breakdown. So the estimation {{has to be done}} properly to save insulation from failure. The use of modern computers in bdv analysis has lead to the estimation based on fuzzy logic modeling. The mamdani fuzzy logic using triangular and trapezoidal mf used for the modeling. The bdv got from the modeling section is used to get the weibull parameters using MLE. The shape parameters are used for the life estimation of the dielectric. DESCRIPTION Fuzzy logic modeling is widely used in those fields where the boundary between having a property and not having it is not sharp. The construction of this model {{can be viewed as a}} process in which a collection of objects called variables and parameters of the model are related by some other objects called the operators of the model. In the present case it is tried to estimate the bdv of dielectrics depending upon various input conditions. The most important source of partial discharge and breakdown in dielectrics is the voids. Voids are produced due to process control errors at the time of production of most of the solid dielectrics. This is a gas discharged event. The test dielectric is taken as leatherite paper and the estimation is based on data experimentally generated in the laboratory using a CIGRE- 2 electrode. The choice of test procedure to know the breakdown voltage of a typical insulation material on insulation system is determined by the test objective. Constant voltage tests provide reliable comprehensive data for the distribution function of the breakdown time but is very time consuming. An accelerated test with increase in voltage stress in discrete steps is quite often used for an electrical insulation study and is widely accepted by the insulation designers. With this method the stress at which the insulation breaks down and time to failure is taken as 6 observed variable The effect of void dimensions on the output is studied and implemented in MATLAB environment. The various steps in modeling include study of the range variation, grouping, rule list generation and simulation. Present system is a MISO system having three inputs (thickness of dielectric, depth and diameter of void) and one output (bdv). The min max algorithm is used as t-norm and s-norm operator. Coa is used for difuzzification. Programming approach is adopted for estimation. The surface plot is plotted to study the variation. Weibull probability has gained wide acceptance in the statistical treatment of time to electrical breakdown of solid dielectrics. It seems to fit experimental data well. MLE is used for parameter estimation. Confidence interval is chosen to get lower and upper limits of the parameters within which the estimation lie for a surety.

The system testing that we are using is not clearly integrated into the process of design and development of safety critical systems.

This study sought to investigate in 25 hypertensive and 16 normotensive male subjects whether relationships operating at rest may be preserved after a central nervous system arousal induced by a mental <b>stress</b> <b>test.</b> As a secondary endpoint, we evaluated the potential changes {{of the components of}} heart rate and blood pressure variability during stress. RESULTS: A significant correlation was observed between components of RR and systolic blood pressure (SBP) variability (p< 0. 0001), after controlling for the subject's status (normotensive vs. hypertensive) and for stress-steps (baseline condition, during <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> and recovery). Moreover, the multiple regression model accounted for the potential effects of the baseline alpha(LF) value and for the baseline heart rate and systolic blood pressure. The relationship operating between the LF/HF(RR) ratio and LF/HF(SBP) ratio was not different either at the different <b>steps</b> of <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> (interaction: p= 0. 87) or in the two groups of normotensive and hypertensive subjects (interaction: p= 0. 76).

40|$|The {{development}} of state-of-the-art AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) has shown much promise for advancing future RF and microwave communication systems. These revolutionary devices demonstrate great potential and superior performance and many commercial companies have demonstrated excellent reliability results based on multiple temperature accelerated <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> However, a physical {{understanding of the}} various reliability limiting mechanisms is lacking and the role and relative contribution of the various intrinsic material factors, such as physical stress and strain has not been clearly explained in the literature. Part of issues that impact device reliability are the mechanical stresses induced in the devices {{as well as the}} self-heating that also limit device performance. Thus, quantification of stress and temperature in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs is of great importance. To address some of the needs for metrology to quantify stress in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, micro-Raman spectroscopy and micro-photoluminescence (micro-PL) were utilized to quantify the residual stress in these devices. Through the use of micro-Raman and micro-PL optical characterization methods, mapping of the vertical and lateral stress distributions in the device channels was performed. Results show that stress can be influenced by the substrate material as well as patterned structures including metal electrodes and passivation layers. Previously developed and reported micro-Raman thermometry methods require an extensive calibration process for each device investigated. To improve the implementation of micro-Raman thermometry, a method was developed which offers both experimental simplicity and high accuracy in temperature results utilizing a universal calibration method that can be applied to a broad range of GaN based devices. This eliminates the need for performing calibration on different devices. By utilizing this technique, it was revealed that under identical power dissipation levels, the bias conditions (combination of Vgs and Vds) alter the heat generation profile across the conductive channel and thus influence the degree of device peak temperature. The role of stress in the degradation of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs was also explored. A combined analysis using micro-Raman spectroscopy, coupled electro-thermo-mechanical simulation, and electrical <b>step</b> <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> was conducted to investigate the link between performance degradation and the evolution of total stress in devices. It was found that in addition to stresses arising from the inverse piezoelectric effect, the substrate induced residual stress and the operational themo-elastic stress in the AlGaN layer {{play a major role in}} determining the onset of mechanically driven device degradation. Overall, these experiments were the first to suggest that a critical level of stress may exist at which point device degradation will start to occur. The optical characterization methods developed in this study show the ability to reveal unprecedented relationships between temperature/stress and device performance/reliability. They can be used as effective tools for facilitating improvement of the reliability of future AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|In {{designing}} accelerated testing plans, cost is {{a factor}} that is missing {{in much of the}} literature. This paper explicits considers cost by developing an optimization model with the objective to minimize costs for a simple <b>step</b> <b>stress</b> accelerated <b>test</b> plan. Two methodologies are employed. One is an optimization approach in which an attempt is made to quantify the behavior of a series-parallel hardware system over all stages of testing using a response surface, and then an optimization model is used to determine the settings for stresses and failure mode modifications for all stages of testing {{prior to the start of}} testing. The second methodology or sequential stage approach is to generate a response surface using data from a completed test stage to determine the settings of stresses and failure mode modifications for the next stage. Then this process is repeated for all stages of testing. When validating the results of the optimization model through simulation, the model overestimated costs. Assuming the simulated optimal settings are the true value of cost, the sequential approach produced suboptimal results. This is because each stage of testing results in narrowing the search parameters of a solution. However, it was found that the sequential stage approach had similar costs to that of the optimization model. Although the optimization model has a better solution, it requires much more data initially whereas the sequential stage approach does not require information about the system for all stages prior to testing. If information of the system 2 ̆ 7 s behavior is known for all stages prior to testing, then the optimization approach is more advantageous, yet most cases have limited information so the sequential stage approach should be utilized...|$|R
