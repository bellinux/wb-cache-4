5|$|Alfred John <b>Shout</b> {{was born}} in Wellington, New Zealand, on 8 August 1882. He was the eldest of nine {{children}} to an English-born father, John Richard <b>Shout,</b> and Irish mother, Agnes Mary (née Kelly, formerly McGovern). Information on Alfred Shout's early life is rather scant and the details differ between sources, but according to his First World War attestation form he was privately educated. In early 1900, <b>Shout</b> travelled to South Africa with his elder half-brother, William McGovern. The brothers sought to join one of the colonial contingents then engaged in the Second Boer War; Alfred enlisted in the newly raised Border Horse on 17 February 1900, while William (using the surname <b>Shout)</b> found a place in Bethune's Mounted Infantry. The Border Horse was an irregular colonial force formed in eastern Cape Colony, and <b>Shout</b> was allotted to the unit's No.1 Company with the service number 9216.|$|E
5|$|<b>Shout</b> {{decided to}} remain in South Africa after his {{discharge}} and, in 1903, enlisted in the Cape Colonial Forces. He was made a sergeant in Prince Alfred's Own Cape Field Artillery, with which he served until 1907. While living in Cape Town, <b>Shout</b> married Rose Alice Howe, an Australian from Sydney, in 1905; the couple had a daughter named Florence in June that year. In 1907, the <b>Shout</b> family immigrated to Australia, settling in the Sydney suburb of Darlington. Here, <b>Shout</b> gained employment as a carpenter and joiner at Resch's Brewery. He also joined the 29th Infantry Regiment of the part-time Citizens' Forces shortly after arriving in Sydney, was a foundation member of the 29th Infantry Club, and a regular visitor at the Randwick rifle range, where he gained a reputation as an excellent shot. <b>Shout</b> was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Citizens' Forces on 16 June 1914.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of an}} {{endeavour}} {{to defeat}} the Ottoman Empire and force a supply route through to Russia via the Bosporus and the Black Sea, the British War Council formulated a plan to invade the Gallipoli Peninsula. On 25 April 1915, {{the men of the}} 1st Australian Brigade—of which the 1st Battalion was part—landed at Anzac Cove between 05:30 and 07:30 among the second and third waves of Australian troops. The 1st Battalion was meant to be held in reserve, but due to heavy casualties and confusion the unit soon went into action. Following a request for reinforcements, <b>Shout</b> moved up with one of the 1st Battalion's companies to the hill feature Baby 700. Arriving at the position around 11:00, he led a party to hold the rear left flank of the hill as part of the Australians' rearguard action. The Australian position on Baby 700 had become dire by that afternoon, a situation compounded by the small number of available infantry in the area and the complete lack of artillery support, when the Turkish forces launched a counter-assault. By this time, <b>Shout</b> and Lieutenant Leslie Morshead of the 2nd Battalion were the only two surviving officers in their sector of the line. At 16:30, the Turks broke through the defensive line and the Australians were forced to abandon their position on the hill. <b>Shout</b> {{was one of the last}} to evacuate, and withdrew down towards the beach. During his retreat, <b>Shout</b> encountered Lieutenant Colonel George Braund, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, on Walker's Ridge. Braund dispatched <b>Shout</b> to the beach with a request for reinforcements. <b>Shout</b> duly relayed the message, and was immediately tasked with leading 200 stray men to reinforce the thin defensive line near Braund's position. <b>Shout</b> established a post at the base of the ridge as dusk began to fall, and his men started to dig in.|$|E
5|$|Born in Wellington, <b>Shout</b> {{had served}} in the Second Boer War as a teenager. He rose to {{sergeant}} and was mentioned in despatches for saving a wounded man before being discharged in 1902. He remained in South Africa for the next five years, serving as an artilleryman in the Cape Colonial Forces from 1903. With his Australian-born wife and their daughter, <b>Shout</b> immigrated to Sydney in 1907. The family settled in Darlington, where <b>Shout</b> worked for Resch's Brewery as a carpenter and joiner. He was also active in the part-time Citizens' Forces, being commissioned just prior to the outbreak of the First World War. In August 1914, he joined in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for active service overseas and was appointed a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion. After training in Egypt, he took part in the Anzac landings at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. For his leadership during the invasion and its immediate aftermath, <b>Shout</b> was awarded the Military Cross and later mentioned in despatches. Shout's three gallantry awards at Gallipoli made him the most highly decorated member of the AIF for the campaign.|$|E

5|$|There was {{considerable}} confusion following Shout's death. Army Headquarters in Melbourne cabled Rose <b>Shout</b> on 15 August to inform her that Alfred had been wounded. Confirmation {{of his death}} was conveyed to her, but was contradicted by a later cable on 23 August. This communication stated that <b>Shout</b> was not dead, but alive and returning to Australia aboard the Thermistocles. The press in Australia published news of his pending return, adding that he would arrive in Sydney in mid-September. This {{proved to be a}} case of mistaken identity. Shout's death was confirmed by 26 August; a Lieutenant A.J. Shirt, also of the 1st Battalion, was the officer aboard the Thermistocles. Rose <b>Shout</b> received a ministerial apology for the clerical errors and distress caused.|$|E
