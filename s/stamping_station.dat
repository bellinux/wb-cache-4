50|$|In 2006 the Irish postal service, An Post, celebrated {{ten years}} of the Irish-language station with a {{commemorative}} <b>stamp.</b> The <b>station</b> also launched a book entitled TG4@10: Deich mBliana de TG4 (Ten Years of TG4).|$|R
40|$|Finding aid {{only for}} Manuscripts Collection 102. World War II {{correspondence}} of Stamps, Bowling Green, Kentucky, includes chiefly letters (99) to Sallie Hills, Bowling Green, Kentucky, and Laura H. Savord (37), Lakeland, Florida. <b>Stamps</b> was <b>stationed</b> at {{military bases in}} Indiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Italy. Also includes letters of George L. Smith, Bowling Green, Kentucky, to Sallie Hills...|$|R
50|$|After Osloer Straße station, {{the line}} {{continues}} along Schwedenstraße, which changes {{its name to}} Residenzstraße shortly before it intersects Reginardstraße. A station was built near the Schäfersee lake. There were many disputes over what to name it; the name finally agreed upon is Franz-Neumann-Platz (Am Schäfersee) (Franz-Neumann-Platz (at the Schäfersee). Like the following stations on the line, this station bears the unmistakable <b>stamp</b> of <b>station</b> architect Rainer Rümmler. On its walls are trees, intended to symbolise the parkland surrounding the lake.|$|R
5000|$|An {{event that}} {{features}} special shows and presentations by locally and nationally known conservationists including Jack Hanna accompanied by many animals, some endangered. The 2017 event will occur every weekend in March {{and all of}} Spring Break. The lineup is SeaWorld Live, Flying High, Jungle Jack Hanna, and finally the new Texas Untamed. It includes activities for children such as a scavenger hunt passport {{which is used to}} get <b>stamps</b> at <b>stations</b> around the park. The Sesame Street show [...] "A" [...] is for Africa and Sesame Street Breakfast is also offered at the Bay of Play.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} silence. It {{was the first time}} the fact that all three {{recognised}} had been put into words, and a faint flush mantled Eveline Annersly's cheeks. Still, her eyes were gentle, and there was no doubt that the bond between the little faded lady, upon whom the <b>stamp</b> of <b>station</b> was plain, and the gaunt prairie farmer, with the hard hands and the bronzed face, sprinkled with the dust of toil, was a wondrous strong one. In England it would, perhaps, have seemed incomprehensible, an anachronism; but amidst the long rows of sheaves he had called up out of the prairie there was nothing strange in their communion. After all, it is manhood that counts in the new Northwest.|$|R
50|$|The {{feeding system}} pushes {{a strip of}} metal (as it unrolls from a coil) {{through all of the}} {{stations}} of a progressive <b>stamping</b> die. Each <b>station</b> performs one or more operations until a finished part is made. The final station is a cutoff operation, which separates the finished part from the carrying web. The carrying web, along with metal that is punched away in previous operations, is treated as scrap metal. Both are cut away, knocked down (or out of the dies) and then ejected from the die set, and in mass production are often transferred to scrap bins via underground scrap material conveyor belts.|$|R
50|$|The kanji {{characters}} for Ayashi are {{the same}} characters as in the name Aiko given to {{the daughter of the}} Crown Prince of Japan. When she was born on December 1, 2001, over a thousand people came to the station to purchase platform tickets as a commemorative souvenir. From April to November 2001, only 124 tickets were sold at the station but from December 7 to December 28, 2001, about 84,000 tickets were sold at the station. JR East began selling commemorative tickets on January 1, 2002, to honor the event showing the station. Each ticket was <b>stamped</b> with the <b>station</b> name and date of purchase automatically.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1960s the use {{of trading}} stamps had spread to the United Kingdom. Entrepreneur Richard Tompkins {{established}} Green Shield Stamps in the United Kingdom. Although based along a similar model, the Green Shield Stamps were independent of S&H Green Stamps but carried a similar trademark. Tompkins' company began selling <b>stamps</b> to filling <b>stations,</b> small retailers and had signed up the Tesco supermarket chain to the Green Shield Stamp franchise in 1963.The S&H Company began offering their stamps in the United Kingdom as well but with the color changed to pink. [...] 1965, the British co-operative movement was offering trading stamps as a new means of allocating patronage dividends to its consumer members.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} code sharing {{agreements}} between airlines and rail lines. These are more formally {{known as an}} air-rail alliance, but more commonly known as [...] "Rail & Fly" [...] due to {{the popularity of the}} Deutsche Bahn codeshare with many airlines. They involve some integration of both types of transport, e.g., in finding out the fastest connection, allowing exchange between an air ticket and a train ticket, or a step further, the air ticket being valid on the train, etc. In Europe these air-rail alliances are used to divide markets by selling these combination tickets abroad for a lower price to attract more customers. The systems also prevent local customers from buying these much cheaper tickets as the customer is only allowed to board the plane with a valid train <b>stamp</b> from a <b>station</b> outside the country.|$|R
60|$|Ill {{luck was}} {{in store for}} the expedition, however. On inquiry at the ticket-office they {{found that there was}} no train for upwards of two hours, and then it was a slow one which would not land them until eight o'clock at Bedsworth. At this piece of {{information}} Tom Dimsdale fairly broke down, and <b>stamped</b> about the <b>station,</b> raving and beseeching the officials to run a special, be the cost what it might. This, however, could by no means be done, owing to the press of Saturday traffic. There was nothing for it but to wait. The three foreigners went off in search of something to eat, and having found a convenient cookshop they disappeared therein and feasted royally at Von Baumser's expense. Major Tobias Clutterbuck remained with the young man, who resolutely refused to leave the platform. The major knew of a snug little corner not far off where he could have put in the time very comfortably, but he could not bring himself to desert his companion even for a minute. I have no doubt that that wait of two hours in the draughty station is marked up somewhere to the old sinner's credit account.|$|R
40|$|Queuing {{theory is}} a major topic of applied {{mathematics}} that deals with phenomenon of waiting and arises {{from the use of}} powerful mathematical analysis to describe production processes. This study examines the use of production capacity of facilities in Fujitsu Components (M) Sdn. Bhd. based on queuing theory. The aim {{of this study is to}} achieve an appropriate queuing analytical model and determine its performance measures by analyzing the capacity requirements and estimating manufacturing cycle times. Field study has been conducted in several production departments in Fujitsu Components (M) and production data has been collected through selftiming, past collected data and recorded data approach. The production processes has been simplified into seven independent series of <b>stations,</b> which are <b>Stamping,</b> Riveting, Cutting, Bending, Packing and two Inspection stations. The capacity requirement has been determined by utilization factor where the benchmark equal to one. This study then represents the data in form of queuing analytical model to analyze the performance measures. The queuing analytical model later identified that all stations having enough capacity (uj < 1) to achieved the production planned with slightly higher utilization occur in <b>stamping</b> and riveting <b>stations.</b> Several suggestions have been discussed in order to improve the performance measures. Results for this study clearly show that queuing theory is very useful and practical in evaluating the capacity requirement of the production system facilities. </p...|$|R
50|$|The CTS {{has several}} {{different}} tickets available to satisfy different needs. There is no {{division of the}} network into pricing zones; instead, a single fare is offered, costing €1.60, allowing the holder to travel from any station to another, including transfers, regardless of distance. Tickets are not valid after the journey; they are <b>stamped</b> at the <b>station</b> just before entering the tram (on bus services, tickets are stamped inside the bus). They are sold individually and in packs of ten and thirty, at a discount of 15% and 19% respectively. A ticket is sold for €3.90 (or €30.90 for the pack of ten) which works like regular system, but also allows travel on the TER train to Strasbourg Airport. There are also return tickets, which are 10% cheaper than the price of two singles. The ‘24h individuel Alsa’ ticket allows one person to make an unlimited number of journeys {{in a period of}} 24 hours at a cost of €4 while the ‘24h Trio’ ticket provides the same service to three people, at a price of €5.70. These last two tickets are also valid on TER trains travelling in the Urban Community of Strasbourg and include the nearby town of Kehl. Tram tickets are sold at numerous points in the city, such as newsagents, post offices, tobacconists etc.|$|R
