5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> then leave the cell.|$|E

This terminal has facilities for containers, bulk cargo, and refrigerated and frozen storage, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> handle the import and export of many commodities. In 2009 the Port of San Diego handled 1,137,054 short tons of total trade; foreign trade accounted for 956,637 short tons while domestic trade amounted to 180,417 short tons.|$|E
5|$|Other {{arthropods}} {{may make}} use of the antlion larva's ability to trap prey. The larva of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female chalcid wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax.|$|E

5|$|Sub-Commander T'Pol orders Enterprise to 'Sphere 41', in {{an attempt}} to destroy the entire sphere network. They arrive to find that the Sphere Builders have created a {{distortion}} field around it. Doctor Phlox determines that 12–15 minutes exposure will kill the crew. Undeterred, Commander Tucker modifies the deflector dish <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be used to destroy the sphere. As they approach, two Guardians arrive and begin damaging the ship's systems, but they cannot prevent its destruction. It implodes, setting off a chain reaction that successfully destroys the rest of the spheres, ending all spatial anomalies in the region.|$|E
5|$|The ReactOS and the Wine {{projects}} {{share the}} goal to run binary Windows software natively and can share therefore many dependencies and development. ReactOS uses {{portions of the}} Wine project <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> benefit from Wine's progress in implementing the Win32 API. While Wine's NTDLL, USER32, KERNEL32, GDI32, and ADVAPI32 components cannot be used directly by ReactOS due to architectural differences, code snippets of them and other parts can be shared between both projects. The kernel is developed by ReactOS separately as Wine relies here on existing Unix-like kernels.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal is to}} {{increase}} the park's value and available money <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be sold and a new lot purchased from another part of the world to start a new theme park. Once enough money has been made, the player can auction the park and move on to newer plots, located worldwide and having different factors affecting gameplay, including the economy, weather, terrain and land value. The Mega Drive and SNES versions feature different settings (e.g. desert and glacier) depending on the park's location.|$|E

5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it {{to keep pace with}} changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.|$|E

5|$|When {{breeding}} is over, the {{black-necked grebe}} usually partakes in a moult migration to saline lakes. It especially prefers lakes {{with large numbers}} of invertebrate prey, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> fatten up while moulting and before going on its winter migration. Some birds, although, moult when on the breeding grounds, but most do not moult {{until the end of the}} moult migration. This migration is dangerous, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of birds being killed by snowstorms when traveling to places such as Mono Lake.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, {{a reference to the}} energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, May 25, 1941, {{ground was}} broken for Mount St. Peter Church. The event was celebrated by the priests of St. Peter's {{congregation}} and about two thousand {{people showed up}} to watch. The cornerstone was blessed on Sunday, September 7, 1941, by Reverend Alfred Koch, who was the Arch Abbot of St. Vincent in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Many other priests from the area were also present. Father Paul Tomlinson of St. Peter's Church in Pittsburgh delivered the sermon in English and Archabbot Koch closed the ceremony with the Pontifical Benediction in Italian. The large red cornerstone was made of granite and was fitted with an iron box. The box contained the memorial reports of the congregation, newspapers, American and Papal coins, and medals of the church. The cornerstone was placed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be seen from inside the church. It is located by the altar of the Sacred Heart.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} in Shaw and Crompton is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester. Shaw and Crompton had {{a railway}} line and station between 1863 and 2009, opened initially for haulage, but later used for passenger and commuter journeys. Shaw and Crompton railway station {{was used by}} passenger trains running between Rochdale and Manchester on the Oldham Loop Line. After initially being rejected in the early 2000s, plans to turn the line into part of the light-rail Metrolink system were accepted by the government on 6 July 2006. Shaw and Crompton railway station closed on 3 October 2009, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be converted from use with heavy rail to Metrolink.

Back on the Normandy, Shepard speaks with the Illusive Man, who is either pleased or furious with Shepard's decision. As Shepard meets in the Normandys cargo bay with the survivors, Joker gives the Commander schematics of a Reaper. Humanity now has the full attention of the Reapers, who awaken in dark space and descend upon the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The pupal {{transformation}} into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings {{visible on the}} outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.|$|E
5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
