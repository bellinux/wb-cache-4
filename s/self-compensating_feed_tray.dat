50|$|The {{weapon is}} fed from the {{left-hand}} side by disintegrating-link M27 ammunition belts (a miniaturized version of the 7.62mm M13 belt), from either an unsupported loose belt, enclosed in a polymer ammunition box with a 200-round capacity attached {{to the base of}} the receiver, or from detachable STANAG magazines, used in other NATO 5.56 mm assault rifles such as the M16 and FNC. Magazine feeding is used only as an auxiliary measure, when belted ammunition has been exhausted. The ammunition belt is introduced into the <b>feed</b> <b>tray,</b> magazines are seated inside the magazine port at a 45° angle, located beneath the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> port. When a belt is placed in the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> it covers the magazine port. Likewise, a magazine inserted into the magazine well will prevent the simultaneous insertion of a belt. The magazine port, when not in use, is closed with an L-shaped hinged flap equipped with a tooth, which engages a corresponding opening in the magazine and serves as a magazine release. This feature was developed by FN's Maurice V. Bourlet and allows the Minimi to be instantly changed from belt feed to magazine feed without any modification.|$|R

50|$|The Barrett 240LWS {{features}} a removable and telescoping buttstock, that can has 6 adjustable positions. It {{differs from the}} buttstock of the 240LW by being half of its size in length, and doesn't have a polymer cheek piece. There are two telescoping rods that allows the buttstock to be extended to the desired position, when depressed from the top portion. The rods have indentations on them, which lock into positional latches within {{the rear of the}} buttstock. The hydraulic buffer is permanently encased within the stock and is necessary for recoil reduction from the reciprocating movement of the bolt group. Early prototypes had steel QD sling sockets {{on both sides of the}} stock, however current production versions will have solid steel sling loops on either side of it. This is to alleviate any damage that may occur to a sling mounted on the QD socket, and the amount of stress that it could take while carrying the machine gun. It also {{features a}} Picatinny rail that is longer compared to the Picatinny rail of the M240 machine guns, and where the Barrett M107A1 rear sight can be mounted and other various optics. The design of the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> cover hinge has been altered to be in the shape of a hexagon, thus allowing for the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> cover to be able to stay open while at a 45 degree angle to the receiver, while the machine gunner is loading a belt of ammunition. The <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> has also been altered, with two protruding spring-loaded teeth which can bend in the direction of the ammunition belt. These teeth allows the operator to securely place a belt of ammunition on the <b>feed</b> <b>tray,</b> while at an upright angle, and not have the belt slip out while closing the cover. In addition they allow the operator to be able to squeeze the front of the belt into a closed cover because the teeth only bends in the direction of the belt, and the belt will pass over them, then the teeth will click upwards, thus locking the belt in place. Another click forward, and the belt of ammunition will be in place to fire. This allows the operator to feed a belt of ammunition into his 240LWS without ever having to possibly expose his position or line of sight, by opening the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> cover.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a short {{method for}} the design of {{reactive}} distillation is presented.

50|$|In the belt-fed configuration, belt {{movement}} {{is produced by}} a roller riding in the channeled feed arm and is actuated by the reciprocating movement of the bolt. The spring-loaded feed arm is protected by a hinged top cover and is pivoted at its rear end. As the bolt travels back, {{the front end of}} the feed arm moves across the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> and operates a lever attached to a single set of spring-loaded pawls. These pawls move a cartridge and link over the <b>feed</b> <b>tray’s</b> stop pawl from where they are positioned onto the slotted feed path and held firmly in place by a spring-powered steel plate in the top cover. The cartridge is then pushed out of its link and the empty link is discarded through the link ejection port which is held closed by a spring-loaded dust cover.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{minimization}} of the {{entropy production}} {{is equivalent to}} minimizing the work or energy consumption required by a separation process. Sources of entropy creation during the extractive distillation of a minimum- and maximum boiling azeotropic mixture with a heavy entrainer are evaluated at each column stage {{in accordance with the}} second law of thermodynamics, and the distribution of entropy flow in different sections of the column is analyzed. Results show that mixing on <b>feed</b> <b>trays</b> and heat exchange in the reboiler and condenser are the main sources of entropy production. The temperature of the main feed and entrainer feed does not significantly affect the irreversibility of the process at the reference temperature of all flows. Although optimal values can be proposed to achieve a minimum isothermal work, the energy loss of the real process steadily increases with increases in the entrainer/feed flow rate ratio and reflux.

50|$|The weapon feeds {{from the}} left side from open-link, metal {{ammunition}} belts: either the American disintegrating M13 belt (NATO standard) or the segmented German DM1 belt, whose 50-round sections can be linked through a cartridge. In order to adapt the weapon to feed from one belt type to the other, several components of the feed mechanism need to be reconfigured since the position of the <b>feed</b> <b>tray's</b> cartridge stop and pawl angles in the top cover are different. The MAG features a pawl-type feeding mechanism that continues to move the feed link during both the rearward and forward cycles of the reciprocating bolt carrier, producing a smooth belt flow. The feeding mechanism's three pawls are actuated by a roller connected to the bolt carrier. The feed channel rail, feed link, both feed slides and the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> are chrome plated. The top cover body is an anodized aluminum casting. In the infantry assault role, the weapon can be fitted with a sheet metal container that houses a 50-round belt and is attached to {{the left side of the}} receiver.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{assembly}} of bolt, barrel and barrel extension recoiled {{to the rear of}} the gun upon firing, the locking block was drawn out of engagement by a cam in the bottom of the gun's receiver. The recoiling barrel extension struck the [...] "accelerator" [...] assembly, a half-moon shaped spring-loaded piece of metal pivoting from the receiver below the bolt and behind the barrel extension. The tips of the accelerator's two curving fingers engaged the bottom of the bolt and caused it to move rapidly to the rear. The extractor-ejector was a mechanism that pivoted over the front of the bolt, with a claw that gripped the base of the next round in the belt. A camming track in the left side of the receiver caused this to move down as the bolt moved back, lowering the next round down on top of the fired case, pushing it straight down out of the extraction grooves of the bolt face through the ejection port. A spring in the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> cover pushed the extractor-ejector down onto the next round, so if the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> cover was opened, the extractor-ejector would be pulled upwards if the belt needed to be removed.|$|R

40|$|Diabatic {{distillation}} is {{a separation}} {{process in which}} heat is transferred inside the column as opposed to classical adiabatic columns where heat is only supplied to the reboiler and extracted from the condenser. Recent works have shown that such diabatic columns dramatically reduce the exergy needed to perform the separation. The present research considers a particular implementation of diabatic columns particularly suitable for retrofitting applications. The implementation uses a single heating fluid circulating in series below the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> and a single cooling fluid circulating in series above the <b>feed</b> <b>tray.</b> The optimal control is determined in a simulation-based optimization. This is a difficult optimization because traditional algorithms for optimization invariably get stuck. However, an algorithm based on physical intuition for adjusting the temperature profile can find the optimum. This algorithm does not guarantee convergence in all cases, but usually manages to find the optimum by varying the initial state. The resulting operation is compared to the optimal operation with independent heat transfer to each tray (the completely controlled diabatic column) and to a conventional adiabatic column. In the former comparison, we find how much exergy is lost by circulating a fluid in series rather than using independently adjustable heat exchanges. In the latter, we find the possible saving...|$|R

This ammunition container has a transparent rear wall that allows the gunner to monitor ammunition levels visually.

50|$|Clearing {{the weapon}} is {{performed}} {{by ensuring that}} the bolt is locked to the rear and the weapon is on safe. The top cover is then lifted, the remaining belt (if any) is swept out of the <b>feed</b> <b>tray,</b> the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> is lifted to visually inspect the chamber and {{the face of the}} bolt. Any links or brass casings are removed. The weapon is now clear. In the extremely unlikely event that a live round is on the bolt face, it is knocked loose with a cleaning rod or another rigid object. If there is a live round lodged in the barrel, the operator must immediately decide if the barrel is hot enough that there is a chance of it cooking off. If there is, he will immediately move his face away from the opening of the weapon; and aiming the gun is a direction that is perceived to take the least amount of damage and/or casualties should the event of a cook-off occur. He should then wait for the barrel to cool off before attempting to remove it. He can also attempt to extract the round by closing the cover, taking the weapon off of safe, and pulling the trigger. This will likely causing the weapon to fire, so care should be made in ensuring that the weapon is first pointed in a safe direction.|$|R

40|$|When foraging, {{animals can}} {{maximize}} their fitness {{if they are}} able to tailor their foraging decisions to current environmental conditions. When making foraging decisions, individuals need to assess the benefits of foraging while accounting for the potential risks of being captured by a predator. However, whether and how different factors interact to shape these decisions is not yet well understood, especially in individual foragers. Here we present a standardized set of manipulative field experiments in the form of foraging assays in the tropical lizard Anolis cristatellus in Puerto Rico. We presented male lizards with foraging opportunities to test how the presence of conspecifics, predation-risk perception, the abundance of food, and interactions among these factors determines the outcome of foraging decisions. In Experiment 1, anoles foraged faster when food was scarce and other conspecifics were present near the <b>feeding</b> <b>tray,</b> while they took longer to feed when food was abundant and when no conspecifics were present. These results suggest that foraging decisions in anoles are the result of a complex process in which individuals assess predation risk by using information from conspecific individuals while taking into account food abundance. In Experiment 2, a simulated increase in predation risk (i. e., distance to the <b>feeding</b> <b>tray)</b> confirmed the relevance of risk perception by showing that the use of available perches is strongly correlated with the latency to feed. We found Puerto Rican crested anoles integrate instantaneous ecological information about food abundance, conspecific activity and predation risk, and adjust their foraging behavior accordingly...|$|R
50|$|Many modern {{ammunition}} belts use disintegrating links. Disintegrating links {{retain a}} single round and are articulated with the round {{ahead of it}} in the belt. When the round ahead is stripped from the belt and fed into the feed system or chamber, the link holding it is ejected and the link holding the following round is disarticulated. Many disintegrating belt designs allow two pieces of belt to be connected by a cartridge, it applies even to non-disintegrating belts. When done by assistant gunner in combat, linking new belt {{to the end of the}} belt already being fed in the weapon allows for continuous fire without the need to open the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> and reload.|$|R

Early M60s also had driving spring guides and operating rods that were too thin and gas pistons that were too narrow behind the piston head (part {{of an attempt to}} save weight), leading to problems with breakage. Metallurgical problems also played a part, (blamed by some on low-bid contractors), but after 1970 a slightly heavier part was designed and slowly put into the supply chain. High-round-count weapons were also susceptible to stretching of the receiver and other parts.|$|R

When in the belt-fed role, {{the weapon}} would feed from a disintegrating metallic linked belt marked [...] "S-63 BRW" [...] {{which is a}} scaled-down version of the U.S. M13 link developed for the M60 GPMG. The Stoner 63/63A will not work reliably with the later M27 link developed for the M249 SAW. The belt is normally contained in a 150-round plastic ribbed container that has a tab allowing it to be clipped on {{to the side of}} the left-hand <b>feed</b> <b>tray.</b> Early ammunition boxes were olive drab in color and manufactured at Costa Mesa, this later changed to a black-colored plastic container made in Warren, Michigan. Stoner 63A boxes were also black but had a reduced capacity of 100 rounds as the larger container would unbalance the rifle. These can either be attached to the left-hand <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> or held in a bottom box carrier when using the right-hand feed mechanism. Several drum-type belt carriers were designed for the left-hand feed system, with a 150-round drum container being the most popular and used frequently by SEALS in Vietnam. A 250-round drum carrier was also developed by NAWS China Lake, but this proved too heavy and cumbersome. SEALS would also resort to converting RPD belt carriers for use with their Stoners. The detachable magazines used in the Rifle, Carbine and Automatic Rifle models are fabricated from steel and weigh 8 oz unloaded. In an effort to reduce weight, aluminum magazines were later developed cutting the weight down to 4 oz.
