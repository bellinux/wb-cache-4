50|$|A Hose Reel is a {{cylindrical}} spindle made {{of either}} metal, fiberglass, or plastic {{and is used}} for storing a hose. The most common styles of hose reels are <b>spring</b> <b>driven</b> (which is self retracting), hand crank, or motor driven. Hose reels are categorized by the diameter and length of the hose they hold, the pressure rating and the rewind method. Hose reels can either be fixed in a permanent location, or portable and attached to a truck, trailer, or cart.|$|E
50|$|A problem {{throughout}} the history of <b>spring</b> <b>driven</b> clocks and watches is that the force (torque) provided by a spring is not constant, but diminishes as the spring unwinds (see graph). Timepieces, however, have to run at a constant rate to keep accurate time. Timekeeping mechanisms are never perfectly isochronous, meaning their rate is affected by changes in the drive force. This was especially true of the primitive verge and foliot type used before the advent of the balance spring in 1657. So early clocks slowed down as the mainspring ran down.|$|E

50|$|Seiko's {{efforts to}} combine the quartz and {{mechanical}} movements bore fruit after 20 years of research, leading {{to the introduction of}} the Seiko <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive,</b> first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in September 2005. The <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery, using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring, without the need for a balance wheel either.|$|R

50|$|The fusee was a {{much longer}} lasting innovation. This was a {{cone-shaped}} pulley that was turned by a chain wrapped around the mainspring barrel. Its curving shape continuously changed the mechanical advantage of the linkage to even out {{the force of the}} mainspring as it ran down. Fusees became the standard method of getting constant torque from a mainspring. They were used in most <b>spring</b> <b>driven</b> clocks and watches from their first appearance until the 19th century when the going barrel took over, and in marine chronometers until the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was the son}} of a watchmaker and christened Heinrich Wilhelm Kilfitt. He {{spent his}} early youth {{repairing}} watches and taking an interest in optics and photography. At the optical company R. Neumann in Berlin he was hired as the head of the Photography department. Combining his watch repair and photography skills he designed the <b>spring</b> <b>driven</b> Robot camera for H. H. Berning in 1930 for fast series of single frame photographs. In the early 1950s he conceived the very compact 35mm SLR Mecaflex camera to be manufactured by Metz Apparantenfabik in Fürth, Germany. In 1964 he established the Kilfitt Optische Fabrik in Munich.|$|E
5000|$|Spring-driven clocks {{appeared}} {{during the}} 15th century, although they are often erroneously credited to Nuremberg watchmaker Peter Henlein (or Henle, or Hele) around 1511. [...] The earliest existing <b>spring</b> <b>driven</b> clock is the chamber clock given to Phillip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, around 1430, now in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum. Spring power presented clockmakers with a new problem: {{how to keep the}} clock movement running at a constant rate as the spring ran down. This resulted in the invention of the stackfreed and the fusee in the 15th century, and many other innovations, down to the invention of the modern going barrel in 1760.|$|E
50|$|Before Poplar Springs Road (now Poplar <b>Springs</b> <b>Drive)</b> was a street, it was {{a cattle}} trail. Around {{the turn of the}} 20th century there was a spring north of Meridian, and cattle would travel on the path that is now Poplar <b>Springs</b> <b>Drive</b> to get to the spring. This is the reason that the street doesn't follow the same layout pattern {{as the rest of the}} city; the cattle's path gives the street its curvy shape.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movement}} uses a mainspring as {{a source}} of energy and transmits it through gear train just like a traditional mechanical watch, but instead of an escapement and balance wheel, Seiko used the newly developed [...] "Tri-synchro regulator", which acts like a quartz movement. The Tri-synchro regulator has three main function: controlling the mechanical energy of the mainspring, generate electricity for the low consumption (~25 nanowatts) quartz crystal oscillator and generate a magnetic force to regulate the glide wheel. By replacing the traditional escapement with magnetic brake, the <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> operates with lower noise and present a glide motion hand that shows continuous flow of time. The <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> movement was also used {{as the basis for the}} first ever watch designed to be worn by an astronaut during a space walk, the aptly named Seiko <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> Spacewalk.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{neighborhood}} was developed by 1912, but one remaining parcel was a 12 acre bell-shaped tract, {{the site of the}} original mansion, which had been converted to a school. The parcel was developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s as a signature feature of {{the neighborhood}}. The <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive</b> mansions, recognizable by their 200 ft front yards, are perched atop large hills. One of Louisville's most famous Derby parties - the Barnstable Brown Party - is held at a home on <b>Spring</b> <b>Drive.</b>|$|R
50|$|Forced {{dithering}} can largely {{overcome this}} problem. The ring laser cavity is rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise about its axis using a mechanical <b>spring</b> <b>driven</b> at its resonance frequency. This {{ensures that the}} angular velocity {{of the system is}} usually far from the lock-in threshold. Typical rates are 400 Hz, with a peak dither velocity of 1 arc-second per second. Dither does not fix the lock-in problem completely, as each time the direction of rotation is reversed, a short time interval exists in which the rotation rate is near zero and lock-in can briefly occur. If a pure frequency oscillation is maintained, these small lock-in intervals can accumulate. This was remedied by introducing noise to the 400 Hz vibration.|$|E
50|$|Any {{escapement}} with {{sliding friction}} will need lubrication, but as this deteriorates the friction will increase, and, perhaps, insufficient power will {{be transferred to}} the timing device. If the timing device is a pendulum, the increased frictional forces will decrease the Q factor, increasing the resonance band, and decreasing its precision. For <b>spring</b> <b>driven</b> clocks, the impulse force applied by the spring changes as the spring is unwound, following Hooke's law. For gravity driven clocks, the impulse force also increases as the driving weight falls and more chain suspends the weight from the gear train; in practice, however, this effect is only seen in large public clocks, and it can be avoided by a closed-loop chain.|$|E
50|$|Power source - This {{is usually}} {{identical}} to the device that powers the clock's timekeeping mechanism: in weight driven clocks it is a second weight on a cord (P), in <b>spring</b> <b>driven</b> clocks it is another mainspring. Although older one-day (30-hour) clocks often used a single weight or mainspring to drive both the timekeeping and striking trains, better clocks used a separate power source, because the striking mechanism consumes {{a lot of power}} and often has to be wound more frequently, and also to isolate the delicate timekeeping train from the large movements that occur in the striking train. Winding a striking clock requires winding both the timing and striking parts separately.|$|E
