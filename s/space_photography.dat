500|$|The In Rainbows artwork was {{designed}} by Stanley Donwood, {{who has worked with}} Yorke to design Radiohead's album art since 1994. Donwood worked in the studio as Radiohead were working on the album, which allowed the mood of the music to be conveyed in the album artwork, and regularly put up images in the studio and on the studio computer for the band to interact with and comment on. He also posted images daily on the Radiohead website, though none were used in the final album artwork.

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} direct {{intended}} use of chiaroscuro in filmmaking would be Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. When informed that no lens currently had a wide enough aperture to shoot a costume drama set in grand palaces using only candlelight, Kubrick bought and retrofitted a special lens for these purposes: a modified Mitchell BNC camera and a Zeiss lens manufactured for the rigors of <b>space</b> <b>photography,</b> with a maximum aperture of f/.7. The naturally unaugmented lighting situations in the film exemplified low-key, natural lighting in filmwork at its most extreme outside of the Eastern European/Soviet filmmaking tradition (itself exemplified by the harsh low-key lighting style employed by Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein).|$|E

In fact, he also holds the record for being the first person to vomit in space. He was the first to pilot a spaceship personally and he made the first manual photographs from orbit, thus setting a record for modern <b>space</b> <b>photography.</b> He also was the first person to film the Earth using, for ten minutes, a professional quality Konvas-Avtomat movie camera.

50|$|Desire Machine Collective is a {{group of}} media {{practitioners}} based in Guwahati. Collaborating since 2004 as Desire Machine Collective, Sonal Jain and Mriganka Madhukaillya employ film, video, sound, <b>space,</b> <b>photography</b> and objects in their installation and works. Their experiments {{with a wide range of}} media techniques and strategies with the aim of probing narratives and modes of representations, infused with a political character lend them a uniqueness that contributed to their growth as one of the leading artist collaboratives in India’s contemporary art scene. Their works have been showcased at some major international festivals and renowned museums. They were a part of the inaugural Indian Pavilion at the 54th International Art exhibition of the Venice Biennale and nominated for the LUMA award along with experimental cinema legends Jonas Mekas and Kenneth Anger. Their artworks have been exhibited at the Solomon Guggenheim Museum New York and the Deutsche Guggenheim Museum, Berlin. Over the years, they have created alternate spaces for art practices, ‘Periferry’ being the most interesting of them. It is located on a ferry, on river Brahmaputra, docked in Guwahati. Working with redundant spaces, that are dysfunctional, the project has activated a disused ferry and converted it into a space for research and aims to create a public space and public domain, physical as well as virtual for critical reflections.|$|E
