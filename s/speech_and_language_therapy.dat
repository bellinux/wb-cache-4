25|$|Studies of {{interventions}} have some methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that {{some form of}} treatment is preferable to no treatment, the systematic reviews have reported that the quality of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children with ASD acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often can improve functioning, and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. Available approaches include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapy,</b> social skills therapy, and occupational therapy. Educational interventions have some effectiveness in children: intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children, and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. The limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{benefits}} of neuropsychological assessment for evaluating a brain-injured person’s functional abilities and rehabilitation needs. The importance of early assessment in addressing these goals is discussed. Strengths and weaknesses of neuropsychological assessment for predicting a person’s ability to participate in normal activities of daily living are considered. Test data taken alone often lack ecological validity, but nevertheless, specific test findings can be used to predict functional skills. The ecological validity of neuropsychological testing can be extended by observing the patient’s approach to tasks in the assessment environment and by observing the patient in his or her normal activities. Evaluation information obtained by allied rehabilitation professionals, including occupational <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapies,</b> can be integrated with neuropsychological test data to both extend the generalizability of our findings and to validate hypotheses generated from our test data.

40|$|The {{experiences}} {{of women who}} stammer have not been explored for over 30 years, with most stammering research recruiting only men and not differentiating the results by gender.

Furthermore, <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapies</b> (SLT) that are based on this research are arguably inappropriate in addressing the {{experiences of}} women who stammer. In light of the above, this study aimed to explore the experiences of women who stammer, whilst taking into account the influence of societal gender norms on these experiences. 12 women were recruited from either the British Stammering Association (BSA) or the City Lit (college that offers SLT).

25|$|For {{most people}} with stroke, {{physical}} therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) are the cornerstones of the rehabilitation process. Often, assistive technology such as wheelchairs, walkers and canes may be beneficial. Many mobility problems can be improved {{by the use of}} ankle foot orthoses. PT and OT have overlapping areas of expertise; however, PT focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and relearning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions. Physiotherapists can also work with patients to improve awareness and use of the hemiplegic side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and patient’s goals. One example physiotherapists employ to promote motor learning involves constraint-induced movement therapy. Through continuous practice the patient relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes. OT is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting. <b>Speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapy</b> is appropriate for people with the speech production disorders: dysarthria and apraxia of speech, aphasia, cognitive-communication impairments, and problems with swallowing.|$|E
25|$|Both hemispheres of {{the brain}} make a {{contribution}} to the McGurk effect. They work together to integrate speech information that is received through the auditory and visual senses. A McGurk response is more likely to occur in right-handed individuals for whom the face has privileged access to the right hemisphere and words to the left hemisphere. In people that have had callosotomies done, the McGurk effect is still present but significantly slower. In people with lesions to the left hemisphere {{of the brain}}, visual features often {{play a critical role in}} <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapy.</b> People with lesions in the left hemisphere of the brain show a greater McGurk effect than normal controls. Visual information strongly influences speech perception in these people. There is a lack of susceptibility to the McGurk illusion if left hemisphere damage resulted in a deficit to visual segmental speech perception. In people with right hemisphere damage, impairment on both visual-only and audio-visual integration tasks is exhibited, although they are still able to integrate the information to produce a McGurk effect. Integration only appears if visual stimuli is used to improve performance when the auditory signal is impoverished but audible. Therefore, there is a McGurk effect exhibited in people with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain but the effect is not as strong as a normal group.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there are}} {{relatively}} few studies of rehabilitation in MS, its general effectiveness, when {{conducted by a}} team of specialists, has been clearly demonstrated in other diseases such as stroke or head trauma. As for any patient with neurologic deficits, a multidisciplinary approach is key to limiting and overcoming disability; however there are particular difficulties in specifying a 'core team' because people with MS may need help from almost any health profession or service at some point. Neurologists are mainly involved in the diagnosis and ongoing management of [...] multiple sclerosis, and any exacerbations. The comprehensive rehabilitation process for patients with multiple sclerosis is generally managed by physiatrists. Allied treatments such as physiotherapy, <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapy</b> or occupational therapy can also help to manage some symptoms and maintain quality of life. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional distress and clinical depression should involve mental health professionals such as therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists, while neuropsychologists can help to evaluate and manage cognitive deficits.|$|E
40|$|As {{recently}} as four decades ago, children with Down Syndrome were {{not expected to}} live until adulthood.

As for any person with neurologic deficits, a multidisciplinary approach is key to optimising outcome. Physiatrists or neurologists are likely to be the key medical staff involved, but depending on the person, doctors of other medical specialties may also be helpful. Allied health professions such as physiotherapy, <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapy,</b> cognitive rehabilitation therapy, and occupational therapy will be essential to assess function and design the rehabilitation activities for each person.

2500|$|The {{intensity}} of aphasia therapy {{is determined by}} the length of each session, total hours of therapy per week, and total weeks of therapy provided. There is no consensus about what “intense” aphasia therapy entails, or how intense therapy should be to yield the best outcomes. Overall, treatment is considered more intense when total therapy hours per week are increased, and on average, research suggests more intense therapy leads to better outcomes. [...] For example, one study found that patients who were treated for 8.8 hours a week for 11.2 weeks progressed more than patients who were treated 2 hours a week for 22.9 weeks. Results of another study corroborate these findings. The researchers found that patients who received intensive therapy of 100 treatment hours over 62 weeks scored higher on language measures than the control group who received less intensive therapy. However, a Cochrane review of <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapy</b> for people with aphasia revealed a more nuanced finding. The review found that treatments that are higher intensity, higher dose or over a long duration of time led to significantly better functional communication but people were more likely to drop out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to: {{understand}} how people with acquired low vision (subnormal vision) used written language in daily living <b>and</b> to recommend <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> pathology <b>therapy</b> during the process. A descriptive/exploratory study was conducted in order to build a data collection instrument. The sample was composed of subjects with low vision who attended Cepre/FCM/Unicamp in 2008. A questionnaire was applied during an interview, during which time the following variables were investigated: personal characteristics, use of assistive technology in reading and writing, reasons for performing reading and writing activities and the frequency of reading and writing after having acquired the visual loss. The sample was made up of 8 subjects with acquired low vision. The mean age was 47 years, of which 75, 0 % were males. Most of the subjects (62, 5 %) declared they used optical aids to read. All reported they used non-optical aids to read. The results showed that the subjects reported that they used to read to get information on topics of interest and they write to communicate with other people. The majority (75, 0 %) reported they didn't read and write with the same frequency as before the emergence of the ophthalmic problem and the reason given was difficulty in seeing and eyestrain. The reduction of reading and writing for individuals with low vision justifies the need for greater emphasis on working with reading and writing during rehabilitation, and this can be enhanced by <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> pathology <b>therapy...</b>|$|R

40|$|Approximately 40 % of {{patients}} diagnosed with stroke experience {{some degree of}} aphasia. With limited health care resources, patients' access to <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapies</b> is often delayed. We propose using mobile-platform technology to initiate early speech-language therapy in the acute care setting. For this pilot, our objective {{was to assess the}} feasibility of a tablet-based speech-language therapy for patients with communication deficits following acute stroke. We enrolled consecutive patients admitted with a stroke and communication deficits with NIHSS score ≥ 1 on the best language and/or dysarthria parameters. We excluded patients with severe comprehension deficits where communication was not possible. Following baseline assessment by a speech-language pathologist (SLP), patients were provided with a mobile tablet programmed with individualized therapy applications based on the assessment, and instructed to use it for at least one hour per day. Our objective was to establish feasibility by measuring recruitment rate, adherence rate, retention rate, protocol deviations and acceptability. Over 6 months, 143 patients were admitted with a new diagnosis of stroke: 73 had communication deficits, 44 met inclusion criteria, and 30 were enrolled into RecoverNow (median age 62, 26. 6 % female) for a recruitment rate of 68 % of eligible participants.

40|$|Aphasia is a {{communication}} disorder affecting all language modalities {{to varying degrees}} of severity, and impacting on the person’s overall quality of life, place in society and interpersonal relationships. Early post-stroke, healthcare professionals (HCPs) are often the main communication partners of people with aphasia (PWA), yet there are apparently few opportunities for communication practice {{in the course of}} rehabilitation. Practice is key to (re) learning, with other processes such as intensity, context, and the therapeutic alliance also shown to impact on outcomes of (re) learning. Currently, PWA in the UK receive stroke rehabilitation in a variety of care settings. Rehabilitation in the home through Early Supported Discharge (ESD) is the focus of this study. A systematic review using adapted Cochrane methodology examined how learning processes are reported in <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapies</b> for post-stroke aphasia with a functional outcome. The 34 included studies were reported with variable degrees of adherence to the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist. More specific and comprehensive articulation of the learning processes entailed in rehabilitation and (re) learning is needed in such aphasia therapies. An exploratory study was conducted to understand how conditions for (re) learning are produced during routine rehabilitation for PWA in the ESD context. Observational and interview methods were used to collect data on perceptions and practices of routine rehabilitation with 10 PWA and 22 HCPs (observation study) and 9 PWA and 8 HCPs (interview study). Interview data were analysed using thematic analysis; observational data explored the structure and ecology of the rehabilitation session and how the interview themes were enacted in interactions. Interview and observation data were analysed and combined within an Activity-based Communication Analysis (ACA) approach. Opportunities to enhance (re) learning of functional communication during routine rehabilitation were identified, but not consistently realised.
