5|$|The {{electrostatic}} force was first described in 1784 by Coulomb {{as a force}} that existed intrinsically between two charges. The properties of the {{electrostatic force}} were that it varied as an inverse <b>square</b> <b>law</b> directed in the radial direction, was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic polarity), was independent {{of the mass of}} the charged objects, and followed the superposition principle. Coulomb's law unifies all these observations into one succinct statement.|$|E
5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse <b>square</b> <b>law.</b> When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse <b>square</b> <b>law.</b> Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E

25|$|This remark refers {{among other}} things to Newton's finding, {{supported}} by mathematical demonstration, that if the inverse <b>square</b> <b>law</b> applies to tiny particles, then even a large spherically symmetrical mass also attracts masses external to its surface, even close up, exactly as if all its own mass were concentrated at its center. Thus Newton gave a justification, otherwise lacking, for applying the inverse <b>square</b> <b>law</b> to large spherical planetary masses {{as if they were}} tiny particles. In addition, Newton had formulated in Propositions 43-45 of Book 1, and associated sections of Book 3, a sensitive test of the accuracy of the inverse <b>square</b> <b>law,</b> in which he showed that only where the law of force is accurately as the inverse square of the distance will the directions of orientation of the planets' orbital ellipses stay constant as they are observed to do apart from small effects attributable to inter-planetary perturbations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Theoretical results {{about the}} {{capacity}} of stegosystems typically assume that {{one or both of}} the adversaries has perfect knowledge of the cover source. So-called perfect steganography is possible if the embedder has this perfect knowledge, and the <b>Square</b> Root <b>Law</b> of capacity applies when the embedder has imperfect knowledge but the detector has perfect knowledge. The epistemology of stegosystems is underdeveloped and these assumptions are sometimes unstated. In this work we consider stegosystems where the detector has imperfect information about the cover source: once the problem is suitably formalized, we show a parallel to the <b>Square</b> Root <b>Law.</b> This answers a question raised by Böhme. ...|$|R

25|$|One subtle {{feature of}} rockets relates to energy. A rocket stage, while {{carrying}} a given load, {{is capable of}} giving a particular delta-v.

25|$|Newton's law of {{universal}} gravitation states that a particle attracts every other particle {{in the universe}} using a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to {{the square of the}} distance between their centers. This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called inductive reasoning. It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton's work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("the Principia"), first published on 5 July 1687. When Newton's book was presented in 1686 to the Royal Society, Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse <b>square</b> <b>law</b> from him.|$|E
25|$|The {{matter was}} {{resolved}} by the bright comet that was discovered by Gottfried Kirch on November 14, 1680. Astronomers throughout Europe tracked its position for several months. In 1681, the Saxon pastor Georg Samuel Doerfel set forth his proofs that comets are heavenly bodies moving in parabolas of which the Sun is the focus. Then Isaac Newton, in his Principia Mathematica of 1687, proved that an object moving {{under the influence of}} his inverse <b>square</b> <b>law</b> of universal gravitation must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the conic sections, and he demonstrated how to fit a comet's path through the sky to a parabolic orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.|$|E
25|$|The path {{followed}} by any particle {{in the classical}} Kepler problem is a conic section. In particular, if the total energy E of the particle is greater than zero (i.e., if the particle is unbound), the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. This property is useful in studying atomic and sub-atomic forces by scattering high-energy particles; for example, the Rutherford experiment demonstrated {{the existence of an}} atomic nucleus by examining the scattering of alpha particles from gold atoms. If the short-range nuclear interactions are ignored, the atomic nucleus and the alpha particle interact only by a repulsive Coulomb force, which satisfies the inverse <b>square</b> <b>law</b> requirement for a Kepler problem.|$|E

25|$|The {{far field}} pattern is thus seen {{to consist of}} a {{transverse}} electromagnetic (TEM) wave, with electric and magnetic fields {{at right angles to}} each other and at right angles to the direction of propagation (the direction of r, as we assumed the source to be at the origin). The electric polarization, in the θ direction, is coplanar with the source current (in the Z direction), while the magnetic field is at right angles to that, in the φ direction. It can be seen from these equations, and also in the animation, that the fields at these distances are exactly in phase. Both fields fall according to 1/r, with the power thus falling according to 1/r2 as dictated by the inverse <b>square</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|Newton, {{faced in}} May 1686 with Hooke's {{claim on the}} inverse <b>square</b> <b>law,</b> denied that Hooke was to be {{credited}} as author of the idea. Among the reasons, Newton recalled that the idea had been discussed with Sir Christopher Wren previous to Hooke's 1679 letter. Newton also pointed out and acknowledged prior work of others, including Bullialdus, (who suggested, but without demonstration, {{that there was an}} attractive force from the Sun in the inverse square proportion to the distance), and Borelli (who suggested, also without demonstration, that there was a centrifugal tendency in counterbalance with a gravitational attraction towards the Sun so as to make the planets move in ellipses). D T Whiteside has described the contribution to Newton's thinking that came from Borelli's book, a copy of which was in Newton's library at his death.|$|E
25|$|Newton's tract De motu corporum in gyrum, {{which he}} sent to Halley in late 1684, derived what are {{now known as the}} three laws of Kepler, {{assuming}} an inverse <b>square</b> <b>law</b> of force, and generalised the result to conic sections. It also extended the methodology by adding the solution of a problem on the motion of a body through a resisting medium. The contents of De motu so excited Halley by their mathematical and physical originality and far-reaching implications for astronomical theory, that he immediately went to visit Newton again, in November 1684, to ask Newton to let the Royal Society have more of such work. The results of their meetings clearly helped to stimulate Newton with the enthusiasm needed to take his investigations of mathematical problems much further in this area of physical science, and he did so in a period of highly concentrated work that lasted at least until mid-1686.|$|E
