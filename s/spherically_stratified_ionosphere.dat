40|$|The {{possibility}} of using terrestrial ionospheric focusing {{to improve the}} directivity of electric dipoles on space missions has been investigated by comparing simultaneous observations of a solar radio storm by the ISIS 1 and ISIS 2 spacecraft, in near earth orbit, and the ISEE 3 spacecraft located beyond the magnetosphere. To this end, a three-dimensional ray tracing in a <b>spherically</b> <b>stratified</b> <b>ionosphere</b> {{has been carried out}} for conditions appropriate to the observations by the ISIS spacecraft of a solar radio storm in September 1983. The procedure allows Poynting flux spectral densities measured on ISIS to be converted to spectral densities well outside the ionosphere where they can be compared directly with simultaneous observations on ISEE 3. The results demonstrate good agreement over their common observing frequency range (1 - 2 MHz) ...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{ray tracing}} in the {{analysis}} of certain daytime ionograms recorded at Grahamstown is discussed in this thesis. A computer program has been modified and used to trace rays in the frequency range 1 - 30 MHz. Vertical, short distance oblique, and long distance oblique ionograms have been synthesized from the results and compared with experimental ionograms for Grahamstown, the Alice - Grahamstown transmission path (64 km), and the SANAE - Grahamstown transmission path (4470 km) respectively. Ray paths have been calculated and related in detail to the models of the ionosphere and geomagnetic field. The main features of the vertical and short distance oblique ionograms can, in general, be reproduced using <b>spherically</b> <b>stratified</b> <b>ionosphere</b> models with electron density profiles derived from vertical ionograms. A suitable model for the geomagnetic field is a tilted dipole equivalent to the actual field at Grahamstown. The two-hop mode is shown to be, usually, the lowest on the long distance oblique records. The ionosphere model is the principal limiting factor in reproducing such ionograms, and the most satisfactory results have been those obtained with a model in which electron density is assumed to vary linearly with latitude between the profiles at SANAE and Grahamstown. The promising results obtained by ray tracing with normal ionospheric conditions indicate that the method has further possibilities which could usefully be explored.

Ray tracing equations are defined for wave propagation in a horizontally <b>stratified</b> <b>ionosphere</b> which has been bathed with HF signals and therefore contains wavelike structures. Irregularities polarized within the meridian plane are found to cause the spread F echoes, while perpendicularly polarized irregularities do not. A magnetic dip angle of 5 deg must be exceeded for the spread F to become strong. The irregularities need scale lengths exceeding 100 m. Modes of operation are identified for inducing the required spread F echoes using ground-based radiotelescopes...|$|R

We apply the linear sampling method and factorization method to numerically reconstruct the boundary of the cavity. We prove that the linear sampling method works when the wave number is not an exterior transmission eigenvalue. We prove that the exterior transmission eigenvalues form a discrete set. We then consider both the exterior transmission eigenvalue problem and the interior transmission eigenvalue problem for a <b>spherically</b> <b>stratified</b> media and study the inverse spectral problem for the exterior transmission eigenvalue problem.

30|$|When {{the patch}} of ESF was first seen at 22 : 35 IST in Figure  5, it was {{situated}} between 6 - and 7 -MHz frequencies while the critical frequency of overhead ionosphere was around 5.5 MHz (see Figure  5). As the ESF patch moved to the overhead sky and continued to approach the 1 F trace, its maximum frequency did not decrease but rather stayed nearly stable at approximately 7 MHz. This illustrates that the maximum frequency within the spread F {{is dependent on the}} electron densities in the region of irregularities and it does not decrease like the virtual range when the irregularities move towards the overhead sky. In a uniformly <b>stratified</b> <b>ionosphere</b> (within the area covered by ionosonde beam), the electron content can increase in oblique ray paths, but the electron densities will be the same as that for a vertical incidence ray path. Since the plasma frequency is proportional to the electron density, oblique reflections do not show any pseudo enhancement or reduction in the plasma frequency.|$|R

40|$|Several {{alternative}} methods for solving the group height equation are presented. Three {{of these are}} now in operation at Ames Research Center and use data contained in a single ionogram trace. From the data an electron density profile N(h) is computed. If the ionogram also exhibits other traces, reverse ionogram traces are computed, using the N(h) profile, for comparison with the redundant data. When agreement is poor, the initial data trace is reinterpreted, another N(h) profile computed, and the reverse traces generated once again. This process is repeated until a desired degree of consistency is achieved. To reduce the necessity for human intervention and eliminate decision making required {{in conjunction with the}} preceding methods, a method is proposed that accepts as input, all data from a single ionogram. In general, no electron density function will satisfy these data exactly, but a best N(h) profile can be computed.

Our results apply in particular to the first order invisibility cloaks introduced by Pendry et al. and to the high order invisibility cloaks introduced by Hendi et al. and by Cai et al [...] We identify the appropriate cloaking boundary conditions that the solutions of Maxwell equations have to satisfy at the outside, ∂K+, and at the inside, ∂K−, of the boundary of the cloaked object K.

40|$|EditorialInternational audienceIn inverse {{scattering}} theory, transmission eigenvalues {{can be seen}} as {{the extension}} of the notion of resonant frequencies for impenetrable objects to the case of penetrable dielectrics. The transmission eigenvalue problem is a relatively late arrival to the spectral theory of partial differential equations. Its first appearance was in 1986 in a paper by Kirsch who was investigating the denseness of far-field patterns for scattering solutions of the Helmholtz equation or, in more modern terminology, the injectivity of the far-field operator [1]. The paper of Kirsch was soon followed by a more systematic study by Colton and Monk in the context of developing the dual space method for solving the inverse scattering problem for acoustic waves in an inhomogeneous medium [2]. In this paper they showed that for a <b>spherically</b> <b>stratified</b> media transmission eigenvalues existed and formed a discrete set. Numerical examples were also given showing that in principle transmission eigenvalues could be determined from the far-field data. This first period of interest in transmission eigenvalues was concluded with papers by Colton etÂ al in 1989 [3] and Rynne and Sleeman in 1991 [4] showing that for an inhomogeneous medium (not necessarily <b>spherically</b> <b>stratified)</b> transmission eigenvalues, if they existed, formed a discrete set. For the next seventeen years transmission eigenvalues were ignored. This was mainly due to the fact that, with the introduction of various sampling methods to determine the shape of an inhomogeneous medium from far-field data, transmission eigenvalues were something to be avoided and hence the fact that transmission eigenvalues formed at most a discrete set was deemed to be sufficient. In addition, questions related to the existence of transmission eigenvalues or the structure of associated eigenvectors were recognized as being particularly difficult due to the nonlinearity of the eigenvalue problem and the special structure of the associated transmission eigenvalue problem. The need to answer these questions became important after a series of papers by Cakoni etÂ al [5], and Cakoni etÂ al [6] suggesting that these transmission eigenvalues could be used to obtain qualitative information about the material properties of the scattering object from far-field data. The first answer to the existence of transmission eigenvalues in the general case was given in 2008 when PÃ¤ivÃ¤rinta and Sylvester showed the existence of transmission eigenvalues for the index of refraction sufficiently large [7] followed in 2010 by the paper of Cakoni etÂ al who removed the size restriction on the index of refraction [8]. More importantly, in the latter it was shown that transmission eigenvalues yielded qualitative information on the material properties of the scattering object and Cakoni etÂ al established in [9] that transmission eigenvalues could be determined from the Tikhonov regularized solution of the far-field equation. Since the appearance of these papers there has been an explosion of interest in the transmission eigenvalue problem (we refer the reader to our recent survey paper [10] for a detailed account of the developments in this field up to 2012) and the papers in this special issue are representative of the myriad directions that this research has taken. Indeed, we are happy to see that many open theoretical and numerical questions raised in [10] have been answered (totally or partially) in the contributions of this special issue: the existence of transmission eigenvalues with minimal assumptions on the contrast, the numerical evaluation of transmission eigenvalues, the inverse spectral problem, applications to non-destructive testing, etc. In addition to these topics, many other new investigations and research directions have been proposed as we shall see in the brief content summary below. A number of papers in this special issue are concerned with the question of existence of transmission eigenvalues and the structure of the associated transmission eigenfunctions. The three papers by respectively Robbiano [11], Blasten and PÃ¤ivÃ¤rinta [12], and Lakshtanov and Vainberg [13] provide new complementary results on the existence of transmission eigenvalues for the scalar problem under weak assumptions on the (possibly complex valued) refractive index that mainly stipulates that the contrast does not change sign on the boundary. It is interesting here to see three different new methods to obtain these results. On the other hand, the paper by Bonnet-Ben Dhia and Chesnel [14] addresses the Fredholm properties of the interior transmission problem when the contrast changes sign on the boundary, exhibiting cases where this property fails. Using more standard approaches, the existence and structure of transmission eigenvalues are analyzed in the paper by Delbary [15] for the case of frequency dependent materials in the context of Maxwell's equations, whereas the paper by Vesalainen [16] initiates the study of the transmission eigenvalue problem in unbounded domains by considering the transmission eigenvalues for SchrÃ¶dinger equation with non-compactly supported potential. The paper by Monk and Selgas [17] addresses the case where the dielectric is mounted on a perfect conductor and provides some numerical examples of the localization of associated eigenvalues using the linear sampling method. A series of papers then addresses the question of localization of transmission eigenvalues and the associated inverse spectral problem for <b>spherically</b> <b>stratified</b> media. More specifically, the paper by Colton and Leung [18] provides new results on complex transmission eigenvalues and a new proof for uniqueness of a solution to the inverse spectral problem, whereas the paper by Sylvester [19] provides sharp results on how to locate all the transmission eigenvalues associated with angular independent eigenfunctions when the index of refraction is constant. The paper by Gintides and Pallikarakis [20] investigates an iterative least square method to identify the <b>spherically</b> <b>stratified</b> index of refraction from transmission eigenvalues. On the characterization of transmission eigenvalues in terms of far-field measurements, a promising new result is obtained by Kirsch and Lechleiter [21] showing how one can identify the transmission eigenvalues using the eigenvalues of the scattering operator which are available in terms of measured scattering data. In the paper by Kleefeld [22], an accurate method for computing transmission eigenvalues based on a surface integral formulation of the interior transmission problem and numerical methods for nonlinear eigenvalue problems is proposed and numerically validated for the scalar problem in three dimensions. On the other hand, the paper by Sun and Xu [23] investigates the computation of transmission eigenvalues for Maxwell's equations using a standard iterative method associated with a variational formulation of the interior transmission problem with an emphasis on the effect of anisotropy on transmission eigenvalues. From the perspective of using transmission eigenvalues in non-destructive testing, the paper by Cakoni and Moskow [24] investigates the asymptotic behavior of transmission eigenvalues with respect to small inhomogeneities. The paper by Nakamura and Wang [25] investigates the linear sampling method for the time dependent heat equation and analyses the interior transmission problem associated with this equation. Finally, in the paper by Finch and Hickmann [26], the spectrum of the interior transmission problem is related to the unique determination of the acoustic properties of a body in thermoacoustic imaging. We hope that this collection of papers will stimulate further research in the rapidly growing area of transmission eigenvalues and inverse scattering theory...|$|R
40|$|In a body {{periodically}} strained by tides, heating {{produced by}} viscous friction {{is far from}} homogeneous. I show here that {{the distribution of the}} dissipated power within a <b>spherically</b> <b>stratified</b> body is a linear combination of three angular functions. These angular functions depend only on the tidal potential whereas the radial weights are specified by the internal structure of the body. The 3 D problem of predicting spatial patterns of dissipation at all radii is thus reduced to the 1 D problem of computing weight functions. I compute spatial patterns in various toy models without assuming a specific rheology: a viscoelastic thin shell stratified in conductive and convective layers, an incompressible homogeneous body and a two-layer model of uniform density with a liquid or rigid core. For a body in synchronous rotation undergoing eccentricity tides, dissipation in a mantle surrounding a liquid core is highest at the poles. Within a softer layer (asthenosphere or icy layer), the same tides generate maximum heating in the equatorial region with a significant degree-four structure if the layer is thin. Tidal heating patterns are thus of three main types: mantle dissipation (including the case of a floating icy crust), dissipation in a thin soft layer and dissipation in a thick soft layer. I illustrate the method with applications to Europa, Titan and Io. The formalism described in this paper applies to dissipation within solid layers of planets and satellites for which internal spherical symmetry and viscoelastic linear rheology are good approximations.

40|$|Transmission {{eigenvalues}} in inverse scattering theory FIORALBA CAKONI AND HOUSSEM HADDAR In {{the past}} few years transmission eigenvalues have become an important area of research in inverse scattering theory with active research being undertaken {{in many parts of the}} world. Transmission eigenvalues appear in the study of scattering by inhomogeneous media and are closely related to non-scattering waves. Such eigenvalues provide information about material properties of the scattering media and can be determined from scattering data. Hence they can play an important role in a variety of inverse problems in target identification and nondestructive testing. The transmission eigenvalue problem is a non-selfadjoint and nonlinear eigenvalue problem that is not covered by the standard theory of eigenvalue problems for elliptic operators. This article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the art theoretical results on the transmission eigenvalue problem including a discussion on fundamental questions such as existence and discreteness of transmission eigenvalues as well as Faber–Krahn type inequalities relating the first eigenvalue to material properties of inhomogeneous media. We begin our presentation by showing how the transmission eigenvalue problem appears in scattering theory and how transmission eigenvalues are determined from scattering data.

40|$|Impulsive ELF/VLF {{electric}} field bursts observed by the vector {{electric field}} instrument (VEFI) on the Dynamics Explorer 2 (DE 2) satellite {{on almost every}} crossing of the geomagnetic equator in the evening hours are interpreted as originating in lightning discharges. These signals that peak in intensity near the magnetic equator are observed within 5 - 20 deg latitude of the geomagnetic equator at altitudes of 300 - 500 km with amplitudes {{of the order of}} approximately mV/m in the 512 - or 1024 -Hz frequency band of the VEFI instrument. Whistler-mode ELF/VLF wave propagation through a horizontally <b>stratified</b> <b>ionosphere</b> predicts strong attenuation of subionospheric signals reaching the equator at low altitudes. However, ray tracing analysis shows that the presence of the equatorial density anomaly, commonly observed in the upper ionosphere during evening hours, leads to the focusing of the wave energy from lightning near the geomagnetic equator at low altitudes, thus accounting for all observed aspects of the phenomenon. The observations presented here indicate that during certain hours in the evening, almost all the energy input from lightning discharges entering the ionosphere at less than 30 deg latitude remains confined to a small region (in altitude and latitude) near the geomagnetic equator. The net wideband electric field, extrapolated from the observed electric field values in the 512 - to 1024 -Hz band, can be approximately 10 mV/m or higher.

30|$|The ELF {{propagation}} constant ν (f) is usually constructed {{on the assumption}} that the ionosphere plasma is isotropic and horizontally homogeneous. Then, by using the full wave solution (see Hynninen and Galuk 1972; Bliokh et al. 1997, 1980; Galuk and Ivanov 1978; Galuk et al. 2015), one might compute the ν (f) dependence corresponding to a given profile σ (h). The full wave solution is the rigorous solution of the radio propagation problem within the vertically <b>stratified</b> <b>ionosphere,</b> and it allows us to obtain the sub-ionospheric {{propagation constant}} (f). We will mention the major steps in obtaining the solution without reproducing equations here, as these could be found in the above-cited works. The upward and downward waves are taken into account in every plasma layer. Their thickness is much smaller than the wavelength in the medium. The tangential field components are continuous at the layer boundaries. It might be shown then (Hynninen and Galuk 1972; Bliokh et al. 1997; Galuk and Ivanov 1978; Galuk et al. 2015) that the electromagnetic problem is reduced to a nonlinear differential equation of the first order for the surface impedance (the ratio of the tangential components of E and H fields). The surface impedance satisfies boundary conditions at the ground and at the upper boundary in the ionosphere from where the plasma density is supposed to remain constant. The problem is solved numerically by using the iteration procedure, and the desired propagation constant ν (f) is obtained as a result. The method is regarded as the full wave solution, since it strictly accounts for all the fields propagating in the stratified plasma and in the air.|$|R

These frequencies are higher than the fundamental harmonics of the field line resonances in the magnetosphere. High quality signals with dominant frequencies 70 – 200 mHz are a regular phenomenon in the F layer and in the magnetosphere. The mean latitude of the maximum Pc 2 - 3 occurrence rate lies at L � 3 : 5 in the F layer, i. e., inside the plasmasphere. Day-to-day variations of the L value of the CHAMP Pc 2 - 3 occurrence rate maximum follow the plasmapause day-to-day variations. Polarization and amplitude of Pc 2 - 3 s in the magnetosphere, in the ionosphere, and on the ground allow us to suggest that they are generated as fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves in the outer magnetosphere and are partly converted into shear Alfven waves near the plasmapause. The observed ground-to-ionosphere amplitude ratio during the night is interpreted {{as a result of the}} Alfven wave transmission through the ionosphere.

40|$|The {{computation}} {{of global}} postseismic rebound in a <b>spherically</b> symmetric, <b>stratified,</b> self-gravitating Earth with Maxwell viscoelastic rheology {{can be carried}} out semi-analytically with a normal-mode approach. The solution scheme usually involves the application of standard propagator techniques to the equivalent problem in the Laplace domain; to recover the temporal dependence a numerical Laplace anti-transform is required. This step involves the solution of the so-called “secular equation”, whose degree increases linearly with the detail of the stratification modeling, and whose coefficients become extremely ill-conditioned for high harmonic orders. As a result, the practically solvable models are limited to a few viscoelastic layers, and are anyway affected by severe numerical instabilities. To overcome these difficulties, alternative approaches have been explored by several authors, ranging from Runge-Kutta purely numerical integration to the evaluation of Laplace antitransform by a numerical discretization of the Bromwich integral. The Post-Widder algorithm allows the estimation of the Laplace antitransform by sampling numerically the transform on the positive real axis. This method, which has been recently applied to the computation of GIA viscoelastic Love numbers, allows to bypass completely the root-finding procedure while preserving {{at the same time the}} analytical normal-mode solution form. In this work, we apply the Post-Widder method to the computation of post-seismic rebound models.
