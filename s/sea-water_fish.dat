50|$|The {{topography}} {{of the land}} features plain to rolling and hills. Among the municipalities, Jabonga ranks first in total area and number of farms (464) mostly owned by individuals. It {{has one of the}} 36 crop storage facilities of the province. Its major crops are coconut, rice, corn, timber and both fresh and <b>sea-water</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
60|$|Another lark {{had risen}} almost from their feet, and, {{circling}} its way upwards, was breaking into song. And below, the full spring tide was filling the pools and creeks with the softly flowing, glimmering <b>sea-water.</b> The <b>fishing</b> boats, {{high and dry}} an hour ago, were passing now seaward along the silvery way. All these things Mannering was watching with rapt eyes, even whilst he listened to his companion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Sea-water ice slurry {{generator}} {{is aimed}} to produce ice-slurry using <b>sea-water</b> while <b>fishing</b> on boat. Some models of ice slurry generator have been researched and developed. Indonesia as an archipelago and maritime nation has big potential in fishery. Appropriate model for Indonesian traditional fishing boat is necessary. The {{most important part}} of ice slurry generator is evaporator, including auger and scrapper. Some studies on ice slurry are presented in this review paper in order to get larger view on design of ice slurry generator...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the lagoon of Mischief Reef, South China Sea to test the feasibility of feeding and rearing wild caught yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares and skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis juveniles in small, deep <b>sea-water,</b> cages. <b>Fish</b> started active feeding four days after transfer to the rearing cage. Initial feeding depth between yellowfin tuna and skipjack tuna was not significantly different (P > 0. 05). The initial feeding depth for yellowfin tuna juveniles was 2. 97 ± 1. 09 m, and skipjack tuna fed at 2. 95 ± 0. 77 m. After the 30 day rearing experiment specific growth rates of yellowfin tuna and skipjack tuna were: 0. 25 ± 0. 02 %/day and 0. 32 ± 0. 03 %/day, respectively; survival rate of yellowfin tuna was 100 %, and the survival rate of skipjack tuna was 82. 6 %. The estimated feed conversion ratio was 9. 73 in this study. The results of this study provide practical data for culturing wild caught yellowfin tuna and skipjack tuna juveniles in sea cages...|$|R
40|$|A continuous-flow {{method for}} the {{determination}} of nitrate and phosphate in water is proposed. The method is based on insertion of reagents and sample solutions into a single channel through a programmable switching valve. The method depends upon heteropolyacid with phosphate and on the modified Griess reaction for nitrate, and permits {{the determination of}} PO- 34 in the range 1 - 20 μg/ml and NO- 3 between 5 and 100 μg/ml, the achievable sampling frequency being 45 /hour. The two analytes can be determined in N/P ratios between 0. 25 and 100. The method {{has been applied to}} the determination of nitrate and phosphate in the <b>sea-water</b> used in <b>fish</b> farms...|$|R
40|$|Phage type M 1 {{was most}} {{frequently}} found (44 %) among 190 Salmonella typhi strains isolated from sporadic cases in South Korea. An epidemic of typhoid has broken {{out in a}} province, 60 isolates from which were typed in all as type A. Phage types of S. typhi in Taiwan was extremely rich in variety, among them some rare phage types like G, E 9 and T were found. There was no appreciable difference in drug sensitivity between S. typhi isolated in Korea and Taiwan on one hand, and between the strains from sporadic and epidemic cases in Korea on the other hand. The results of serotype determination, biochemical study and drug sensitivity tests in 78 salmonellae other than S. typhi are also presented. Sixty strains among them were of human source, and were forwarded to the laboratory for identification from Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and some public health institutions in Nagasaki. The remaining 18 strains were those isolated from laboratory animals in Taiwan. It is noteworthy that S. paratyphi C was found only in Korea, S. typhimurium was more frequent in the other countries, and, in the Philippines, two multiply resistant strains showing resistance extending over kanamycin, aminobenzil-penicillin and fradiomycin were isolated. In addition, {{it was observed that}} all salmonellae and shigellae used, numbering 363 and 47 respectively, showred a high sensitivity to furazolidone and furatrizine, especially to the latter. The most prevalent colicin type of Shigella sonnei in Taiwan was type 8, whereas in Hong Kong, type 9 A. Distinct differences with regard to biochemical type and drug-resistance pattern of this organism were not observed between the two countries. Out of a total of 56 halophilic bacteria, isolated from <b>sea-water</b> and <b>fishes</b> in Taiwan, only one strain was determined as sucrose negative, hemolytic and K-typable Vibrio parahaemolyticus. 韓国の散発例分離チフス菌 190 株のうちではファージ型M 1 が最も多かった. 同国で腸チフスの集団発生があったが,その分離菌のファージ型はすべてA型であった. 台湾分離チフス菌のファージ型は極めて多彩で,そのなかにはG,E 9,Tのような稀有型もみられた. 韓国と台湾分離チフス菌の薬剤感受性には特記すべき差異がなく,韓国の散発株と集発株を比較しても同様であった. チフス菌以外のサルモネラ 78 株の血清型決定,生化学的研究,薬剤感受性試験の成績も提示されている. そのうち 60 株は韓国,台湾とフイリピンからおよび長崎県下の保健所などから送られてきた人系株,残る 18 株は台湾で実験動物から分離されたものであった. パラチフスC菌が韓国だけで見出されたこと,S. typhimuriumはその他の国で最もしばしばみられたこと,それとフィリピンで,カナマイシン,アミノベンチールペニシリンからフラジオマイシンにも及ぶ多剤耐性菌 2 株が検出されたことは特記の要がある. これに加えて,使用したサルモネラ 363 株と赤痢菌 47 株はフラゾリドンとフラトリジンに対し,特に後者に対して高い感受性を示した. 赤痢ソンネ菌のコリシン型として台湾で最も多かったのは 8 型,香港では 9 A型であった. 同菌の生化学型と薬剤耐性パターンについては両地間に特に明確な差異を認めなかった. 台湾で海水と魚類から分離した好塩菌は 56 株,V. parahaemolyticusとしては 15 株であったが,このうち白糖非分解,溶血性,K型別可能のものは僅か 1 株にすぎなかった...|$|R
40|$|Lithium was {{contained}} rich in ocean sardine and anchovy; especially {{concentrated in the}} back-bone, head or gill of the fish, which were related with calcium as matrix components. In leaching experiments lithium was softly dissolved from the fish bone by shaking with a 0. 1 mol/l hydrochloric acid or a 0. 1 mol/l acetic acid solution after washing and removing the surface <b>sea-water</b> on the <b>fish</b> with water. The lithium leached in the acid solutions and remained to the residue was determined by flame photometry using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer with air-acetylene flame, after the decomposition with nitric-perchloric acid mixture. In the gill, head and back-bone of anchovy, 73, 71 and 71 % of total lithium were dissolved with 0. 1 mol/l hydrochloric acid, respectively. Same leaching results were obtained for calcium; 78 〜 84 % of total calcium were also dissolved with the same leaching solution. The ratio of lithium and calcium dissolved in hydrochloric acid or acetic acid were almost constant to be 3 〜 8 × 10 ^ regardless {{of the sort of}} acid, the number of leaching fraction and the part of fish bone, and the ratio in the hydrochloric acid leaching was constant to be 7 ± 2 × 10 ^. Those values was nearly equal to the ratio of 6 ± 2 × 10 ^ (n= 9) of total lithium content of anchovy. It was, therefore, supposed that lithium was existed in fish bone as calcium compounds which was likely apatite or calcite, or a part of total lithium presented as the complexing component with calcium, which was passed through the dialysis filter less than 10000 as molecular weight...|$|R
