40|$|The Iowa D. O. T. has a {{classification}} {{system designed to}} rate coarse aggregates as to their <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> characteristics. Aggregates have been classified into five functional types, with a Type 1 being the most <b>skid</b> <b>resistant.</b> A complete description of the classification system {{can be found in}} the Office of Materials Instructional Memorandum T- 203. Due to the variability of ledges within any given quarry the classification of individual ledges becomes necessary. The type of aggregate is then specified for each asphaltic concrete surface course. As various aggregates become used in a. c. paving, there is a continuing process of evaluating the frictional properties of the pavement surface. It is primarily through an effort of this sort that information on aggregate sources and individual ledges becomes more refined. This study is being conducted to provide that needed up-to-date information that can be used to monitor the aggregate classification system...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} floors in horse stables is a compromise. On one hand it shou 1 dn’t be {{slippery}} for horses or people {{and on the}} other hand it should be easy to clean. These two requirements often contradict each other. The flooring should also be cheap and durable. The most common flooring in horse stables is concrete. The concrete slab for the house is then used as flooring. There are some stables with alternative flooring such as wood, asphalt, shavings, sand, pavement stones or epoxy/sand-mixtures. The purpose of this study was to compare different floorings from a friction point of view. The study was carried out by visiting stables in Sweden and Ireland and measuring the friction on 20 Swedish stable-floors. Before the measurements started, a method was developed that was easy to use in the field. The method that has been used for the friction measurements is based on the measuring of sliding distance. A block of wood, with a horse-shoe nailed or glued to it, slides down a chute and out on the floor. The distance it slides varies depending on the friction of the flooring. The equipment is easy to use and to transport from stable to stable. To test the methods reliability it was compared to the method used by Hörndahl (1995) in the study "Wearing quality and prevention of slipperiness on solid floors in animal houses". One of the limitations with the method is that it can only be used on hard surfaces. The abrasive properties of the floors has also been measured in order to see if it can be related to the friction. The measuring were carried out by dragging a block of plaster over the floors. By weighing the block before and after the drag test, the degree of abrasion can be determined. The more weight-loss - the more abrasive is the floor. Different floorings have been compared from a friction point of view. Other parameters such as price or hygiene qualities have not been considered. The measurements were carried out in 20 stables in Skåne, Östergotland and Uppland in 1996 - 1997. The results show that the concrete floors are most slippery. The epoxy/sand-floors showed the best results. There are many varieties of epoxy/sand-floors and this study only includes two of them. Therefore it isn’t possible to say that they are generally good but it is possible to make good floorings from epoxy/sand, for example the flooring in some of the aisles of the clinical centre of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. Measurements of the abrasive properties did not show a strong correlation with the friction measurements, It seems as if the correlation is weaker on the less slippery floors. This could be explained by the different ways in which a floor can be slip-resistant. They can be soft like the wooden floors or they can have more or less sharp structures and this is why the weight-loss of the plaster-blocks are varying. A slippery floor on the other hand is hard and even and the plaster-blocks don’t loose much weight. During the visits floors made of shavings, sand, rubber, concrete with stones in it and different kinds of urine drainage in horse-boxes were studied. Aisles with shavings or sand are <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> and sound-absorbing but they demand more maintenance then hard surfaces. There are rubber floorings that are <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> and sound-absorbing but generally they are expensive. To be able to say which floor is the most <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> more tests need to be carried out. The floors in this study are of different ages and the amount of "horse-traffic" varies considerably between them. Newly laid floors of the different materials would have to be tested and re-tested after being exposed to the same wearing. One should also test how the different materials are affected by dirt and moisture. Stable floors are often both dirty and wet and it is important that they are <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> all the time. The used friction measuring method should be tested further to se if the results are affected by e. g. air temperature or atmospheric humidity. Another question that needs to be answered is how soft the floorings can be without the friction measuring method giving the wrong results. The wooden floors in this study are probably a borderline case. Since they are a bit deformed when a horse step on them the risk of slipping is decreased. A floor that is <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> for horses with shoes does not necessarily have to be <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> for horses without shoes. A hoof without a shoe can be deformed and thereby interact with grooves or other irregularities in the floor. A shod hoof will slide over the grooves...|$|E

40|$|High {{friction}} surfacing (HFS) is {{a specialist}} {{type of road}} coating with very high skid resistance. It {{is used in the}} UK at locations where there is significant risk of serious or fatal accidents. This paper considers the aggregate used in HFS. Calcined bauxite is the only aggregate that provides the highest levels of skid resistance over the longest period. No naturally occurring aggregate has been found to give a comparable level of in-service performance. This paper reviews the historical development of HFS in the UK relating to aggregate. In-service performance is predicted in the laboratory using the Wear test which subjects test specimens to an estimated 5 – 8 years simulated trafficking. Examples are given of Wear test data. They illustrate why calcined bauxite performs better than natural aggregate. They show how the amount of calcined bauxite can be reduced by blending with high <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> natural aggregates. Data from the Wear test can be related to every HFS laboratory experiment and road trial carried out in the UK for over the last 50 years. Anyone considering the prediction of HFS performance needs to carefully consider the data given in this paper with any other test method currently being considered or used to investigate HFS...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the major}} by–products of the steel {{production}} industry is Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) slag. In the field {{of research and development}} and in cooperation with the laboratory of EGNATIA ODOS SA, the current study focuses on the mechanical properties of electric arc furnace slag, as used in the thin, porous surfacing of Egnatia Odos highway. The in–situ measurements refer to two highway segments constructed in July 2007 and August 2008. The data collected is compared to the initial results of the mixture studies and the behaviour of the wearing course is examined in the time span of 30 and 41 months, subject to normal traffic and environmental weathering. The data obtained refers to three types of measurements, skid resistance, macro texture depth and permeability. The results show minor differences in between initial and later measurement. The data is also compared to skid–resistant layers with natural hard aggregates which were constructed at the same time period and were subject to identical environmental and traffic conditions on the Egnatia Odos highway. Comparison is made to a study on the P. A. TH. E. highway with similar <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> wearing courses of asphaltic concrete. Both results show the suitability of EAF slag aggregates to fully satisfy the technical specifications. The comparison to wearing courses made with natural hard aggregates highlights the superiority of artificial aggregates, primarily due to their enhanced mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Micro asphalt is a {{combination}} of nominal 6 mm aggregate, bitumen emulsion, Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), water and additive. This is mixed cold and applied in-situ by a purpose- built paver as a thin layer. The process meets many of the ideals of sustainable highway construction. The UK highway surfacing industry is dominated by hot mix asphalt types and a specification that asks for high <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> aggregate and texture depth to ensure wet skid resistance. Hot mix asphalt materials can result in a larger carbon footprint compared to micro asphalt. Production, transportation and installation of hot mix materials use higher amounts of energy compared to cold applied micro asphalt. Recent research has questioned whether there is the need to use limited reserves of high <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> aggregate in mixes with high texture depth that may generate excessive noise. It has been suggested that the use of smaller sized aggregate of lower skid resistance may provide acceptable levels of wet skid resistance by offering a greater number of contact points with a moving tyre compared to larger stone sizes. This argument formed the basic aim of the research reported in this thesis i. e. to assess whether the use of smaller sized mid range PSV aggregate in smaller carbon footprint micro asphalt would provide acceptable levels of wet skidding resistance. The research methodology has provided the opportunity to gather new data from a range of sources. It has developed new laboratory test methods to assess smaller sized aggregates and micro asphalt surfacing mixes. It has resulted in the first full-scale micro asphalt road trial in the UK to assess differing aggregates in the provision of wet skid resistance. This trial has allowed the development of micro asphalt early life skid resistance to be studied {{for the first time in}} detail over a 2 -year period. The trial has also' facilitated the first UK SCRIM/GripTester skid resistance measurement correlation study for micro asphalt. The research has provided improved understanding of the role of 2. 8 - 6. 3 mm porphyritic andesite aggregate in micro asphalt for the provision of wet skid resistance and made significant contributions to knowledge. Both the laboratory and full-scale A 26 road trial concluded that the different aggregate combinations used provided a durable surface and safe highway surface. The use of high PSV natural aggregate and the addition of imported calcined bauxite did not cause wet skid resistance to be significantly improved indicating that the mid range skid resistance aggregate offered acceptable performance i. e. a more sustainable use of natural resources. The micro asphalt mixes were found to offer immediate high levels of early life skid resistance and not suffer from early life issues of lower wet skid resistance experienced by some types of hot mix asphalt. The SCRIM / GripTester trial carried out with TRL found that data from the A 26 trial followed almost the exact same trend from the 2005 correlation study. This allows the data from the A 26 road trial to be quoted as equivalent SCRIM data if required and lets those involved in measuring skid resistance using GripTester know that it behaves in a similar manner. The research concludes that the use of small carbon foot print surfacing materials such as micro asphalt offer considerable opportunity to the UK highway industry in providing a safe, durable and sustainable surfacing material, while showing that there is a modest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to a reduction in travel distance for the micro asphalt material.

40|$|Epoxy-based {{flexible}} {{polymer concrete}} overlays {{have been used}} in the past 15 years in North America to protect the bridge deck from deterioration, to extend the service life, and to improve <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> of the riding surface. While 15 years of field applications have demonstrated the effectiveness of the protection offered by the technique, cracking and delamination failures have also been observed. The purpose of the research reported herein is to understand the mechanism of durability failure of the epoxy polymer concrete overlay system. The tests conducted were water permeability, chloride ion penetration, water absorption, strength loss, temperature cycling, and water vapour pressure. Methods of application of polymer concrete overlay {{play a key role in}} the success of the overlay. In addition to the two commonly used methods, the multiple layer and the slurry methods, five new application methods were proposed and evaluated. It was found that the addition of a primer in the overlay system helps reduce water permeability, and that the thin polymer concrete overlay was much less permeable than the thick asphalt overlay. The temperature cycling tests revealed that no significant delamination occurred after 103 cycles from - 50 °C to 40 °C at an accelerated rate. The rapid chloride ion penetration test confirmed that polymer concrete overlays did provide sufficient protection to stop the chloride ion intrusion. Nevertheless, the epoxy polymer concrete overlays were found to absorb 2 [...] 3 % of water, which caused a significant strength loss. This strength loss could lead to cracking inside the overlay and accelerate delamination thereafter. The water vapour pressure generated from the saturated concrete substrates was not large enough to promote delamination. Overall, the newly proposed overlay applications methods have proven effective in constructing a thin, durable, less expensive and fast overlay for aged bridge deck protection...|$|E
40|$|A {{partnership}} {{was formed}} between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and United Technologies USBI Company to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate {{a technology that}} uses a solventless spray process for depositing a lightweight, highly filled roof coating on low-sloped commercial roofs. Although the levels of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from industrial roof coating's and paint operations have been reduced in recent years, this partnership,was an effort to further reduce VOC emission levels and to also demonstrate the use of reclaimed automobile tire rubber as a filler material in roof coating systems. Different materials and coatings were evaluated and tested before the final selection used to coat the roofs of two small buildings at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center during fiscal year 1997. The project successfully leveraged the investment of EPA, NASA and private sector resources to demonstrate a pre-commercial roofing coating process. This process utilizes the Convergent Spray Technologies process, which was initially developed by USBI to apply highly-filled, thermal protection coatings to the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters. A second partnership between the NASA, Federal Highway Administration, Alabama Department of Transportation and USBI Company was formed to develop and demonstrate the Convergent Spray Technology {{as a method of}} applying a <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> coating to interstate roads and concrete bridge decking's. Again, different materials and coatings were evaluated and tested before the final selection of ground flint and resin. Two field demonstrations were performed during fiscal year 1997 for the purpose of evaluating the coating system under actual highway conditions. These coatings were applied on Interstate 65 near Huntsville Alabama, and in the Mobile Bankhead tunnel. The system performed this task without the use of harmful solvents, and accomplished the process in a single application. This project successfully leveraged the investment of NASA, Federal Highway Administration, the Alabama Department of Transportation, and private sector funding...|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{moveable}} bridges use {{open grid}} steel decks, {{because these are}} factory assembled, light-weight, and easy to install. Open grid steel decks, however, are not as <b>skid</b> <b>resistant</b> as solid decks. Costly maintenance, high noise levels, poor riding comfort and susceptibility to vibrations are among the other disadvantages of these decks. The major objective {{of this research was}} to develop alternative deck systems which weigh no more than 25 lb/ft 2, have solid riding surface, are no more than 4 – 5 in. thick and are able to withstand prescribed loading. Three deck systems were considered in this study: ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) deck, aluminum deck and UHPC-fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) tube deck. ^ UHPC deck was the first alternative system developed as a part of this project. Due to its ultra high strength, this type of concrete results in thinner sections, which helps satisfy the strict self-weight limit. A comprehensive experimental and analytical evaluation of the system was carried out to establish its suitability. Both single and multi-unit specimens with one or two spans were tested for static and dynamic loading. Finite element models were developed to predict the deck behavior. The study led {{to the conclusion that the}} UHPC bridge deck is a feasible alternative to open grid steel deck. ^ Aluminum deck was the second alternative system studied in this project. A detailed experimental and analytical evaluation of the system was carried out. The experimental work included static and dynamic loading on the deck panels and connections. Analytical work included detailed finite element modeling. Based on the in-depth experimental and analytical evaluations, it was concluded that aluminum deck was a suitable alternative to open grid steel decks and is ready for implementation. ^ UHPC-FRP tube deck was the third system developed in this research. Prestressed hollow core decks are commonly used, but the proposed type of steel-free deck is quite novel. Preliminary experimental evaluations of two simple-span specimens, one with uniform section and the other with tapered section were carried out. The system was shown to have good promise to replace the conventional open grid decks. Additional work, however, is needed before the system is recommended for field application. ...|$|E
