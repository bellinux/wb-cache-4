The focus is on the quality of final beverage which may lack in taste, flavor, and body. The aim of this work was to evaluate the quality attributes of low-alcohol beers, dealcoholized by osmotic distillation and using strip- ping solutions specific for the beverage composition. Two types of top-fermented beer were used: Weiss beer, with a very fruity aroma and strong phenolic content, and Bitter beer, with a malt aroma. Regarding the <b>stripping</b> <b>solutions,</b> they were obtained by dilution of the original beer with water, in order to limit the volatile compound loss during the process. More- over, low-alcohol Weiss beer was also produced by using carbonated <b>stripping</b> <b>solutions</b> (i. e., saturated with CO 2 at am- bient pressure). The results highlighted that color, bitterness, total phenols, and antioxidant activity were unchanged in the low-alcohol beers but volatile compounds were reduced to a different extent. The lower vapor pressure of some volatile compounds (i. e., 2 -phenylethanol, aldehydes) can explain their retention in beer. The carbonation of <b>stripping</b> <b>solutions</b> did not significantly reduce CO 2 loss, but aldehydes and total alcohols were better retained in low-alcohol Weiss beer.
