5000|$|<b>Sulprostone</b> (as well {{as other}} prostanoids {{receptor}} agonists) is in use for inducting medical abortion and ending pregnancy after fetal death, {{for the treatment of}} severe atonic postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery, and for removal of the placenta in patients with retained placenta. [...] Currently, <b>sulprostone</b> along with SC-46275, MB-28767, ONO-AE-248 and other EP3 receptor agonists are in development as drugs for the possible treatment of stomach ulcers in humans.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{synthetic}} compounds {{have been}} found to be highly selective in binding to but not stimulating EP3. These Receptor antagonist, which block EP3 from responding to PGE2 or other agonists of this receptor, include <b>Sulprostone,</b> DG-O41, L798,106, TEI-3356, and ONO-AE3-240. They are in development primarily as anti-thrombotics, i.e. drugs to treat pathological blood clotting in humans.|$|E
50|$|Although medical {{abortion}} {{is associated with}} more bleeding than surgical abortion, overall bleeding for the two methods is minimal and not clinically different. In a large-scale prospective trial published in 1992 of more than 16,000 women undergoing medical abortion using mifepristone with varying doses of gemeprost or <b>sulprostone,</b> only 0.1% had hemorrhage requiring a blood transfusion. It is often advised to contact a health care provider if there is bleeding to such degree that more than two pads are soaked per hour for two consecutive hours.|$|E
50|$|Standard prostanoids {{have the}} {{following}} relative efficacies in binding to and activating EP3: PGE2>PGF2α=PGI2>PGD2=TXA2. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), which has one less double bond than PGE2, {{has the same}} binding affinity and potency for EP3 as PGE2. PGE2 has extreme high affinity (dissociation constant Kd=0.3 nM) for EP3. Several synthetic compounds, e.g. <b>sulprostone,</b> SC-46275, MB-28767, and ONO-AE-248, bind to and stimulate with high potency EP3 but unlike PGE2 {{have the advantage of}} being highly selective for this receptor over other EP receptors and are relatively resistant to being metabolically degraded.

5000|$|<b>Sulprostone</b> is an {{analogue}} of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) {{that has}} oxytocic activity in assays of rat kidney cells and tissues. There are four known receptors which mediate various but often different cellular and tissue responses to PGE2: prostaglandin EP1 receptor, prostaglandin EP2 receptor, prostaglandin EP3 receptor, and prostaglandin EP4 receptor. Sulprosotone binds to and activates the prostaglandin EP3 receptor with far greater efficacy {{than the other}} PGE2 receptors and also {{has the advantage of}} being relatively resistant, compared with PGE2, to becoming metabolically degraded. It is listed as a comparatively weak receptor agonist of the prostaglandin EP1 receptor. In all events, this as well as other potent synthetic EP3 receptor antagonists have the realized or potential ability to promote the beneficial effects of prostaglandin EP3 receptor activation.|$|E
50|$|The FP {{receptor}} is {{the least}} selective of the prostenoid receptors {{in that it is}} responsive to PGD2 {{and to a lesser extent}} PGE2 at concentrations close to those of PGF2α. Standard prostanoids have the following relative efficacies as receptor ligands in binding to and activating FP: PGF2α>PGD2>PGE2>PGI2=TXA2. In typical binding studies, PGF2α has one-half maximal binding and cell stimulating actions at ~1 nanomolar whereas PGD2 and PGE2 are ~5- to 10-fold and 10-100-fold weaker than this. The synthetic analogs that like PGF2α act as selective receptor agonists of FP viz., cloprostenol, flupostenol, latanoprost, and tafluprost (acid form) have FP binding affinities and stimulating potencies similar to PGF2α while others as enprostil, <b>sulprostone,</b> U46619, carbacyclin, and iloprost are considerably weaker FP agonists. Fluprostenol is a widely used clinically as a selective FP receptor agonist; latanoprost is a suitable substitute.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>sulprostone</b> and mifepristone/misoprostol when used for termination of pregnancy (TOP) in the 2 nd trimester. DESIGN: Comparative retrospective cohort study. METHOD: Data were collected on all women whose pregnancies were terminated in the 2 nd trimester, {{in the presence of}} severe fetal defects, between 1996 and 2007 at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, the Netherlands. From the start of 1996 until the end of 2001 TOPs were performed using <b>sulprostone.</b> In 2001 the treatment was switched to the combination mifepristone/misoprostol. The primary outcome measure was the time interval between the initiation of prostaglandin medication and the birth of the infant. RESULTS: 158 patients met the inclusion criteria: 51 women were treated with <b>sulprostone,</b> 107 women with mifepriston/misoprostol. The duration of treatment in the mifepristone/misoprostol group (median 8. 7 hours, range: 1. 1 - 72. 0 hours) was significantly shorter than in the <b>sulprostone</b> group (median 21. 3 hours, range: 7. 8 - 265. 0 hours). In the mifepristone/misoprostol group significantly more women (94 %) delivered within 24 hours than in the <b>sulprostone</b> group (55 %). In the mifepristone/misoprostol group anti-emetics and pain relief were given significantly less often than in the <b>sulprostone</b> group 5 versus 12 % and 54 versus 90 %, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of women with post partum blood loss (6 versus 6 %), (suspected) placental remnants (33 versus 43 %) or fever (12 versus 4 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent that the administration of <b>sulprostone</b> reduces the need for manual removal of the placenta in patients with retained placenta. STUDY DESIGN: A double-blinded sequential randomized controlled trial of <b>sulprostone</b> versus placebo was conducted among 103 patients with retained placenta. RESULTS: In the first phase of this sequential study, <b>sulprostone</b> was compared with placebo. The null hypothesis of equal effectiveness of both treatments was rejected after 50 patients. In patients with retained placenta, the placenta was expelled after <b>sulprostone</b> in 13 of 24 cases (51. 8 %, bias adjusted), whereas expulsion after placebo was achieved in only 4 of 26 cases (17. 6 %, bias adjusted). The difference was significant (P =. 034). In the second phase of the study, in which the placebo arm was stopped, results were confirmed; in 25 of 53 patients (47 %), the placenta was expelled.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if cervical ripening with the prostaglandin E 2 analogue dinoprostone effectively shortens the induction-to-delivery interval in midpregnancy terminations with <b>sulprostone.</b> STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively studied 100 women admitted for pregnancy termination at midgestation because of fetal anomalies between September 1989 and January 1993. Three regimens were used: 27 women received intramuscular <b>sulprostone</b> only, 29 women received intravenous <b>sulprostone</b> only, and 44 women received intravenous <b>sulprostone</b> after cervical priming with dinoprostone. Wilcoxon's rank sum {{test was used}} for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Dinoprostone priming did not significantly reduce the induction-to-delivery interval in either parous or nulliparous women. However, when divided into first and subsequent pregnancies, we found that primigravidae, but not multigravidae, had an induction-to-delivery interval that was significantly shorter by approximately 10. 5 h when pretreated with dinoprostone.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{two methods}} for second {{trimester}} termination of pregnancy: mifepristone and misoprostol versus Dilapan and <b>sulprostone.</b> METHODS: This was a randomized study involving 16 {{patients with a}} singleton live fetus with congenital malformations or genetic disorders. Eight patients were treated with 200 mg mifepristone orally followed by 200 microg misoprostol vaginally 3 hourly and eight patients received a <b>sulprostone</b> infusion after cervical dilatation with Dilapan. RESULTS: Mifepristone and misoprostol had a mean induction interval of 17. 8 hours and <b>sulprostone</b> and Dilapan 20. 9 hours. The mean induction interval did not differ significantly. Mean hospital stay was shorter in the patients treated with misoprostol: 2. 1 vs. 3. 3 days (p = 0. 02) with a 95 % confidence interval of - 2. 1 to 0. 3.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of contraction of guinea-pig isolated aorta {{induced by the}} prostanoid EP 3 receptor agonist <b>sulprostone</b> (0. 1 – 300 nm) has been investigated. In 60 % of the experiments, the <b>sulprostone</b> log concentration–response curve (maximum= 15 – 40 % of 100 nm U- 46619 response; low-responders) was unaffected by the removal of extracellular Ca 2 +, blockade of L-type Ca 2 + channels with nifedipine and depletion of internal Ca 2 + stores. In the remaining preparations (35 – 65 % of 100 nm U- 46619 response; high-responders), contractions to higher <b>sulprostone</b> concentrations showed a nifedipine-sensitive component, which was enhanced by charybdotoxin. In Ca 2 +-free Krebs solution, established contractions to 300 nm <b>sulprostone</b> were abolished by the Rho-kinase inhibitors H- 1152, Y- 27632 and HA- 1077 (IC 50 values= 190, 770 and 2030 nm). The PKA/Rho-kinase inhibitor H- 89 (10 nm– 10 μm) caused enhancement progressing to inhibition. The selective PKC inhibitor Ro 32 - 0432 (3 μm) had no effect, while staurosporine, recently {{shown to be a}} potent Rho-kinase inhibitor, abolished <b>sulprostone</b> responses (IC 50 ∼ 47 nm), but its action was slow. The MAP kinase inhibitors SB 202190, SB 203580 and PD 80958 produced little inhibition. In normal Krebs solution, H- 1152 and Y- 27632 abolished established contractions to 300 nm <b>sulprostone</b> and 1 μm phenylephrine, and partially inhibited 10 μm phenylephrine and 50 mm K+ responses. The results are discussed in relation to the reported potencies of the protein kinase inhibitors in enzyme assays.

40|$|A {{prospective}} randomized double-blind placebo-controlled {{trial was}} conducted in 13 subjects {{to find out whether}} mifepristone treatment could facilitate termination of second trimester pregnancy by <b>sulprostone.</b> The women received either 600 mg oral mifepristone or placebo tablets 36 hours before the administration of intramuscular <b>sulprostone</b> 0. 5 mg every 6 hours. The median interval between the administration of <b>sulprostone</b> and abortion in the mifepristone group (4. 6 hours) was significantly shorter than that in the placebo group (20 hours). The amount of <b>sulprostone</b> required was also significantly less in the mifepristone group.

We conclude that oral mifepristone is useful in facilitating termination of second trimester pregnancies by <b>sulprostone.</b> | Termination of second trimester pregnancies has been related to side effects. ATtempts have been made to shorten the induction-abortion interval and to lower dosage of the prostaglandins in order to reduce the incidence of side effects. In this study, 13 second trimester patients 18 - 35 years of age were administered mifepristone before the procedure which called for administration of intramuscular sulprostone; the trial was prospective and randomized and called for double-blind placebo controls. The objective was to determine whether administration of mifepristone would facilitate termination of the pregnancy. 6 women received 600 mg oral mifepristone in an unmarked packet 36 hours before the administration of. 5 mg <b>sulprostone</b> intramuscularly every 6 hours until the patient felt strong uterine contractions. 7 women received a placebo in an unmarked packet at the same time as those receiving mifepristone followed by <b>sulprostone.</b> Side effects, uterine contractions, blood pressure, and pulse were recorded every 2 hours. There were no significant differences in mean age of patients or in weight and height. Women were excluded who had any significant past or present medical disorder, who were using prescription drugs regularly, who were nursing or using hormonal contraception during or just before conception, or who were using an intrauterine device. The statistically significant results showed that the induction-abortion interval was shorter and the amount of <b>sulprostone</b> lower in the mifepristone group. 3 patients in the placebo groups did not abort within 24 hours and required administration of oxytocin and further injections of <b>sulprostone.</b> 2 patients (28. 6 %) in the placebo group required uterine evacuation under general anesthesia, and 4 patients (66. 7 %) in the placebo group required uterine evacuation due to incomplete abortions, which was not a statistically significant difference. Temperature highs were similar in both groups, but the amount of vomiting or diarrhea and the analgesic requirement was greater in the placebo group, but not significantly so. There was early termination of the study because of unexpected cardiovascular complications in another study; intravenous injection of <b>sulprostone</b> is recommended.

40|$|Objective. To compare effectiveness, side effects, and patients' {{perception}} of vaginal misoprostol versus intravenous <b>sulprostone</b> for ending pregnancy after fetal death between 14 and 42 weeks gestation. Method. Multicenter randomized controlled trial, using block randomization, central allocation, and prior power analysis. Outcome measures.

40|$|AbstractThe {{group of}} {{prostaglandin}} (PG) E 2 - and prostacyclin receptors consists of different subtypes, which exibit different affinities for prostaglandins and synthetic analogues.

The stable PGI 2 analogues, iloprost and cicaprost, both activate the PGI 2 receptor (IP) and iloprost, additionally, bind to the EP 1 subtype. Using these subtype-selective PG receptor agonists, we studied the interaction of PG receptor subtypes with Gs and Gi-type heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) in membranes from the human erythroleukaemia cell line, HEL. <b>Sulprostone</b> stimulated high-affinity GTPase in HEL membranes in a pertussis toxin (PTX) -sensitive manner.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Misoprostol and <b>sulprostone</b> are prostaglandins {{that can}} be used for the {{termination}} of second and third trimester pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of both agents for the termination of second and third trimester pregnancy in cases of congenital or genetic abnormalities, and for the induction of labour in cases of intra-uterine foetal death. STUDY DESIGN: We collected data from all women who had been treated with misoprostol in the second or third trimester of pregnancy between January 2001 and July 2002 in cases of congenital or genetic abnormalities, and for the induction of labour in cases of intra-uterine foetal death. In cases where the foetus was alive, misoprostol was usually (77 %) combined with mifepristone. Women were matched to women who had been treated with <b>sulprostone</b> for termination of second and third trimester pregnancy before 2001. We matched for hospital, previous vaginal delivery, intra-uterine death and duration of pregnancy. The primary outcome measure was time to delivery. RESULTS: Since the treatment effect was different in patients in whom labour was induced for intra-uterine death and patients in whom labour was induced while the foetus was alive, the analysis was stratified for this parameter. In 94 patients with intra-uterine death, there was no significant difference in time to delivery, blood loss, operative removal of the placenta and need for pain relief between misoprostol and <b>sulprostone.</b> In vital pregnancy (n = 96), time to delivery was significantly shorter in the misoprostol group. The relative risk for haemorrhage exceeding 1000 ml in this group was 0. 40 (95 % confidence interval, CI, 0. 13 - 1. 2). We observed no significant differences with respect to operative removal of the placenta or need for pain relief.

To date, the function of the prostanoid system in the brain has not been well characterized. The locus coeruleus (LC), the main noradrenergic nucleus in the brain, has been described to express the EP 3 receptor. The aim of this study was to characterize the functional relevance of EP 3 receptors in the LC by single-unit extracellular recordings in rat brain slices. We performed concentration-effect curves for different endogenous derivatives and selective agonists of EP 3 receptors. Thus, increasing concentrations of the EP 3 /EP 1 agonist <b>sulprostone</b> (0. 3 - 80 nM) fully inhibited the neuronal activity of LC cells, with an EC 50 value of 15 nM (n = 9). The EP 3 receptor antagonist L- 798, 106 (10 µM) caused a rightward shift (> 8 fold) in the concentration-effect curve for <b>sulprostone,</b> but the EP 2 receptor antagonist PF 04418948 (10 µM) or the EP 4 receptor antagonist L- 161, 982 (10 µM) failed to cause any rightward shift of <b>sulprostone</b> effect. On the other hand, perfusion with the endogenous PGE 2 (0. 3 nM- 1. 28 µM) o...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the magnitude of the intraocular-pressure (IOP) -lowering response in monkeys to the nonselective prostaglandin (PG) F 2 a-isopropyl ester (ie) can be reproduced by combining other PG-subtype-selective compounds. IOP was lowered by approximately 25 % after 4 – 5 days of topical administration with latanoprost (FP agonist, 1. 5 μg, q. d.), bimatoprost (prostamide, whose metabolites have been shown to be FP agonists; 9 μg, q. d.), or travoprost (FP agonist, 1. 2 μg, q. d) or the EP 2 agonist, butaprost (25 μg, b. i. d.). The EP 1 agonist, 17 -phenyl trinor (PhT) PGE 2 (b. i. d.), and EP 3 agonist, <b>sulprostone</b> (b. i. d.), had no IOP-lowering effects. The addition of butaprost, <b>sulprostone</b> (10 μg), or 17 PhTPGE 2 (25 μg) to latanoprost did not lower IOP more than latanoprost alone. However, treatment with the combination of latanoprost, 17 PhTPGE 2, butaprost, and <b>sulprostone</b> produced a similar 50 – 55 % reduction in IOP, as did PGF 2 α-ie (b. i. d.). In conclusion, latanoprost, travoprost, and bimatoprost produce similar IOP-lowering responses in normotensive monkeys and are most efficacious when administered q. d. pm, compared to b. i. d. The combination of the FP, EP 1, EP 2, and EP 3 agonists used in this study was sufficient to lower IOP by the same magnitude as PGF 2 α-ie, suggesting that combining PG-subtype agonists may be a potent antiglaucoma strategy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the transduction pathways elicited by prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) to inhibit hormone-stimulated adenosine 3 ′: 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation in the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) and medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL) microdissected from the rat nephron. In the OMCD, 0. 3 [*]μM PGE 2 and low concentrations of Ca 2 + ionophores (10 [*]nM ionomycin or 50 [*]nM A 23187) inhibited by about 50 % a same pool of arginine vasopressin (AVP) -stimulated cyclic AMP content through a same process insensitive to Bordetella pertussis toxin (PTX). <b>Sulprostone,</b> an agonist of the EP 1 /EP 3 subtypes of the PGE 2 receptor, decreased AVP-dependent cyclic AMP accumulation in OMCD and MTAL samples. The concentration eliciting half-maximal inhibition was of about 50 [*]nM in OMCD and 0. 1 [*]nM in MTAL. In MTAL, 1 [*]nM <b>sulprostone</b> and PGE 2 inhibited by about 90 % a same pool of AVP-dependent cyclic AMP content through a PTX-sensitive, Ca 2 +-independent pathway. In the OMCD, PGE 2 decreased by about 50 % glucagon-dependent cyclic AMP synthesis by a process sensitive to PTX and Ca 2 +-independent. <b>Sulprostone</b> 1 [*]nM induced the same level of inhibition. These results demonstrate that PGE 2 decrease hormone-dependent cyclic AMP accumulation through a Gαi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in MTAL cells and glucagon-sensitive cells of the OMCD or through a PTX-insensitive increase of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in AVP-sensitive cells of the OMCD...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Postpartum {{hemorrhage}} is {{the leading}} cause of maternal death worldwide. Recent data from trauma patients and patients with hemorrhagic shock have suggested that an increased fresh frozen plasma:red blood cell (FFP:RBC) ratio may be of benefit in massive bleeding. We addressed this issue in cases of severe postpartum hemorrhage. METHODS: We reviewed data from all patients diagnosed with severe postpartum hemorrhage during a 4 -year period (2006 - 2009). Patients who were treated with <b>sulprostone</b> and required transfusion within 6 hours of delivery were included in the study and were divided into 2 groups according to their response to sulprostone: bleeding controlled with <b>sulprostone</b> alone (<b>sulprostone</b> group) and bleeding requiring an additional advanced interventional procedure including arterial angiographic embolization and/or surgical procedures (arterial ligation, B-Lynch suture, or hysterectomy; intervention group). The requirement or no requirement for advanced procedures constituted the primary end point of the study. Propensity scoring was used to assess the effect of a high FFP:RBC ratio on bleeding control. RESULTS: Among 12, 226 deliveries during the study period, 142 (1. 1 %) were complicated by severe postpartum hemorrhage. Bleeding was controlled with <b>sulprostone</b> alone in 90 patients (63 %). Advanced interventional procedures were required for 52 patients (37 %). Forty-one patients were transfused with both RBCs and FFP. The FFP:RBC ratio increased over the study period (P < 0. 001), from 1 : 1. 8 at the start to 1 : 1. 1 at the end of the study period. After propensity score modeling (inverse probability of treatment weighting), a high FFP:RBC ratio was associated with lower odds for advanced interventional procedures (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval], 1. 25 [1. 07 - 1. 47]; P = 0. 008). There were no deaths, severe organ dysfunction, or other complications as a consequence of severe postpartum hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study, a higher FFP:RBC ratio was associated with a lower requirement for advanced interventional procedures in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage. The benefits of transfusion using a higher FFP:RBC ratio should be confirmed by randomized-controlled trials. Copyright © 2012 International Anesthesia Research Society.

40|$|Abstract Background Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), {{experimentally}} {{administered to}} asthma patients or assayed in murine models, improves allergen-driven airway inflammation. The mechanisms are unknown, but fluctuations of the endogenous cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 /prostaglandin/E prostanoid (EP) receptor pathway activity likely {{contribute to the}} clinical outcome. We analyzed {{the activity of the}} pathway in mice sensitized to aeroallergens, and then studied its modulation under exogenous PGE 2. Methods Mice were exposed to house dust mite (HDM) aeroallergens, a model that enable us to mimic the development of allergic asthma in humans, and were then treated with either subcutaneous PGE 2 or the selective EP 1 / 3 receptor agonist <b>sulprostone.</b> Simultaneously with airway responsiveness and inflammation, lung COX- 2 and EP receptor mRNA expression were assessed. Levels of PGE 2, PGI 2, PGD 2 were also determined in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Results HDM-induced airway hyperreactivity and inflammation were accompanied by increased COX- 2 mRNA production. In parallel, airway PGE 2 and PGI 2, but not PGD 2, were upregulated, and the EP 2 receptor showed overexpression. Subcutaneous PGE 2 attenuated aeroallergen-driven airway eosinophilic inflammation and reduced endogenous PGE 2 and PGI 2 production. <b>Sulprostone</b> had neither an effect on airway responsiveness or inflammation nor diminished allergen-induced COX- 2 and PGE 2 overexpression. Finally, lung EP 2 receptor levels remained high in mice treated with PGE 2, but not in those treated with <b>sulprostone.</b> Conclusion The lung COX- 2 /PGE 2 /EP 2 receptor pathway is upregulated in HDM-exposed mice, possibly as an effort to attenuate allergen-induced airway inflammation. Exogenous PGE 2 downregulates its endogenous counterpart but maintains EP 2 overexpression, a phenomenon that might be required for administered PGE 2 to exert its protective effect. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRat hepatocytes have {{previously}} {{been reported to}} possess prostaglandin E 2 receptors of the EP 3 -type (EP 3 -receptors) that inhibit glucagon-stimulated glycogenolysis by decreasing cAMP. Here, the isolation of a functional EP 3 β receptor cDNA clone from a rat hepatocyte cDNA library is reported. This clone can be translated into a 362 -amino-acid protein, that displays over 95 % homology to the EP 3 β receptor from mouse mastocytoma. The amino- and carboxy-terminal region of the protein are least conserved. Transiently transfected HEK 293 cells expressed a single binding site for PGE 2 with an apparent Kd of 15 nM. PGE 2 > PGF 2 α > PGD 2 competed for [3 H]PGE 2 binding sites as did the EP 3 receptor agonists M&B 28767 = <b>sulprostone</b> > misoprostol but not the EP 1 receptor antagonist SC 19220. In stably transfected CHO cells M&B 28767 > <b>sulprostone</b> = PGE 2 > misoprostol > PGF 2 α inhibited the forskolin-elicited cAMP formation. Thus, {{the characteristics of the}} EP 3 β receptor of rat hepatocytes closely resemble those of the EP 3 β receptor of mouse mastocytoma...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIE Prostanoid (EP) receptors play an {{important}} role in urinary Na+ excretion. In the kidney, the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is the rate-limiting-step for Na+ reabsorption. We hypothesized that activation of EP 1 /EP 3 regulates the expression of ENaC in the face of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone-system (RAAS) activation. In primary cultures of inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells, <b>sulprostone</b> (EP 1 > EP 3 agonist, 1 lM) and 17 Phenyl trinor (17 Pt, EP 1 agonist, 10 lM) prevented the up-regulation of aENaC mRNA induced by aldosterone (10 nM). In Sprague–Dawley rats infused with angiotensin II (0. 4 lg/kg/ min), aENaC expression was up-regulated in renal cortex and medulla coincidently with high plasma aldosterone levels. <b>Sulprostone</b> and/or 17 Pt prevented this effect in renal medulla but not in cortex. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that IMCD cells express EP 1. Our results suggest that specific activation of EP 1 receptor during RAAS activation antagonizes the action of aldosterone on aENaC expression in the renal medulla.

40|$|International audienceProstaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) is {{a potent}} {{mediator}} generated in immune tissues by cyclooxygenation of arachidonic acid. PGE 2 affects T cell functions through four homologous G protein-coupled receptors termed EP 1 R, EP 2 R, EP 3 R, and EP 4 R that differ in tissue distribution and signaling. Antigen-evoked secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by sperm whale myoglobin-specific Th 1 cells of DBA/ 2 mouse I-Ed-restricted clones, that express EP 3 Rs and EP 4 Rs, was enhanced a maximum of 3 -fold by 10 (- 10) to 10 (- 8) M PGE 2 and 2. 5 -fold each for the EP 1 R/EP 3 R-directed agonist <b>sulprostone</b> (10 (- 8) and 10 (- 7) M) and for the EP 4 R/EP 3 R/EP 2 R agonist misoprostol (10 (- 9) M). Neither PGE 2 nor the synthetic analogs affected secretion of IFN-gamma by PMA plus ionomycin-stimulated clones of Th 1 cells. Antigen-evoked secretion of IFN-gamma by influenza hemagglutinin-specific mouse lymph node Th 1 cells, that also express EP 3 Rs and EP 4 Rs, was increased a maximum of 12 -fold by 10 (- 9) to 10 (- 8) M PGE 2, 14 -fold by 10 (- 9) M <b>sulprostone,</b> and 10 -fold by 10 (- 9) M misoprostol. Production of IFN-gamma by either type of Th 1 cell was not affected significantly by 10 (- 6) M PGE 2 alone. The generation of IFN-gamma by antigen-stimulated Th 1 cells thus is significantly enhanced by physiologically relevant concentrations of PGE 2...|$|E
40|$|Although prostaglandins {{are largely}} used and {{considered}} safe drugs to induce midtrimester abortion, the literature reports several cases of uterine rupture consequent to their administration. We report the second ever-described case of uterine rupture after administration of gemeprost and <b>sulprostone</b> for midtrimester abortion in a 45 years-old women with scarred uterus. She {{was admitted to}} our Unit for termination at 20 weeks' gestation because of trisomy 21 diagnosed by chromosomal analysis of amniotic liquid at 16 weeks' gestation. Five pessaries of gemeprost (one pessary, every 3 hours) were administered into the posterior vaginal fornix. Since the cervix remained closed and uneffaced, another cycle of 5 gemeprost administration was conducted. When the cervix changed in consistency and dilatation, we decided to administrate <b>sulprostone.</b> At the obstetric examination any visible fetus was evidenced. The abdominal ultrasonography showed an empty uterine cavity and the gestational sac with the dead fetus in abdomen. Emergency laparotomy was therefore undertaken. Primary suture of the ruptured uterus was initially attempted but in vain. Therefore, total abdominal hysterectomy was performed to control bleeding and eventual hypovolemic shock. Given the lack of strong evidence in literature {{and the fact that}} case reports are not an optimal method for assessing frequency of an event nor the overall risks of a procedure since they frequently report rare single events, other larger studies are needed to assess whether women with multiple risk factors (e. g. advanced age and previous uterine surgery), and administered with prostaglandins' association have a higher risk of uterine rupture...|$|E
40|$|The prostanoid, PGE 2, {{is known}} to inhibit human lung mast cell activity. The aim {{of the present study}} was to {{characterize}} the EP receptor that mediates this effect. PGE 2 (pEC 50, 5. 8 ± 0. 1) inhibited the IgE-mediated release of histamine from mast cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Alternative EP receptor agonists were studied. The EP 2 -selective agonist, butaprost (pEC 50, 5. 2 ± 0. 2), was an effective inhibitor of mediator release whereas the EP 1 /EP 3 receptor agonist, <b>sulprostone,</b> and the EP 1 -selective agonist, 17 -phenyl-trinor-PGE 2, were ineffective. The DP agonist PGD 2, the FP agonist PGF 2 α, the IP agonist iloprost and the TP agonist U- 46619 were ineffective inhibitors of IgE-mediated histamine release from mast cells. PGE 2 induced a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP levels in mast cells. The effects of the EP 1 /EP 2 receptor antagonist, AH 6809, and the EP 4 receptor antagonist, AH 23848, on the PGE 2 -mediated inhibition of histamine release were determined. AH 6809 (pKB, 5. 6 ± 0. 1) caused a modest rightward shift in the PGE 2 concentration–response curve, whereas AH 23848 was ineffective. Long-term (24 [*]h) incubation of mast cells with either PGE 2 or butaprost (EP 2 agonist), but not <b>sulprostone</b> (EP 1 /EP 3 agonist), caused a significant reduction in the subsequent ability of PGE 2 to inhibit histamine release. Collectively, these data suggest that PGE 2 mediates effects on human lung mast cells by interacting with EP 2 receptors...|$|E
