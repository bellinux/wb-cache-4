5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm.

She said he was short with her and <b>seemed</b> to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who <b>seemed</b> normal.|$|E
