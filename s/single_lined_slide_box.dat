40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{algorithm}} to evaluate fractal dimension and lacunarity of images at various box sizes by modifying the traditional <b>sliding</b> <b>box</b> counting method using Brownian motion expansions, and demonstrate {{the effectiveness of}} these quantities in image segmentation. In this approach, the mass variation (total pixel value) in each scale is used during the conventional <b>sliding</b> <b>box</b> approach, and then the power law formula is applied to determine both fractal dimension and lacunarity for the respective box sizes. Exploiting the synergy between fractal properties, the ratio of lacunarity to fractal dimension is used to determine an optimal threshold for edge detection in Canny method.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the effects of two types of drip {{irrigation}} line design on cotton yield, water use, and net returns. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} arid region of Xinjiang, Northwest China, during 2009 - 2010 growing years. The two types of lateral placement are commonly used by the local farmers in the area: double lines (two laterals controlling four rows) and <b>single</b> <b>line</b> designs (one lateral controlling four rows). The results indicated that less irrigation water was applied by <b>single</b> <b>line</b> compared with double lines design. This implies that more irrigation water could be saved using <b>single</b> <b>line,</b> by reducing the water consumption of cotton. The emergence rates for double lines were 2 and 6 % higher than those for <b>single</b> <b>line</b> design in 2009 and 2010. The seed cotton yields for double lines design were 5. 76 and 6. 41 Mg ha(- 1) which were 13 and 9 % higher than for <b>single</b> <b>line</b> design in 2009 and 2010, respectively. <b>Single</b> <b>lines</b> could however lower the investment cost compared to double lines, which produced 10 and 7 % more net income in 2009 and 2010, respectively.
