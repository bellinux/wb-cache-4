5000|$|<b>Sun</b> <b>gun</b> - a {{parabolic}} mirror in orbit designed to focus sunlight onto specific locations on the Earth's surface ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the story}} goes on, Orion Assante is driven to desperation {{following}} the deaths of his loved ones and leads a private army to destroy the <b>Sun</b> <b>Gun.</b> Pellon Cross escapes Tujiro's clutches and turns {{a number of his}} fellow COPs into vampires, enlisting their allegiance against the Pope. Thatcher, Pellon's vampires and Orion's army all attack the Vatican tower and it is destroyed before the <b>Sun</b> <b>Gun</b> is activated. Tujiro and Thatcher apparently perish in the process.|$|E
5000|$|Bruce Hegerberg {{designed}} the <b>Sun</b> <b>Gun</b> from a 60mm dia. 900mm fl. optical tube which is mounted inside a 3" [...] PVC {{which is in}} turn connected to a 20" [...] plastic flower planter. A rear projection screen is then mounted {{on the top of}} the flower planter. The entire <b>Sun</b> <b>Gun</b> can be made from items easily found at most local hardware stores. The scope itself is an inexpensive 60mm refractor available from many sources.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} {{the middle of a}} clear morning, still cold, but the <b>sun</b> was shining. <b>Guns</b> were {{speaking}} intermittently. Those soldiers who were off duty had their gas-masks in their hands. All were gazing intently upward.|$|R
5000|$|The White Clouds Course {{opened in}} 2008, {{on the former}} land of the <b>Sun</b> Valley <b>Gun</b> Club. The newest of the courses, the nine-hole layout has {{impressive}} views and severe elevation changes over its 3605 yd and is the most difficult, with a course rating of 37.5 (75.0 for 18 holes) and a slope of 145. [...] Also designed by Jones, it is named after the White Cloud Mountains in adjacent Custer County.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the band}} members have since gone on to form or {{collaborate}} {{with a variety of}} acts including One Watt <b>Sun,</b> The Hired <b>Guns,</b> Beam Up, Leather Pet, Legends of Motorsport, The Snuff Puppets, Snout, and Will Guthrie.|$|R
50|$|The Phoebe Waterman Haas Public Observatory has a main {{telescope}} {{used during}} the nighttime, {{as well as a}} <b>Sun</b> <b>Gun</b> Telescope and other telescopes for observing the sun.|$|E
50|$|The observatory's 4-inch <b>Sun</b> <b>Gun</b> Telescope is {{used for}} viewing the {{photosphere}} of the sun in the visible spectrum. There are also other instruments for viewing the hydrogen-alpha (red) and calcium-K (purple) light emitted by the chromosphere.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sun</b> <b>gun</b> or heliobeam is a {{theoretical}} orbital weapon, which {{makes use of}} a concave mirror mounted on a satellite, to concentrate rays from the sun on to a small area of the Earth's surface, destroying targets or killing through heat.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} made by Seven Arts Productions and {{acquired}} by Paramount for distribution. It was the company's third film, after Gunrunners and Ten Seconds to Hell. It was known during filming as Between the Thunder and the <b>Sun</b> and The <b>Gun</b> and the Arrow.|$|R
50|$|Following this Brainiac, now in {{possession}} of his ship again, unleashes his robot army against the newly created planet of New Krypton, and the Kryptonian citizens rise up to fight the drones. General Zod's army proves totally unable to fend them off, as the Brainiac's ship's force fields are seemingly invulnerable and his drones are equipped with red <b>sun</b> ray <b>guns,</b> allowing them to kill {{tens of thousands of}} Kryptonians. Superman, being the only one who knows how to penetrate his force fields (having learned the trick in the previous story arc), manages to enter Brainiac's ship. Supergirl leads the Kryptonians against the drones, but is attacked by an anti-Kryptonian Brainiac probe. Superboy, Mon-El, and the Legion of Super-Heroes join the fight and save Supergirl.|$|R
2500|$|An {{adaptation}} of Land Rovers to military purposes is the [...] "Pink Panther" [...] models. Approximately 100 Series IIA models were adapted to reconnaissance use by British {{special operations forces}} the SAS. For desert use they were often painted pink, hence the name. The vehicles were fitted with among other gear a <b>sun</b> compass, machine <b>guns,</b> larger fuel tanks and smoke dischargers. Similar adaptations were later made to Series IIIs and 90/110/Defenders.|$|R
5000|$|In the TV series Scorpion episode [...] "Sun of a Gun", Walter O'Brien's fictional {{alter ego}} {{and his team}} are sent {{alongside}} their friend Sylvester Dodd's estranged father to an African dictator's country to investigate his discovery of a Nazi World War II <b>sun</b> <b>gun</b> project.|$|E
50|$|To combat this threat, the Church {{establishes}} a second Inquisition. Pellon Cross, {{head of the}} mercenary Confederacy Of Police (COP), is hired to provide added security. Tujiro uses Cross to retrieve materials needed to complete the <b>Sun</b> <b>Gun.</b> As an afterthought, he turns Cross into a vampire servant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sun</b> <b>Gun</b> Telescope, as {{featured}} in the August 1999 issue of Scientific American magazine, was designed so that large groups of people can view the sun safely - in particular it was created {{as a way to}} encourage children to become interested in astronomy. With this safe and portable device, both amateur science enthusiasts and professionals alike can observe sun spots.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, the Denharts hired Phil Iosca as CEO/President who refocused {{the company}} on young children's apparel. Then, in 2001, the Denharts sold the company {{for a total of}} $175 million. Following the initial sale, Hanna Andersson was sold to a {{succession}} of private equity firms, ultimately sold to <b>Sun</b> Capital Partners. <b>Gun</b> Denhart remained on the Board of Directors until 2007. When Iosca retired in 2010, then-COO Adam Stone was named the new CEO of the company.|$|R
5000|$|Gün Ana {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} deities, the goddess of life and fertility, warmth and health. She is patroness of the unfortunate, especially orphans. She lives on the seventh floor of the sky. Gök Tanrı created the earth with rays of <b>sun</b> light, thus, <b>Gun</b> Ana took part in the creation of earth. Solar rays are also considered to be [...] "strings" [...] between the sun and the spirits of plants, animals and humans. Turks who worship Gun Ana turn towards the sunrise when praying.|$|R
50|$|After Oghuz {{becomes the}} khan, {{he goes to}} steppes by himself to praise and pray to Tengri (Sky-God). While praying he sees a circle of light coming from the sky, there was a supernaturally {{beautiful}} girl in the light. Oghuz {{falls in love with}} the girl and marries her. He has three sons which he names <b>Gün</b> (<b>Sun),</b> Ay (Moon) and Yıldız (Star). Later, Oghuz goes hunting and sees another supernaturally beautiful girl inside a tree. He marries her and has three sons which he names Gök (Sky), Dağ (Mountain) and Deniz (Sea).|$|R
50|$|Orion {{comes to}} believe he is {{actually}} possessed by the devil, by the spirit of Grendel. He disappears from public life and tracks down Eppy Thatcher, who is alive, hiding in the sewers beneath Vegas. Interrogating Eppy, Orion has an inspiration. Adapting the technology of Tujiro's <b>sun</b> <b>gun,</b> Orion develops a new weapon called the Sun-Disk and devastates Japan. China surrenders, making Orion Assante ruler of Earth, Orion I.|$|E
50|$|The Phoebe Waterman Haas Public Observatory {{opened its}} doors to public in 2009 {{as part of the}} celebration of the International Year of Astronomy. It has a 16-inch Boller & Chivens telescope, a <b>Sun</b> <b>Gun</b> Telescope and hydrogen-alpha (red light, to see the chromosphere) and calcium-K (purple light) telescopes. The {{observatory}} opens to public from Wednesdays through Sundays from noon to 3 P.M. and is open about once a month at night time.|$|E
50|$|Orbital {{weaponry}} is any {{weapon that}} is in orbit around a large body such as a planet or moon. As of April 2017, there are no known operative orbital weapons systems, but several nations have deployed orbital surveillance networks to observe other nations or armed forces. Several orbital weaponry systems were designed by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. During World War II Nazi Germany also was developing plans for an orbital weapon called the <b>Sun</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
60|$|The natives in {{this part}} of the river resided entirely on the {{northern}} side. They were hunters, as well as fishermen, and had horses in plenty. Some of these were purchased by the party, as provisions, and killed on the spot, though they occasionally found a difficulty in procuring fuel wherewith to cook them. One of the greatest dangers that beset the travellers {{in this part}} of their expedition, was the vast number of rattlesnakes which infested the rocks about the rapids and portages, and on which the men were in danger of treading. They were often found, too, in quantities about the encampments. In one place, a nest of them lay coiled together, basking in the <b>sun.</b> Several <b>guns</b> loaded with shot were discharged at them, and thirty-seven killed and wounded. To prevent any unwelcome visits from them in the night, tobacco was occasionally strewed around the tents, a weed for which they have a very proper abhorrence.|$|R
50|$|The ten ship Polish fleet was {{commanded}} by Admiral Arend Dickmann in the galleon Sankt George (Święy Jerzy) which was anchored at the Danzig roadstead. The Swedish squadron of six ships sailed from the Hel Peninsula. The less experienced Poles immediately took the attack to the Swedish squadron, an aggressive move that surprised the Swedes. The battle then {{split into two}} separate events. 1. The Polish flagship Sankt Georg (galleon, 400t, 31 guns), supported by the smaller Meerwieb (Panna Wodna -160t, 12 guns) attacked the Swedish flagship Tigern (Tiger, 320t, 22 guns), that was {{commanded by}} Admiral Niels Stiernskold. Entangled together, the Polish marines boarded and captured the Tigern. 2. The Vice Admiral's ship of the Polish Navy, the small galleon Meerman (Wodnik, 200t, 17 guns) attacked the larger Swedish Solen (<b>Sun,</b> 300t, 38 <b>guns),</b> whose captain blew up the ship, rather than let be captured. The remaining four Swedish ships fled and escaped pursuit. Both the Polish and Swedish Admirals were killed.|$|R
5000|$|Controversy arose {{around the}} film as Azerbaijani writer Elchin Huseynbeyli claimed that {{the plot of the}} film {{contains}} many of the same elements as his story <b>Sun</b> Blinding (Gözlərimə <b>gün</b> düşür). The writer says he wrote it in early 2010. The story was published on 27 February 2010 in 525th gazzet, and in the June issue of [...] "Friendship of Peoples". There was a discussion on the topic at a press conference with the Azerbaijan Writers Union. The event was attended by representatives of the Copyright Agency of Azerbaijan. Huseynbeyli also suggested Copyright Agency of Azerbaijan contact on the matter to the Committee for Movie Awards. However, Michael Poghosyan (writer of [...] "If Only Everyone") claims that he wrote the script in early 2010 after meeting with people who lived through the war and the production followed in the spring of 2010. Additionally, Michael Poghosyan stated, [...] "We could similarly accuse the Azerbaijanis of stealing the story of our film Longing, where the main hero crossed a border to die in his homeland." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the film}} Die Another Day, the twentieth {{installment}} in the James Bond series of films, the primary antagonist of the film, fictional British billionaire Gustav Graves (in reality the alias of the assumed-to-be-dead North Korean Colonel Tan Sun-Moon), constructs an orbital <b>sun</b> <b>gun</b> code named [...] "Icarus" [...] {{for the use}} of cutting a path through the Korean Demilitarized Zone and allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea. The device was disabled after its control console is destroyed.|$|E
50|$|A team of {{television}} superheroes that Chiro idolizes. Super Quasar, {{the leader of}} the group, can emit solar energy from his visor. Aurora Six the stunning and single female member wields the <b>Sun</b> <b>Gun.</b> Johnny Sunspot, an older midget who looks like a young boy, uses special gloves to create and control black holes. They once worked under the Skeleton King, but eventually turned to the Hyperforce's side. Super Quasar was voiced by Keone Young Aurora Six voiced by Meredith Salenger and Johnny Sunspot was voiced by Tom Kenny.|$|E
5000|$|Later during World War II, a {{group of}} German {{scientists}} at the German Army Artillery proving grounds at Hillersleben began to expand on Oberth's idea of creating a superweapon that could utilize the sun's energy. This so-called [...] "sun gun" [...] {{would be part of}} a space station 8200 km above Earth. The scientists calculated that a huge reflector, made of metallic sodium and with an area of , could produce enough focused heat to make an ocean boil or burn a city. After being questioned by officers of the United States, the Germans claimed that the <b>sun</b> <b>gun</b> could be completed within 50 or 100 years.|$|E
5000|$|In the 26th century, much of Earth is {{contaminated}} and {{unfit for}} life. America is fragmented {{into a number}} of corporate [...] "systems" [...] dominated by a corrupt Catholic Church, now based in [...] "Vatican Ouest" [...] in Colorado and led by Pope Innocent XLII, who is greedily taxing resources to build a huge, ostentatious tower. Unknown to the public, Pope Innocent XLII is actually the vampire Tujiro, who centuries ago inspired Christine Spar to become the second Grendel and whose associate Brian Li Sung became the third Grendel. The true purpose of the Pope's new tower is not pride but to house a weapon called the <b>Sun</b> <b>Gun,</b> which will block sunlight from reaching Earth.|$|E
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for making precise point-to-point displacement measurements on critical structures under structural, thermal, or gravity loading. The technique consists of attaching the gauge to the structure at one point, and connecting it to a second point on the structure by a thin (0. 25 mm) tungsten wire. The wire provides a dual function: in addition to physically connecting the gauge to a remote point, it provides a calibrating function. Tests have demonstrated that measurements can be made within a micron over a length of a meter or two, even {{in the presence of}} severe thermal shock, such as exposure to a <b>sun</b> <b>gun</b> or to a refrigerant spray...|$|E
