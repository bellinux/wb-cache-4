Abstract — Introduction. <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> are {{susceptible}} to postharvest decay. The use of synthetic fungicides is discouraged in postharvest handling because they can leave a residue and present a safety risk. Therefore, naturally occurring compounds have been considered as an alternative. Fumigation of short-chain organic acids and essential oils has shown promise in controlling fungal activities. This study reports their effects on <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries.</b> Material...|$|R

25|$|Native and {{non-native}} sweet cherries grow well in Canada's {{provinces of}} Ontario and British Columbia where an annual cherry fiesta has been celebrated for seven consecutive {{decades in the}} Okanagan Valley town of Osoyoos. In addition to the Okanagan, other British Columbia cherry growing regions are the Similkameen Valley and Kootenay Valley, all three regions together producing 5.5 million kg annually or 60% of total Canadian output. <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> varieties in British Columbia include 'Rainier', 'Van', 'Chelan', 'Lapins', 'Sweetheart', 'Skeena', 'Staccato', 'Christalina' and 'Bing'.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultivated}} {{forms are}} of the species <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> (P. avium) to which most cherry cultivars belong, and the sour cherry (P. cerasus), which is used mainly for cooking. Both species originate in Europe and western Asia; they do not cross-pollinate. Some other species, although having edible fruit, are not grown extensively for consumption, except in northern regions where the two main species will not grow. Irrigation, spraying, labor, and their propensity to damage from rain and hail make cherries relatively expensive. Nonetheless, demand is high for the fruit. In commercial production, cherries are harvested by using a mechanized 'shaker'. Hand picking is also widely used to harvest the fruit to avoid damage to both fruit and trees.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of short hyperbaric treatments to control postharvest decay of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> (Prunus avium L., cv Ferrovia) and table grapes (Vitis vinifera L., cv Italia) was investigated. <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> and table grape berries {{were exposed to}} the pressure of 1140 mmHg (1. 5 atm) for 4 and 24 It, respectively, in 64 L gas-proof tanks. Fruit kept at ambient pressure (near 760 mmHg, 1. 0 atm) served as a control. Postharvest rots of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> arose from naturally occurring infections, whereas table grape berries were artificially wounded, exposed to the hyperbaric treatment, then the wounds inoculated with 20 mu L of a Botrytis cinerea conidial suspension (5 x 10 (4) spores mL(- 1)). <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> were stored at 0 +/- 1 degrees C for 14 d, followed by 7 d at 20 +/- 1 degrees C. Table grapes berries were kept at 20 +/- 1 degrees C for 3 d. On <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries,</b> hyperbaric treatment reduced the incidence of brown rot, grey mould, and blue mould, with respect to the control. Similarly; on treated table grapes a significant reduction of lesion diameter and percentage of B. cinerea infected berries was observed. Induced resistance was likely to be responsible for the observed decay reduction. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the {{effectiveness of}} short hyperbaric treatments in controlling postharvest decay of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> and table grapes.

40|$|Fifty-one {{endophytic}} isolates of Aureobasidium pullulans {{were obtained}} from the flesh of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> and extensively screened to evaluate their biocontrol activity against postharvest rots of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> and table grapes. Preliminary analysis of all isolates by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) with three different primers showed the presence of a high genetic variability and enabled isolates not showing any genetic difference to be discarded. Thirty-five isolates with different RAPD electrophoresis patterns had a wide range of biocontrol activity against Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia laxa on single-wounded berries of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> and table grapes with a reduction of decay from 10 to 100 %. Two isolates (533 and 547) significantly reduced R cinerea on table grape berries also when applied 6, 12, and 24 h after the pathogen inoculation. In a 2 -year period of investigation (1998 - 1999), a reduction of total rots ranging from 32 to 80 % (<b>sweet</b> <b>cherries)</b> and from 59 to 64 % (table grape) was achieved with isolates 533 and 547 applied after harvest. Preharvest applications of isolate 547 significantly reduced postharvest rots of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> and table grapes by 47 and 38 %, respectively. On the whole, isolates 533 and 547 were more effective than A. pullulans L 47, a biocontrol agent of postharvest diseases with a known activity. Population studies demonstrated that isolate 547 was able to survive under field conditions, to increase its population during cold storage, and to penetrate the flesh of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> when applied during flowering.

40|$|As the {{population}} tends to urbanize, the potential consumer market of fresh produce becomes {{distant from the}} producing farm. This distance brings to growers and handlers the problems of how to keep their fresh products unspoiled after harvest and during transit period of shipping, {{and how they can}} be delivered to the specified destination without substantial deterioration. It is the common interest of fruit growers, shippers, wholesalers, and retailers that the shelf-life of fresh fruit be prolonged to increase sales. <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> are one of the important fruit crops in Utah. Being highly perishable, fresh <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> have relatively short storage life after harvest. It is known that the approximate limit for the successful commercial storage of fresh <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> is about 10 days to 2 weeks only. A practicable measure for extending this storage limit has to be established so that the market may have fresh <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> over a longer season and also be able to balance the time of plenty and the time of scarcity. Furthermore, the Utah grown cherries may find new outlets in the distant market. Thus the benefit will be shared by the grower, the seller, and the consumer. Metabolic breakdown and fungal deterioration are the two important factors which cause the spoilage of fruits. Studies have shown that with many perishable produces, precooling [...] the prompt application of refrigeration prior 2 to normal storage or transportation is the key to successful storage. Hydro -cooling treatment is considered to be advantageous especially in Utah, where high temperature and low relative humidity predominate during the harvest season of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries.</b> Post-harvest chemical and packaging treatments of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> are possible approaches on ext ending the keeping quality of the fruits concerned. With some of the antifungal agents available today, the fungi which cause fruit decay might be successfully controlled. As a matter of fact, new fungicides, antifungal antibiotics, and packaging films are continuously developed by the industries in the United States. Appropriate combination of these newly developed materials with hydro-cooling followed by refrigerated storage, coupled with in vitro study of the effects of chemicals on fruit decay organisms, might lead to an improvement in the storage life of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries.</b> It was with this idea in mind that experiments were conducted to study the effects of hydro-cooling, chemicals, and packaging treatments on preserving fresh <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> and also in vitro effects of chemicals on certain fungi responsible for fruit deterioration...|$|R
