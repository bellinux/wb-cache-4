The same year the company bought five used de Havilland DH.60 Moths from the Norwegian Army Air Service and started aviation schools in Oslo and Bergen. Widerøe's Flyveselskap A/S was founded by Viggo Widerøe, Einar Isdahl and Arild Widerøe on 19 February 1934. Skis were equipped on the Cabins and Spartan during winter. The company also started ambulance flights. In April the company expanded their share capital from NOK25,000 to NOK65,000. The money was used to buy a seaplane variant Cabin and on 15 June it started flying the post route from Oslo via Kristiansand and Stavanger to Haugesund. During the summer the company arranged a summer camp for youth and bought a <b>sail</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E

50|$|The B&R 23 is a {{sailing boat}} {{designed}} in the early 1990s. It has an ultralight construction with a very large <b>sail</b> <b>plane.</b> Typical crew is a helmsman and two deck hands in trapezes. The boat is predominately used for racing.|$|E
50|$|This {{resulted}} in an extremely light (420 kg/926 lbs), minimum resistance, high performance apparent wind boat with a huge <b>sail</b> <b>plane,</b> particularly for downwind, where the total sail area is close to 100 m2 (1,000 sqft). The boat is capable of planing in modest winds downwind, and even on upwind the boat performs very well, in parity with much bigger 38-40 foot yachts.|$|E

50|$|The boat {{has almost}} no form stability: {{walking on the}} gunwale, the boat {{immediately}} heels over. There is not much weight stability either, the 90 kg’s of the ‘keel’ does not provide enough momentum to keep the boat upright, even without any wind pressure in the <b>sail</b> <b>plane.</b> In this respect the boat is {{much more of a}} dinghy than a keel boat. On water under sail, the boat must be kept upright by active crew work, balancing, hiking, steering and constant adjustment {{of the power of the}} sails.|$|E
50|$|During World War II {{the young}} artist and writer was {{captured}} in France; he was transported to Marseille, where he was shipped to Oran. After 3 or 4 days he was transported to the United States. Press was trained as an unarmed <b>sail</b> <b>plane</b> glider pilot. He moved to Hamburg in 1945 and attended the Hochschule für Bildende Künste. While {{a prisoner of war}} at Ft. D.A. Russell in Texas, he painted detailed murals of far West Texas mountain scenes at Building 98 in Marfa, Texas. The murals are on the National Register of Historic Places. He departed Marfa, Texas, in 1945 while there he created two west Texas watercolors of local residents one performing a Spanish dance and another playing the Spanish guitar.|$|E
5000|$|Both vessels were damaged. Vanguard {{received}} {{damage to}} the outer casing {{in the area of}} the missile compartment on the starboard (right) side. Triomphant was initially said to have received {{damage to the}} active sonar dome under her bow, indicating that Triomphant ran into Vanguard from above and amidship, but was later reported as having received impacts to three parts of her structure, with her conning tower and the starboard <b>sail</b> <b>plane</b> attached to the conning tower visibly deformed by the incident. According to the Daily Telegraph, the cost of repairing the damage to both boats was expected to amount to up to £50 million. [...] Both vessels returned to home bases under their own power, Vanguard to Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde in the Firth of Clyde, on 14 February 2009 and Triomphant to Île Longue in Brittany, escorted by a frigate as a normal procedure, although it is unclear whether this was an unplanned return following the incident.|$|E

40|$|The wake of {{wind energy}} rotors is modeled as a tip vortex helix with a vortex {{strength}} estimated from its rotor thrust. A fixed-wing <b>sail</b> <b>plane</b> and a helicopter whose rotor is {{represented as a}} fixed-wing circular disk (instead of rotating blades) are subjected to the wake. In both cases the roll moment induced by the wake is compared to the maximum roll control moment of the aircraft. For comparison with revolving blades, the blade element momentum theory {{is applied to the}} isolated rotor and a simulation of an entire helicopter is used also. It is found that typical on-shore power plants could be a hazard for sailplanes, but not for helicopters. Large off-shore wind energy converters, however, could even be a danger for small helicopters that may be used for maintenance...|$|E
40|$|To clarify certain conspicious unsymmetries in the {{radiated}} noise from piston-powered single-engine propeller-driven aeroplanes "air-to-air acoustic measurements" were conducted employing an inherently quiet <b>sail</b> <b>plane</b> as a microphone carrier and {{to fly the}} very test aircraft at various positions relative to it (i. e. above, below and to the side of). The test aircraft, a Dornier DO 27, was equipped with a 6 -piston combustion engine and a 2 -blade propeller with an uneven gear-ratio in between, faciliting the separation of propeller and engine exhaust contributions in the combined radiated acoustic pressure time history (PTH). The engine's twin pipe exhaust system was located {{on the underside of}} the aircraftsuch that its two orifices were acoustically shielded to some extent from an observer above the aircraft.

40|$|A three-axis {{solar sail}} {{attitude}} control system for interplanetary missions is proposed: required steering is achieved {{by means of a}} small control mass in the solar <b>sail</b> <b>plane,</b> whereas roll-axis control is achieved through the rotation of ballast with two masses at the extremities. The satellite is fixed at the sail geometrical centre: this solution avoids the difficulties arising from the employment of an out-of-plane control boom with the satellite at the end, i. e. pointing problems for optical payloads and communication antennas. A circular sailcraft of 220 kg with characteristic acceleration a(c) = 0. 5 mm/s(2) is considered, and the control system performances are presented in terms of pointing accuracy for a rendezvous mission to Mercury. The dynamical model takes into account the perturbation torque because of an offset between the centre of pressure and the geometrical sail centre, as well as the Sun gravity-gradient effect and a perturbation torque on the roll axis...|$|E

50|$|Since seas were moderate, the {{decision}} was made to attempt to <b>sail</b> the <b>plane</b> to Hawaii. The crew then rigged crude sails made from fabric torn from the aircrafts wings and sailed the aircraft a further 450 miles, finally being spotted on the ninth day about 15 miles off the southeast coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai. In the aftermath of the headline-grabbing rescue, Commander Rogers was promoted to the position of Assistant Chief of the Navys Bureau of Aeronautics.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} finding the optimal steering law for a flat solar sail whose propulsive acceleration is described by an optical force model. In particular, the problem amounts to looking for the optimal direction of the unit vector normal to the <b>sail</b> <b>plane</b> that maximizes the projection of the propulsive acceleration along a given direction. Starting from the known results from the literature, according to which a close form solution for the general case of not (fully) specularly reflecting sail cannot be retrieved, the propulsive acceleration is approximated by a mathematical model that closely resembles the classical optical force model. Using this new approach, {{the solution of the}} optimal steering law is shown to be written in an analytical form that is fully general and extremely accurate. In this sense, the proposed mathematical model may effectively be used to analyze the impact of the thermo-optical characteristics of the sail film on the optimal steering law within a wide range of different mission scenarios...|$|E
40|$|NanoSail-D 2 unfurled January 17 th, 2011 and {{commenced}} a nine month Low Earth Orbit path to reentry {{to evaluate}} a sail's capacity to deploy in space and deorbit satellites. The orbit was strongly affected by variables including but not limited to: initial attitude, orbit lighting, solar radiation pressure, aerodynamic drag, gravity, and Center of Pressure offsets. The effects of these variables were evaluated through a 3 -DOF rigid body simulation. The sail experienced stability in orbits which were continuously lit, i. e. did not orbit behind Earth. Probable drag area experienced by the sail for the mission is also estimated from orbital data and compared to the attitude simulation results. Analysis focuses on sail behavior in full lighting conditions to establish {{the limits of the}} sails stability in full lighting. Solar radiation pressure, aerodynamic drag, and gravity torque effects are described. Lastly, a reasonable upper bound on the variation of the Center of Pressure from the geometric center of the <b>sail</b> <b>plane</b> is established. Each of these results contributes to the design requirements for future solar sails...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of nonlinear aeroelastic static analysis in the structural design of high aspect ratio wings. As an indicator of {{the importance of}} static nonlinearity, the root bending moment is used. A relatively accurate prediction of the bending moment of a flexible wing is important in early design stages, since it largely determines the wing box weight. A linear Timoshenko beam element in a corotational framework is used as a nonlinear structural model. For the aerodynamics, Weissinger’s method is used. The nonlinearly coupled structural and aerodynamical equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson method. The load distribution is obtained for the aircraft trimmed at a range of load factors. Results for root bending moment, trimmed angle-of-attack, and wing tip deformation are presented for a high aspect ratio composite wing of a high performance open class <b>sail</b> <b>plane.</b> It is shown that the root bending moment obtained using nonlinear analysis differs significantly from the results of a linear analysis at high load factors. The reasons for the difference are found to be (i) end shortening, (ii) stiffening of the wing, (iii) change in trimmed angle-of-attack, and (iv) load redistribution. Therefore, it is concluded that nonlinear static aeroelastic effects are significant for the structural design of flexible high aspect ratio wings and ought {{to be included in the}} preliminary design stage.

40|$|A report {{discusses}} {{the ability to}} control the attitude and translation degrees-of-freedom of a solar sail vehicle by changing its center of gravity. A movement of the spacecraft s center of mass causes solar-pressure force to apply a torque to the vehicle. At the compact core of the solar-sail vehicle lies the spacecraft bus which is a large fraction of the total vehicle mass. In this concept, the bus is attached to the spacecraft by two single degree-of-freedom linear tracks. This allows relative movement of the bus in the <b>sail</b> <b>plane.</b> At the null position, the resulting solar pressure applies no torque to the vehicle. But any deviation of the bus from the null creates an offset between the spacecraft center of mass and center of solar radiation pressure, resulting in a solar-pressure torque on the vehicle which changes the vehicle attitude. Two of the three vehicle degrees of freedom can be actively controlled in this manner. The third, the roll about the sunline, requires a low-authority vane/propulsive subsystem. Translation control of the vehicle is achieved by directing the solar-pressure-induced force in the proper inertial direction. This requires attitude control. Attitude and translation degrees-of-freedom are therefore coupled. A guidance law is proposed, which allows the vehicle to stationkeep at an appropriate point on the inertially-rotating Sun-Earth line. Power requirements for moving the bus are minimal. Extensive software simulations have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept...|$|E
