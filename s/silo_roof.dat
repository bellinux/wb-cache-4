40|$|Exports of {{processed}} rice {{have been}} increasing every year, {{as well as}} legislative restrictions and consumer demand for certified chemical free rice, pressing the rice processing industry to new challenges. The objective of this work was {{the implementation of a}} Rice Quality Certification Program. The package includes the association of a rigorous sanitation program and safe environmentally friendly control measures. It was accomplished in a large paddy rice facility with 40 silos during the 2008 / 09 rice crop. Silo sanitation was done by washing with pressurized water the conveyor belt structure above the <b>silo</b> <b>roof,</b> around the externals walls and thorough aspiration of the aeration system. During silo filling, the lower and top portions of the rice grain were treated with a mixture of diatomaceous earth (DE) and powder deltamethrin. Artificial chilling was applied as soon as the top layer of the grain mass was leveled by insufflating cool air (6 to 8 ºC) with a large cooling machine through the aeration system. The grain mass temperature stabilized at about 12 - 14 ºC, and kept this range of temperature for about 60 d. As the temperature of the grain mass increased, mainly on the top layer, aeration was performed with natural air from the cold fronts during the winter months. After 8 months on storage the rice was free of external insects, as proved by the grain sampling just before processing. For the 2009 / 10 crop season, the rice quality program will be repeated on 60 silos with few adjustments...|$|E

It is sheathed in shiplap siding and has two attached wood <b>silos</b> with conical <b>roofs.</b> Also on the property are the contributing concrete silo, gas pump, windmill, pole barn, and a fenced lot. The farm was originally developed by the Sisters of the Holy Cross, then converted to a park in 1966.|$|R
40|$|Ferrocement {{construction}} technology is quite popular throughout the world. Ferrocement, a thin element, {{is used as}} a building construction as well as a repair material. This paper attempts to review the literature on ferrocement and bring out the salient features of construction, material properties and the special techniques of applying cement mortar on to the reinforcing mesh. This study brings out the importance of using ferrocement in swimming pools and water tanks, <b>silos,</b> corrugated <b>roofs,</b> shell and dome structures, and also in the repair of old/ deteriorated RCC structures. Also is discussed in this paper a similar material to ferrocement, termed as Engineered Cementitious Composite, which uses fibers as reinforcement. The recommendations of this study include addition of fibers in ferrocement to reduce crack-width. The present authors recommend that experimental investigation may be conducted on new reinforcing materials by researchers in the future. The study concludes that ferrocement will certainly {{be one of the best}} structural alternatives for RCC in the future...|$|R
5000|$|The Slayton Farms-Round Barn is an {{historic}} structure located near Iowa Falls in rural Hardin County, Iowa. It {{was built in}} 1915 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1986. [...] The barn is one of 16 that was built by the Johnston Brothers Clay Works from Fort Dodge, Iowa. [...] It is constructed of hollow clay tiles and features a gambrel roof with two different pitches and hay dormer. Two aerators flank the central <b>silo</b> on the <b>roof.</b> [...] The interior of the barn is fashioned around the silo from which silage was shoveled to feed the cattle. An overhead track system and a bucket for hauling materials remains intact.|$|R
40|$|Alfalfa silages {{were made}} in pilot- and farm-scale silos, and five sealing {{treatments}} were compared. After 90 days, sealing dramatically reduced DM losses at the 5 and 10 in. depths in the farm silos and at the 0 to 12, 12 to 24, and 24 to 36 in. depths in the pilot silos. Extending the storage period to 180 days in pilot silos {{had no effect on}} DM losses for sealed or delay sealed silages, but DM losses for unsealed silages continued to increase at all three depths. Placing a roof over the unsealed, farm-scale silo increased the silage DM content at all three depths, increased storage temperatures at the 10 and 20 in. depths, and reduced DM loss at the 10 in. depth compared to the unsealed <b>silo</b> without a <b>roof.</b> Rainfall was much above normal (16. 8 in. during the first 90 days of storage; 11. 2 in. the second 90 days) and contributed to huge increases in the moisture content of silage at the lower depths in the unsealed, no roof, pilot- and farm-scale silos...|$|R
40|$|Concrete shells – towards {{efficient}} structures: {{construction of}} an ellipsoidal concrete shell in Switzerland Concrete shells {{have been widely used}} in the past as economical and suitable solutions for a number of structures such as <b>roofs,</b> <b>silos,</b> cooling towers and offshore platforms. Taking advantage of their single or double curvature, bending moments and shear forces are limited, and the structures develop mostly membrane (in-plane) forces, allowing them to span large distances with limited thicknesses (typically just a few centimetres). In recent decades, advances in numerical modelling, formwork erection and concrete technology have opened up a new set of possibilities for the use of concrete shells. This paper describes the design and construction of a shell {{in the form of an}} ellipsoid (93 × 52 × 22 m) and with thickness varying between 100 and 120 mm. The shell was built using sprayed concrete and also ordinary concrete in some regions. A number of tailored solutions were also adopted, such as post-tensioning, addition of fibres and shear studs, to ensure satisfactory performance at both the serviceability and ultimate limit states...|$|R
50|$|The round, two-story barn {{is unusual}} with a conical <b>roof,</b> <b>silo</b> and cupola, {{looking like a}} three tiered wedding cake. The main roofing system is a conical design that is {{penetrated}} by the large silo with square, single-paned windows. The silo is in turn capped by a round cupola with an even steeper pitched conical roof. The attached rectangular barn (built 1915) has a gambrel roof. The balloon frame walls of both barns rest on poured concrete foundations.The roof has been covered with asphalt replacement shingles. Walls are original. The cupola has decorative shingles. Horizontal wood siding covers the silo and the barn. The rectangular barn is also covered in horizontal wood siding. The main entry is centered on east facade, the large doors of vertical wood pieces swing out to offer access. Above the doors is an upper level hay door. Around the structure are eight spaced square, single-paned windows on the lower level. On the northwest is a large sliding-door, then the attached rectangular barn and two more windows {{before returning to the}} main door. On the upper level, there is the upper hay doors, followed by a bay without a window, then a window positioned slightly lower than the other upper level units. Following this window is another upper level hay door of smaller, then five windows centered above the lower level windows, along with another upper level window to the north. The silo has four square, windows, located on the four compass points.The rectangular barn is very simple in design with equally spaced square windows along the east, west and north walls. There is a small sliding door on the south located near the connector to the round barn and a large door on the north that opens into the main drive.|$|R
40|$|Os silos metálicos, quando vazios, são suscetíveis ao amassamento das chapas do corpo cilíndrico pela ação do vento. Este trabalho compara os efeitos do enrijecimento interno e externo com colunas, no comportamento aerodinâmico de silos cilíndricos com telhado cônico. Os estudos teóricos conduziram a ensaios em túnel de vento, que foram realizados em dois tipos de modelos reduzidos: um com superfície lisa (enrijecimento interno) e o outro com superfície nervurada (enrijecimento externo), ambos em duas relações geométricas de altura/diâmetro do cilindro (0, 5 e 1, 0) e inclinação da cobertura cônica de 27 º. Com base nos ensaios, foram obtidos os coeficientes de pressão externa e os coeficientes de arrasto nos cilindros, bem como os coeficientes de arrasto e de sustentação na cobertura. Com isso, identificou-se o melhor tipo de enrijecimento ao projeto otimizado de silos para resistir adequadamente à ação do vento. O resultado final é um conjunto de dados atualizado, oriundo de ensaios com características de semelhança geométrica e aerodinâmica definidas, que é aplicável a qualquer tipo de silo cilíndrico. Steel {{cylindrical}} silos, when empty, {{are susceptible}} to the crumpling of the sheeting of the cylinder by the wind action. This paper compares the effects of internal and external stiffening with columns on the aerodynamic behavior of cylindrical <b>silos</b> with conical <b>roof.</b> The theoretical studies leaded to wind tunnel experiments, which {{have been carried out}} on two types of scaled silo models, one with smooth surface (internal stiffening), the other with ribbed surface (external stiffening), both with two geometric height/diameter ratio of cylinder (0. 5 and 1. 0) and a conical roof pitch equal to 27 º. Based on the information gained during these experiments, external coefficients of pressure and drag and lift coefficients are derived for the cylinders, as well as the drag and lift coefficients for the conical roofs. With this, it is identified the best stiffening arrangement for an optimum design of cylindrical silos to resist wind loads. The final result is an updated data set, originated from tests with geometric and aerodynamic characteristics well conditioned, which are applicable to a variety of cylindrical silos...|$|R
