40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the question of}} how the perception of 3 D information of digital holograms reconstructed numerically and presented on conventional displays depends on motion and <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>presentation.</b> Perceived depth in an adjustable random pattern stereogram was matched to the depth in holographic objects. The objects in holograms were a microscopic biological cell and a macroscopic coil. <b>Stereoscopic</b> <b>presentation</b> increased perceived depth substantially in comparison to non-stereoscopic presentation. When stereoscopic cues were weak or absent e. g. because of blur, motion increased perceived depth considerably. However, when stereoscopic cues were strong, the effect of motion was small. In conclusion, for the maximisation of perceived 3 D information of holograms on conventional displays, it seems highly beneficial to use the combination of motion and <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>presentation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} that group subjective measures of presence {{as well as}} observers' postural responses are sensitive to increasing the realism of a display with motion content, {{by the addition of}} stereoscopic information, using a 20 -inch stereoscopic screen with an effective horizontal field of view of 28 deg. (Freeman, Avons, Meddis, Pearson, & IJsselsteijn, 2000). The experiment presented here employed a large projection display with a 50 deg. horizontal field of view showing a rally car traversing a curved track at speed. The independent variables included image motion and <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>presentation</b> as within-subjects factors and screen size as a between-subjects factor. Dependent variables included subjective measures of presence, vection, involvement, and sickness, as well as observers' lateral postural responses, which served as a candidate objective corroborative measure of presence. Results demonstrated a noisy yet positive effect of <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>presentation</b> on the lateral postural responses. Post-test subjective ratings revealed a significant effect of <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>presentation</b> on the subjective judgments of presence, but not on those of vection, involvement, or sickness. Image motion had a large and significant effect on the subjective judgments of presence, vection, and involvement. The effect of image motion was considerably larger than that of stereoscopic viewing. By comparing results between experiments, a large effect of screen size on subjective presence ratings could be demonstrated, but only for the video stimulus that contained motion. The postural response measure did not differentiate between screen sizes, thus limiting its utility as an objective corroborative measure of presence, although further research is required {{to be able to be}} more firm in our conclusion regarding this issue...|$|E

The current paper presents a classroom experiment ascertaining differences, and potential advantages and disadvantages, of 2 D versus 3 D (<b>stereoscopic)</b> <b>presentations</b> of landscape changes. The landscape to be valued was a traditional Alpine pasture in the Austrian Alps as a prominent example of natural and cultural heritage (traditional economy and specific ecology). Two alternative scenarios included, on the one hand, changes in agricultural uses, leading to natural afforestation (reforestation) and decay of existing infrastructure (e. g., hiking trails). On the other hand, significantly extended tourism infrastructure (e. g., new attractions for visitors) was presented. Two groups were presented manipulated pictures (2 D/non-stereoscopic), and 3 D (<b>stereoscopic)</b> <b>presentations</b> with 3 D glasses, respectively. Both groups were then asked for their perception of landscape changes. It turns out that {{significant differences between the}} two groups could be detected in terms of the frequency of vacations at Alpine pastures. For instance, respondents in the 3 D stereoscopic group stated a significantly higher frequency of trips. However, on the other hand, they did not state a significantly different willingness-to-pay to prevent landscape changes disadvantageous in terms of sustainability. The study results thus suggest that the mode of presentation may affect the valuation of landscape changes depending on the valuation instrument...|$|R

40|$|Online {{presentation}} of virtual 3 D {{objects in the}} Web, based on Internet standards, is limited due to several performance bottlenecks, quality restrictions and missing functionality.

This paper describes the concept, implementation and evaluation of an optimized viewer, based on a new 3 D stream format. The design of this 3 D representation and the strategies realized in the viewer were tuned for efficiency, especially to take advantage of high bitrates to obtain short latency.

40|$|AbstractConcerns about {{potentially}} harmful {{effects on the}} visual system due {{to the use of}} head mounted displays (HMDs) in general, and stereoscopic systems in particular, have been raised in the literature. Most of the concerns were based on studies measuring visual function changes following short-term use of HMDs. This study measured functional changes in binocular vision, accommodation, and resolution following 30 min use of HMD in both stereoscopic- and non-stereoscopic modes, and compared them to changes following the same task performed on a desk-top CRT display. No functional differences were found between HMD and CRT and most measured changes were too small to be considered clinically meaningful. An evaluation of subjective comfort found a statistically significant difference in the impression of comfort between the CRT and the HMD in stereoscopic mode, with the latter being less comfortable.

40|$|Among all imaging {{techniques}} {{that have been}} invented throughout the last decades, computer graphics {{is one of the}} most successful tools today. Many areas in science, entertainment, education, and engineering would be unimaginable without the aid of 2 D or 3 D computer graphics. The reason for this success story might be its interactivity, which is an important property that is still not provided efficiently by competing technologies – such as holography. While optical holography and digital holography are limited to presenting a non-interactive content, electroholography or computer generated holograms (CGH) facilitate the computer-based generation and display of holograms at interactive rates [2, 3, 29, 30]. Holographic fringes can be computed by either rendering multiple perspective images, then combining them into a stereogram [4], or simulating the optical interference and calculating the interference pattern [5]. Once computed, such a system dynamically visualizes the fringes with a holographic display. Since creating an electrohologram requires processing, transmitting, and storing a massive amount of data, today’s computer technology still sets the limits for electroholography. To overcome some of these performance issues, advanced reduction and compression methods have been developed that create truly interactive electroholograms. Unfortunately, most of these holograms are relatively small, low resolution, and cover only a small color spectrum. However, recent advances in consumer graphics hardware may reveal potential acceleration possibilities that can overcome these limitations [6]. In parallel to the development of computer graphics and despite their non-interactivity, optical and digital holography have created new fields, including interferometry, copy protection, data storage, holographic optical elements, and display holograms. Especially display holography has conquered several application domains. Museum exhibits often use optical holograms because they can present 3 D objects with almost no loss in visual quality. In contrast to most stereoscopic or autostereoscopic graphics displays, holographic images can provide all depth cues—perspective, binocular disparity, motion parallax, convergence, and accommodation—and theoretically can be viewed simultaneously from an unlimited number of positions. Displaying artifacts virtually removes the need to build physical replicas of the original objects. In addition, optical holograms can be used to make engineering, medical, dental, archaeological, and other recordings—for teaching, training, experimentation and documentation. Archaeologists, for example, use optical holograms to archive and investigate ancient artifacts [7, 8]. Scientists can use hologram copies to perform their research without having access to the original artifacts or settling for inaccurate replicas. Optical holograms can store a massive amount of information on a thin holographic emulsion. This technology can record and reconstruct a 3 D scene with almost no loss in quality. Natural color holographic silver halide emulsion with grain sizes of 8 nm is today’s state-of-the-art [14]. Today, computer graphics and raster displays offer a megapixel resolution and the interactive rendering of megabytes of data. Optical holograms, however, provide a terapixel resolution and are able to present an information content in the range of terabytes in real-time. Both are dimensions that will not be reached by computer graphics and conventional displays within the next years – even if Moore’s law proves to hold in future. Obviously, one has to make a decision between interactivity and quality when choosing a display technology for a particular application. While some applications require high visual realism and real-time presentation (that cannot be provided by computer graphics), others depend on user interaction (which is not possible with optical and digital holograms). Consequently, holography and computer graphics are being used as tools to solve individual research, engineering, and presentation problems within several domains. Up until today, however, these tools have been applied separately. The intention of the project which is summarized in this chapter is to combine both technologies to create a powerful tool for science, industry and education. This has been referred to as HoloGraphics. Several possibilities have been investigated that allow merging computer generated graphics and holograms [1]. The goal is to combine the advantages of conventional holograms (i. e. extremely high visual quality and realism, support for all depth queues and for multiple observers at no computational cost, space efficiency, etc.) with the advantages of today’s computer graphics capabilities (i. e. interactivity, real-time rendering, simulation and animation, <b>stereoscopic</b> and autostereoscopic <b>presentation,</b> etc.).

However, when used with 3 -D block diagrams to present semi-discrete data of the type usually presented by crosstab tables, the technique was less successful than a conventional crosstab presentation.

40|$|Within {{the area}} of {{broadcasting}} and entertainment, stereoscopic displays are used to heighten the viewer's sense of excitement and qual ity. To evaluate these subjective experiences, an appreciation-oriented approach may be appropriate. Within this context, the current study investigates the influence of image disparity, convergence distance and focal length on the subjective assessment of depth, naturalness of depth and quality of depth. Twelve observers viewed a set of stereoscopic still images varying in image disparity, convergence distance and focal length. Each observer was asked to rate his/her impression of depth, naturalness of depth and quality of depth, in separate counterbalanced sessions. Results indicate that observers prefer a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>presentation</b> of images over a monoscopic presentation. A clear optimum was found at 4 em image disparity for both subjective judgments of naturalness and of quality. A focal length effect was only found for extreme image disparities. Although {{there was a strong}} linear relationship between naturalness and quality (a correlation of r=O. 96), a small but systematic deviation could be observed. This quality-naturalness shift is discussed in relation to similar, yet more pronounced findings in the domain of colour perception...|$|E
