40|$|Due {{to the low}} temperatures, {{the heating}} {{efficiency}} of {{air source heat pump}} systems during the winter is very low. To address this problem, a low-temperature solar hot water system was added to a basic air source heat pump system. Several parameters were tested and analyzed. The heat collection efficiency of the solar collector was analyzed under low-temperature conditions. The factors that affect the performance of the heat pumps, such as the fluid temperature, pressure, and energy savings, were analyzed for cases where the <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>auxiliary</b> heat pump and the air source heat pump are used independently. The optimal heating temperature and the changes in the fluid temperature were determined. The influence of the compression ratio and the coefficient of performance (COP) were investigated theoretically. The results revealed the parameters that are important to the performance of the system. Several measures for improving the COP of the heat pump units are provided for other applications and future research...|$|E

40|$|A pioneer {{system of}} solar water {{desalination}} was constructed, tested and numerically simulated for moderate latitudes, Cairo 30 °N. The humidification/dehumidification (HD) process is considered in this system. The salt water is heated by either <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> or/and <b>auxiliary</b> heater before injection inside an insulated desalination chamber using an air atomizer. The air is supplied into a condenser by a 0. 4 kW blower {{and later on}} it pulls hot salt water up through the atomizer from an insulated tank. By this idea the air is preheated inside the condenser and {{is used as a}} water pump. The flashing water is evaporated and condensed simultaneously above the condenser surface. A 2. 39 M 2 flat-plate solar collector is used to heat the salt water existed in an insulated tank. The tank opening is closed by the chamber one. By this way the salt water is circulated naturally inside the solar water heater where it is forced inside the desalination chamber. A numerical simulation of the considered system was developed and validated. It was provided a mathematical model of each system component. The system was successfully tested using either <b>solar</b> or/and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>energies.</b> It can produce about 36 liter daily of purified water where the using of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> alone can obtain about 12 liter on clear days. To visualize the heat and mass transfer inside the chamber temperature and humidity distribution were measured. The annual and monthly performance of the system is presented.

40|$|Abstract—The most {{significant}} barrier to improving passive RFID tag performance for both fixed function ID tags and enhanced RFID tags is the limitation {{on the amount}} of power that can be harvested for operation. This paper presents a novel approach for incorporating solar harvesting capability into existing passive RFID tags without increasing the parts count or changing the tag assembly process. Our approach employs the tag’s antenna as a dual function element in which the antenna simultaneously harvests RF energy, communicates with the RFID reader, and harvests <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> for <b>auxiliary</b> power. This is accomplished by using low cost, printable photovoltaics deposited on flexible substrate to form part of the antenna’s radiating structure. Several prototype UHF RFID antennas are demonstrated using commercially available thin film, amorphous solar cells. To quantify the improvement in tag performance, Intel’s WISP was used as an initial test vehicle. The effective read range of the tag was increased by six times and exceeded the reader’s sensitivity limitations. Additionally, the new antenna allowed for sensing and computing operations to take place independent of the RFID reader under typical office lighting conditions...|$|R
