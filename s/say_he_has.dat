5|$|The next day, Peter {{gets the}} Lizard photos {{published}} in the Bugle and gets the money he needs. However, when Gwen, Eddie, and the Connors find out, they are outraged that he ran off simply to take pictures and <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> lost their trust. Although Martha understands the difficult choices that Peter had, she fires him. He secretly grabs another vial of gene cleanser and returns home, frustrated about his reputation. Blaming the events that gave him his powers, {{he is about to}} take the vial when he sees a photo of himself with Ben. Realizing that he had saved Curt either way, he decides that Spider-Man is needed and hides the vial under his desk.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{the lawyers}} of Bin al-Shibh {{argued that he}} may be unfit to stand trial and {{participate}} in his own defense. They have asked that the proceedings against him and his four co-accused be stayed until his mental state is determined. They <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been prescribed psychotropic drugs of the sort that are used to treat schizophrenia. Bin al-Shibh claims that he is mentally fit, has denounced his lawyers, and says that he wants to represent himself before the commissions.|$|E

The joke may yet prove to be {{at the expense of the}} Turner." [...] In a separate piece, the newspaper implied that the K Foundation had hit their perceived target with some success: ...|$|E

500|$|Peterborough's Director of {{football}} Barry Fry criticised Nottingham Forest's owners for {{pulling out of}} the deal to sign Boyd, and chairman MacAnthony said, [...] "I'm devastated for George. I got a phone call off him in bits... He said that he passed the medical then they made him do an eye test. He's played 300 matches and scored from the halfway line the other month, but Forest <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> an eyesight problem. The whole thing stinks. Alex McLeish wanted to sign him. It's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to me." [...] Peterborough subsequently said that with Boyd's contract expiring in the summer, they would be prepared to offer him a new contract or let him leave on loan when the emergency loan window opened, with at least one club having signalled their interest in doing so.|$|E

2500|$|This {{idea was}} later {{developed}} in ancient philosophy by the Stoic school. Stoic epistemology generally {{emphasized that the}} mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it.

2500|$|Farber's book, How to Learn any Language never {{specifies}} {{all of the}} 25 languages {{that his}} publicity materials <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> studied. He says {{in the book that}} when he was inducted into the U.S. Army in 1952, he was [...] "tested and qualified for work in fourteen different languages" [...] and has since learned more in some of those languages as well as the others. He mentioned in the 2005 interview that he still constantly learns bits and pieces of new language—some Albanian phrases or a new phrase each time he went into a grocery store where a Tibetan woman works.|$|E

[...] On February 21, 2007, {{in an interview with}} Maureen Dowd of the New York Times, Geffen described Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton in unflattering terms: [...] "Everybody in politics lies, but they do it with such ease, it's troubling." [...] He said that Hillary Clinton was [...] "incredibly polarizing" [...] and described Bill Clinton as [...] "reckless" [...] and cast doubt on those who <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> become a different person since leaving office.|$|E
2500|$|Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Duchamp-Villon, and Jacques Villon are {{currently}} exhibiting at the Der Sturm gallery in Berlin. Jean Metzinger represents an extremely sophisticated art. He completes to perfection what he paints—not satisfying himself by drawing, he states. If Mr. Ingres, {{in spite of}} his considerable reputation, did not have somewhat restrained press, I would <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the Japanese qualities of Ingresque painting.

2500|$|In Southey's {{personal}} appearance, {{there is}} something eccentric, even off-putting: he [...] "walks with his chin erect {{through the streets of}} London, and with an umbrella sticking out under his arm, in the finest weather." [...] "With a tall, loose figure, a peaked austerity of countenance, and no inclination to embonpoint, you would <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> something puritanical, something ascetic in his appearance." [...] Hazlitt hopes the negative aspects of his character will dissipate, wishing that Southey live up to his own ideal as expressed in his poem [...] "The Holly-Tree" [...] so that [...] "as he mellows into maturer age, all [...] asperities may wear off...." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, not all {{reception}} {{has been}} positive; {{the book has}} {{had its share of}} critics. Rohrer writes, [...] "Many of these readers are disappointed that the novel fails to meet the expectations generated by the mystique it is shrouded in. [...] J. D. Salinger has done his part to enhance this mystique. [...] That is to <b>say,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done nothing." [...] Rohrer assessed the reasons behind both the popularity and criticism of the book, saying that it [...] "captures existential teenage angst" [...] and has a [...] "complex central character" [...] and [...] "accessible conversational style"; {{while at the same time}} some readers may dislike the [...] "use of 1940s New York vernacular" [...] and other things.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} is, {{what are}} {{the ways in which}} peasant music is taken over and becomes transmuted into modern music? We may, for instance, take over a peasant melody unchanged or only slightly varied, write an accompaniment to it and possibly some opening and concluding phrases. This kind of work would show a certain analogy with Bach's treatment of chorales.... Another method... is the following: the composer does not make use of a real peasant melody but invents his own imitation of such melodies. There is no true difference between this method and the one described above.... There is yet a third way... Neither peasant melodies nor imitations of peasant melodies can be found in his music, but it is pervaded by the atmosphere of peasant music. In this case we may <b>say,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> completely absorbed the idiom of peasant music which has become his musical mother tongue.|$|E
