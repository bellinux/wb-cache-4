40|$|Calculations {{are made}} for a fluid-filled tube with {{characteristics}} approximately those found physiologically. The pressure variation, diameter, and compliance at the input end are as measured by Lawton for the abdominal aorta of a dog. After a 30 cm-long input section of constant k (=dp/dA), the tube is taken to stiffen by approximately the amount measured by Patel et al., i. e., k increases {{by a factor of}} 5 over the next 40 cm. The cross-section remains constant. Pressure and velocity wave forms are calculated at 8 stations spaced at 10 -cm intervals down the tube. The pressure pulse leading edge is found to become steeper in the <b>stiffening</b> <b>section.</b> The peak height of the pressure pulse is found to increase by about 50 % and the velocity pulse to decrease by about 30 % as the disturbance propagates over a distance of 70 cm. These values agree qualitatively with the experimental physiological values given by McDonald. Most of the pressure peaking takes place upstream of the <b>stiffening</b> <b>section...</b>|$|E

The sections under investigation are hollowed extrusions which have been reinforced with boron epoxy by means of a fiber infiltration scheme being developed by Avco. Advantages of this type of construction are cost, environmental stability, manufacturing flexibility, and simplicity in joining. Present studies are focused on developing and verifying structural concepts for stiffener sections for compression panels. Results of analytical studies to size boron reinforcement will be discussed. Compression test results on stiffener sections will be presented and the design of a large compression panel will be reviewed.

40|$|Stiffener {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{components}} of aircraft structures to increase the load carrying capacity. Damage in the stiffener, mostly in the form of crack is an unavoidable problem in aerospace structures. Stiffener is bonded to the inner side of the aircraft panel which is not accessible for immediate inspection. A sensor-actuator network can be placed on the outer side of the panel that is accessible. Ultrasonic lamb waves are transmitted through stiffener using the sensoractuator network for detecting the presence of damages. The sensor-actuator network is placed on both halves of the <b>stiffened</b> <b>section</b> on the accessible surface of the plate. Detecting damage in stiffener by using this technique has significant potential for SHM technology. One of the major objectives of the present work is to determine the smallest detectable crack on the stiffener using the proposed technique. Wavelet based damage parameter correlation studies are carried out. In the proposed scheme, with increase in the damage size along the stiffener, it is found that the amplitude of the received signal decreases monotonically. The advantage of this technique is that the stiffened panels need not be disassembled in a realistic deployment of SHM system...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This study aims {{to analyse}} slender {{thin-walled}} anisotropic box-beams. Fiber-reinforced laminated composites could {{play an important}} role in the design of current and future generations of innovative civil aircrafts and unconventional unmanned configurations. The tailoring characteristics of these composites not only improve the structural performance, and thus reduce the structural weight, but also allow possible material couplings to be made. Static and dynamic aeroelastic stability can be altered by these couplings. It is, therefore, necessary to use an accurate and computationally efficient beam model during the preliminary design phase. Design/methodology/approach - A proper structural beam scheme, which is a modification of a previous first-level approximation scheme, has been adopted. The effect of local laminate stiffness has been investigated to check the possibility of extending the analytical approximation to different structural configurations. The equivalent stiffness has been evaluated for both the case of an isotropic configuration and for simple thin-walled laminated or <b>stiffened</b> <b>sections</b> by introducing classical thin-walled assumptions and the classical beam theory for an equivalent system. Coupling effects have also been included. The equivalent analytical and finite element beam behaviour has been determined and compared to validate the considered analytical stiffness relations that are useful in the preliminary design phase. Findings - The work has analyzed different configurations and highlighted the effect of flexural/torsion couplings and a local stiffness effect on the global behaviour of the structure. Three types of configurations have been considered, namely, a composite wing box configuration, with and without coupling effects; a wing box configuration with sandwich and cellular constructions; and a wing box with stiffened panels in a coupled or an uncoupled configuration. An advanced aluminium experimental test sample has also been described in detail. Good agreement has been found between the theoretical and numerical analyses and the experimental tests, thus confirming the validity of the analytical relations. Practical implications - The equivalent beam behaviour that has been determined and the stiffness calculation procedure that has been derived could be useful for future dynamic and aeroelastic analyses. Originality/value - The article presents an original derivation of the sectional characteristics of a thin-walled composite beam and a numerical/experimental validatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} Finite Strip is {{modified}} {{and applied to}} the three dimensional analysis of rib stiffened soil-steel structures. The strips are oriented in the curved direction, so {{that the effect of}} stiffeners is determined by considering them as individual strips. The eccentricity of the <b>stiffened</b> <b>section</b> is incorporated in the displacement functions to satisfy the continuity of the shell between the strips. The surrounding soil is replaced by the spring analog model. The spring coefficients are dependent on the type and depth of soil and the direction of wall displacement. Displacement functions are developed to model a soil-steel structure during side filling and under the traffic loads. The developed formulation has been verified by the laboratory scale model tests as well as by prototype test results. It has been observed that the provision of stiffeners at closer spacing (say 1. 0 m c/c) in the upper zone of the conduit has considerable effect in reducing the conduit deformation and the combined stresses during construction. However, if the stiffeners are widely spaced (say 2. 75 m c/c or more) the bending load carrying capacity of the stiffened upper zone is increased but slightly when compared with the capacity of non-stiffened conduits. The practice of analysing the conduit as a plane structure is found to be approximately valid if the ratio of conduit radius (R) to stiffener spacing (S) is greater than 0. 6. If S/R (LESSTHEQ) 0. 2, the stiffeners are considered to be fully acting with the main shell, while for 0. 2 3 ̆c S/R 3 ̆c 0. 6, the stiffeners are considered to be partially acting with the main shell. A simplified two-dimensional analysis procedures are suggested for stiffened soil-steel structures during and after backfilling. The failure tests of a laboratory scale model indicated that the stiffeners have considerable effect on the overall buckling of the conduit but little effect on the local buckling in the zone between the stiffeners, especially when localized live load is applied.

40|$|As {{the steel}} is tested {{for all types}} of tests viz, compressive, tensile test, shear test, torsion test, etc. This paper {{provides}} an experimental investigation for the compressive strength of Cold – Formed light gauge steel plain (<b>stiffened)</b> tubular <b>sections.</b> The test specimens were brake pressed from high strength structural steel sheets. In addition, the test strengths were compared with the design strengths calculated using the Indian Standard and North American Specification for Cold –Formed steel structures. Compression members are linear members in which axial forces act to cause elongation (stretch). Such members can sustain loads up to the ultimate load, at which stage they may fail by rupture at a critical section. However, if the gross area of the member yields over a major portion of its length before the rupture load is reached, the member may become non – functional due to excessive elongation. I.

40|$|Abstract- Stiffened {{panel is}} a {{component}} in aircraft {{that is used}} to fasten the stiffener and the skin. These are the components that carry and allocate the loads throughout the surface of the fuselage or the wing. These panels are present in both fuselage and wings. Stiffener or longeron or stringer is a thin metal strip that is used as a supporting member in fuselage and wing. When we consider the issue i. e. resistance of the aircraft’s skin towards the loads applied on it, due to frailty the aircraft skin is easily deformed. In order to solve this problem we designed a stiffened panel which can endure to deflection and stress levels. By changing the <b>stiffened</b> panel <b>sections</b> and by changing the material of the skin, the aircraft skin can withstand the deformation. Generally T-section stiffened panel is used but there is a disadvantage of using T-section, it can’t resist to deformation. So we designed an I-section stiffened panel (because I-section is more resistant to deformation) in CATIA and Meshing in Hyper mesh and Analysis is done in ANSYS. We considered three types of analysis in ANSYS, Modal analysis, Static analysis, Harmonic analysis respectively and also we considered two materials, one is aluminum and the other is carbon fiber. Aluminum is the common element used in the design of aircraft, but Carbon fiber is recently being used in aircrafts. (1, 10...|$|R
40|$|The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), in {{collaboration}} with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), is currently investigating various novel materials (single crystal silicon, , and ) for use as electron-beam transmission windows in a KrF excimer laser system. The primary function of the window is to isolate the active medium (excimer gas) from the excitation mechanism (field-emission diodes). Chosen window geometry must accommodate electron energy transfer greater than 80 % (750 keV), while maintaining structural integrity during mechanical load (1. 3 to 2. 0 atm base pressure differential, approximate 0. 5 atm cyclic pressure amplitude, 5 Hz repetition rate) and thermal load across the entire hibachi area (approximate 0. 9 W {center_dot} cm superscript ''- 2 ''). In addition, the window must be chemically resistant to attack by fluorine free-radicals (hydrofluoric acid, secondary). In accordance with these structural, functional, and operational parameters, a 22. 4 mm square silicon prototype window, coated with 500 nm thin-film silicon nitride (Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 }), has been fabricated.

40|$|Light-gauge steel framed (LSF) {{walls with}} {{plasterboard}} lining are increasingly used in modern building construction {{due to their}} numerous advantages. Their fire performance has been investigated using both numerical and experimental studies {{in the past for}} lipped channel section (LCS) and welded hollow flange section (HFC) studs. A new riveted HFC stud was also considered. However, no attempt was made to use a structurally and economically optimum stud section in the wall configurations. This paper investigates the fire performance of a new <b>stiffened</b> channel <b>section</b> (SCS) as LSF wall studs. The proposed section succeeds in delaying both local and distortional buckling modes. At ambient temperature, the member compression capacity of each stud section, normalized to its squash capacity, was used to compare the performance of the three sections. It was found that the performance of SCS is equivalent to the LSB and superior to the LCS. The fire performance of LSF wall studs made of LCS, LSB, and the proposed section has also been assessed for three common wall configurations using finite element (FE) analyses. The walls were exposed to the standard ISO 834 - 1 fire curve on one side. Stud time-temperature profiles were developed for the three wall configurations using finite element thermal analyses and validated using available full-scale fire test data. Fire Resistance Levels (FRL) of load bearing and non-load bearing walls were determined and validated using previous experimental and numerical results. For the same load ratio, the three stud sections perform similarly, giving close FRL values for each of the configurations considered. Due to the elimination of the necessity for welding or riveting, it is proposed that SCS is used to develop structurally and economically optimum LSF walls compared to those made using LCS and welded or riveted HFC sections. FRL versus Load Ratio curves were developed for the full range of load ratio using both steady and transient state FE analyses. Using them, the susceptibility of cavity insulated, non-load bearing LSF walls to failure due to structural inadequacy was also identified...|$|R

40|$|Globally, {{there is}} need for {{strengthening}} of steel structures {{due to increased}} load carrying requirements, changes in earthquake / wind codes and rehabilitation due to corrosion degradation. Advanced composites have {{become one of the}} most popular techniques of repairing and/or strengthening civil infrastructure in the past couple of decades. The use of FRP material for the repair and rehabilitation of steel members has numerous benefits over the traditional methods of bolting or welding of steel plates. Carbon FRPs (CFRPs) have been preferred over other FRP material for strengthening of steel structures due to CFRPs possess higher stiffness. The emergence of high modulus CFRP, with an elastic modulus higher than that of steel, enables researchers to achieve substantial load transfer in steel beams before the steel yields. In the present work, experimental investigation is carried out to analyze the behavior of steel angle sections wrapped with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) to increase flexural strength and stiffness of parent structural member steel angle section due to CFRP wrapping. A total of 4 tensile coupon tests are conducted to determine the engineering properties of structural steel used. A novel flexural strengthening technique using bonded CFRP wrapping to enhance the strength and stiffness of existing steel angle sections has been developed. This is carried out by varying the CFRP wrap configurations and keeping adhesive properties constant. The experimental program consists of two sets each with 15 specimens to test a total of 30 specimens. Each set has five subsets as four different strengthening configurations and a set representing reference control specimens. The parameters studied include the slenderness ratio (b/t) of steel angles, the thickness and orientation of the CFRP wrap, comparative study on behavior of strengthened specimens, investigation on stiffness enhancement and strain variation across the section in relation with load. This research investigated experimentally the behavior transformation of open sections into closed <b>section,</b> <b>stiffening</b> enhancement in elastic region and strength enhancement in both elastic and post yield regions of high strength CFRP vi strengthened structural steel angles tested under four point bending system in comparison with bare steel angles. Proposed external wrapping (bonded) CFRP reinforcement has been clearly established as a promising alternative to existing strengthening technique for steel structures. This proves that CFRP strengthening can be employed with proposed strengthening configuration to achieve desired degree of effectiveness and efficiency. The new strengthening approach has resulted in novel wrapping technology which has been first time applied to structural steel angle section (open section).

40|$|In this thesis, some {{nonlinear}} effects {{associated with}} the buckling behaviour of plated steel structures are examined using a modified finite strip method. To include the effects of plasticity over parts of the cross-section, a more general stress-strain relationship than previously included has been used. The method is also extended {{to account for the}} large deflection behaviour of perfect and imperfect plates in the elastic range. The only restriction on the method presented here is that the buckling mode varies sinusoidally in the.;, longitudinal direction, which implies either that the ends of the structure are simply supported or that the wavelength of the buckled mode is small in comparison with the overall length of the structure. The present study may be divided into three parts. In the first part the small deflection theory is used to determine the stiffness and stability matrices of individual strip and these are assembled to form an overall stiffness matrix, representing a structure which may be under concentric load, eccentric load or pure bending. In some cases a structure with an overall initial imperfection is considered. The Wittrick-Williams Algorithm is used to obtain the smallest critical buckling load. The method is applicable to the analysis of various structures such as isolated plates, <b>stiffened</b> panels, rolled <b>sections</b> and <b>stiffened</b> box-girder bridges. To check the accuracy of the method a comparison with some published theoretical and experimental results is undertaken. Secondly, a parametric study for stiffened panels, columns, and beams is presented. For the stiffened panels, the effect of seven parameters (slenderness ratio, residual stress, dimensions and shape of the stiffener, mode of buckling, the longitudinal boundary conditions, and the yield stress) has been investigated. Approximate design curves for the optimum dimensions of panels stiffened by flat stiffeners are given. The capability of the method for the analysis of a stiffened box-girder in bending is also shown. The effect of seven parameters (dimensions and shape of the cross-section, the slenderness ratio, the material yield stress, the residual stress, the initial overall imperfection and the eccentricity of the applied load) on the inelastic buckling of columns and beams has been studied. All the results are given in nondimensional graphs or tables. Finally large deflection plate theory is applied to study the post-buckling behaviour of both perfect plates and those with initial imperfections. The work in this section is restricted to the elastic state. The longitudinal axial compression is assumed to act on the plate through two rigid bars at the ends, and various in-plane boundary conditions for the longitudinal unloaded edges have been considered. The Newton-Raphson method is used for the solution of the non-linear equations...|$|R
