40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} the objectives of reform of public finances in the years 2007 - 2010, mainly in the tax area. The main objective of the reform was to reduce the public deficit, reducing government debt and the administrative costs associated with collecting the tax due on the taxpayer and the state. The most significant changes were applied {{in the context of}} tax on personal income tax so that devote the greatest attention. In the context of public finance reform changes in the tax system are also applied. This is a new law on income tax, new tax rules and creating a single collection point. All these modifications have lead to the <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> and tax administration and thereby reducing administrative costs. In the evaluation, I compared the determined objectives and actual results and concluded that the objectives were not fulfilled. On the other hand, it must be stressed that the objectives of the reform were and are largely influenced by the impact of economic crisis and an unstable political environment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the appropriateness of}} the tools used in the current Community legislative review from a legal perspective and how the review is shaped by institutional factors, in particular the change of Community culture engendered by the Maastricht process. There is a greater emphasis on accountability with the onus on the Community to justify its actions to Member States on whom it largely relies for implementation and enforcement. Rather than tackle this key issue of accountability through institutional reform which would weaken the positions of the indirectly accountable and secretive Council, the Member States have sought to resolve this issue through greater transparency and legislative review. Legislative review is being conducted under a number of initiatives, notably the Sutherland Report, the principle of subsidiarity and the Committee of Experts on <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation.</b> The review is not a deregulation programme, rather a consolidation, clarification and simplification exercise with some repeal of legislation. and The paper looks at how and why review has come about before turning to an analysis {{of the nature of the}} review itself. It then discusses the impact of this review on the acquis communautaire and the institutional balance within the Community. It concludes that the review may lead to greater transparency but at the cost of acquis commaunuautaire with the inappropriate retroactive application of the subsidiarity principle to an existing body of law. At the same time, greater transparency may force the question of democratic accountability further up the political agenda...|$|E
40|$|The tax {{administration}} of every tax form {{is a very}} important area of its successful operation. This is especially the case with taxes such as value added tax. Although it is important in the tax system of each country, as it greatly contributes to filling the country’s budget, due to a number of specific features of its operation, it requires a well-timed legislation. In fact, it is a complex form of taxation which, if not set on the appropriate legal basis, can easily lead to high administrative costs for the state (i. e. its administrative entities) and taxpayers. There is a high risk of occurrence of tax evasion which, if occurs, leads to a set of problems in the tax system of a given state. This paper illuminates the difference in terms of demands that are placed in front of the taxpayers in two completely different tax systems. On the one hand, the Republic of Serbia, by its size and economic potential, has a relatively small economy, so it is necessary to set such tax regulations that will be "cheap" enough {{to meet the demands of}} the taxpayers, and which will ensure sufficient mass of fiscal revenues. On the other hand, the European Union has significantly developed tax legislation, which, at the same time, sets more complicated administrative requirements. Therefore, the recommendations for both analyzed areas will go in the direction of additional harmonization and <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation,</b> as well as avoidance of cumbersome and inefficient administration. Finally, it is necessary to harmonize them (regulation and administration) with the amount of collected tax revenues...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} information services and databases of the institutions of the European Union (mainly of the European Commission) which are freely available to the public. These services concern the <b>legislation</b> <b>of</b> the European Communities. It also presents information services concerning the <b>legislation</b> <b>of</b> the European Communities in the Czech Republic. The first chapter of this work describes particular institutions of the European Union (Council of the EU, European Commission, European Parliament, European Council, Economic and Social Committee, Committee of the Regions, Court of Justice, Court of First Instance, Civil Servants Tribunal, European Central Bank, European Court of Auditors); their position and role in the legislative process. The second chapter focuses on the European Communities' legislation and on the procedures of the legislative process (characteristics of particular procedures - consultation, assent, cooperation and codecision procedure). In the third chapter the paper mentions the <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> the EC <b>legislation</b> (acquis communautaire). This process is the priority of the EU information policy in the area of the European Communities legislation (consolidation, codification and recasting). The fourth chapter describes information sources and services of the [...] ...|$|R

The law No. 22 / 1997 Technical Requirements for Product Design (valid since September 1 st 1997) has fallen short. Opening of European Congruency Review Act negotiations has shown a need of change of the law No. 22 / 1997 because of possibility to enter Bilateral Recognition Agreement.

40|$|In {{this article}} I try to {{establish}} whether {{it is fair to}} argue that there exists a particular Norwegian fishery terminology, and, if so, whether and to what extent national administrative bodies have played and are still playing a role in developing and updating it. Or is it, perhaps, more appropriate to claim that there merely exists a “fishery jargon”, a tribal language unintelligible to others than those engaged in professional fishing activities? I attempt to demonstrate that Norwegian trawl fishing terminology, or jargon, is heavily influenced by English for historical reasons, whereas a general national fishery terminology seems to have been developed and updated amongst responsible authorities and fishermen alike as a result of formal and informal interaction between them and not due to a high degree of language consciousness or concerted efforts. In particular it would seem that legislation in the area has {{played an important role in}} formalizing the terminology in question. Finally I point out how a shift in attitude in public sector in recent years towards regarding people in the fishing industry as “users” or “clients” has led to <b>simplification</b> also <b>of</b> fishery <b>legislation,</b> thus bringing about increased linguistic and terminological awareness and improvement. I wind up, nevertheless, describing the Icelandic terminology situation as a model also for Norway...|$|R

The expansion and <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> codecision under Amsterdam since May 1999 has started to generate significant strains on the further development of those norms and rules.
