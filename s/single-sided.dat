5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the <b>single-sided</b> front fork, and the <b>single-sided</b> swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E
5|$|However, the Imme {{began to}} develop problems, {{especially}} with the <b>single-sided</b> crankshaft bearings and the freewheel for the kick starter. Riedel corrected the problem beginning with the Model D version, which had a conventional crankshaft with two bearings. However, the profit from sales {{was not enough to}} cover the warranty expenses, and, by the end of 1950, Riedel AG went bankrupt with debts of 1.25millionDeutschmark.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{a number of}} {{manufacturers}} introduced smaller floppy drives and media in various formats. A consortium of 21 companies eventually settled on a 3½-inch floppy disk (actually 90mm wide) a.k.a. Micro diskette, Micro disk, or Micro floppy, similar to a Sony design but improved to support both <b>single-sided</b> and double-sided media, with formatted capacities generally of 360 KB and 720 KB respectively. <b>Single-sided</b> drives shipped in 1983, and double sided in 1984. What became the most common format, the double-sided, high-density (HD) 1.44 MB disk drive, shipped in 1986.|$|E
25|$|FR-2 (Flame Retardant 2), {{phenolic}} {{paper or}} phenolic cotton paper, paper impregnated with a phenol formaldehyde resin. Cheap, common in low-end consumer electronics with <b>single-sided</b> boards. Electrical properties inferior to FR-4. Poor arc resistance. Generally rated to 105°C. Resin composition varies by supplier.|$|E
25|$|A small <b>single-sided</b> {{version of}} this boiler was also {{produced}} for launches. The first small {{version of this}} also dispensed with the wing drum, the water-wall tubes bending at right angles and passing back to the central water drum, the tubes also forming the grate to support the fire.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all US disc {{records were}} <b>single-sided</b> until 1908, when Columbia Records began mass {{production}} of discs with recordings pressed on both sides. Except for premium-priced classical records, that {{quickly became the}} industry standard. With their capacity effectively doubled, the storage efficiency advantage of discs over the space-wasting cylinder format became even more obvious.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{the company}} {{introduced}} the Ducati 916 model designed by Massimo Tamburini, a water-cooled version that allowed for higher output levels and a striking new bodywork that had aggressive lines, an underseat exhaust, and a <b>single-sided</b> swingarm. Ducati has since ceased {{production of the}} 916, supplanting it (and its progeny, the 748, 996 and 998) with the 749 and 999.|$|E
25|$|The first Macintosh {{computers}} used <b>single-sided</b> 3½-inch floppy disks, {{but with}} 400 KB formatted capacity. These were followed in 1986 by double-sided 800 KB floppies. The higher capacity was achieved {{at the same}} recording density by varying the disk rotation speed with head position so that the linear speed of the disk was closer to constant. Later Macs could also read and write 1.44 MB HD disks in PC format with fixed rotation speed.|$|E
25|$|This {{probability}} is the p-value, considering only extreme {{results that}} favor heads. This {{is called a}} one-tailed test. However, the deviation can be in either direction, favoring either heads or tails. The two-tailed p-value, which considers deviations favoring either heads or tails, may instead be calculated. As the binomial distribution is symmetrical for a fair coin, the two-sided p-value is simply twice the above calculated <b>single-sided</b> p-value: the two-sided p-value is 0.115.|$|E
25|$|Universal Studios Home Entertainment has {{released}} all Miami Vice seasons on DVD for regions 1, 2, and 4. Seasons 1 & 2 were released in 2005, and seasons 3 through 5 were released in 2007. The DVD {{release of the}} series had been significantly slow due {{to one of the}} signature features of the show: the heavy integration of 1980s pop and rock music. The music was difficult to source the rights to and acquire permission to use. In the November 2004 announcement for the DVD release of the series, Universal promised that all original music in the series would be intact. On August 21, 2007 Universal announced the November 13, 2007 release of the complete series, with all five seasons on 27 <b>single-sided</b> DVDs. The seasons are in their own Digipak-style cases, and the set is housed in a faux alligator-skin package. Seasons 1 & 2 contained six <b>single-sided</b> discs, rather than the three double-sided discs in the initial release. The Region 2 version has different packaging, does not use double-sided discs, and although there are no special features stated on the packaging they are contained within the season 1 discs.|$|E
25|$|Both engines {{were located}} behind a single very large ventral <b>single-sided</b> Ferri intake, which {{featured}} a prominent, swept-forward lip, a design feature employed on the Republic RF-84F Thunderstreak and later F-105 Thunderchief. The J67 was installed {{just behind the}} intake, angled with its intake below the centerline of the aircraft. The XJ55 was installed inline with the fuselage in the extreme rear, {{as if it were}} the exhaust of a conventional engine installation. There was a significant empty space above the J67 for ducting.|$|E
25|$|A bracteate (from the Latin bractea, a thin {{piece of}} metal) is a flat, thin, <b>single-sided</b> gold medal worn as jewelry that was {{produced}} in Northern Europe predominantly during the Migration Period of the Germanic Iron Age (including the Vendel era in Sweden). The term is also used for thin discs, especially in gold, to be sewn onto clothing in the ancient world, as found for example in the ancient Persian Oxus Treasure, and also later silver coins produced in central Europe during the early Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|Single sided disks were {{coated on}} both sides, despite the {{availability}} of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified error-free {{on both sides of}} the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for <b>single-sided</b> disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the FAT ID {{was meant}} to be a bit flag with all bits set except for bit 2 cleared to {{indicate}} an 80 track (vs. 40 track) format, bit 1 cleared to indicate a 9 sector (vs. 8 sector) format, and bit 0 cleared to indicate a <b>single-sided</b> (vs. double-sided) format, but this scheme was not followed by all OEMs and became obsolete with the introduction of hard disks and high-density formats. Also, the various 8-inch formats supported by 86-DOS and MS-DOS do not fit this scheme.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Nintendo {{released}} the Famicom Disk System (FDS) in Japan, {{a type of}} floppy drive that uses a <b>single-sided,</b> proprietary 5cm (2") disk and plugs into the cartridge port. It contains RAM for the game to load into and an extra single-cycle wavetable-lookup sound chip. The disks were originally obtained from kiosks in malls and other public places where buyers could select a title and have it written to the disk. This process would cost less than cartridges and users could take the disk back to a vending booth and have it rewritten with a new game. The disks were used both for storing the game and saving progress and total capacity was 128k (64k per side).|$|E
25|$|With two gauges {{and four}} {{companies}} using the <b>single-sided</b> station, {{it was in}} need of remodelling. A new double-sided platform opened on the site west side of the line and the original up platform at the northern end was closed. The original platforms had all had individual train sheds covering the tracks, and the opportunity was taken to replace these with one large train shed across all the main tracks and platforms. North of the station was a level crossing and just beyond this an additional goods shed was constructed. Unlike the earlier ones it was solely for transferring goods between the trains of the two different gauges. All of these buildings were designed by the Francis Fox, the B engineer, and Henry Lloyd and the work was completed in 1864.|$|E
25|$|Cordwood {{construction}} {{can save}} significant space and was often used with wire-ended components in applications where space {{was at a}} premium (such as fuzes, missile guidance, and telemetry systems) and in high-speed computers, where short traces were important. In cordwood construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The components were either soldered together with jumper wire, or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads. To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that special nickel-leaded components had {{to be used to}} allow the interconnecting welds to be made. Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause physical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are difficult to replace. Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered <b>single-sided</b> PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components.|$|E
25|$|Drums {{are highly}} {{influential}} in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums {{and how to}} play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller <b>single-sided</b> hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.|$|E
25|$|The bank, {{which had}} {{established}} a number of foreign subsidiary companies {{in the years after}} 1988, published its first consolidated financial statements for the 1995 business year. Over the two decades of this boom phase, its total assets increased from 530 million (end-1979) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (end-2000), reported total net income rose from CHF 2.9 million to 197 million, and the workforce more than sextupled from 86 to 563. The main book turnover (<b>single-sided)</b> of the parent bank alone surged from 6.7 to 77.3 billion Swiss francs between 1980 and 1989. Business for VP Bank Group flourished {{in the second half of}} the 1990s: total Group assets grew from 6.3 billion (1995) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (2000) and gross income (revenues less operating expenses) from CHF 94 million to 254 million, whereas the commission and services business overtook the interest-differential business in 1997 as the major pillar of the income statement. In the years between 1996 and 2000, there was also a doubling of client assets under management from CHF 15 billion (end-1995) to 31 billion. Consolidated net income increased from 48 million (1995) to 197 million (2000) Swiss francs. As the significance of VP Bank Group’s foreign subsidiary companies grew, the proportion of investments attributable to them (assets held in non-CHF regions) increased as well, from 22 per cent (1996) to 40 per cent (2000) and ultimately to a high of 58.3 per cent at the end of 2005. As always, VP Bank placed those funds only with top-rated banks. The progressively internationalised bank redoubled its risk management efforts in the late 1990s and introduced an Asset and Liability Committee.|$|E

500|$|A {{variety of}} folk dances {{originating}} from Okinawa, known collectively as eisa, often {{make use of}} the taiko. Some performers use drums while dancing, and generally speaking, perform in one of two styles: groups on the Yokatsu Peninsula and on Hamahiga Island use small, <b>single-sided</b> drums called [...] whereas groups near the city of Okinawa generally use shime-daiko. Use of shime-daiko over pāranku has spread throughout the island, and is considered the dominant style. Small nagadō-daiko, referred to as ō-daiko within the tradition, are also used and are worn in front of the performer. These drum dances are not limited to Okinawa and have appeared in places containing Okinawan communities such as in São Paulo, Hawaii, and large cities on the Japanese mainland.|$|E

Manhattan group Effanel Music, a mobile and portable multitrack remote recording company and its sub-division, L7 Group, did the recording and post-production works on the DVD.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{released}} on May 24, 1988, and contained video compilation of two different dates from the tour, Turin and from Florence, as well as clips from her concert in Tokyo, Japan. The video had an introduction, where Madonna was shown practicing with her troupe on the stage, rehearsing the songs and the dance moves. Madonna, who had gone through rigorous exercises and aerobics to prepare herself for the tour, demanded from director Egbert van Hees that {{the shape of her}} body be given prominence in the footage to be used for the video. She believed that her new shape and figure would make her appear highly attractive. In 1999, Warner Bros. re-released the video in DVD format, along with some of Madonna's other video albums. The music video appears in an aspect ratio of [...] (4:3) on the <b>single-sided,</b> single-layered DVD. The concert relied heavily on magenta tones; from the lighting to Madonna’s outfits. A stereo soundtrack accompanied the DVD release, where the songs were mixed without having a surround sound effect.|$|E
