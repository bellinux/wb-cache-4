25|$|The Ministry of Industry {{proposed}} in 1970 that Kings Bay be merged with another state-owned mining company, Adventdalens Kullfelt. This was not carried out as Kings Bay's board insisted on retaining its independence. Various companies {{were interested in}} leasing part of Ny-Åleund, including Norsk Polar Navigasjon, and various fishery groups, although no agreements were struck. Kings Bay had no permanent employees by 1970, but resumed operation of Ny-Ålesund in 1974. Bjørnøen, which previously operated a mine on Bjørnøya, received a common administration and board with Kings Bay from 1975. By 1977 Kings Bay <b>stuck</b> <b>a</b> deal by the then state-owned Store Norske to sell all its claims, although it kept the property rights around Ny-Ålesund.|$|E

No Water ran his horse until it died and continued on foot until he reached the safety of his own village.|$|E
25|$|The Norwegian Polar Institute {{established}} a scientific station in Ny-Ålesund in 1966, moving their ionosphere measurement station from Isfjord Radio. An early scientific agent was the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which has conducted air research in Ny-Ålesund since the mid-1970s. Gradually there was {{increased interest in}} research in Ny-Ålesund. In the first years a series of universities sent summer expeditions. Kings Bay also generated revenue from selling fuel, supplies and air transport to shrimp fishers. By 1977 Kings Bay <b>stuck</b> <b>a</b> deal by the then state-owned Store Norske to sell all its claims, although it kept the property rights around Ny-Ålesund. During the early 1980s a plan for cultural heritage management was developed, which included the renovation of several older houses. In 1992 nearly the entire town was listed.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to Israeli covert operations, Iranian agents reportedly {{began trying to}} hit Israeli and Jewish targets; potential targets were then placed on high alert. Yoram Cohen, the head of Shin Bet, claimed that three planned attacks in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Thailand were thwarted at the last minute. On 11 October 2011, the United States claimed to have foiled an alleged Iranian plot that included bombing the Israeli and Saudi embassies in Washington DC and Buenos Aires. On 13 February 2012, Israeli embassy staff in Georgia and India were targeted. In Georgia, a car bomb failed to explode near the embassy and was safely detonated by Georgian police. In India, the car bomb exploded, injuring four people. Amongst the wounded was the wife of an Israeli Defense Ministry employee. Israel accused Iran of being behind the attacks. The following day, three alleged Iranian agents were uncovered in Bangkok, Thailand, {{thought to have been}} planning to kill Israeli diplomatic officials, including the ambassador, by attaching bombs to embassy cars. The cell was uncovered when one of their bombs exploded. Police responded, and the Iranian agent present at the house threw an explosive device at officers that tore his legs off, and was subsequently taken into custody. A second suspect was arrested as he tried to catch a flight out of the country, and the third escaped to Malaysia, where he was arrested by Malaysian Federal Police. Thai police subsequently arrested two people suspected of involvement. Indian police arrested a Delhi-based journalist in connection with February’s car bomb, which injured four Israelis including the wife of an Israeli diplomat.

500|$|In foreign policy, Lincoln's {{main goal}} was to stop {{military}} aid from countries abroad to the Confederacy. Lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. At times Seward was too bellicose, so for balance Lincoln <b>stuck</b> <b>a</b> close working relationship with Senator Charles Sumner, {{the chairman of the}} Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy had illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the Trent, on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer James G. Randall has dissected Lincoln's successful techniques: ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria's self-imposed {{isolation}} from the public diminished {{the popularity of the}} monarchy, and encouraged the growth of the republican movement. She did undertake her official government duties, yet chose to remain secluded in her royal residences—Windsor Castle, Osborne House, and the private estate in Scotland that she and Albert had acquired in 1847, Balmoral Castle. In March 1864, a protester <b>stuck</b> <b>a</b> notice on the railings of Buckingham Palace that announced [...] "these commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupant's declining business". Her uncle Leopold wrote to her advising her to appear in public. She agreed to visit the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington and take a drive through London in an open carriage.|$|E
50|$|The Australian-built Capri was {{intended}} primarily for export to the US. Exports began in 1991, as the Mercury Capri. When {{the car was}} new, it had a poor reputation for reliability, although many still exist today perhaps due to the mechanical robustness of the Laser/323 upon which it was based. In particular, the Capri's roof was prone to leaking, due to poor-quality materials being used; although Ford quickly resolved the issue, the car's poor reputation <b>stuck.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the MX-5 was comfortably more popular, particularly as that car was rear-wheel-drive, and enthusiasts were skeptical about the front-wheel-drive arrangement that the Capri used.|$|R

500|$|Olds {{was known}} for the extravagantly waxed (and decidedly non-regulation) {{handlebar}} moustache he sported in Vietnam. It was a common superstition among airmen to grow a [...] "bulletproof mustache", but Olds also used his as [...] "a gesture of defiance. The kids on base loved it. Most everybody grew a mustache." [...] Olds started the mustache {{in the wake of}} the success of Operation Bolo and let it grow beyond regulation length because [...] "It became the middle finger I couldn't raise in the PR photographs. The mustache became my silent last word in the verbal battles...with higher headquarters on rules, targets, and fighting the war." [...] Returning home, however, marked the end of this flamboyance.

500|$|On 9 December 1980, McCartney {{followed}} {{the news that}} Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was [...] surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: [...] "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for {{what appeared to be}} a superficial response. He later explained, [...] "When John was killed somebody <b>stuck</b> <b>a</b> microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?'

A series of forward positions were then established a further [...] inland. Instead of pushing his rifle platoons further inland, however, Downs decided that he would wait for the second wave to arrive. This ultimately proved critical as it allowed the Japanese commander, Kato, time to respond to the landing. As the three landing craft of {{the first wave}} withdrew, another three landing craft came in with reinforcements, heavy weapons and other support elements, however, they ran aground on a coral reef and the men aboard were forced to wade ashore. Although one of these craft was later able to float free, two of the others remained <b>stuck.</b> <b>A</b> short time later they began to take fire from Japanese machine-guns, which stopped the Australians from unloading their equipment.|$|E

500|$|Bill Russell {{was born}} to Charles Russell and Katie Russell in West Monroe, Louisiana. Like almost all {{southern}} towns and cities of that time, West Monroe was a highly segregated place, and the Russells often struggled with racism in their daily lives. Once, Russell's father was refused service {{at a gas station}} until the staff had taken care of all the white customers. When his father attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant <b>stuck</b> <b>a</b> shotgun in his face and threatened to kill him if he didn't stay and wait his turn. At another time, Russell's mother was walking outside in a fancy dress when a policeman accosted her. He told her to go home and remove the dress, which he described as [...] "white woman's clothing". Because large numbers of blacks were moving to the West during World War II to look for work there, Russell's father moved the family out of Louisiana when Russell was eight years old and settled them in Oakland, California. While there the family fell into poverty, and Russell spent his childhood living in a series of public housing projects.|$|E
500|$|While he {{was still}} on bail on 16 February 1990, during his third {{interview}} with police, Webster admitted to killing Leigh. In the interview transcript, Webster initially denied killing Leigh, then [...] "without being asked a further question" [...] he stated, [...] "Well, I did it. But I just can't believe ... it happened. It's just unbelievable." [...] Webster went on to state that he saw Leigh while {{he was looking for}} his stash of beers. According to Webster, they walked to the saltbushes together, where he pulled off her clothes and <b>stuck</b> <b>a</b> finger in her vagina. Webster stated he lost his temper when Leigh rebuffed him, choking her for a while before killing her with a rock, specifically saying he killed Leigh because he [...] "thought she would squeal on [...] for trying to rape her". After spending the weekend in a police cell, Webster appeared in court on 19 February where he was refused bail. On 21 March, while in custody, Webster was convicted and fined $250 for offensive behaviour in the 28 January assault. On 17 July Shearman was given a 12-month good behaviour bond for the 31 January assault; the judge did not record a conviction, taking into consideration that he had been provoked into attacking Wilson.|$|E
