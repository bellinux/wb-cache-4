40|$|In this paper, a {{nonlinear}} estimation {{strategy for}} <b>sensing</b> <b>the</b> time-varying angular rate of a Z-axis MEMS gyroscope is presented. An off-line adaptive least-squares estimation strategy is first developed to accurately estimate the unknown model parameters. Both axes of a Z-axis MEMS gyroscope are then actively controlled utilizing an on-line controller/observer to facilitate time-varying angular rate <b>sensing.</b> <b>The</b> proposed nonlinear estimation strategy is developed {{based on a}} Lyapunov-based analysis, which proves that the time-varying angular rate experienced by the device can be estimated accurately. Two cases for angular rate are investigated which are time-varying and constant magnitudes. An adaptive controller/observer was also utilized for <b>sensing</b> <b>the</b> angular rate to investigate {{the performance of the}} proposed controller/observer. Representative numerical results are discussed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed nonlinear strategy in accurately <b>sensing</b> <b>the</b> applied angular rate. Overall, the proposed nonlinear controller/observer improves <b>sensing</b> <b>the</b> constant angular rate by 50 % and the time-varying angular rate by 90 % when compared with an adaptive controller/observer. © 2010 Elsevier B.
