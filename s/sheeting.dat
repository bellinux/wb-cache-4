5|$|Some of this retreat has {{resulted}} in efforts {{to slow down the}} loss of glaciers in the Alps. To retard melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the Stubai and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic. In Switzerland plastic <b>sheeting</b> is also used to reduce the melt of glacial ice used as ski slopes. While covering glaciers with plastic <b>sheeting</b> may prove advantageous to ski resorts on a small scale, this practice is not expected to be economically practical on a much larger scale.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn Sahelian savannas, fungus-growing {{termites}} form biogenic structures made of soil or <b>sheetings,</b> on {{the soil}} surface and inside the soil, to protect themselves against heat, desiccation and predators while collecting food. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if analysis of the nematofauna can show differences in the way termites construct <b>sheetings</b> according to termite species or organic material harvested. In this study, soil nematodes, which were inactive during the experiment, were passively transported in soil. pellets by termites when they built <b>sheetings.</b> Composition of the soil nematofauna was analyzed in <b>sheetings</b> produced when harvesting the four different types of different organic matter and in the soil around which these structures were produced. Three of the four organic materials were applied on soil as mulch whereas wood Logs were inserted in the soil. Nematode density and diversity in <b>sheetings</b> produced by the three different termite species present (Ancistrotermes guineensis, Ondontotermes nilensis and Macrotermes subhyalinus) were similar in the four organic treatments except for <b>sheetings</b> constructed within the wood by A. guineensis. Nematode densities in <b>sheetings</b> were about ten-fold lower than in the 0 - 10 cm upper soil layer. Moreover, the composition of the nematofauna in <b>sheetings</b> was very different from that of the upper 10 cm, except for the <b>sheetings</b> built on wood. A finer comparison of the soil nematofauna in the top 7 cm of soil (separated in 0 - 0. 25, 0. 25 - 3. 0 and 3. 0 - 7. 5 cm), and of fresh surface <b>sheetings</b> (produced within 24 h) showed that nematode composition of <b>sheetings</b> was very similar to that of the soil. in the superficial strata (0 - 3 cm). Analysis of the nematofauna led us to conclude that the soil. used by termites to construct biogenic structures when harvesting organic matter originates from soil layers as close as possible to the area where the organic resource is located. Moreover, there were no differences in the soil or the three type of surface-applied organic matter used for the three fungus-growing termites. ...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the link}} between termites' impact on {{ecosystem}} functioning and their ecological needs remains a key question in ecology. This study focused {{on the influence of}} the fungus-growing termite species, Hypotermes obscuriceps, on soil properties in Southern India. This species produces soil <b>sheetings</b> and mounds on the ground. In contrast to other termite species, such as those belonging to the Macrotermes and Odontotermes genera, which produce mounds to live in, H. obscuriceps excavates soil above ground for constructing its chambers below ground. Using a captive colony of H. obscuriceps growing up in control conditions, we measured the soil properties (carbon content, particle size distribution, pH, electrical conductivity and concentration in soluble anions and cations) of its mound and of the <b>sheetings</b> it produced over the leaves of Acacia auriculiformis and on the branches of Ipomoea carnea and Lantana camara. The physical and chemical properties of H. obscuriceps mounds were very {{similar to those of the}} surrounding soil and even if rain erodes these mounds in the field, it is likely to have only a small effect on the resulting run-off water quality. In contrast, <b>sheetings</b> have higher clay and C contents than the surrounding soil. Their degradation by rain is likely to be associated with soil detachment and F-, Cl- and K+ export in water runoff and/or leachate. In conclusion, this study shows that this species impacts soil properties more through the construction of <b>sheetings</b> than mounds. This difference is explained by the ecological needs of termites. While H. obscuriceps is not dependent on soil mound properties for survival, soil sheetings' properties are essential for providing them a protective cover...|$|R

Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal <b>sheeting</b> and uprooting of trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber <b>sheeting</b> for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E

40|$|Wind-induced fatigue {{loading and}} damage to roof {{claddings}} on gable-roof and hip-roof buildings are investigated {{in this study}} through both wind tunnel tests and computer analyses. The magnitude and distribution of wind pressures on both roofs are first measured at different wind directions. Fatigue characteristics of wind pressures are identified based on a rainflow count method for each tap at its critical wind direction in which its largest negative pressure occurs. Total fatigue loading at each tap on both roofs is then computed using the obtained fatigue characteristics and information on wind climate. Finally, fatigue damage to screw-fastened light-gauge steel roof <b>sheetings</b> of different profiles is estimated in terms of previously obtained S-N curves and a modified Miner's rule. The distributions of fatigue damage index over both roofs show that under the same strong winds, fatigue damage to the hip roof cladding is much less severe than that gable roof cladding.
