25|$|A {{trolley pole}} is a tapered {{cylindrical}} pole of wood or metal placed {{in contact with}} an overhead wire to provide electricity to the trolley car. The trolley pole sits atop a <b>sprung</b> <b>base</b> {{on the roof of}} the trolley vehicle, the springs maintaining the tension to keep the trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire. Occasionally, a Canadian named John Joseph Wright is credited with inventing the trolley pole when an experimental tramway in Toronto, Ontario, was built in 1883. While Wright may have assisted in the installation of railways at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and may even have used a pole system, there is no hard evidence to prove it. Likewise, Wright never filed or was issued a patent. Official credit for the invention of the electric trolley pole has gone to an American, Frank J. Sprague, who devised his working system in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888. Known as the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, this 12-mile system was the first large-scale trolley line in the world, opening to great fanfare on February 12, 1888.|$|E

The pole sits atop a <b>sprung</b> <b>base</b> {{on the roof of}} the vehicle, with springs providing the pressure to keep the trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire. If the pole is made of wood, a cable brings the electric current down to the vehicle.

50|$|The source {{material}} for candy mesh is usually both coloured and flavored. In the US, so-called 'floss sugar' {{is available in}} a wide variety of flavors, but two flavor-blend-colors predominate - 'blue raspberry' and 'pink vanilla', both originally formulations by the Gold Medal brand (which uses the names 'Boo Blue' and 'Silly Nilly'). Cotton candy also comes out purple, when mixed, making a significant favorite at fairs. Cotton candy machines were notoriously unreliable until Gold Medal's invention of a <b>sprung</b> <b>base</b> in 1949, and since then they have manufactured nearly all commercial cotton candy machines and much of the floss sugar in the US.|$|E

50|$|Most modern beds {{consist of}} a soft, {{cushioned}} mattress on a bed frame, the mattress resting either on a solid base, often wood slats, or a <b>sprung</b> <b>base.</b> Many beds include a box spring inner-sprung base, which is a large mattress-sized box containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress. Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs, to small beds for a single child or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two adults. While most beds are single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as the murphy bed, which folds into a wall, the sofa bed, which folds out of a sofa, and the bunk bed, which provides two mattresses on two tiers. Temporary beds include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot. Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as the hammock, which {{is considered one of}} the most comfortable places to rest while swaying side to side. Some beds are made especially for animals.|$|E

The pole sits atop a <b>sprung</b> <b>base</b> {{on the roof of}} the vehicle, with springs providing the pressure to keep the trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire. If the pole is made of wood, a cable brings the electric current down to the vehicle. A metal pole may use such a cable, or may itself be electrically [...] "live", requiring the base to be insulated from the vehicle body.On systems with double-ended tram cars capable of running in both directions, the trolley pole must always be pulled behind the car and not pushed, or [...] "dewiring" [...] is very likely, which can cause damage to the overhead wires. At terminus points, the conductor must turn the trolley pole around to face the correct direction, pulling it off the wire either with a rope or a pole and walking it around to the other end. In some cases, two trolley poles are provided, one for each direction: in this case it is a matter of raising one and lowering the other. Since the operator could raise the pole at one end whilst the conductor lowered the other, this saved time and was much easier for the conductor. Care must be taken to raise the downed pole first, to eliminate the damage caused by arcing between the pole and wire. In the US, the dual-pole system was the most common arrangement on double-ended vehicles. However, pushing of the pole (called [...] "back-poling" [...] in the US or [...] "spear-poling" [...] in Australia), was quite common where the trams were moving at slow speeds, such as at wye terminals (also known as reversers) and whilst backing into the sheds.|$|E
40|$|The video {{shows how}} `keywords' from abstracts {{contained}} in three journals [...] Physics of Fluids (A) from 1970, Experiments in Fluids from 1983, and Journal of Fluid Mechanics from 1954 [...] {{have changed over}} time. Abstracts were analyzed by first removing non-descriptive words. A script then parsed each abstract to find all unique words that remained. Each abstract was then analyzed {{to determine if a}} given word appeared in the abstract. For each year the twenty words that appeared in the most abstract were recorded. The union of these top twenty words (~ 50 words) was then used to study the abstracts over all the years. The percentage of abstracts in which each word occurred was then calculated for each year studied. In this way, usage trends of common descriptive words over the course of many years are extracted. The entire process, from collecting abstracts to extract the frequency of word use, is automated so that any collection of abstracts, titles, or keywords can be easily analyzed. The data is visualized and animated using an applications written by the authors. Each word is represented by a bubble whose size represents the percentage of abstracts containing the word. This program uses Apple Computer's Quartz and CoreAnimation technologies for rendering and a high-order numerical integrator to determine particle motion. Word bubbles are modeled as soft spheres, repelling each other when they overlap and having a mass proportional to the square of their radius. They are attracted {{to the center of the}} domain by nonlinear springs and have a vertical downward (gravitational) force such the larger bubbles tend to sink to the bottom of the region. The center of mass of each bubble is offset from the geometric center of the circle through which the spring and contact forces act. Each bubble then behave like a pendulum with <b>sprung</b> <b>base.</b> Damping is included so the motion settles into quasi-period behavior...|$|E

30|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>based</b> {{systems have}} the {{advantage}} that no electrical power is needed, which reduces the weight and volume of the exoskeleton. Similar passive concepts do exist. However, due to the additional load, systems with counterweights are too heavy. In addition, springs with zero free length (i.e. ideal springs) compared to non-zero free length springs are costly or require an increased complexity [7]. For simplicity reasons, the solution focuses on using non-zero free length springs.|$|R
