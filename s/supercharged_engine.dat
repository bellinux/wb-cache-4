5|$|Titanium metal {{is used in}} {{automotive}} applications, {{particularly in}} automobile and motorcycle racing where low weight and high strength and rigidity are critical. The metal is generally too expensive for the general consumer market, though some late model Corvettes have been manufactured with titanium exhausts, and a Corvette Z06's LT4 <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> uses lightweight, solid titanium intake valves for greater strength and resistance to heat.|$|E
25|$|The <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> was not {{cleared for}} {{use at the}} time of the first flight on October 19 and the Ju 49 used instead the unsupercharged L88 version. Externally this {{installation}} was characterised by a tall, inline vertical stack of exhausts, unlike the single sloping pipe of the L88a. By summer 1932, the <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> was flight-ready and installed, and the research program proper began.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1941, the LaGG-3 {{appeared}} with new armament options, an internally balanced rudder, retractable ski landing gear for the winter, retractable tailwheel and wing pipes for drop tanks. The result {{was still not}} good enough. Even with the lighter airframe and revised <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine,</b> the LaGG-3 was underpowered.|$|E

25|$|The Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics {{ordered a}} second <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> under their {{original}} contract No. 3224. It {{was equipped with}} a special Roots-type supercharger. It was ordered with a supercharger when {{it was discovered that}} it would be necessary to supercharge the engine in order to equal the reported speeds of the other contestants.|$|E
25|$|The Bureau of Aeronautics {{analyzed}} {{the possibilities of}} the plane becoming a competitive race plane, and decided that the extra weight of the supercharger could be better put to use by installing an epicyclic reduction gear, for improved propeller efficiency, thereby providing greater improvement in performance than what the <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> with a direct drive propeller could provide for the same weight.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{prototype}} of GT350 used as a track use demonstrator. In {{the end it was}} not used all that much. It features a 624HP <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine,</b> premium interior with Recaro seats, gauges, and 6 piston Wilwood brakes in the front and 4 piston calipers in the rear.

25|$|In 1962, Studebaker {{introduced}} the Avanti, featuring an exotic Raymond Loewy designed fiberglass body and <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> {{mounted on a}} modified 109-inch convertible chassis and innovations such as front disc brakes. The automaker marketed the Avanti as America's Only 4 Passenger High-Performance Personal Car. The company was only able to build 4,100 Avanti cars before it closed in 1963, and sold its dealership network to Mercedes-Benz.|$|E
25|$|The first Griffon-powered Spitfires {{suffered}} from poor high altitude performance due to having {{only a single}} stage <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine.</b> By 1943, Rolls-Royce engineers had developed a new Griffon engine, the 61 series, with a two-stage supercharger. In {{the end it was}} a slightly modified engine, the 65 series, which was used in the Mk XIV. The resulting aircraft provided a substantial performance increase over the Mk IX. Although initially based on the Mk VIII airframe, common improvements made in aircraft produced later included the cut-back fuselage and tear-drop canopies, and the E-Type wing with improved armament.|$|E
25|$|The Alfa Romeo 158/159, {{also known}} as the Alfetta (Little Alfa in Italian), {{is one of the most}} {{successful}} racing cars ever produced. The 158 and its derivative, the 159, took 47 wins from 54 Grands Prix entered. It was originally developed for the pre-World War II voiturette formula (1937) and has a 1.5-litre straight-8 <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine.</b> Following World War II, the car was eligible for the new Formula One introduced in 1947. In the hands of drivers such as Nino Farina, Juan-Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli, it dominated the first two seasons of the World Championship of Drivers.|$|E

25|$|In 1930, the French Air Ministry {{issued a}} C.1 {{specification}} for a single-seat fighter, {{with the ability}} to reach 350km/h (217mph) and to be fitted with a <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine.</b> ANF Les Mureaux produced the ANF Les Mureaux 170, an parasol winged monoplane of all-metal construction powered by a single Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs V12 engine. Its wings were slightly gulled and tapered out to give maximum chord and thickness midway along the wing, near where they were braced by struts to the fuselage. A fixed tailwheel undercarriage was fitted. The pilot sat in an open cockpit, and was armed by two Vickers machine guns mounted in the wings.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, GM {{announced}} a recall on all 1997â€“2003 Grand Prix GTP models (as well as sister car Buick Regal GS) {{due to a}} problem that causes fires in the engine compartment. Over 230 fires were reported. This recall affected over 200,000 vehicles equipped with the supercharged 3800 Series II engine. GM {{sent a letter to}} the owners of these vehicles on March 13, 2008, instructing them not to park in garages or carports until the problem was resolved. The recall for the <b>Supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> involved changing the left (front) valve cover gasket, as oil leaks onto the exhaust manifold may cause engine fires. Some believed this recall did not fix the fire problem, and instead the problem is likely faulty fuel rail quick disconnect o-rings. There have been reports of fires happening after the recall has been performed.|$|E
25|$|Methanol is {{occasionally}} used to fuel {{internal combustion}} engines. Pure methanol {{is required by}} rule {{to be used in}} Champcars, Monster Trucks, USAC sprint cars (as well as midgets, modifieds, etc.), and other dirt track series, such as World of Outlaws, and Motorcycle Speedway, mainly because, {{in the event of an}} accident, methanol does not produce an opaque cloud of smoke. Since the late 1940s, Methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for radio control, control line, free flight airplanes, cars and trucks; such engines use a platinum filament glow plug that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction. Drag racers, mud racers, and heavily modified tractor pullers also use methanol as the primary fuel source. Methanol is required with a <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> in a Top Alcohol Dragster and, until the end of the 2006 season, all vehicles in the Indianapolis 500 had to run on methanol. As a fuel for mud racers, methanol mixed with gasoline and nitrous oxide produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone.|$|E

25|$|The {{first true}} {{production}} Zeppelin-Staaken Riesenflugzeug was the R.VI. This giant aircraft was powered either by four 245hp (183KW) Maybach MbIV engines or four 260hp(194KW) Mercedes D.IVa engines. The fuselage {{was similar to}} the previous aircraft but the cockpit was extended forwards, enclosed and glazed with a gunners cockpit in the extreme nose. Other improvements included aluminium alloy structure in the triple finned biplane tail unit, which was built with inverse camber to improve the stabilising downforce. Eighteen R.VIs were built serialled 'R25' to 'R39' and 'R52' to 'R54' all except 'R30', which was used exclusively as a <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> test-bed, saw service in the LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte with Rfa500 and Rfa 501 on the western front stationed in the Ghent area. Air raids on England by R.VIs began on 17 September 1917. Many air raids attributed to Gotha bombers were, in fact, carried out by Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI or R.XIV bombers, with direct hits on the Royal Hospital Chelsea with the first 1,000kg bomb dropped on England, on 16/17 February 1918. St Pancras Station was attacked the next night. During the campaign from 18 December 1917 to 20 May 1918 the R.VIs of Rfa501 made eleven raids dropping 27,190kg (28tons) of bombs. Eighteen built.|$|E
25|$|While some privateers {{continued}} to use GT1 version of the C6.R in Europe, the official factory team Corvette Racing switched from the slowly dying GT1 category to the much more competitive and popular GT2 class in mid-2009. The new GT2 C6.R used {{a modified version of}} the ZR1 model body, but does not have the ZR1 <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine.</b> GT2 rules are based more on production vehicles, therefore the GT2 C6.R naturally aspirated engine was considerably more restricted and less powerful than its predecessor. The car debuted at Mid-Ohio's ALMS round. They achieved one ALMS race victory in the remaining 2009 ALMS season, and one victory at the final round of 2010 ALMS season, Petit Le Mans. Corvette Racing's two GT2 C6.Rs also led most of the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans, but both cars were forced to retire. Racing in the new GTE Pro class, the C6.R raced in the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans with the No.73 car taking the class victory. The No.74 car led the class for most of the race but crashed in the morning hours. The C6.R raced by Larbre Competition also took the GTE Am class victory. In 2012, Corvette Racing returned to glory in the ALMS winning 4 of 10 races and claiming the Driver's, Team, and Manufacturer's Championships. Corvette Racing repeated the feat in 2013 by winning 5 of 10 races and claiming the Driver's, Team and Manufacturer's Championships again.|$|E
500|$|The 1995 VS Commodore {{served as}} a {{mechanical}} update of the VR, destined to maintain sales momentum {{before the arrival of}} an all-new VT model. The extent of exterior changes amounted to little more than a redesigned Holden logo and wheel trims. An overhauled Ecotec (Emissions and Consumption Optimisation through TEChnology) version of the Buick V6 engine coincided with changes to the engine in the United States. The Ecotec engine packed 13percent more power for a total of , cut fuel consumption by 5percent, increased the compression ratio from 9.0:1 to 9.4:1 and improved on the engine's previous rough characteristics. Holden mated the new engine with {{a modified version of the}} GM 4L60-E automatic transmission, improving throttle response and smoothing gear changes. The Series II update of June 1996 included elliptical side turn signals, interior tweaks and the introduction of a supercharged V6 engine for selected trim levels, and the introduction of a new Getrag manual transmission. The new <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> slotted between the existing V6 and V8 engines in the lineup and was officially rated at , just [...] below the V8.|$|E
5000|$|For 2011 the 3.6 FSI and 4.2 FSI were {{replaced}} by two 3.0 L TFSI <b>supercharged</b> <b>engines.</b> The base version develops [...] ( [...] for 2012) and 295 lbft Nm while the S-Line has [...] and 325 lbft Nm.|$|R
50|$|In {{turbocharged}} and <b>supercharged</b> <b>engines</b> {{with potential}} for abundant torque, an intake pressure regulation system often limits torque to a near-constant figure across the {{engine speed range}} to reduce stresses on the engine and provide consistent handling without decreasing peak power.|$|R
5000|$|Designed by Nye Frank, it used twin <b>supercharged</b> <b>engines</b> {{and had an}} {{aluminum}} body. When owned by John Peters, running in Top Gas (driven by Bob Muravez) at the 1971 Supernationals, it was painted black and powered {{by a pair of}} Chrysler hemis.|$|R
2500|$|In January 1926 the Air Ministry funded Gloster Aircraft {{to produce}} an {{all-metal}} version of their Gamecock for a high altitude fighter role, hence requiring a <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine.</b> [...] The result was the Goldfinch, a single-bay biplane with unequal span wings of marked stagger. Unsurprisingly, this aircraft had a strong similarity to the Gamecock and in particular to the Gamecock II with its narrow-chord ailerons. [...] Because of the <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> the fuselage was longer forward of the cockpit. [...] The tail also was slightly different, the tailplane having rounded trailing tips and the fin, initially, was [...] very broad in chord and short in height.|$|E
2500|$|Changes were minimal to the Ninety-Eight for 1996, {{its final}} year. [...] The most notable was {{the removal of}} the <b>supercharged</b> <b>engine</b> from the option list. [...] That engine, however, {{remained}} available on Oldsmobile's performance LSS model.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a three-year}} break a new Daimler, the Super Eight, was {{presented}} in July 2005.
