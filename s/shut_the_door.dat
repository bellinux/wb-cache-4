25|$|Both teams swapped {{field goals}} {{for the first two}} periods. The third was scoreless, despite an {{opportunity}} for Arkansas to <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with a field goal attempt. Arkansas then scored on a Matt Jones run, but failed the two-point conversion, which is required versus an extra point in the third overtime or later. The Volunteers answered the call on their first play, a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Tony Brown, but the Volunteers also failed the two, sending the game into a fifth extra period.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{moved back}} to the buses where Janet Quin lay injured from the earlier shot. Bryant shot her in the back, then left; she later died from her wounds. Bryant then went onto one of the coaches and fired a shot at Elva Gaylard who was hiding inside, hitting her in the arm and chest and killing her. At an {{adjacent}} coach, Gordon Francis saw what happened and moved down the aisle to try to <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the coach he was on. He was seen by Bryant and shot from the opposite coach. He survived, but needed four major operations.|$|E
25|$|The other {{settlers}} {{rushed into}} the cabin as the raiding warriors surrounded the house. They <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and aimed their weapons through cracks in the walls. Two of the men stood near the doorway with their weapons, and Hodges' weapon {{came into contact with}} Girty's chest causing him, and his group, to retreat into the woods. Young Dimmick, anxious to the point of begging to leave, was then dispatched to Hennepin by horseback for help. The men at the cabin expected Dimmick to be shot as soon as he rode off, but he crossed the open prairie unscathed. Dimmick made the 16 mile (25.7km) journey and arrived in Hennepin to report the attack.|$|E

25|$|In Game 6, Damon {{sparked the}} Yankees with a 2-run {{single in the}} bottom of the 4th to give the Yankees a lead that they would not relinquish. Pettitte hurled 6 strong innings, {{allowing}} only one earned run. Mariano Rivera came on in the 8th for a 6 out save, but allowed an RBI single to Guerrero to make it a 3-2 Yankee lead. It was the first postseason run allowed by Rivera at home since 2000, and the only one he would give up in the 2009 postseason. In the bottom half, errors by Kendrick and Scott Kazmir gave the Yankees two insurance runs, and Rivera <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in the 9th to give the Yankees their 40th American League pennant.|$|E
25|$|In 1974–75, Dave Schultz topped {{his mark}} from the {{previous}} season by setting an NHL record for penalty minutes with 472. Clarke's efforts earned him his second Hart Trophy and Parent was the lone recipient of the Vezina Trophy. The Flyers as a team improved their record slightly with a mark of 51–18–11, {{the best record in}} the NHL. After a first-round bye, the Flyers easily swept the Toronto Maple Leafs and were presented with another New York-area team in the Semi-finals. The Flyers looked to be headed toward another sweep against the New York Islanders after winning the first three games. The Islanders, however, fought back by winning the next three games, setting up a deciding seventh game. The Flyers were finally able to <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on the Islanders, winning Game 7, 4–1.|$|E
25|$|On April 5, in his Red Sox debut, David Price {{struck out}} ten Indians batters and earned the win. He became the fifth Red Sox pitcher {{to win an}} opening day game in his debut for the ball club and the first since Pedro Martínez did it in 1998. Mookie Betts went deep in the third innings, scoring Jackie Bradley, Jr. and gave Boston an early 2–0 lead. In a four-hit inning, Cleveland brought two runners home and the game was tied {{at two in the}} bottom of the fourth. In the sixth, on a Travis Shaw single, Hanley Ramírez took third base from first, and scored on a Brock Holt blooper to left field. Travis Shaw took third on a Blake Swihart ground out and scored on a wild pitch by Corey Kluber. Junichi Tazawa and Koji Uehara retired all batters they faced in the seventh and eighth {{respectively}} and with Craig Kimbrel warming in the bullpen and Dustin Pedroia on first, David Ortiz hit his fifth opening day home run of his career, extending the lead to 6–2. Although not a save situation, Kimbrel made his Red Sox debut in the ninth and <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> allowing a walk and striking out two.|$|E

500|$|In January 1941, Berryman became Commander, Royal Artillery, in Arthur [...] "Tubby" [...] Allen's 7th Division, and was {{promoted}} to brigadier. During the Syria-Lebanon campaign, Berryman demonstrated {{that he was a}} thrusting commander who led from the front and repeatedly demonstrated his coolness under fire.

500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I Stuart was called up to service, as {{an officer in the}} Royal Naval Reserve. He was originally posted as a junior officer on board the old and obsolete destroyer HMS Opossum in Plymouth. This ship was used for harbour patrols and intercepting neutral merchant ships and other work Stuart considered tedious. He became increasingly impatient with the life and repeatedly applied to his senior officers with requests for transfer; at one point he even requested that he be commissioned into the army. All of these were turned down, with increasing levels of hostility from his commanders, one of whom was reported to have told him to [...] "Go to hell!

On an arranged signal, the English <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the house and Standish attacked Pecksuot, stabbing him repeatedly with the man's own knife. [...] Wituwamat and the third warrior were also killed. Leaving the house, Standish ordered two more Massachusett warriors to be put to death. Gathering his men, Standish went outside the walls of Wessagusset in search of Obtakiest, a sachem of the Massachusett tribe. The Englishmen soon encountered Obtakiest with a group of warriors and a skirmish ensued, during which Obtakiest escaped.|$|E

Fahs states that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales of the SCUM Manifesto, which he had published. Fahs states that [...] "the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actor's Studio at 432 West Forty-Fourth Street early that morning."

500|$|The episode {{opens in}} the [...] "green reality" [...] (where Rex {{is alive and}} Hannah isn't), with John Cooper (Clifton Powell), a convict that Michael arrested 10 years ago, who is {{transferred}} to a medical clinic for dialysis because he is missing a kidney, by Nancy (Lolly Ward). As the guard takes Copper to the car {{to go back to}} prison, he complains that the prisoner is getting preferential treatment over his mother, who is on the waiting list. As they arrive at the van, Cooper uses a paralytic vial hidden in his bandages to knock one guard out. He takes his gun, and makes the other security guard <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Cooper claims his has [...] "nothing to lose". Later, at home, while Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) takes him to tennis practice, Michael gets a call from Isaiah [...] "Bird" [...] Freeman (Steve Harris), his partner, that Cooper had escaped. Rex and Tara are talking about Rex's guilt about his father, when Cooper hits the car, and puts a chemical thing on Tara, and kidnaps Rex.|$|E
500|$|The set design, too, {{has been}} praised for being [...] "suitably claustrophobic." [...] Robson's {{direction}} has earned kudos for heightening the suspense by leaving certain actions and motives vague. In {{the scene in}} which Seaman Parker (Lawrence Tierney) dies, crushed by the anchor chain, Robson left it unclear whether Captain Stone committed murder by trapping Parker in the anchor chain locker or whether he merely <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The vagueness leaves the audience unsure whether to believe Merriam's accusations against the Captain, and builds an atmosphere of paranoia and doubt which {{is critical to the}} picture's success. Contemporary critic Gary Giddins has pointed out that the film incorporates classic Lewton scare tactics but in new ways. [...] "His trademark scare tactic, a high point in practically all of his films, is a long, dark, nightmarish walk, where every sound is magnified and every object threatening. In The Ghost Ship, that [...] "walk" [...] is transferred to the cabin of the victimized third officer..." [...] Others have pointed out another Lewton device, the gradual stalking of a main character by a murderer, as another deft touch in the film.|$|E

500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud."
