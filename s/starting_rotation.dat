5|$|Ellis {{made his}} MLB debut that June, {{beginning}} as a relief pitcher. The Pirates moved Ellis into the <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> later that season. Ellis pitched his first complete game in September. He had a 6–5 win-loss {{record with a}} 2.51 ERA with the Pirates in 1968. In 1969, Ellis made the team's <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> for Opening Day. The struggles of Steve Blass kept Ellis in the <b>starting</b> <b>rotation,</b> as Blass {{was moved to the}} bullpen.|$|E
5|$|Nova entered spring {{training}} in 2011 expected {{to secure a}} spot in the <b>starting</b> <b>rotation.</b> Nova was named to the Yankees' <b>starting</b> <b>rotation.</b> On June 20, Nova had the longest start in his career (at that time), allowing one run in eight innings against the Cincinnati Reds, while striking out seven. Through June, Nova had an 8–4 win–loss record and 4.15 ERA, including a 4–1 record and 3.35 ERA in his six most recent starts.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{returned}} to Kansas City's <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> in 2006 {{when he was}} named the fourth starter during Spring training. However, he was moved up to the third spot before the season began when Runelvys Hernández was demoted to the fifth spot. Affeldt struggled as a starter, going 25 with a 7.80 ERA in nine starts. His final major league start came on May 27 against the New York Yankees. He gave up ten runs on eleven hits in a 154 loss. After the start, {{he was sent to}} the bullpen, and Bobby Keppel filled his place in the <b>starting</b> <b>rotation.</b> Affeldt improved in the bullpen, posting a 2.91 ERA there through July 31.|$|E
50|$|Going {{into the}} 2011 season, the Phillies' top four {{pitchers}} (Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, Oswalt, and Cole Hamels) were widely touted as constituting {{one of the}} best <b>starting</b> <b>rotations</b> in history.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was called}} up to San Diego early in the [...] season to join Bill Greif, Randy Jones & Dan Spillner {{in one of the}} best young <b>starting</b> <b>rotations</b> in the National League. He won his major league debut over Steve Carlton & the Philadelphia Phillies, 6-2.|$|R
50|$|An owner {{plays the}} role of both general manager and manager for each team they create. A team’s roster {{contains}} up to 25 players and is built from an owner’s baseball card collection. The owner then sets fielding positions, batting lineups, <b>starting</b> <b>rotations</b> and bullpen assignments. After these decisions are made, the owner’s team is ready to compete against other players with a number of game types.|$|R
5|$|Since , Cain was one {{of three}} {{starting}} pitchers in the <b>starting</b> <b>rotation,</b> along with Tim Lincecum and Madison Bumgarner, to win over one hundred games. In that span, the San Francisco Giants are the only Major League team to accomplish the feat, according to NBC Sports Bay Area.|$|E
5|$|The Houston Astros claimed Humber off waivers on November 30, 2012. Humber {{made the}} Astros' <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> {{at the start}} of the 2013 season. Humber lost his spot in the <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> to Érik Bédard after opening the season with an 0–7 record and an ERA of 8.82. Humber was {{designated}} for assignment on May 12, after his record fell to 0–8 with a 9.59 ERA. After pitching in relief for the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the PCL, the Astros selected his contract on August 12, when they traded Wesley Wright to the Tampa Bay Rays. On October 3, the Astros declined a $3 million option for 2014, instead paying him his guaranteed $500,000 and releasing him.|$|E
5|$|Cain {{started the}} 2014 season 1–3 with a 3.66 ERA {{in his first}} eight starts, before being placed on the 15-day DL with a {{strained}} right hamstring on May 30, 2014. Bruce Bochy stated that after the All Star break, Cain would move from the {{second place in the}} Giants <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> to fifth. Bochy added that Cain falling in the order {{had more to do with}} everyone else's successes than any shortcomings of Cain.|$|E
50|$|Power {{spent most}} of his career as a relief pitcher, and he held the closer role for the Reds for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s. From 1986 to 1989, he spent {{significant}} time in his teams' <b>starting</b> <b>rotations</b> before moving back to the bullpen {{for the last few years}} of his career. He earned 70 career saves. He suffered a career-ending shoulder injury before the 1994 season and later entered coaching. He has been the pitching coach for the Louisville Bats since 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Miami- {{holds the}} best <b>starting</b> {{pitching}} <b>rotation</b> with Henter (best pitcher {{in the game}} with a 1.85 ERA), West, and Jarvis; average bullpen led by closer Irving; and weak offense led by Warner ...|$|R
5000|$|Brewer toiled on {{the mounds}} of black {{baseball}} for twenty-four years {{with an assortment}} of teams throughout the world, including China, Japan, the Philippines, Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, Haiti, Santo Domingo, and in forty-four of the forty-eight continental United States. While with the Kansas City Monarchs, he was a part of legendary <b>starting</b> <b>rotations</b> including Satchel Paige and Bullet Rogan. Brewer had a lively fastball and a devastating overhand [...] "drop ball," [...] which was especially tough on left-handed hitters. He also threw a scuffed baseball, known as an [...] "emery ball" [...] (learned from Emory Osborne and Ted [...] "Double Duty" [...] Radcliffe.) when such practice was legal.|$|R
5|$|Cain's 2005 {{performance}} was impressive enough that manager Felipe Alou named {{him to the}} team's 2006 <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> before spring training began. Cain began the season as the team's fourth starter. Entering the season, he was again ranked as the Giants' top prospect by Baseball America, which also named him the 10th-best prospect in baseball.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{began the}} 1944 Philadelphia Athletics {{season as a}} member of the <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> along with Don Black, Lum Harris and Bobo Newsom. However, he did split time in the first half of the year between the <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> and the bullpen. Among those {{appearances}} was a 16-inning match against the Chicago White Sox; Christopher pitched the final four innings, losing 4–2 after Hal Trosky stole home plate. On July 14, he pitched a 4–3 victory against the Senators, helping his team defeat Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn for the first time in three years. After starting the season with a 4–10 record, on July 22 Christopher went on a seven-game winning streak that culminated with a 5–1 complete game victory over the White Sox. He finished the season with a 14–14 record, 84 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.97. After the season ended, Christopher and others went on a barnstorming tour throughout the United States, ending in Wenatchee, Washington.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{held out}} from the Pirates in February 1968; he came {{to terms with the}} team in March. The Pirates optioned Ellis to Columbus, who moved Ellis from the <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> to the bullpen. At Columbus, Ellis {{credited}} his work with manager Johnny Pesky and pitching coach Harvey Haddix for improving his performance.|$|E
5000|$|Hedlund {{began the}} [...] in the majors, but was ineffective, and was reassigned to the triple A Omaha Royals. In , the Royals boasted {{one of the}} most talented young <b>starting</b> <b>rotations</b> in the majors with Hedlund, Dick Drago and Paul Splittorff all under 27 years old. After {{narrowly}} avoiding one hundred losses in 1970, the Royals improved to 85-76, in 1971 to finish second in the American League West. For his part, Hedlund rebounded to go 15-8 in with the leagues fourth best ERA, 2.71. After the season, Hedlund traveled to Vietnam with a group of Major League ballplayers on a tour of hospitals and military bases.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, in modern-day play, {{an active}} roster {{will consist of}} five {{starting}} pitchers, seven relief pitchers, two catchers, six infielders, and five outfielders. Teams can vary this somewhat according to preference and circumstance, and indeed the [...] "typical" [...] roster makeup has changed somewhat over the years. (<b>Starting</b> <b>rotations</b> used to consist of four pitchers, not five, well into the 1970s; third-string catchers used {{to be much more}} common; many other minor variations exist.) In the American League, a full-time designated hitter is usually classified as either an infielder or an outfielder, not a DH, because most DHs do play defensive positions from time to time.|$|R
2500|$|Let [...] be {{an element}} of H which <b>starts</b> with a <b>rotation</b> on the z axis, of the form [...]|$|R
5|$|In 2003, Affeldt {{found himself}} {{competing}} with Runelvys Hernández {{for the first}} spot in the Royals' <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> during Spring training. Because Tony Peña, the Royals' manager, was unable to decide which one would be the ace, he flipped a coin to determine who would be number one. Hernández won the toss.|$|E
5|$|Nova secured {{for a spot}} in the <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> for the 2012 {{season in}} spring training. He won 15 {{consecutive}} games from June 2011 through May 2012, one short of the franchise record set by Roger Clemens. He surpassed the Yankees' rookie record of twelve consecutive wins, set by Atley Donald in 1939, during the 2011 season.|$|E
5|$|The Nationals {{announced}} that Strasburg would be scheduled {{to make his}} final start on September 12 and would be replaced by John Lannan in the Nationals' <b>starting</b> <b>rotation.</b> However, after a rough outing on September 8, Davey Johnson {{announced that}} Strasburg was finished for the 2012 season. Strasburg spent the postseason on the physically unable to perform list as the Nationals lost the 2012 NLDS to the St. Louis Cardinals in 5 games.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the team's overall performance, {{the first half of}} the season provided several memorable moments for the players themselves. Highlights included Johnson earning his 300th career victory, becoming the twenty-fourth pitcher in Major League history to do so, as well as struggling starter Jonathan Sánchez tossing a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres on July 10, the first Giants no-hitter since 1976. 2009's pitching staff will go down as one of the strongest <b>starting</b> <b>rotations</b> in Giants history– the Giants sent two of their starting pitchers to the All-Star Game, including that year's starter, Tim Lincecum. He went on to win the 2009 NL Cy Young Award, finishing at 15–7. Lincecum became the only pitcher to capture the Cy Young Award in each of his first two full Major League seasons.|$|R
40|$|The {{decline in}} {{undergraduate}} teaching in plastic surgery may affect student's decisions {{to pursue a}} career in the speciality and junior doctors may be insufficiently prepared for plastic surgery rotations during foundation or core surgical training. To address this issue, we have developed a one-day Basic Surgical Skills and Principles in Plastic Surgery Course designed to provide medical students with the relevant skills and knowledge required for placements in plastic surgery as junior doctors. A pre- and post-course questionnaire was used to record self-assessment of confidence in various domains. Our results show that students were significantly less confident in <b>starting</b> foundation training <b>rotations</b> in plastic surgery (mean 3. 59, SD 1. 56) compared with general surgery (mean 5. 75, SD 1. 95) (p <  0. 0001), and ‘any specialty’ (mean 5. 88, SD 1. 54) (p <  0. 0001). However, a one-day course can significantly address this imbalance: 100 % increase in confidence in <b>starting</b> <b>rotations</b> in plastic surgery (pre-course mean 3. 59 (SD 1. 56), post-course mean 7. 20 (SD 1. 60), p <  0. 0001). We conclude that medical students should have greater exposure to teaching in plastic surgery and that this could be achieved in-part through courses in basic surgical skills and principles in plastic surgery...|$|R
50|$|Sapp {{signed with}} the Vikings in 2008. In 2008 he stepped in to the Vikings <b>starting</b> nickel <b>rotation</b> after Charles Gordon went down. In 2008, he had 22 tackles along with 2 interceptions. On March 3, 2009, the Vikings re-signed him to a one-year {{contract}}. And re-signed him again for a two-year contract on March 9, 2010.|$|R
5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the San Francisco Giants in 2004, Sánchez quickly {{worked his way through}} the Giants' minor league system. In 2006, he was called up to the major leagues and was used mostly in a long relief role. In 2007, he made the team out of spring {{training}} and was again used mostly in long relief, though he spent part of his season in the minors. In 2008, he made the Giants' <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> and remained in it for the entire year, except for a stint on the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|Clippard began 2007 {{with the}} Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League. He was 3–2 with a 2.72 ERA {{in his first}} eight starts, {{striking}} out 41 in 39 2/3 innings but allowing 40 hits and 17 walks. Though the Yankees experienced injuries in the <b>starting</b> <b>rotation,</b> they called on Matt DeSalvo and Chase Wright before Clippard. When Darrell Rasner broke his finger in May, Clippard was called up to New York. He became the seventh rookie to start a game for the 2007 New York Yankees, following Hughes, DeSalvo, Rasner, Wright, Kei Igawa and Jeff Karstens.|$|E
5|$|Kendrick {{was born}} in Houston, Texas, but {{attended}} high school in Mount Vernon, Washington. While growing up, he was greatly influenced by his father, from whom he developed his composure when pitching. Upon graduation, he turned down a scholarship to play college football, instead signing a contract to begin his professional baseball career in the Phillies' organization. After a slow ascent through {{the lower levels of}} the Phillies' minor league system, he made his MLB debut in 2007, and {{was a member of the}} <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> of the 2008 World Series Champion team.|$|E
50|$|The Astros also {{announced}} their <b>starting</b> pitching <b>rotation.</b> As usual Roy Oswalt {{was given the}} ball on opening day. With Jason Jennings in Texas and Woody retired,the Astros named Brandon Backe to the second spot. Wandy Rodríguez would get {{the ball in the}} third spot with Shawn Chacón and Chris Sampson following them in the #4 and 5 spots.|$|R
50|$|Utah- {{has one of}} {{the best}} offenses in the game led by Agua and Harlan, {{featuring}} a Jekyll and Hyde pitching staff with a strong <b>starting</b> pitching <b>rotation</b> led by Quinta, Lep, and Stava and an inconsistent bullpen led by Bella, one of the best closers in the game, but also features three of the five worst ERAs.|$|R
30|$|The {{rotation}} assay of the F 1 -bead {{was conducted}} {{using the following}} procedures. A buffer solution [10 mM 4 -morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS)–KOH/ 50 nm KCl 1 % (vol/vol) BSA, pH 7.0] was flowed thoroughly to fill the entire microchannel at the first step. Second, 2 nM biotinylated His-tagged F 1 -ATPase in the buffer solution {{was introduced to the}} microchannel and was immobilized naturally to Ni–NTA on the surface for a few minutes. Streptavidin-coated duplex bead (ϕ 350 nm, CM 01 N/ 7024; Bangs Laboratories Inc.) solution was then flowed continuously to attach itself naturally to the biotinylated part of F 1 -ATPase to be F 1 -bead complex for 15 min. Finally, 700 μM ATP in the buffer solution was introduced to <b>start</b> <b>rotation.</b> The rotational motion was extracted automatically from the video image using homemade image processing software on a PC.|$|R
5|$|Lieber {{remained}} in the bullpen to begin the 1996 season. In his first 34 games, he posted a 4.21 ERA. In July, {{he returned to the}} <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> following the release of Zane Smith. As a starter, Lieber posted a 72 record with a 3.91 ERA, emerging as the Pirates' ace {{by the end of the}} year. In 51 games (15 starts) in 1996, Lieber posted a 95 record, a 3.99 ERA, 94 strikeouts, 28 walks, and 156 hits allowed in 142 innings pitched.|$|E

After struggling in 2012, Nova reemerged in 2013, winning the American League Pitcher of the Month Award for August 2013. The Yankees traded Nova to the Pirates in 2016, and he won the National League Pitcher of the Month Award for April 2017.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2010, Cliff Lee {{returned}} to the Phillies as he signed a free-agent contract with Philadelphia {{for five years and}} $120 million with a vesting option for a sixth year. After this signing, the Phillies' <b>starting</b> <b>rotation</b> consisted of Roy Halladay, Roy Oswalt, Cliff Lee, Cole Hamels, and Joe Blanton. This rotation was considered {{one of the best in}} pitching history by many. Halladay, Oswalt, Lee, and Hamels were dubbed the Phantastic Phour by fans and the media.|$|E
5|$|Stivetts {{was again}} {{reserved}} by Boston, and later re-signed for $2000.
