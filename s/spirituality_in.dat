The purpose of her endowment was to be her crypt and {{to serve as the}} spiritual center which would continue the orientation of the Serbian culture toward Byzantine Orthodox <b>spirituality</b> <b>in</b> this historically last period of Serbian medieval statehood. In this way Jelena confirmed her loyalty to the tradition of the Nemanjić dynasty and her father Prince Lazar in the period when she was able to make a political choice between Islam and militant Catholicism. Jelena's efforts had an additional dimension taking into consideration that her work is a testimony of the presence of the Byzantine hesychasm in the Serbian Despotate.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s the Elephant 6 collective, {{including}} {{acts like}} The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and of Montreal, produced eclectic psychedelic rock and folk. Other alternative acts to pursue psychedelia from the 1990s included The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Dandy Warhols, Kula Shaker and Super Furry Animals. Stoner rock also emerged, combining elements of psychedelic rock, blues-rock and doom metal. Typically using a slow-to-mid tempo and featuring low-tuned guitars in a bass-heavy sound, with melodic vocals, and 'retro' production, it was pioneered by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. In the UK the Madchester scene influenced the early sound of 1990s Britpop bands like Blur. The Verve mixed on 1960s psychedelia with the shoegazing aesthetic. Oasis also drew on 1960s psychedelic pop and rock. In the immediate post-Britpop era Kula Shaker incorporated swirling, guitar-heavy sounds of late-'60s psychedelia with Indian mysticism and <b>spirituality.</b> <b>In</b> {{the new millennium}} neo-psychedelia was continued by bands directly emulating {{the sounds of the}} 60s such as The Black Angels, Tame Impala, Pond, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and The Essex Green, while bands like Animal Collective and The Bright Light Social Hour applied an experimental approach that combined genres from the 1960s and the present.M.
