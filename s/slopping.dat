She {{was the first woman}} to do so, and the second person after Kieran Nugent, a prisoner in the H-Blocks of HMP Maze. Farrell instigated a dirty protest in February 1980. This meant that prisoners refused to slop-out and would smear excrement and menstrual material on the walls of their cells instead of risking being attacked by the guards while <b>slopping</b> out. On 1 December Farrell, along with Mary Doyle and Mairead Nugent, began a hunger strike in Armagh prison to coincide with the one already taking place in Long Kesh. It ended on 19 December, a day after the men's strike. The dirty protest ended in March 1981 as the prisoner's rights' campaign was focused on the hunger strike being undertaken by Bobby Sands, leader of IRA prisoners in the H-Blocks. She was one of the H-Block/Armagh prisoners to stand for election in the Republic of Ireland in the 1981 General Election, standing in Cork North Central and polling 2,751 votes (6.05%).|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of indoor toilets, it was common to use the chamber pot under one's bed at night and then to dispose of its contents in the morning. During the Victorian era, British housemaids collected all of the household's chamber pots and carried them to a room known as the housemaids' cupboard. [...] This room contained a [...] "slop sink", made of wood with a lead lining to prevent chipping china chamber pots, for washing the [...] "bedroom ware" [...] or [...] "chamber utensils". Once running water and flush toilets were plumbed into British houses, servants were sometimes given their own lavatory downstairs, separate from the family lavatory. The practice of emptying one's own chamber pot, known as <b>Slopping</b> out, continued in British prisons until recently and is still in use in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} study the effect of distillery <b>slop</b> and chemical fertilizer on soil fertility, growth and yield of sugar cane. The field experiment was conducted on Mahasarakam soil series, using the K 88 - 92 variety of sugar cane. The results showed that distillery <b>slop</b> significantly increased some nutrients in soil, particularly potassium, magnesium, sulfur and chloride. The results also showed that application of distillery <b>slop</b> did not affect most of the physical properties of soil. Only the saturated hydraulic conductivity was significantly decreased under non-application of fertilizer. Under the application of distillery <b>slop,</b> chemical fertilizer had no {{significant effect on the}} yield and the juice quality of sugar cane for both crop years. However, under non-application of distillery <b>slop</b> in the first crop year, application of 21 - 0 - 0 and 20 - 20 - 0 fertilizer had a significant effect on cane yield. With the application of chemical fertilizer, distillery <b>slop</b> had an influence on the yield of sugar cane in both crop years while different doses of <b>slop</b> did not make any significant difference on cane yield. The average yields of the first crop year were 126. 7, 195. 6, 203. 0 and 187. 2 ton/hectare and those of the second crop year were 85. 0, 150. 0, 150. 8 and 142. 4 ton/hectare after the application of 0, 187. 5, 375 and 562. 5 m 3 /hectare, respectively. The results also showed that application of distillery <b>slop</b> did not have any significant effect on juice quality for both crop years. Investigation of <b>slop</b> trace under the ground surface indicated that application of distillery <b>slop</b> did not affect the quality of underground water as the deepest level of trace was only 50 centimeters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Co-pyrolysis of <b>slop</b> {{oil with}} {{ferrocene}} {{was carried out}} to convert waste of petroleum into carbon nanoparticles (CNPs). Since <b>slop</b> oil {{is a mixture of}} hydrocarbons (HCs) with broad molecular weight distribution, it could be simply fractionated into some certain fractions by batch distillation. Distillate containing hydrocarbons with small molecules was mainly focused as an alternative carbon source for synthesis of CNPs. A two-stage furnace was employed for evaporating a mixture of distillated <b>slop</b> oil and ferrocene at 200 °C in the 1 st stage of the furnace and then formation of CNPs at 900 °C could be observed in the 2 nd stage. Laboratory-grade ferrocene was mixed with <b>slop</b> oil with a designated weight-ratio of 1 : 2. Microscopic analyses based on SEM and TEM micrographs reveals that CNPs obtained from distillated <b>slop</b> oil mostly consist of bundles of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with nominal diameters of 20 - 50 nm. Raman spectroscopic analyses of the synthesized CNPs exhibit the notably high value of IG/ID, suggesting that the synthesized CNPs preferably consist of graphitic nanostructure. Moreover, TGA analysis shows that 39. 8 and 32. 9 wt % of Fe contents exist in the CNP samples synthesized from original <b>slop</b> oil and distillated <b>slop</b> oil, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract	 Offshore {{oil and gas}} {{drilling}} operations generates <b>slop</b> water, {{which are}} formed when wastewater originating from multiple sources becomes contaminated with drilling fluid components {{and have to be}} disposed or treated prior to discharge in compliance with local discharge regulations. The logistics and treatment of <b>slop</b> water have been suggested to represent {{a significant part of the}} life-cycle environmental footprint of offshore drilling operations but poorly understood due to lack of information regarding volumes, sources and technology descriptions to properly model <b>slop</b> waste treatment technologies with life-cycle assessment. In this thesis, the environmental impacts of offshore injection disposal and a range of <b>slop</b> water treatment technology options applied offshore and onshore for the treatment of different types and volumes of <b>slop</b> water were evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA). The offshore treatment technological set-ups were filtration, dissolved air flotation (DAF) and centrifuge based treatment technologies, while the onshore treatment system involves a combination of chemical and physical treatment processes. The sources, characteristics and volume estimates of <b>slop</b> water treated by the identified treatment technologies were described based on four wells scenarios drilled within the Norwegian continental shelf which includes a normal, deep-water, and high pressure high temperature (HPHT) well, all of which were partly drilled with an oil based mud (OBM) and an arctic well drilled using only water based mud (WBM). The results of the study showed that offshore treatment of <b>slop</b> is a better alternative to offshore injection and onshore treatment with the DAF system emerging as the best alternative overall. When <b>slop</b> cannot be handled at source on the rig, onshore treatment will be a better alternative to offshore injection. The disposal or recycling of oil present in <b>slop</b> water has a significant effect on the environmental performance of the treatment systems. A comparison of the normal well with the three other well scenarios highlighted that the HPHT and deep-water have relatively higher impacts due to the high volumes of <b>slop</b> water generated by both wells. The significant impact contributions of logistics when <b>slop</b> water is sent onshore was highlighted by the deep-water and arctic well scenarios which both has the longest distance from field to shore. The arctic well scenario offshore treatment impacts were the lowest due to the use of WBM only for drilling, thereby highlighting the significant effect of OBM use on <b>slop</b> water treatment impacts. The benefits of using natural gas and onshore electricity (where applicable) instead of diesel as a source of energy when handling <b>slop</b> offshore was also demonstrated by sensitivity analysis. The findings of this study offers new and useful information that allows for the better assessment of offshore <b>slop</b> water management options which also serves as a useful input in the decision objectives used by stakeholders for the overall environmental evaluation of offshore drilling activities...|$|R
