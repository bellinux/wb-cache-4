25|$|An {{area was}} {{set aside for}} the burial of Confederate prisoners of war who died at the camp. As many as 700 prisoners died in 1862 when {{smallpox}} and other diseases were rampant in the camp. The situation was aggravated by the poor living conditions the prisoners endured there, and they were interred in the cemetery in their own Confederate section. A total of 866 Confederate prisoner's graves can be found today in the National Cemetery. The Confederate graves are easily distinguishable by the pointed headstones, which were instituted under the superstition that it was a means of preventing the devil from <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> graves. They are buried side by side with 776 graves of Union soldiers and enlistees, making a total of 1,642 Civil War graves.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found {{at the scene of}} the attacks. The first specimen of physical evidence was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> porch next to the screen door. Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth and smelled it. As soon as she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation in her mouth and throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis of her legs. Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.|$|E

500|$|Despite these rewrites, 20th Century Fox did {{not express}} {{confidence}} in financing a science-fiction film. However, after {{the success of}} Star Wars in 1977 the studio's interest in the genre rose substantially. According to Carroll: [...] "When Star Wars came out and was the extraordinary hit that it was, suddenly science fiction became the hot genre." [...] O'Bannon recalled that [...] "They wanted {{to follow through on}} Star Wars, and they wanted to follow through fast, and the only spaceship script they had <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> desk was Alien". Alien was greenlit by 20th Century Fox, with an initial budget of $4.2million. Alien was funded by North Americans, but made by 20th Century-Fox's British production subsidiary.|$|E
500|$|In March 1969, James {{arranged}} {{to sell his}} and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company Associated Television (ATV), founded by impresario Lew Grade, without first informing the Beatles. The band then made a bid to gain controlling interest by attempting {{to work out a}} deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding. The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, [...] "I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> fat arses in the City." [...] By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973. In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969.|$|E
500|$|Jim Harrison of SoundSpike {{affirmed that}} the Harajuku Lovers Tour lacked a strong musical setlist, and {{also felt that}} Stefani's stage {{presence}} was absent. He stated that she [...] "doesn't have many songs that translate well in a live setting" [...] from her album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and suggested {{that she should have}} included songs by No Doubt for [...] "much-needed shots of adrenaline" [...] for the audience, who were, according to Harrison, [...] "figuratively <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> hands and literally yawning four songs into the set". Harrison felt that Stefani seemed truly [...] "lost on stage without a band", ultimately describing her performance as [...] " [...] energy", [...] "lukewarm" [...] and seemingly [...] "on autopilot". Furthermore, the SoundSpike writer thought that her performance was akin to that of fellow American recording artist Britney Spears, which was [...] "utterly unsuitable for both the song selection and her style". However, he did praise the rendition of [...] "Hollaback Girl", calling it [...] "great" [...] and [...] "Gwen being all Gwen can be", and called the breakdancing [...] "pretty cool".|$|E

500|$|Starship Troopers is {{generally}} considered to promote militarism, the glorification of war and of the military. Scholar Bruce Franklin referred to it in 1980 as a [...] "bugle-blowing, drum-beating glorification" [...] of military service, and wrote that militarism and imperialism were the explicit message of the book. Science fiction writer Dean McLaughlin called it [...] "a book-length recruiting poster". In 1968 science fiction critic Alexei Panshin called Starship Troopers a militaristic polemic and compared it to a recruiting film, stating that it [...] "purports to show {{the life of a}} typical soldier, with a soundtrack commentary by earnest sincere Private Jones who interprets what we see for us." [...] Panshin stated that there was no [...] "sustained human conflict" [...] in the book: instead, [...] "All the soldiers we see are tough, smart, competent, cleancut, clean-shaven, and noble." [...] Panshin, a veteran of the peacetime military, argued that Heinlein glossed over the reality of military life, and that the Terran Federation-Arachnid conflict existed simply because, [...] "Starship troopers are not half so glorious <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> butts polishing their weapons for the tenth time for lack of anything else to do." [...] Literature scholar George Slusser, in describing the novel as [...] "wrong-headed and retrogressive", argued that calling its ideology militarism or imperialism was inadequate, as these descriptions suggested an economic motive. Slusser instead says that Heinlein advocates for a complete [...] "technological subjugation of nature", of which the Arachnids are a symbol, and that this subjugation itself is depicted as a sign of human advancement.|$|E
500|$|According to Scully, [...] "Kill the Alligator and Run" [...] {{is often}} cited by fans of The Simpsons {{as one of the}} worst episodes ever because of its {{structure}} and outlandish nature. Scully has said that the episode is [...] "kind of three stories in one." [...] Meyer, a writer and producer on the show, said in the DVD audio commentary that the fans thought it was [...] "kind of a frenetic and crazy, chaotic episode," [...] adding: [...] "I can't disagree. But {{we had a lot of}} fun writing it, and we stand by it." [...] While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing: [...] "Wow – this may be the most jumbled Simpsons to date! The episode seems to suffer from ADD as it can’t focus on any topic for very long. It flits from one gag to another with abandon and rarely makes much sense – or produces many laughs. Yeah, it has a few amusing moments, but it’s too scattershot to succeed." [...] Annie Alleman of The Herald News, on the other hand, named [...] "Kill the Alligator and Run" [...] her eighth favorite Simpsons episode. Nancy Basile of About.com thought the best scene of the episode is the one where the Simpsons have become hillbillies and are <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> porch, and Bart says [...] "I'm getting used to this country life. Teacher says I'm whittling at a tenth-grade level." [...] Corey Deiterman of the Houston Press listed Kid Rock at number one in his list of the top five worst musical guests in Simpsons history.|$|E

Soon after, Uychich's brother Brian Uychich (keyboard, vocals) began <b>sitting</b> in <b>on</b> <b>their</b> practices. Brian asked to join the band, playing an old keyboard he found in the Uychich family attic. This completed the original lineup, with which the first two albums and EP were recorded.|$|R

25|$|The correct {{position}} for this discipline, {{as in all}} forms of riding, is a balanced seat. This is seen when a bystander can run an imaginary straight line that passes through the rider's ear, shoulder, hip, and heel. This means the rider's feet and legs must hang directly in balance so that the heel hits this line, with heels down. The rider should also be sitting as straight as possible, but with their hips under <b>their</b> body, <b>sitting</b> firmly <b>on</b> <b>their</b> seat bones, not <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> one's crotch with an arched back. The rider should have their weight sunk into their seat and distributed through their legs.

2500|$|Early in the 4th quarter, Pittsburgh {{managed to}} tie the game with a 48-yard catch by Stallworth setting up Bradshaw's 1-yard {{touchdown}} pass to tight end Larry Brown. [...] But this would be their last score as Denver soon took over the game. [...] First, Jim Turner put the Broncos up 24-21 by kicking 44-yard field goal with 7:17 left on the clock. [...] Then Jackson intercepted a pass from Bradshaw and returned it 32 yards to the Steelers 9-yard line, setting up Turner's 24-yard field goal to make the score 27-21. [...] On Pittsburgh's ensuring drive, Jackson struck again, intercepting another pass and returning this one 17 yards to the Steelers 33. [...] Rather than <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> one-score lead and trying to run out the clock with running plays, Denver took to the air, scoring the game clinching touchdown on Morton's 34-yard pass to Jack Dolbin with 1:44 left in the game.|$|E
2500|$|Allen Klein (the {{de facto}} {{manager of the}} Beatles {{in the wake of}} Epstein's death) then {{attempted}} to set up a deal for Apple Corps to buy ATV out, which was stopped by attorney John Eastman—Linda McCartney's brother, and son of McCartney's future business manager, Lee Eastman—who sent a letter to ATV informing them that Klein was not authorised to act on Apple's behalf. Although technically true, Klein was the de facto manager for Lennon, Harrison and Starr, and also had McCartney's verbal go-ahead for the deal. ATV backed out rather than risk being pulled into litigation. Next, a block of investors who owned a small, but crucial, percentage of shares were lobbied by both sides to either sell out or cooperate to take control of Northern Songs. Unfortunately, during negotiations, Lennon expressed his absolute disdain for businessmen, saying, [...] "I'm sick to death of being fucked about by men in suits <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> fat arses in the City!", which immediately pushed any offended investors to ATV's side.|$|E

60|$|A {{vigilant}} lookout was kept. Suddenly, {{when they}} were in the thickest part of the wood, a number of mounted men dashed out from either side. In obedience to the orders Ronald had given, the men in front and behind at once closed in, so that there were three {{on either side of the}} carriage.

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with a schoolboy pin. The attacking wrestler holds their opponent from behind in a waistlock. The attacking wrestler then performs a backward roll while holding the waistlock. The opponent ends up <b>on</b> <b>their</b> shoulders with the attacking wrestler <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> top of <b>their</b> legs holding the opponent down. This move is often done when the opponent is leaning on the ropes facing out of the ring and the attacking wrestler would first push forward into the ropes with the waistlock in order to generate faster backward motion. A common heel tactic is to grab the back of the opponents clothing or tights while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> top of them or to use the ropes for leverage, thus making the pin illegal.|$|R

Police confirmed that Faheem was carrying a pistol {{at the time of}} the shooting. [...] According to the investigative officers, when Davis fired at Faizan and Faheem, they were <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> bike in front of his car with their backs towards Davis. Davis shot them through his windshield. After the shooting, Davis is alleged to have exited his car to take pictures and videos of the casualties with his cell phone.
