500|$|Marsh {{made his}} first {{impression}} in the <b>sporting</b> <b>arena</b> as a professional runner, following his brother Larry to the Sydney athletics tracks in 1893.

Aside from his victories in New South Wales, he travelled to race in Queensland and Victoria. As with some other Indigenous runners, Marsh was exploited by his trainer and was suspended for [...] "running stiff" [...] in Sydney in 1895. A more recent study by Max Bonnell has {{come to the conclusion that}} Marsh was a world-class sprinter. He found that The Referee, the leading sports publication in Australia at the time, reported that Marsh had covered 100yd in 9.8s, which was equal to the amateur world record set by American John Owen in 1890. Marsh had also posted a time of 9.9s in the previous year. Eight years later a publication briefly noted that Marsh's time was an Australian record.|$|E
