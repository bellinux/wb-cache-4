In early March 1911, Deutschland again carried Wilhelm II to Helgoland; this trip was followed by fleet exercises in the <b>Skagerrak</b> <b>and</b> <b>Kattegat</b> that month. Deutschland and the rest of the fleet received British and American naval squadrons at Kiel in June and July. The year's autumn maneuvers were confined to the Baltic and the Kattegat, and Deutschland won the Schießpreis a third time. Another fleet review was held during the exercises for a visiting Austro-Hungarian delegation that included Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli. Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Chancellor of Germany, also attended the review, aboard Deutschland. On 1 October, Deutschland was relieved of her tactical assignment to the II Squadron, as the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) authorized the fleet to keep a 17th battleship in commission—the I and II Squadrons comprising eight battleships each, so the fleet could now keep two full squadrons in addition to the flagship.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of biologically differentiated populations has {{been credited with}} {{a major role in}} conferring sustainability and in buffering overall productivity of anadromous fish population complexes where evidence for spatial structure is uncontroversial. Here, we describe evidence of correlated genetic and life history (spawning season linked to spawning location) differentiation in an abundant and highly migratory pelagic fish, Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus, in the North Sea (NS) and adjacent areas. The {{existence of}} genetically and phenotypically diverse stocks in this region despite intense seasonal mixing strongly implicates natal homing in this species. Based on information from genetic markers and otolith morphology, we estimate the proportional contribution by NS, <b>Skagerrak</b> (SKG) <b>and</b> <b>Kattegat</b> <b>and</b> western Baltic (WBS) fish to mixed aggregations targeted by the NS fishery. We use these estimates to identify spatial and temporal differences in life history (migratory behaviour) and habitat use among genetically differentiated migratory populations that mix seasonally. Our study suggests the existence of more complex patterns of intraspecific diversity than was previously recognized. Sustainability may be compromised if such complex patterns are reduced through generalized management (e. g. area closures) that overlooks population differences in spatial use throughout the life cycl...|$|R
50|$|Continuing {{sea level}} rise during the Mastogloia Sea stage {{had the effect}} of {{deepening}} the straits connecting the Baltic with the ocean, thus increasing the influx of salt water into the Baltic. A significant hydrographic shift occurred 8500 years ago, which corresponds to shifts in currents in the <b>Skagerrak,</b> <b>Kattegat</b> <b>and</b> the Norwegian Channel, as they transition to the modern circulation system in the eastern North Sea. This is a consequence of the opening of the English Channel and the Danish straits and increased Atlantic water inflow, and the subsequent development of the South Jutland Current.|$|R
40|$|Background: In marine fish species, where pelagic egg and larvae drift with ocean currents, {{population}} structure {{has been suggested}} to be maintained by larval retention due to hydrographic structuring and by homing of adult fish to natal areas. Whilst natal homing of adults has been demonstrated for anadromous and coral reef fishes, there are few documented examples of philopatric migration in temperate marine fish species. Results: Here, we demonstrate temporally stable genetic differentiation among spawning populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), and present genetic and behavioural evidence for larval drift and philopatric migration in the eastern North Sea‑Skagerrak‑Kattegat area. We show that juvenile cod collected in the eastern <b>Skagerrak</b> <b>and</b> central <b>Kattegat</b> are genetically similar to cod from offshore spawning areas in the eastern North Sea. Genetic assignment of individual 2 – 5 year old fish indicates that cod residing at, or migrating towards, spawning areas in <b>Kattegat</b> <b>and</b> the North Sea display philopatric behaviours. Conclusions: Together these findings suggest a loop between spawning, larval drift and adult return‑migrations to spawning areas and underlines that both oceanographic processes and migratory behaviour in the adult phase may be important for stock separation and integrity in marine temperate fishes such as Atlantic cod...|$|R
