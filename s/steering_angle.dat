5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> must be greater, and when oversteering, the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative <b>steering</b> <b>angle)</b> to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary control}} input that the rider can make {{is to apply}} a torque {{directly}} to the steering mechanism via the handlebars. Because of the bike's own dynamics, due to steering geometry and gyroscopic effects, direct position control over <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> {{has been found to}} be problematic.|$|E
5|$|Several effects {{influence}} the <b>steering</b> <b>angle,</b> the angle {{at which the}} front assembly is rotated about the steering axis, necessary to maintain a steady-state turn. Some of these are unique to single-track vehicles, while others are also experienced by automobiles. Some of these may be mentioned elsewhere in this article, and they are repeated here, though not necessarily in order of importance, {{so that they may}} be found in one place.|$|E
25|$|<b>Steering</b> <b>angles</b> {{are also}} crucial {{as the driver}} progresses. The first stage of these {{modifications}} is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright. Extended control arms can be employed on MacPherson strut vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis, as to allow for more clearance for higher <b>steering</b> <b>angles.</b> Companies like Wisefab, IRP (Individual Racing Parts), Voodoo13, and Parts Shop MAX have developed full lock kits including modification of the vehicle's original scrub radius, kingpin axis, Ackermann angle, amount of bump steer, caster angle, and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> in excess of 60Â°. While MacPherson strut vehicles are prevalent in profession drifting, Double wishbone suspension vehicles can also be competitive, with often better caster and camber curves.|$|R
3000|$|The {{validity}} of criterion C 2, regarding manoeuvre similarity, can be confirmed, {{as there were}} nosignificant differences between any analysed <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angles,</b> <b>steering</b> wheel rates, or SWRRs.There is, however, an apparent difference (not significant) regarding <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> at time [...]...|$|R
5|$|The rider applies {{torque to}} the {{handlebars}} {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At high speeds, small <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> quickly move the ground contact points laterally; at low speeds, larger <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> are required {{to achieve the same}} results in the same amount of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds. As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases the chances that a bike is contributing to its own stability.|$|R
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller <b>steering</b> <b>angle.</b> When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and <b>steering</b> <b>angle,</b> usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, <b>steering</b> <b>angle,</b> fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
40|$|SOLAR sailing {{has long}} been {{considered}} for a diverse range of future mission applications. As with other forms of low-thrust propulsion, trajectory optimization has been a focus of development activities. In particular, minimum-time solar-sail trajectories have been obtained by several authors {{for a range of}} mission applications. Almost all of these studies have used the Pontryagin principle of the calculus of variations to obtain minimum-time trajectories by the classical, indirect method (see, for example, Ref. 2). The indirect approach provides a continuous time history for the required solar sail <b>steering</b> <b>angles.</b> Only a few studies have used the competing direct approach, which recasts the task as a parameter optimization problem by discretizing the control variables. These studies have used many discrete segments for the sail <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> to ensure a close approximation to the continuous <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> provided by the indirect approach and hence a close approximation to the true minimum-time trajector...|$|R

Simulation results show that reference governor designs are effective in avoiding rollover.

25|$|At low speeds countersteering {{is equally}} necessary, but the countersteering is then so subtle {{that it is}} hidden by the {{continuous}} corrections that are made in balancing the bike, often falling below a just noticeable difference or threshold of perception of the rider.

40|$|We {{investigate}} Tx/Rx joint beamforming in millimeter-wave communications (MMWC). As the multipath components (MPCs) {{have different}} <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> and independent fadings, beamforming aims at achieving array gain {{as well as}} diversity gain in this scenario. A sub-optimal beamforming scheme is proposed to find the antenna weight vectors (AWVs) at Tx/Rx via iterative eigenvalue decomposition (EVD), provided that full channel state information (CSI) is available at both the transmitter and receiver. To make this scheme practically feasible in MMWC, a corresponding training approach is suggested to avoid the channel estimation and iterative EVD computation. As in fast fading scenario the training approach may be time-consuming due to frequent training, another beamforming scheme, which exploits the quasi-static <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> in MMWC, is proposed to reduce the overhead and increase the system reliability by multipath grouping (MPG). The scheme first groups the MPCs and then concurrently beamforms towards multiple <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> of the grouped MPCs, so that both array gain and diversity gain are achieved. Performance comparisons show that, compared with the corresponding state-of-the-art schemes, the iterative EVD scheme with the training approach achieves the same performance with a reduced overhead and complexity, while the MPG scheme achieves better performance with an approximately equivalent complexity.

25|$|The {{actual torque}} the rider must {{apply to the}} {{handlebars}} to maintain a steady-state turn is a complex function of bike geometry, mass distribution, rider position, tire properties, turn radius, and forward speed. At low speeds, the steering torque necessary from the rider is usually negative, that is opposite {{the direction of the}} turn, even when the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> is {{in the direction of the}} turn. At higher speeds, the direction of the necessary input torque often becomes positive, that is in the same direction as the turn.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than the}} {{mechanical}} linkages employed in earlier directional-headlamp systems, AFS relies on electronic sensors, transducers and actuators. Other AFS techniques include special auxiliary optical systems within a vehicle's headlamp housings. These auxiliary systems may be switched {{on and off}} as the vehicle and operating conditions call for light or darkness at the angles covered by the beam the auxiliary optics produce. A typical system measures <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and vehicle speed to swivel the headlamps. The most advanced AFS systems use GPS signals to anticipate changes in road curvature, rather than simply reacting to them.|$|E

In order for it to be successful, the tractor must be able to follow deterministic tasks (a task that is defined before it starts, such as a path to follow on a field), have reactive behavior (the ability to react to an unknown situation such as an obstacle in the way), and have reflexive responses (making a decision without hesitation or time consuming calculations such as changing the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> if necessary). Ultimately, the tractor should imitate a human in its ability to observe spatial position and make decisions such as speed.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{planning}} and autonomous execution of a single-trajectory, velocity-independent, parallel parking manoeuvre for autonomous vehicles is presented. The procedure commences with the identification and pre-selection of a smooth sigmoidal trajectory known as the Gompertz curve in parametric format. Trajectory parameters are determined in real-time during the path-planning phase using an optimization scheme in order to generate a candidate path. The optimization scheme {{takes into account the}} maximum <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> that can be physically realized and checks the generated candidate trajectory for collisions. Thereafter, the trajectory is reparametrized to arc-length format using the cubic interpolation method and the vehicle orientation at every point of the trajectory is deduced.

In the final step, the vehicle uses dead-reckoning to follows the arc-length parametrized path in reverse in order to park itself in a single-manoeuvre.
