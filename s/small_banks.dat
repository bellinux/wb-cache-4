5|$|Government policy {{designed}} to promote affordable housing, widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation's history since the Great Depression. Barack Obama, the first African American and multiracial president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act {{in an attempt to}} mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements and a relative decline in unemployment. Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there is evidence it may have had a negative impact on <b>small</b> <b>banks.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{a unique}} {{database}} {{to test the}} effect of ATM surcharges on larger versus <b>smaller</b> <b>banks.</b> Only nonbank ("foreign") users of ATMs pay ATM surcharges. Customers thus face incentives to switch accounts from <b>smaller</b> <b>banks</b> to larger banks {{in order to avoid}} high ATM surcharges. We find that, after we control for other bank factors, higher ATM surcharges result in a greater market share of deposits of larger banks and a lower market share for <b>smaller</b> <b>banks,</b> results that are consistent with customer switching. However, <b>smaller</b> <b>banks</b> can positively affect their market share by establishing larger ATM networks. ...|$|R

Although the deposit insurance provisions of the 1933 Banking Act were very controversial, and drew veto threats from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President Roosevelt supported the Glass–Steagall provisions separating commercial and investment banking, and Representative Steagall included those provisions in his House bill that differed from Senator Glass's Senate bill primarily in its deposit insurance provisions. Steagall insisted on protecting <b>small</b> <b>banks</b> while Glass felt that <b>small</b> <b>banks</b> were the weakness to U.S. banking.|$|E

40|$|With some of {{the largest}} mergers in history now taking place in the {{financial}} services industry, the fact that consolidation is also occurring among <b>small</b> <b>banking</b> institutions is often overlooked. The factors that are promoting consolidation in the banking industry are also relevant for the <b>smallest</b> <b>banks,</b> namely the need to spread the cost of technological and administrative overhead and the desire to maintain earnings growth. With limited growth opportunities in many rural communities, <b>smaller</b> <b>banks</b> often choose to merge with other nearby rural banks as the means to gain asset size and improve efficiency.; Using a case study approach that focuses on nineteen rural banks that participated in in-market mergers, this article examines whether <b>smaller</b> community <b>banks</b> that followed this merger strategy realized efficiency gains. The results show that such mergers have usually been successful from both a profitability and a cost efficiency perspective. Further, these gains were typically achieved without closing branch offices. These successes are important to rural bankers as they seek opportunities for consolidation. They are also important from a public policy perspective and should be carefully considered by regulators in their evaluation of <b>small</b> <b>bank</b> mergers. Bank mergers...|$|R
25|$|The Great Depression {{devastated the}} American banking system. There was {{widespread}} panic over the American banking system; {{in the years}} before the FDIC's creation, more than one-third of all banks failed due to bank runs. <b>Small</b> <b>banks</b> in rural areas were especially affected. Reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors' fears. Many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearly-insolvent banks.|$|E
25|$|Associated Press {{reported}} that {{in response to the}} costs that the legislation places on banks, some banks have ended the practice of giving their customers free checking. <b>Small</b> <b>banks</b> have been forced to end some businesses such as mortgages and car loans in response to the new regulations. The size of regulatory compliance teams has grown. The Heritage Foundation, calling attention to the new ability of borrowers to sue lenders for misjudging their ability to repay a loan, predicted that smaller lenders would be forced to exit the mortgage market due to increased risk. One study has shown that smaller banks have been hurt by the regulations of the Dodd–Frank Act. Community banks' share of the US banking assets and lending market fell from over 40% in 1994 to around 20% today, although this is a misleading at best but highly likely inaccurate number considering the Dodd-Frank was implemented 16 years later than 1994. These experts believe that regulatory barriers fall most heavily on <b>small</b> <b>banks,</b> even though legislators intended to target large financial institutions.|$|E
25|$|Banking {{institutions}} in the United States are required to hold reservesamounts of currency and deposits in other banksequal to {{only a fraction of}} the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called fractional-reserve banking. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a lender of last resort when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following Milton Friedman, believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to <b>small</b> <b>banks</b> during the bank runs of 1929.|$|E
