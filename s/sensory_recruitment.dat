40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that visual {{features}} are stored in working memory (WM) via <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> or sustained stimulus-specific patterns of activity in cortical regions that encode memoranda. One important question concerns the spatial extent of <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment.</b> One possibility is that <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> is restricted to neurons that are retinotopically mapped to the positions occupied by the remembered items. Alternatively, specific feature values could be represented via a spatially global recruitment of neurons that encode the remembered feature, regardless of the retinotopic position of the remembered stimulus. Here, we evaluated these alternatives by requiring subjects to remember the orientation of a grating presented in {{the left or right}} visual field. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivoxel pattern analysis were then used to examine feature-specific activations in early visual regions during memory maintenance. Activation patterns that discriminated the remembered feature were found in regions of contralateral visual cortex that corresponded to the retinotopic position of the remembered item, as well as in ipsilateral regions that were not retinotopically mapped to the position of the stored stimulus. These results suggest that visual details are held in WM through a spatially global recruitment of early sensory cortex. This spatially global recruitment may enhance memory precision by facilitating robust population coding of the store...|$|E
40|$|Recent neuroimaging {{studies suggest}} that early sensory areas such as area V 1 are {{recruited}} to actively maintain a selected feature of the item held in visual short-term memory (VSTM). These findings raise the possibility that visual attention operates in similar manners across perceptual and memory representations to a certain extent, despite memory-level and perception-level selections are functionally dissociable. If VSTM operates by retaining “reasonable copies ” of scenes constructed during sensory processing (Serences et al., 2009, p. 207, the <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> hypothesis), then {{it is possible that}} selective attention can be guided by both exogenous (peripheral) and endogenous (central) cues during VSTM maintenance. Yet, the results from the previous studies that examined this issue are inconsistent. In the present study, we investigated whether attention can be directed to a specific item’s location represented in VSTM with the exogenous cue in a well-controlled setting. The results from the four experiments suggest that, as observed with the endogenous cue, the exogenous cue can efficiently guide selective attention during VSTM maintenance. The finding is not only consistent with the <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> hypothesis but also validates the legitimacy of th...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> {{models of}} working memory assume that {{information}} storage is {{mediated by the}} same cortical areas {{that are responsible for}} the perceptual processing of sensory signals. To test this assumption, we measured somatosensory event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during a tactile delayed match-to-sample task. Participants memorized a tactile sample set at one task-relevant hand to compare it with a subsequent test set on the same hand. During the retention period, a sustained negativity (tactile contralateral delay activity, tCDA) was elicited over primary somatosensory cortex contralateral to the relevant hand. The amplitude of this component increased with memory load and was sensitive to individual limitations in memory capacity, suggesting that the tCDA reflects the maintenance of tactile information in somatosensory working memory. The tCDA was preceded by a transient negativity (N 2 cc component) with a similar contralateral scalp distribution, which is likely to reflect selection of task-relevant tactile stimuli at the encoding stage. The temporal sequence of N 2 cc and tCDA components mirrors previous observations from ERP studies of working memory in vision. The finding that the sustained somatosensory delay period activity varies as a function of memory load supports a <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> model for spatial working memory in touch...|$|E
40|$|SummaryVisuomotor {{circuits}} filter {{visual information}} and {{determine whether or}} not to engage downstream motor modules to produce behavioral outputs. However, the circuit mechanisms that mediate and link perception of salient stimuli to execution of an adaptive response are poorly understood. We combined a virtual hunting assay for tethered larval zebrafish with two-photon functional calcium imaging to simultaneously monitor neuronal activity in the optic tectum during naturalistic behavior. Hunting responses showed mixed selectivity for combinations of visual features, specifically stimulus size, speed, and contrast polarity. We identified a subset of tectal neurons with similar highly selective tuning, which show non-linear mixed selectivity for visual features and are likely to mediate the perceptual recognition of prey. By comparing neural dynamics in the optic tectum during response versus non-response trials, we discovered premotor population activity that specifically preceded initiation of hunting behavior and exhibited anatomical localization that correlated with motor variables. In summary, the optic tectum contains non-linear mixed selectivity neurons that are likely to mediate reliable detection of ethologically relevant <b>sensory</b> stimuli. <b>Recruitment</b> of small tectal assemblies appears to link perception to action by providing the premotor commands that release hunting responses. These findings allow us to propose a model circuit for the visuomotor transformations underlying a natural behavior...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} morphologic {{and functional}} modifications of the ulnar nerve at the wrist in {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} (CTS) after carpal tunnel release (CTR). Methods: Ultrasonography was used to study the cross sectional area (CSA) of the ulnar nerve at Guyon’s canal, before and 1 and 6 months after CTR, in 18 CTS patients. A parallel electrophysiological and clinical analysis was also conducted. Results: CSA of the ulnar nerve significantly increased 6 months after CTR. Ten (55 %) cases showed abnormal CSA values compared to a control group before surgery and five (28 %) at 6 month follow-up. In addition, there were improvements in the motor and <b>sensory</b> ulnar axon <b>recruitment</b> properties and the conduction values in sensory ulnar fibres. Patients with extra-median distribution of paresthesia (4 subjects) were free from symptoms. Conclusions: CTR has a significant effect {{not only on the}} anatomical geometry of Guyon’s canal, but also on the morphology and function of the ulnar nerve. Significance: In CTS, high pressure in the carpal tunnel may result in anatomical changes of ulnar nerve, thus causing functional impairment to the ulnar fibres. CTR appears to reverse some of this damage...|$|R
40|$|Every second {{throughout}} life, cortical circuitry efficiently compresses and interprets huge {{volumes of}} incoming sensory information. This high fidelity sensory processing guides normal brain development and {{is essential for}} animals’ successful interaction with the environment. Low-level sensory perceptual disturbance is nearly ubiquitous in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but despite the potential to offer crucial insight into the abnormal development of higher brain function is poorly understood. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) {{is the most common}} heritable cause of ASD. Previous studies in the Fmr 1 -KO mouse model of FXS report cell-intrinsic, synaptic and local connectivity abnormalities in the neuronal physiology of primary sensory cortices. This suggests that sensory perceptual dysfunction could emerge from interacting circuit-wide pathophysiology to impair neural adaptations that support high fidelity sensory information processing. However, there is little mechanistic consensus about how this might occur. To address this, in this thesis I use brain slice electrophysiology and computer modelling to provide a bottom-up description of how thalamocortical (TC) responses, the principal cortical input for ascending sensory information, are mis-interpreted in the somatosensory Layer 4 (L 4) circuit in Fmr 1 -KOs at a crucial developmental transition to active <b>sensory</b> processing. <b>Recruitment</b> of intracortical L 4 network activity could be atypically evoked by lower frequency thalamic stimulation in Fmr 1 -KO slices. Furthermore, profound alterations to single-cell and network response dynamics were observed, in particular loss of spike timing precision considered critical for sensory circuit performance. These network phenomena were supported by interacting single-cell and local circuitry pathophysiology, including hyperexcitable cortical neurons and temporally distorted feed forward and feedback inhibition. Together, these data demonstrate cortical hypersensitivity to TC inputs and abnormal recruitment of network activity in critical period Fmr 1 -KO somatosensory cortical circuits. The hyperresponsiveness of intracortical circuitry may underlie tactile hyperexcitability and distorted sensory perception in FXS patients. Interestingly, modelling suggests that many of the alterations of synaptic and neuronal function are compensatory, thus minimizing the impact of the genetic lesion. Thus, this study shows {{for the first time that}} circuit level dysfunction emerges in the Fmr 1 -KO mouse from an accumulation of effects at the synaptic and cellular level; however, it also highlights the challenge of understanding which of these changes are pathological and which are compensatory...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that the {{temporary}} storage of visual detail in working memory is mediated by <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> or sustained patterns of stimulus-specific activation within featureselective regions of visual cortex.

WeusedfMRIandaforward encoding model to characterize population-level orientationselective responses in visual cortex while human participants held an oriented grating in memory. This analysis, which enables a precise quantitative description of multivoxel, population-level activity measured during working memory storage, revealed graded response profiles whose amplitudes were greatest for the remembered orientation and fell monotonically as the angular distance from this orientation increased. Moreover, interparticipant differences in the dispersion—but not the amplitude—of these response profiles were strongly correlated with performance on a concurrent memory recall task. These findings provide important new evidence linking the precision of sustained populationlevel responses in visual cortex and memory acuity. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: V 1 {{is known}} to contain neurons tuned to visual {{low-level}} features such as spatial frequencies and orientation. Psychophysical studies using delayed discrimination experiments have shown that these features can be retained in memory with high fidelity. According to the <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> model of working memory, visual working memory recruits the perceptual areas involved in discriminating the features {{that is to be}} retained. If this is the case, V 1 -neurons tuned to spatial frequencies should be recruited when information along this dimension is retained in memory. We tested this hypothesis taking advantage of the memory masking effect. METHOD: We used fMRI to measure BOLD responses while participants performed a delayed discrimination task for spatial frequencies. While performing the discrimination task, the participants had to retain spatial frequency information about an irrelevant masker stimulus. The mask differentially interfered with discrimination accuracy on the main task, and this memory masking effect was used to probe early visual areas for differential BOLD modulation related to the masking effect. In one experiment we presented the mask and the sample stimulus to be remembered in the same retinotopic position, and in a second experiment the mask and sample were spatially separated, allowing us to investigate the spatial extent of the low-level memory representation. Early visual areas were identified using a retinotopic mapping procedure, and ROIs retinotopically coding stimuli positions were defined for each visual area in an independent localizer session. RESULTS: When the mask and sample stimulus were presented to the same retinotopic position, the mask impaired discrimination accuracy when it differed in spatial frequency from the sample stimulus. This memory masking effect was observed as a reduced BOLD response in V 1. When spatially separating the mask and sample stimulus, we found no significant decrease in BOLD activation in V 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that neurons in V 1 involved in the perceptual coding of spatial frequencies are recruited during memory of the same information, in accordance with the <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> model of visual working memory. The memory masking effect is proposed to result from cross-channel inhibition, and is a local process in the retinotopically organized visual cortex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Recent neuroimaging {{studies suggest}} that mainte-nance of a {{selected}} object feature held in visual short-term/ working memory (VSTM/VWM) {{is supported by the}} same neural mechanisms that encode the sensory information. If VSTM operates by retaining “reasonable copies ” of scenes constructed during sensory processing (Serences, Ester, Vogel, & Awh, 2009, p. 207, the <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> hypothesis), then attention should be able to select multiple items represented in VSTM as long as the number of these attended items does not exceed the typical VSTM capacity. It is well known that attention can select at least two noncontig-uous locations at the same time during sensory processing. However, empirical reports from the studies that examined this possibility are inconsistent. In the present study, we dem-onstrate that (1) attention can indeed select more than a single item during VSTM maintenance when observers are asked to recognize a set of items in the manner that these items were originally attended, and (2) attention can select multiple cued items regardless of whether these items are perceptually orga-nized into a single group (contiguous locations) or not (non-contiguous locations). The results also replicate and extend the recent finding that selective attention that operates during VSTM maintenance is sensitive to the observers ’ goal and motivation to use the cueing information...|$|E
40|$|Background. WHO’s {{recommendation}} of HbA 1 c≥ 48 [*]mmol/mol (6. 5 %) as diagnostic for {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) was adopted by three UK London boroughs in May 2012. The South London Diabetes (SOUL-D) study has recruited people with newly diagnosed T 2 DM since 2008. We compared participants diagnosed before May 2012 with HbA 1 c< 48 [*]mmol/mol to those with diagnostic HbA 1 c≥ 48 [*]mmol/mol. Methods. A prospective cohort study of newly diagnosed T 2 DM participants from 96 primary care practices, comparing demographic and biomedical variables between those with diagnostic HbA 1 c< 48 [*]mmol/mol or HbA 1 c≥ 48 [*]mmol/mol at recruitment and after one year. Results. Of 1488 participants, 22. 8 % had diagnostic HbA 1 c< 48 [*]mmol/mol. They were older {{and more likely to}} be white (p< 0. 05). At recruitment and one year, there were no between-group differences in the prevalence of diabetic complications, except that those diagnosed with HbA 1 c< 48 [*]mmol/mol had more <b>sensory</b> neuropathy at <b>recruitment</b> (p= 0. 039) and, at one year, had new myocardial infarction (p= 0. 012) but less microalbuminuria (p= 0. 012). Conclusions. Use of HbA 1 c≥ 48 [*]mmol/mol as the sole T 2 DM diagnostic criterion may miss almost a quarter of those previously diagnosed in South London yet HbA 1 c< 48 [*]mmol/mol may not exclude clinically important diabetes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—Working memory (WM) {{involves}} maintaining {{information in}} an on-line state. One emerging {{view is that}} information in WM is maintained via <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment,</b> such that information is stored via sustained activity in the sensory areas that encode the to-be-remembered information. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we observed that key sensory regions such as primary visual cortex (V 1) showed little evidence of sustained increases in mean activation during a WM delay period, though such amplitude increases have typically been used {{to determine whether a}} region is involved in on-line maintenance. However, a multivoxel pattern analysis of delay-period activity revealed a sustained pattern of activation in V 1 that represented only the intentionally stored feature of a multifeature object. Moreover, the pattern of delay activity was qualitatively similar to that observed during the discrimination of sensory stimuli, suggesting that WM representations in V 1 are reasonable ‘‘copies’ ’ of those evoked during pure sensory processing. Working memory (WM) allows the on-line storage of behaviorally relevant information. One emerging view is that WM is supported by the same neural mechanisms that encode the sensory information being remembered (we term this the sensoryrecruitment model of WM; see Awh & Jonides, 2001; D’Esposito, 2007; Jonides, Lacey, & Nee, 2005; Postle, 2006). For example, neurons in face-selective regions of inferotemporal cortex show sustained amplitude increases while an observer is holding a fac...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{working memory}} (VWM) {{is used to}} {{maintain}} visual information available for subsequent goal-directed behavior. The content of VWM {{has been shown to}} affect the behavioral response to concurrent visual input, suggesting that visual representations originating from VWM and from sensory input draw upon a shared neural substrate (i. e., a <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> stance on VWM storage). Here, we hypothesized that visual information maintained in VWM would enhance the neural response to concurrent visual input that matches the content of VWM. To test this hypothesis, we measured fMRI BOLD responses to task-irrelevant stimuli acquired from 15 human participants (three males) performing a concurrent delayed match-to-sample task. In this task, observers were sequentially presented with two shape stimuli and a retro-cue indicating which of the two shapes should be memorized for subsequent recognition. During the retention interval, a task-irrelevant shape (the probe) was briefly presented in the peripheral visual field, which could either match or mismatch the shape category of the memorized stimulus. We show that this probe stimulus elicited a stronger BOLD response, and allowed for increased shape-classification performance, when it matched rather than mismatched the concurrently memorized content, despite identical visual stimulation. Our results demonstrate that VWM enhances the neural response to concurrent visual input in a content-specific way. This finding is consistent with the view that neural populations involved in sensory processing are recruited for VWM storage, and it provides a common explanation for a plethora of behavioral studies in which VWM-matching visual input elicits a stronger behavioral and perceptual response...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{established}} {{the role of}} Visual Short-Term Memory (VSTM) load in visual detection while comparing to the roles of perceptual load and Working Memory (WM) cognitive control load. Participants performed a short-term memory task combined with a visual detection task (as well as attention task, Chapter 2) during the memory delay. The level and type of load was varied (perceptual load, VSTM load or WM cognitive control load). Measures of detection sensitivity demonstrated that increased VSTM load and perceptual load have both resulted in impaired detection sensitivity that was of equivalent magnitude. In contrast, increased WM cognitive control load had either no effect on detection or under some conditions (when the detection task was combined with an attention task of higher priority) resulted in enhanced detection sensitivity, the opposite effect to VSTM load. The contrasting effects {{of different types of}} memory load rule out alternative accounts in terms of general task difficulty. Other interpretations in terms of changes in attention deployment, response bias, task priorities, verbal strategies, were also ruled out. These VSTM load effects lasted over delays of 4 seconds, were generalized to foveal, parafoveal and peripheral stimuli, and were shown to be predicted from estimates of the effects of load on VSTM capacity. fMRI results (Chapter 4) showed that high VSTM load reduces retinotopic V 1 responses to the detection stimulus and psychophysics experiments (Chapter 5) showed that high VSTM load resulted in reduced effective contrast of the detection stimulus. These results in this thesis clarify the distinct roles of WM maintenance processes from those of WM cognitive control process in visual detection. These findings provide further support to the <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> hypothesis of VSTM, clarify previous discrepancies in WM research and extend load theory to account for the effects of VSTM load on visual detection...|$|E
