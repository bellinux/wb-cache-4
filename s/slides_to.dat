5|$|More complex {{parts are}} formed using more complex moulds. These may have {{sections}} called slides, that {{move into a}} cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, the slides are {{pulled away from the}} plastic part by using stationary “angle pins” on the stationary mould half. These pins enter a slot in the slides and cause the <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The part is then ejected and the mould closes. The closing action of the mould causes the <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> move forward along the angle pins.|$|E

25|$|A Slide Away Bed {{is a type}} of {{sofa bed}} that <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> the wall to form a sofa. The {{mattress}} is hinged to form a seating surface and back support. The bed frame support is a telescoping frame that allows the bed platform to recess below the seating cushion. The primitive version of the slide away bed was co-invented by Manning Lane, Warren J. Hauck and Roy O. Sweeney of Cincinnati, Ohio. U.S. patent #4,204,287 was filed on September 5, 1978 and issued on May 27, 1980.|$|E

He began leading hikes into the area, presenting slide shows of the landscape, and having participants write postcards to government leaders asking for their support. He also brought his photos and <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> the Park District headquarters, interesting the staff and allying himself with local officials who would later hire him for a variety of projects. Eventually, the area was preserved as the first addition to Morgan Territory Regional Preserve in more than a decade.|$|E

25|$|April 14, 1993: The {{pilot of}} American Airlines Flight 102, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, {{registration}} number N139AA, lost directional control during a crosswind landing in rainy conditions and caused the jetliner to slide off runway 17L after arriving from Honolulu, Hawaii. The craft dug into deep mud alongside the runway, collapsing the {{nose landing gear}} and tearing off the left-hand engine {{and much of the}} left wing. A fire in the left-hand wheel well was rapidly extinguished by firefighters who arrived almost immediately from the nearby DFW/DPS Fire Station. 2 passengers suffered serious injuries while using the evacuation <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> escape from the steeply tilted fuselage; the remaining 187 passengers and all 13 crew evacuated in relative safety, but the aircraft was a total loss.|$|E
25|$|Mokattam {{village is}} {{situated}} {{at the foot of}} the Mokattam mountains, which has proven to be a precarious geographic location. In 1993, there was a rockslide from Mokattam Mountain, which fell near the bordering area of the Zabbaleen settlement, resulting in the deaths of 40 people. More recently, in 2008, another rock slide from the Mokattam hills killed more than 100 people in El-Duweiqa, another shantytown in the Mokattam district. These rock slides have brought attention to the precarious location of shantytowns located below the Mokattam mountains as well as to the Zabbaleen. Some attribute these frequent rock <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> various development and construction activities on Mokattam Mountain's upper plateau on which the upper middle class residential district of Mokattam City is located.|$|E
25|$|As {{the angle}} of bank θ {{approaches}} 90°, the tangent function approaches infinity, allowing larger values for |v|2/r. In words, this equation states that for faster speeds (bigger |v|) the road must be banked more steeply (a larger value for θ), and for sharper turns (smaller r) the road also must be banked more steeply, which accords with intuition. When the angle θ does not satisfy the above condition, the horizontal component of force exerted by the road does not provide the correct centripetal force, and an additional frictional force tangential to the road surface is called upon to provide the difference. If friction cannot do this (that is, the coefficient of friction is exceeded), the ball <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> a different radius where the balance can be realized.|$|E

25|$|Season 3 saw Fox {{take more}} {{control of the}} show, moving {{production}} from Vancouver to Los Angeles. This was described in the show by {{a change in the}} functionality of the timer which previously had kept their <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> the geographic area around San Francisco to extend that range to over 400 miles, including Los Angeles. Fox also set a more action-oriented tone to the series, often based on ideas popularized by current films at the time, such as a tornado-themed episode inspired by Twister and a dinosaur-themed episode inspired by Jurassic Park. The show also for the first time included mystical elements, instead of all events being explained purely by science. The network appointed crew members more amenable to their views, most notably executive producer David Peckinpah. During this time, Rhys-Davies expressed a lack of interest in continuing his role, and eventually he was dismissed from the series by Fox. Within the show, Professor Arturo discovers he has acquired a terminal disease; he not only informs Quinn but helps him {{come to terms with the}} inevitable loss.|$|E
500|$|Worsley also {{conducted}} lecturing tours for income, his profile enhanced by his publication record. As sailing commissions {{at this late}} stage of his life were in short supply, his lectures became more important {{as a source of}} income. He mainly lectured on his voyages with Shackleton, whose wife lent Worsley several of her late husband's <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> enhance his talks. [...] In later years, he added talks on his own voyages to his repertoire. His lectures were well received with glowing reviews in local newspapers. His profile was boosted following his appearance in the film South, released in 1933, for which he provided an accent-free narration. The film was based on Frank Hurley's cine film of the Endurance expedition, intercut with photographic slides. He made an onscreen appearance in the film, showing the audience several artefacts from the expedition. Like his books, the film was very well received.|$|E
500|$|Propaganda and {{censorship}} {{were closely}} linked during the war. The {{need to maintain}} morale and counter German propaganda was recognised early in {{the war and the}} War Propaganda Bureau was established under the leadership of Charles Masterman in [...] The Bureau enlisted eminent writers such as H G Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling as well as newspaper editors. [...] Until its abolition in 1917, the department published 300 books and pamphlets in 21 languages, distributed over 4,000 propaganda photographs every week, and circulated maps, cartoons, and lantern <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> the media. [...] Masterman also commissioned films about the war such as The Battle of the Somme, which appeared in , while the battle was still in progress as a morale-booster and in general it met with a favourable reception. The Times reported on [...] 1916 that [...] "Crowded audiences... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them, and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents, opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in Picardy".|$|E

[...] "I was hearing two guitars, and {{it took a long time}} to actually realise he was doing it all by himself," [...] said Richards, who later stated that [...] "Robert Johnson was like an orchestra all by himself."

2500|$|Pousseur {{published}} {{a response to}} Berio in which he rejected the validity of separately criticising the music and text, in part because Butor's ideas strongly influenced his musical decisions {{and in part because}} some of the musical ideas actually emanated from Butor himself [...] On the other hand, he admitted there had been [...] "lack of a spirit of collaboration" [...] with the directors of the production, generated by what he felt was [...] "a total lack of respect" [...] for his and Butor's work, and a [...] "total misunderstanding" [...] of it. Pousseur also felt they were unable to deal with the auditory aspect of the opera, due to [...] "a total lack of effort through the entire year prior to the beginning of rehearsals", and indicted the directors' neglect of the visual aspects of the opera, manifested by choosing a production designer only at the last moment, so {{that he did not have}} the time even to read the libretto. [...] "Michel Butor gave him a list of <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> prepare" [...] and, though the score and libretto prescribe exactly where and how they are to be used, [...] "this was not taken into account, the projections were used in the greatest disorder and, once more, with the greatest liberty, which took away every significant function of the temporal architecture envisaged by the authors" [...]|$|E
