Standard procedures to take advantage of rapid IR heating for <b>solutionizing</b> are not currently available. Thus, a primary objective of this work was to determine optimum <b>solutionizing</b> cycles for two aluminum alloys; AA 2618 and AA 6061. Laboratory experiments on aluminum coupons were performed to establish time/temperature <b>solutionizing</b> data for each alloy.

The selection of optimum <b>solutionizing</b> temperature range for microalloyed steel grades is of utmost importance as it can significantly reduce energy consumption. Reheating studies were carried out on two different micro-alloyed steel grades (strip samples) containing Niobium. The reheating temperature range and the effect of Niobium content on the final properties of the steel were established by performing a series of quench and temper experiments, followed by hardness testing. A different set of samples (of the same grades) were subjected to heating in a controlled atmosphere (Nitrogen atmosphere) to mark the differences as compared to heating in open (air) atmosphere. Hardness variation across the strip width was also tested. Microstructural analysis was done using SEM and EDX for further investigation of the results obtained. For both grades (and for both cases of heating in open and nitrogen atmosphere), hardness increased with an increase in <b>solutionizing</b> temperature. Also, at a particular <b>solutionizing</b> temperature, the hardness value was higher for the grade containing greater niobium content. This effect {{can be attributed to the}} increasing fraction of Niobium that dissolves into the solution (matrix) with increasing <b>solutionizing</b> temperature. However, after a particular temperature range, increasing the <b>solutionizing</b> temperature does not significantly increase the hardness, indicating the saturation of Nb levels in the solution...|$|E

Precipitation and dissolution events observed by microcalorimetry and TEM have been related {{to changes in the}} yield strength during ageing of these alloys. Two types of precipitation mechanisms have been observed: precipitates were formed heterogeneously on dislocation loops and helices, but a homogeneous precipitation sequence in the matrix occurred as well. It has been shown that a long (30 min at 525 degrees C) <b>solutionizing</b> treatment favours more the homogeneous precipitation sequence. After a short (10 s at 525 degrees C) <b>solutionizing</b> treatment a more extensive heterogeneous precipitation on dislocations has been observed. In both cases, the rapid initial hardening of the alloy is attributed mainly to cluster - dislocation interactions. The peak of hardness which, after a short <b>solutionizing</b> treatment, is caused by the homogeneous precipitation of S' phase is rather modest compared to the one after a long <b>solutionizing</b> treatment.

40|$|Samples {{belonging}} to {{four different designs}} of afterburner flaps, available in the as-cast, <b>solutionized</b> and aged conditions, underwent 4 -point bend testing to fracture to investigate straightening. The average maximum load values of the second design samples in the as-cast, <b>solutionized</b> and aged conditions were respectively 33 kN, 29 kN and 27 kN. Regarding the fourth design samples, the average maximum load for the as-cast, <b>solutionized</b> and aged conditions were respectively 23 kN, 28 kN, and 25 kN. The other parameter measured during testing was the maximum extension at fracture. All as-cast samples {{belonging to}} the second design fractured at values between 5 and 7 mm, while all aged samples fractured at values between 4 and 6 mm. Independently of the design, most <b>solutionized</b> samples did not fracture at an extension of 9 mm or below; for such samples, 9 mm was the value used as the maximum extension. One-way ANOVA statistical analysis performed on the maximum extension data set revealed that design {{did not have a}} significant effect on maximum extension data. This analysis also revealed a significant difference between the <b>solutionized</b> and aged conditions among the two designs, from which it was extrapolated that it is optimal to straighten in the <b>solutionized</b> condition opposed to the aged. The same analysis was performed on the maximum load data set but was inconclusive due to the mean maximum load value of the as-cast condition being the highest value for Design 2 and the lowest value for Design 4. A hardness test was performed to determine the relative positioning of the maximum load data based on heat treatment condition. Due to a positive correlation between hardness and maximum load, it was expected that the ranking of the heat treatment conditions would start with aged as the highest value, then as-cast, followed by <b>solutionized.</b> Neither the maximum load data set for Design 2 nor 4 followed this trend; however, it was observed that while design played a significant role for the as-cast condition, it did not play a significant role for the <b>solutionized</b> and aged conditions.

The heating {{rate in the}} fluidized bed is greater than in conventional air convective furnaces. Particle size analyses of eutectic Si showed that the high heating rate during fluidized bed solution heat treatment causes faster fragmentation and spherodization of Si particles compared to conventional air convective furnaces. The mechanism of Si fragmentation through fluidized bed processing is through both brittle fracture and neck formation and its propagation. In contrast to this, the mechanism of Si fragmentation using a conventional air convective furnace is through neck formation and propagation. The Sr-modified D 357 alloy showed a faster spherodizing rate than the unmodified alloy. Thermal analyses showed an exothermic reaction during solution heat treatment using a fluidized bed due to recrystallization, and coarsening of eutectic Al grains.

Carbide particles at the grain boundaries were equal size, averaging 13. 0 μm in diameter. The low ductility samples contained an average of twelve particles per 250 μm of grain boundary, high ductility samples contained an average of only four particles along the same grain boundary length.

The experimental {{results show that the}} oxidation resistance is improved by La addition. The mechanism of the reactive-element effect (REE) exhibits some difference at various oxidation temperatures. The REE is dependent on the <b>solutionized</b> La content when the alloy is oxidized at 1 000 °C. The dispersed LaCrO 3 segregates on the grain boundaries of Cr-oxides, and hence the diffusion of metallic ions, e. g., Mn 2 + and Cr 3 +, are prevented. The oxidation resistance decreases with the increase of La content. However, the REE ascribes not only to the <b>solutionized</b> La, but also to the La-Ni intermetallic phases, when the alloy is oxidized at 1 100 °C. The oxidation resistance is influenced by two effects: firstly, the formation of the dispersed La 2 O 3 from the <b>solutionized</b> La on the grain boundary of Cr-oxides reduces the oxidation rate, and secondly, the aggregation of the La-O oxides from the large amount of La-Ni phases accelerates the oxidation process.

The Mg- 2 Ca alloy exhibited the highest corrosion rate when compared with pure Mg and Mg- 2 Ca- 1 Zn for any length of immersion time. For short immersion times (48 hours), <b>solutionizing</b> followed by natural aging reduced the corrosion rate of Mg- 2 Ca alloy, but this heat treatment did not seem to {{have an effect on the}} corrosion rate of Mg- 2 Ca- 1 Zn alloy.

40|$|In this study, {{the solid}} {{particle}} erosion behavior of <b>solutionized,</b> artificially aged (T 6) and annealed aluminum alloy AA 7075 has been investigated. The samples were eroded in solid particle erosion test equipment at 45 impingement angle and 75 m/s impingement velocity with 180 mesh garnet erodent particles. Afterwards, mi-crostructures of <b>solutionized,</b> artificially aged and annealed samples of AA 7075 alloy were analyzed. In order {{to figure out}} the effect of ductility on erosion rates, the Brinell hardness of the samples was measured. The sur-face morphology images of the samples were taken before and after the erosion test by using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The effects of the microstructures and the hardness on the erosion behavior of the different heat treated specimens were examined. Finally, SEM images of the samples were deeply analyzed and the erosion mechanisms which occurred on the surfaces of the samples were discussed...|$|R

The {{effects of}} {{quenching}} rate on the microstructures and mechanical {{properties of the}} heat treatable Mg- 4. 2 Y- 2. 3 Nd- 1. 0 Gd- 0. 6 Zr (wt. %) (WE 43) sand-cast alloy have been studied {{using a combination of}} mechanical testing, Vickers hardness testing, optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Two quenching conditions, either air quenching or 60 ℃ water quenching, were employed. The results indicate that some precipitates have formed in the matrix and grain boundaries in the air-quenched <b>solutionized</b> alloy. And the Vickers hardness and yield strength (YS) is HV 77 and 155 MPa, respectively, which is slightly more than the 60 ℃ water-quenched <b>solutionized</b> alloy. However, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) of the peak-aged at 250 ℃ (T 6) of the two quenching conditions are both 273 MPa and 212 MPa, respectively. And they have similar age hardening curves at 250 ℃ and the T 6 microstructure. So the results indicate that in this work of quenching rate range WE 43 alloy has few quench sensitivity effect...|$|R
40|$|The work {{carried out}} in this thesis was {{conducted}} to investigate thermomechanical aspects of a steel-aluminum cold roll bonded material. The objective was to study different production parameters related to ageing of an AA 6082 aluminum alloy, combined with IF steel, through a cold roll bonding process. Three different sequences of <b>solutionizing,</b> ageing, and cold roll bonding of the materials were tested. Sheets of steel and aluminum, measuring 30 x 120 mm, were used to produce the samples. Each sheet measured roughly 1 mm in thickness, and were stacked {{together to form a}} three layered composite, with aluminum in the middle and steel on either side. The sheets were prepared by scratch brushing, and were roll bonded at pre-heat temperatures of 150, 200, & 300 ^oC. Three different sequences were used for heat treating the aluminum; The BSA samples were roll bonded, followed by <b>solutionizing</b> and ageing to T 6. The SBA samples were solutionized, roll bonded, and then aged to T 6. The SAB samples were solutionized and aged to T 6, followed by roll bonding. The three sequences were meant to determine the optimal way of producing a precipitation hardened structure in the aluminum, while still achieving a good bond to the steel. The cold roll bonded samples were cut into sections and studied through several microstructural and mechanical characterization methods. Optical and scanning electron microscopes were used to study the aluminum grain structure, and the roll bonded interface. A peel testing rig was designed and built to allow for peel testing of the composites with at 90 degree peeling direction. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to study the resulting fracture surfaces, to determine the amount of residual material left on each surface. In summary, the SAB samples were found to produce the greatest bond strengths, followed by the SBA samples, and the BSA samples. The achieved bond strength values were overall fairly low compared to what others have achieved. The <b>solutionizing</b> step caused the aluminum in all samples to recrystallize, and the BSA samples, which were solutionized after roll bonding, developed an intermetallic layer roughly 1 μm thick. This layer was found to severely impact the bond strength of the composite. No intermetallic layers were found for the two other sample sequences. Roll bonding after <b>solutionizing</b> was not found to have any negative effects on the ageing potential. The bonding mechanism was found to be consistent with the film theory...|$|E
40|$|A {{process for}} making a cast article from an {{aluminum}} alloy includes first casting an article from an alloy having the following composition, in weight percent: Silicon (Si) 14. 0 - 25. 0, Copper (CU) 5. 5 - 8. 0, Iron (Fe) 0 - 0. 8, Magnesium (Mg) 0. 5 - 1. 5, Nickel (Ni) 0. 05 - 1. 2, Manganese (Mn) 0 - 1. 0, Titanium (Ti) 0. 05 - 1. 2, Zirconium (Zr) 0. 12 - 1. 2, Vanadium (V) 0. 05 - 1. 2, Zinc (Zn) 0 - 0. 9, Phosphorus (P) 0. 001 - 0. 1, Aluminum, balance. In this alloy the ration of Si:Mg is 15 - 35, and the ratio of Cu:Mg is 4 - 15. After an article is cast from the alloy, the cast article is aged at a {{temperature within the range}} of 400 F to 500 F for a time period within the range of four to 16 hours. It has been found especially advantageous if the cast article is first exposed to a <b>solutionizing</b> step prior to the aging step. This <b>solutionizing</b> step is carried out by exposing the cast article to a temperature within the range of 875 F to 1025 F for a time period of fifteen minutes to four hours. It has also been found to be especially advantageous if the <b>solutionizing</b> step is followed directly with a quenching step, wherein the cast article is quenched in a quenching medium such as water at a temperature within the range of 120 F to 300 F. The resulting cast article is highly suitable in a number of high temperature applications, such as heavy-duty pistons for internal combustion engines...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{hardness}} of {{the samples}} fabricated with Co-Cr-Mo alloy powder using Laser Engineered Net Shaping process was tested. Three different process parameters (laser power, feed rate and scan speed) at two levels were used to fabricate the samples for L 4 orthogonal array of Taguchi method. The hardness obtained was 446 Hv with high laser power, low feed rate and high scan speed. With these process parameters, another set of nine samples were fabricated to apply heat treatment. Three heat treatment parameters (<b>Solutionizing</b> time, ageing temperature and ageing time) at three levels were used for L 9 orthogonal array. The <b>solutionizing</b> timings were 30, 45 and 60 minutes at 1200 oC. One set from these nine samples was with no ageing {{and the other two}} sets were aged at 815 and 830 oC for 2, 4 and 6 hours. The test results of hardness have revealed that the samples aged with 830 oC for two hours have shown highest hardness (much more than the wrought material) but with much variance on the same surface. It has also been established by ANOVA that the solution time and ageing temperature have only a little effect on the hardness but the ageing time has considerable effect and prolonged ageing will result in loss of hardness...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, the Mg– 7 Gd– 5 Y– 1 Nd– 0. 5 Zr alloy {{can reach}} a high {{ductility}} {{by the process}} of multi-directional forging, and the evolution of the microstructure, texture and the mechanical properties were discussed systematically. The results show that after the <b>solutionized</b> sample was multi-forged at 500  °C, its grain size can be refined from 292  um to 58  um. As the forging temperature decreased, fine particles precipitated in the matrix. The volume fraction of the particles increased with the forging temperature decreasing, so the nucleation and growth of crystallization were strongly restricted. There was no recrystallization as the forging temperature fell to 410  °C, and the severe deformed grains distributed as streamlines perpendicular to the final compression axis. The texture intensity decreased with increasing forging passes. The sample with best ductility was obtained after compressed at 470  °C, with an elongation to failure of 21 % at room temperature, which is increased by 200 %, in comparison with that of the samples in <b>solutionized</b> condition. EBSD results revealed that the mean grain size was 15  um. Refined grains as well as the weakened texture were the key factors to its high ductility...|$|R
