Any server can be either on, off, or in <b>setup</b> <b>mode.</b> While prior work has analyzed single servers with setup costs, no analytical results are known for multi-server systems.

Here we analyze policy design questions such as whether it pays to turn servers off when they are idle, whether staggered boot up helps, how to optimally mix policies, and other questions related to the optimal data center size.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on the {{assumption}} that the costly human albumin is not completely used during Single Pass Albumin Dialysis (SPAD) and is largely rejected. In order to verify this hypothesis, an additional pump was connected to the filtration line and the dialysate line to partially recirculate the dialysis solution that had already passed through the filter. In contrast to the commercially obtainable MARS® system, the dialysate solution containing the albumin is not cleaned after passing through the filter; part of it is rejected immediately afterwards and part of it after renewed circulation. Four series of experiments with the additional pump operating at three different speeds (180 ml/min, 270 ml/min, 90 ml/min) were carried out. 2000 ml of plasma, which was full of toxins, were detoxified for 6 hours using the various setup modes in the OLAD (Open Loop Albumin Dialysis) system for each experiment (number of experiments = 4 per <b>setup</b> <b>mode)</b> during this in vitro study. All the experiments were performed using the CVVHDF configuration. The concentrations of ammonia, creatinine, urea, uric acid, albumin, protein and bilirubin were set in order to assess the detoxification capacity. The samples were obtained before the start of the experiment and at particular time intervals. Bilirubin was selected as the marker for albumin-bonded substances and it was reduced from 16. 5 ± 0. 9 mg/dl to 8. 0 ± 1. 3 mg/dl through the OLAD mode when the speed of the recirculation pump was set at 90 ml/min. It was possible to reduce the concentration of bilirubin from 17. 2 ± 0. 4 mg/dl to 9. 5 ± 0. 8 mg/dl by setting the speed of the recirculation pump to 180 ml/min. By increasing the recirculation speed to 270 ml/min, it was possible to reduce the bilirubin level from 17. 5 ± 1. 8 mg/dl to 7. 5 ± 1. 5 mg/dl. A reduction in the concentration of bilirubin from 17. 4 ± 0. 4 to 8. 8 ± 0. 6 mg/dl was observed within the standard SPAD procedure (i. e. without any additional pump for recirculation purposes or with the recirculation speed set at 0 ml/min). Ammonia was selected as the marker for the water-soluble toxins that are clinically significant during liver failure. The concentration of ammonia was reduced from 244. 8 ± 67. 6 mg/dl to 19. 6 ± 12. 9 mg/dl using SPAD (the speed of the recirculation pump was 0 ml/min). Using the OLAD option and the recirculation pump speed set at 90 ml/min, the ammonia level fell from 214. 7 ± 34. 3 mg/dl to 24. 2 ± 8. 7 mg/dl. If the speed was doubled to 180 ml/min, it was possible to reduce the concentration of ammonia from 245. 7 ± 36. 5 mg/dl to 36. 3 ± 13. 7 mg/dl and, if the speed was increased to 270 ml/min, from 237. 2 ± 38. 5 mg/dl to 22. 4 ± 8. 4 mg/dl. An analysis of variance was used to analyse the results of the experiments. The partial recirculation of the dialysate solution containing albumin did not offer any statistically significant effect for the detoxification potential of SPAD when eliminating albumin-bonded and water-soluble toxins...|$|E

40|$|Aquatic {{vegetation}} in {{the coastal}} zone attenuates wave energy and {{reduces the risk of}} coastal hazards, e. g., flooding. Besides the attenuation of sea-swell waves, vegetation may also affect infragravity-band (IG) waves and wave setup. To date, knowledge on the effect of vegetation on IG waves and wave setup is lacking, while they are potentially important parameters for coastal risk assessment. In this study, the storm impact model XBeach is extended with formulations for attenuation of sea-swell and IG waves, and wave setup effects in two modes: the sea-swell wave phase-resolving (nonhydrostatic) and the phase-averaged (surfbeat) mode. In surfbeat mode, a wave shape model is implemented to capture the effect of nonlinear wave-vegetation interaction processes on wave <b>setup.</b> Both modeling <b>modes</b> are verified using data from two flume experiments with mimic vegetation and show good skill in computing the sea-swell and IG wave transformation, and wave <b>setup.</b> In surfbeat <b>mode,</b> the wave <b>setup</b> prediction greatly improves when using the wave shape model, while in nonhydrostatic mode (nonlinear) intrawave effects are directly accounted for. Subsequently, the model is used for a range of coastal geomorphological configurations by varying bed slope and vegetation extent.
