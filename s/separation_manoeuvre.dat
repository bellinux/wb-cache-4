ATM Seminar Eurocontrol/FAA (2013 - 06 - 13) When an {{airliner}} and a Remotely Piloted Air System (RPAS) have conflicting courses that may compromise the minimum safety separation between them, how much in advance should the RPAS start the <b>separation</b> <b>manoeuvre?</b> Which is the optimal heading change that will guarantee the desired separation distance {{with a minimum}} reaction time? These same questions can be asked {{if it is the}} airliner that performs the <b>separation</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> In this paper the time reaction margins for both aircraft are analysed assuming they are equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) systems able to exchange aircraft intents. Due to their small cruise speeds, RPAS manoeuvres must be initiated well before the airliner ones. This leads to some safety buffer in case the RPAS cannot comply with the required change of trajectory or if it becomes suddenly unresponsive (due to an internal failure or because a lost-link situation). The paper also assesses the operational point of view by simplifying the reaction times and conflict geometries by grouping them in a small set of cases, regarding the severity of a loss of separation event.

40|$|An {{attitude}} satellite controller {{that combines}} passive gravity-gradient torque with solar pressure torque is proposed for three-axis stabilization of a micro-satellite. A dumbbell satellite configuration is chosen {{to increase the}} gravity-gradient torque and a three-axis stabilization is pursued {{with the help of}} small solar sails. Solar pressure task is to help the gravity-gradient torque and not to oppose it. The proposed controller is applied to different test cases: first, for satellite stabilization during the tumble motion, due to a nonperfect <b>separation</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> from the launcher last stage; second, the attitude control performances are studied for different eccentric orbits. The results are given in terms of settling time and maximum amplitude oscillations...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Ongoing and Proposed EDL Technology DevelopmentSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopIn the frame of the Aurora Exploration Program, ESA initiated the design phase of the development for the ExoMars mission. Thales Alenia Space-France led consortium was awarded the contract for design, development and manufacturing of the Entry and Descent System under Thales Alenia Space-Italy mission prime. First mission of the Aurora Exploration Program, ExoMars is scheduled for a 2013 launch. It has the technical objective to demonstrate critical technologies linked to Mars mission, including the critical Entry Descent and Landing phases and the scientific objective at establishing whether life ever existed or is still present on Mars. The EDLS functions are to ensure the Entry, Descent and Landing phases of the Descent Module. This module is housing a Rover carrying an exobiology payload and ensures its safe delivery on the Mars surface. The Entry and Descent phases of this planetary mission consists of a precise sequence of events : atmospheric entry, parachutes deployment and braking, frontshield <b>separation,</b> propulsive <b>manoeuvre</b> [...] . The presention focuses on the main functions of the Entry and Descent System (EDS) in the various phases. The major trades and optmisation performed are outlined to provide a better insight of the EDS design approach and the challenge of designing a robust and flexible EDS. The design solutions largely inherited from Huygens are described. An accurate and detailed end-to-end EDL trajectory modelling and simulation tool has beed upgraded by the TAS-F Entry Descent and Landing System team. The MonteCarlo capability of the tool is used to assess the robustness of the EDS end-to-end sequence to off-nominal operational conditions to assure that all EDS requirements and constraints are satisfied.
