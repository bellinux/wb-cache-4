5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my head and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about {{the right amount of}} blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E

[...] "The prime motive in the instant that I pick up the guitar is a selfish one," [...] Joseph says. [...] "It's because I need to deal with the world. I'm in the world and it's horrible, and what can I do? I'm just getting this <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my system as it were." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Drumchapel is {{a housing}} estate just outside Glasgow. Well, it's in Glasgow, but just outside civilisation," [...] he has joked. [...] "To be quite honest, I quite liked it when I lived there. When I moved to Drumchapel, I was {{fourteen}} {{and there was}} a bluebell wood there, and it was in great condition then— I don't think it's in quite so good condition now— but it was lovely then. We had rabbits and pheasants, and I really quite liked it. I just started to dislike it when I got older, into my teens and things. In my late teens, when I was stuck out there, it cost me {{a lot of money to}} go anyplace. It was a kind of cowboy town, but I liked that aspect of it, buying <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> vans, a ragman coming in a wee green van." ...|$|E

60|$|I hadn't {{thought of}} that, and I must confess it shook {{me for a}} moment. Then I {{recovered}} myself. I saw what {{was at the bottom}} of all this. Mortified by the consciousness of his own ineptness--or ineptitude--the fellow was simply trying to hamper and obstruct. I decided to knock the <b>stuffing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him without further preamble.|$|R
