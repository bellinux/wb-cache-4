2500|$|Flush toilets usually {{incorporate}} an [...] "S", [...] "U", [...] "J", or [...] "P" [...] shaped bend (called a trap, such as P trap or S trap) {{that causes}} {{the water in the}} toilet bowl to collect and act as a seal against <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> (trapping the gases). Since flush toilets are typically not designed to handle waste on site, their drain pipes must be connected to waste conveyance and waste treatment systems. When a toilet is flushed, the wastewater flows into a septic tank or sewage system and from there to a sewage treatment plant.|$|E

Improper disposal of petroleum {{products such as}} gasoline and mineral spirits contribute to sewer gas hazards. <b>Sewer</b> <b>gases</b> are of concern due to their odor, health effects, and potential for creating fire or explosions.|$|E

40|$|For roughly forty years, from 1870 to 1910, Americans {{recognized}} and feared <b>gases</b> emanating from <b>sewers,</b> believing {{that they were}} responsible for causing an array of diseases. Fears of <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> arose from deeper anxieties toward contact with decomposing organic matter and the vapors emitted from such refuse. These anxieties were exacerbated by the construction of sewers across the country during the mid-to-late-nineteenth century, which concentrated waste emanations and connected homes to one another. The result was the birth of <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> and the attribution of sickness and death to it, {{as well as the}} development of a host of plumbing devices and, especially, bathroom fixtures, to combat <b>sewer</b> <b>gas.</b> The rise of the germ theory, laboratory science, and belief in disease specificity, however, transformed the threat of <b>sewer</b> <b>gas,</b> eventually replacing it (and the larger fear of miasmas) with the threat of germs. The germ theory framework, by 1910, proved more suitable than the <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> framework in explaining disease causation; it is this suitability that often shapes the relationship between science and society...|$|R
50|$|An island fixture vent {{provides}} an elegant solution for this necessity: when the drain is opened, water displaces the <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> {{up to the}} sanitary tee, the water flows downward while <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> is displaced upward and toward the vent. The vent can also provide air to fill any vacuum created.|$|R
50|$|Fully vented <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> {{contribute}} to greenhouse gas emissions. Septic vent pipes can be fitted with filters that remove some odors.|$|E
50|$|The lamps were {{installed}} at places where <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> {{were likely to}} collect, such as at the tops of hills. The city of Sheffield, being a hilly area, had many sewer gas destructor lamps and many remain.|$|E
5000|$|In plumbing, a trap is {{a device}} {{which has a}} shape that uses a bending path to capture water to prevent <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> from {{entering}} buildings. In refinery applications, traps are used to prevent hydrocarbons and other dangerous gases from escaping outside through drains.|$|E
50|$|In {{plumbing}} a {{smoke test}} forces non-toxic, artificially created smoke through waste and drain pipes under a slight pressure to find leaks. Plumes of smoke form {{where there are}} defects. This test can be performed when the plumbing is brand new, but more often {{it is used to}} find <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> leaks that may plague a building or an area. Any sign of smoke escaping can be considered a possible site for <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> to escape. <b>Sewer</b> <b>gas</b> typically has a rotten egg smell and can contain methane gas, which is explosive, or hydrogen sulfide gas, which is deadly.|$|R

50|$|The San Juan Gas Company vehemently denied {{responsibility}} {{and suggested that}} it could have been caused by <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> instead. However, the lighter-than-air <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> collects in the ceiling, while propane collects on the floor. The explosion showed that stored shoes were tossed up, meaning that the fuel had to be at ground level. An upwards bent beam was also crucial to determining that the blast had come from below.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{unlike the}} {{plumbing}} trap, the catchbasin {{does not necessarily}} prevent <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> such as hydrogen sulfide and methane from escaping. However, in the United Kingdom, where they are called gully pots, they are designed as true water-filled traps and do block the egress of gases and rodents.|$|E
5000|$|Excessive {{negative}} air pressure, {{behind a}} [...] "slug" [...] {{of water that}} is draining, can siphon water from traps at plumbing fixtures. Generally, a toilet outlet has the shortest trap seal, making it most vulnerable to being emptied by induced siphonage. An empty trap can allow noxious <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> to enter a building.|$|E
50|$|Biogas {{forming in}} sewers via {{anaerobic}} digestion {{can be a}} potentially foul-smelling and explosive hazard (chiefly due to chemical spills). Unlike ordinary gas lamps for street lighting, {{the main purpose of}} sewer gas destructor lamps is to remove <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> and their hazards. Joseph Edmund Webb of Birmingham patented a sewer gas destructor lamp.|$|E
50|$|In {{buildings}} with HVAC air handlers that admit outside air for ventilation, plumbing vents placed too closely to air intakes or windows {{can be a}} source of <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> odors. In some cases airflow around buildings and wind effects may contribute to <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> odor problems even with appropriately separated vents and air intakes. Increasing vent heights, adding vent pipe filters, or providing powered dilution and exhaust can help reduce occurrences.|$|R
50|$|Exposure to <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> {{also can}} {{happen if the}} gas seeps in via a leaking {{plumbing}} drain or vent pipe, or even through cracks in a buildingâ€™s foundation. <b>Sewer</b> <b>gas</b> is typically denser than atmospheric gases and may accumulate in basements, but may eventually mix with surrounding air. Individuals who work in sanitation industries or on farms might be exposed on the job if they clean or maintain municipal sewers, manure storage tanks, or septic tanks.|$|R

Why Hawkins, everything is useful--nothing ought ever to be wasted. Now look at <b>sewer</b> <b>gas,</b> for instance. <b>Sewer</b> <b>gas</b> has always been wasted, heretofore; nobody tried to save up sewer-gas--you can't name me a man.

5000|$|The Buchan trap was devised in the 19th {{century to}} stop the flow of <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> also known as miasmas. [...] It was {{believed}} that the disease cholera was an air born infection, not water born. The Buchan trap is normally found in the bottom of manholes or drop-shafts. It normally denotes the end point of the domestic property's sewer before it joins the main public sewer.|$|E
50|$|A blocked vent is a {{relatively}} common problem caused by anything from leaves, to dead animals, to ice dams in very cold weather, or a horizontal section of the venting system, sloped the wrong way and filled with water from rain or condensation. Symptoms range from bubbles in the toilet bowl when it is flushed, to slow drainage, {{and all the way}} to siphoned (empty) traps which allow <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> to enter the building.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{of these}} lamps were {{installed}} in the UK in towns and cities including Sheffield, Winchester, Durham, Whitley Bay, Monkseaton and Blyth, Northumberland. [...] With a flame generated by burning town gas, <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> were drawn from the sewer below and discharged above the heads of passers-by to dissipate odours. The flame in the lamp does not actually generate sufficient thermal energy to combust any of the odour compounds in the air.|$|E
50|$|Each fixture drain, with exceptions, must be vented so that {{negative}} air {{pressure in the}} drain cannot siphon the trap dry, to prevent positive air pressure in the <b>sewer</b> from forcing <b>gases</b> past the water seal, and to prevent explosive <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> buildup.|$|R
25|$|The {{water in}} the toilet bowl is {{connected}} to a pipe shaped like an upside-down U. One side of the U channel is arranged as a siphon tube longer than the {{water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The bottom of the drain pipe limits the height of {{the water in the}} bowl before it flows down the drain. The water in the bowl acts as a barrier to <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> entering the building. <b>Sewer</b> <b>gas</b> escapes through a vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sewer</b> <b>gas</b> is {{a complex}} mixture of toxic and {{nontoxic}} gases produced and collected in sewage systems by the decomposition of organic household or industrial wastes, typical components of sewage.|$|R
5000|$|Inverted siphons are {{commonly}} called traps for their function in preventing smelly <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> from coming {{back out of}} drains and sometimes making dense objects like rings and electronic components retrievable after falling into a drain. Liquid flowing in one end simply forces liquid up {{and out the other}} end, but solids like sand will accumulate. This is especially important in sewage systems or culverts which must be routed under rivers or other deep obstructions where the better term is [...] "depressed sewer".|$|E
50|$|A trap primer (or {{trap seal}} primer) is a {{plumbing}} device or valve that adds water to traps. The water seals in traps {{are needed to}} prevent <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> from entering buildings, but because this water is exposed to the air, it is subject to evaporation over time in infrequently used floor drains, leading {{to the release of}} sewer gas into the environment. The trap primer mitigates this problem by injecting water, either directly or indirectly, into the trap to maintain the water seal indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|Alexhander Cumming (sometimes {{referred}} to as Alexander Cummings) FRSE (1733 -8 March 1814) was a Scottish watchmaker and instrument inventor, {{who was the first}} to patent a design of the flush toilet, that had been invented by Sir John Harrington. The S-trap (or bend) was invented by Cumming in 1775 to retain water permanently within the bowl, thus preventing <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> from entering buildings. It survives in today's plumbing modified as a U- or J-shaped pipe trap located below or within a plumbing fixture.|$|E
50|$|The {{plumbing}} is key. The {{water in}} the toilet bowl is connected to a pipe shaped like an upside-down U. One side of the U channel is arranged as a siphon tube longer than the {{water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The bottom of the drain pipe limits the height of {{the water in the}} bowl before it flows down the drain.

50|$|In the {{developed}} world, sewers are pipes from buildings {{to one or}} more levels of larger underground trunk mains, which transport the sewage to sewage treatment facilities. Vertical pipes, usually made of precast concrete, called manholes, connect the mains to the surface. Depending upon site application and use, these vertical pipes can be cylindrical, eccentric or concentric. The manholes are used for access to the sewer pipes for inspection and maintenance, and as a means to vent <b>sewer</b> <b>gases.</b> They also facilitate vertical and horizontal angles in otherwise straight pipelines.|$|E
5000|$|All {{plumbing}} waste fixtures use traps {{to prevent}} <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> from leaking into the house. Through traps, all fixtures {{are connected to}} waste lines, which in turn take the waste to a [...] "soil stack", or [...] "soil vent pipe". At the building drain system's lowest point, the drain-waste vent is attached, and rises (usually inside a wall) to {{and out of the}} roof. Waste exits from the building through the building's main drain and flows through a sewage line, which leads to a septic system or a public sewer. Cesspits are generally prohibited in developed areas.|$|E
