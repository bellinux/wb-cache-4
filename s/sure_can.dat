500|$|The tour also {{featured}} fellow Yankees Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy (who {{had been called}} up {{late in the season}} and was ineligible for the World Series) as well as Tom Sheehan, who had been sent to the minor leagues {{before the end of the}} season. Two other Yankees, Carl Mays and Wally Schang, had been scheduled to join the tour, but given Landis's position, according to Spink, [...] "wisely decided to pass it up". [...] Spink describes the tour as [...] "a fiasco." [...] On Landis's orders, it was barred from all major and minor league ballparks. In addition, it was plagued by poor weather, and was called off in late October. In early December, Landis suspended Ruth, Piercy, and Meusel until May 20, 1922. [...] Yankee management was actually relieved; they had feared Landis would suspend Ruth for the season or even longer. Both the Yankees and Ruth repeatedly asked Landis for the players' early reinstatement, which was refused, and when Landis visited the Yankees during spring training in New Orleans, he lectured Ruth for two hours on the value of obeying authority. [...] "He <b>sure</b> <b>can</b> talk", noted Ruth.|$|E
500|$|The two Vocal Adrenaline {{performances}} were generally very well received; as noted above, Bell and Chaney used very similar words {{to explain why}} they thought Vocal Adrenaline was [...] "better" [...] than New Directions. [...] "Starships", the first number, was also the more praised of the two: Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said that it [...] "stole the show" [...] for him, and was the best musical number of the night. Flandez called it [...] "an electric and sassy delivery" [...] by Unique, and Strecker asked [...] "is there anything she can't do" [...] before she gave the performance an [...] "A−". Futterman thought it felt [...] "more subdued than the warp-speed of Minaj's hit" [...] though she added that the [...] "stage acrobatics trump everything anyone else does", and Saskin said it [...] "was fun to watch, but the vocals don't add much to the original version". Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] grade and praised the [...] "dazzling" [...] choreography of both numbers. [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] was called [...] "turbo-charged from beginning to end" [...] by Flandez, and both Strecker and Slezak gave the song a [...] "B+" [...] grade; the former's enthusiasm was tempered by the arrangement, which was not very [...] "different from just karaoke of the original", and the dancing on the pinball machines as [...] "a bit much for my taste". Futterman said that Unique [...] "riffs the hell out the song", but added that [...] "the robot dancers of Vocal Adrenaline {{make it hard to}} glean any personality from the performance". Dodge wrote, [...] "This one I'm liking even less than the first", but Saskin said, [...] "Mercedes needs to watch out, because Unique <b>sure</b> <b>can</b> belt it out!" ...|$|E
