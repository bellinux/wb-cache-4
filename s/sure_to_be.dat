With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant {{as he entered the}} state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.|$|E

The Spadina was formally approved at the final meeting Gardiner chaired, and the Cross-town deferred again.|$|E

Others wanted to stick with the decree issued by Simon de Cramand on 10 May, assigning the task to the cardinals, in accordance with Canon Law. The meeting ended, however, without a decision.|$|E

Maldeo Rathore with an army of 30,000 cavalry {{advanced}} to face Sher Shah's army. Instead of marching to the enemy's capital Sher Shah halted {{in the village of}} Sammel in the pargana of Jaitaran, ninety kilometers east of Jodhpur. After one month, Sher Shah's position became critical owing to the difficulties of food supplies for his huge army. To resolve this situation, Sher Shah resorted to a cunning ploy. One evening, he dropped forged letters near the Maldeo's camp {{in such a way that}} they were <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intercepted. These letters indicated, falsely, that some of Maldeo's army commanders were promising assistance to Sher Shah. This caused great consternation to Maldeo, who immediately (and wrongly) suspected his commanders of disloyalty. Maldeo left for Jodhpur with his own men, abandoning his commanders to their fate.|$|E

25|$|The Vikings {{came into}} the game with great {{confidence}} internally but none by the wider league. They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the hard way that you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a close eye on 2014 which is <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a huge one for this team.|$|E
25|$|Ellen Stanton loathed the idea. In California Edwin {{would be}} {{thousands}} of miles away from her for what was <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> months, leaving her lonely in Washington, where she had few friends. Moreover, on May 9, 1857 Ellen had a daughter whom the Stantons name Eleanor Adams. After the girl's delivery, Ellen fell ill, which frightened Edwin and delayed his decision to go to California. In October 1857 Stanton finally agreed to represent the Buchanan administration's interests in California. Having agreed to a compensation of $25,000, Stanton set sail from New York on February 19, 1858 aboard the Star of the West, along with his son Eddie, James Buchanan, Jr., the President's nephew, and Lieutenant H. N. Harrison, who was assigned to Stanton's detail by the Navy. After a tempestuous voyage, the company docked in Kingston, Jamaica, where slavery was disallowed. On the island, the climate pleased Stanton greatly, and at a church there, Stanton was surprised to see blacks and whites sitting together. Afterwards, Stanton and his entourage landed in Panama, and left there on a ship three times larger than the one on which they came, the Sonora. On March 19 the company finally docked in San Francisco, and bunkered at the International Hotel.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} innings, England were 124/8 {{at one point}} and looked <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{dismissed}} for a very low first innings score. Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann then had a partnership of 73 runs and salvaged the innings for England who were eventually dismissed for 221. In reply, India reached a dominant score of 267/4 with Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh sharing a partnership of 128 runs before England bowler Stuart Broad took a hat-trick, dismissing MS Dhoni (caught Anderson), Harbhajan Singh (lbw) and Praveen Kumar (bowled) and finished with his best Test figures to date, with 6 for 46. This hat-trick {{was part of a}} remarkable spell of 16 balls in which Broad got five wickets without conceding a run. India were eventually also dismissed for less than 300, with 288. Ian Bell was involved in a controversial run-out decision with the final delivery before tea on the third day when he was on 139 not out. Bell walked off the field, believing that the previous shot played by Eoin Morgan had gone to the boundary for four. However, the ball had been kept in play and was thrown back to the middle, where India removed the bails. It was referred to the third umpire, Billy Bowden, who gave Bell out. During the tea interval, England captain Andrew Strauss and coach Andy Flower met with the Indian captain Dhoni and their coach Duncan Fletcher and they agreed to withdraw the appeal. Bell was eventually dismissed for 159. England continued to bat strongly with tail-ender Tim Bresnan getting 90 runs. England were eventually bowled out for 544 runs, setting India a target of 478 runs to win. India's response to this target was poor and they slumped to 68/6 at tea on day 4. England dismissed India's top second innings scorer, Sachin Tendulkar for 56 soon after tea. England wrapped the game up in the evening session, finally dismissing India for 158 runs, winning by 319 runs.|$|E
40|$|In a {{world that}} is {{becoming}} increasingly dependent on In- ternet communication, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks have evolved into a major security threat which <b>is</b> easy <b>to</b> launch but difficult to defend against. In order for DoS countermea- <b>sures</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective, the attack must be detected early and accurately. In this paper we propose a DoS detection tech- nique based on observation of the incoming traffic and a com- bination of traditional likelihood estimation with a recurrent random neural network (r-RNN) structure. We select input features that describe essential information on the incoming traffic and evaluate the likelihood ratios for each input, to fuse them with a r-RNN. We evaluate the performance of our method in terms of false alarm and correct detection rates with experiments on a large networking testbed, for a variety of input traffic...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} preprint, [2], reproduced here within the appendix in its revised version, we <b>were</b> confronted, <b>to</b> reach {{the validity of}} the second law of thermodynamics for an unique collapse of an unique quantum object, to the necessity of an ensemble of mea- <b>sures</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accomplished within copies of identical isolated systems. The validity of the second law of thermodynamics {{within the context of the}} wave function collapse was sustained by the large number of microstates related to a given collapsed state. Now, we will consider just one pure initial state containing just one initial state of the quan- tum subsystem, not an ensemble of identically prepared initial quantum subsystems, e. g., just one photon from a very low intensity beam prepared with an equiprobable eigenset containing two elements, an unique observation raising two likelihood out- comes. Again, we will show the statistical interpretation must prevail, albeit the quan- tum subsystem being a singular, unique, pure state element within its unitary quantum subsystem ensemble set. This feature leads to an inherent probabilistic character, even for a pure one-element quantum subsystem object...|$|R
