The Vietnamese government was <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> upgrading sports facilities and building new ones, including the 40,000-seat stadium, My Dinh National Stadium which is the biggest stadium in the country, spending about 60 million to 70 million United States Dollars for its construction.|$|E
500|$|The Great Southern Group relied {{significantly}} {{on financial}} planners and accountants recommending their MIS products to investors. The company was paying commissions of ten percent – high by industry standards, and {{similar to those}} paid by other failed investment businesses including Westpoint Corporation and Storm Financial. It was also <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> on recruiting financial advisers to sell its products. One report indicated that A$137 million was spent on [...] "commissions, marketing and promotion in two years to 2008". Some accountants, with Great Southern's support, were recommending the agribusiness investment schemes, though {{they did not have}} a financial services licence; one report suggested over half of Great Southern's MIS sales were coming through accountants, often tax specialists from small practices. These practices had been questioned for several years by the corporate regulator ASIC and some market analysts, and were widely criticised following Great Southern's collapse. Some experts were critical of the lack of knowledge and expertise of the investment advisers recommending agroforestry MIS schemes.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles' first Hamburg {{residency}} {{took place}} in 1960, with Lennon writing frequent and passionate letters back home to Powell. After returning home, Lennon's aunt and legal guardian, Mimi Smith, threw a hand-mirror at him for <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> on a suede coat for Powell. Smith later referred to her as [...] "a gangster's moll", and was often unpleasant towards her. The Beatles went to Hamburg {{for a second time}} in 1961, and both Powell and Dot Rhone (Paul McCartney's girlfriend at the time), visited them two weeks later, during the Easter holidays. They had to stay up all night because of the long sets, both taking Preludin to stay awake, which the group was also taking. Lennon and Powell stayed with Sutcliffe's girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, at her mother's house. After the trip to Hamburg, Powell's mother Lillian said Powell's cousin and husband were emigrating to Canada with their new-born baby, and that she, Lillian, would be going with them while they studied to become teachers. Powell waited until Lennon came back from Hamburg before she asked Smith—who had taken in lodgers before at 251 Menlove Avenue—if she would rent a room to her. Smith rented out the box-room above the front door (which had been Lennon's bedroom), but insisted she also do chores around the house. To pay the rent, she took a job at a Woolworths store in Liverpool, after her student grant had run out. In the same year, when Lennon was 21 years old, he received £100 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). from his aunt Mater who lived in Edinburgh, and went to Paris with McCartney. Powell could not accompany them as she was studying for her final exams.|$|E

2500|$|Emanuel's {{previous}} {{statements on}} rationing {{were about the}} [...] "allocation of very scarce medical interventions such as organs and vaccines" [...] such as who should get a [...] "liver for transplantation". Ezekiel said that McCaughey's euthanasia claims were a [...] "willful distortion of my record". Jim Rutennberg said that Emanuel's critics oversimplified complex issues, such as who should get a kidney. Such rationing {{was said to be}} unavoidable because of scarcity, and because a scarce resource such as a liver is [...] "indivisible". Emanuel said that McCaughey took words out of context, omitting qualifiers such as [...] "Without overstating it (and without fully defending it) ... Clearly, {{more needs to be done}} ..." [...] Emanuel once compared the word [...] "rationing" [...] to George Carlin’s seven words you can't say on television. In 1994 Emanuel said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, [...] "Just because we are <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> on patients who die does not mean that we can save a lot of money on end of life care." ...|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times asked seven {{academics}} to opine on how corporate {{money would}} reshape {{politics as a}} result of the court's decision. Three of the seven wrote that the effects would be minimal or positive: Christopher Cotton, a University of Miami School of Business assistant professor of economics, wrote that [...] "There may be very little difference between seeing eight ads or seeing nine ads (compared to seeing one ad or two). And, voters recognize that richer candidates are not necessarily the better candidates, and in some cases, the benefit of running more ads is offset by the negative signal that <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> creates. Eugene Volokh, a professor of law at UCLA, stated that the [...] "most influential actors in most political campaigns" [...] are media corporations which [...] "overtly editorialize for and against candidates, and also influence elections by choosing what to cover and how to cover it". Holding that corporations like Exxon would fear alienating voters by supporting candidates, the decision really meant that voters would hear [...] "more messages from more sources". Joel Gora, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who had previously argued the case of Buckley v. Valeo on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the decision represented [...] "a great day for the First Amendment" [...] writing that the Court had [...] "dismantled the First Amendment 'caste system' in election speech".|$|E

A month ago she knew no one but her washerwoman, and now I am told that the cards of Roman princesses are to be seen on her table.
