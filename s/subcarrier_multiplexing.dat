This scheme may be useful in tomorrow's optical local area networks {{to take advantage of the}} capacity of optical fibers using commercially available optical technology. The application of <b>subcarrier</b> <b>multiplexing</b> to optical local networks has generated much interest recently, however it is sensitive to nonlinear distortion generated by the laser diodes used to transmit data over the optical network.

40|$|Abstract—Nonlinear {{dynamics}} of an optically injected semicon-ductor laser {{is applied to}} photonic microwave generation. By prop-erly adjusting the injection conditions, the optical frequency of the slave laser is first locked to the master laser. The slave laser is then driven into a periodic dynamical state, resulting in a single-sideband (SSB) microwave modulation on the optical carrier. The frequency of the SSB can be controlled by the optical injection strength and detuning. Frequency-modulated SSB can, thus, be obtained from a modulated injection. In this work, we experimen-tally investigate the generated SSB {{in terms of its}} broad tunability and fast modulation response.
