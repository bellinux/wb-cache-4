50|$|The word {{surfactant}} {{is short}} for <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent.</b> Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension of a liquid, the interfacial tension between two liquids, or the interfacial tension between a liquid and a solid.

Soluble surfactants are also capable of forming micelles and other aggregate structures in solution, leading to a stabilizing effect in latex paints. Surfactants in paint are used to change many end properties of a dried paint, as well as to emulsify paints in their liquid state.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. -Whereas dilute {{solutions}} of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> {{modify the}} properties of cell membranes, particularly {{in relation to their}} electrical behaviour, moderate and strong solutions provoke more serious structural damage of the membrane, leading to an increase of its permeability and, finally, to cytolysis. These phenomena have inspired some authors to apply detergents as possible cancer chemotherapeuticals so far, however, with only poor results. The disintegrating effect of tumour emboli into single cells by certain detergents, and the ingenious discovery that the mutual adhesiveness between cancer cells is much less than between normal cells, have led the present authors to investigate the action of some biological <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents,</b> alone as well as in some of their associations on the " take " of Yoshida sarcoma implants.

40|$|We {{report the}} use of {{hydrodynamic}} cavitation as a novel, bottom-up method for continuous creation of foams comprising of air microbubbles in aqueous systems containing <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> ingredients, like proteins or particles. The hydrodynamic cavitation was created using a converging-diverging nozzle. The air bubble size obtained using this technique {{was found to be}} significantly smaller than that achieved using conventional mechanical entrapment of air via shearing or shaking routes, which are in essence top-down approaches. In addition, the technique provided the possibility of forming non-spherical bubbles due to the high elongational stresses experienced by the bubbles as they flow through the nozzle throat. We show that <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> with a high surface elasticity modulus can be used to stabilize the nascent air bubbles and keep their elongated shapes for prolonged periods of time.

40|$|The {{range of}} {{electrical}} potential of coalescence of aqueous droplets {{in the oil}} phase was studied, and was compared with the electrocapillary phenomena at the oil-water inter-face. The experimental method was {{essentially the same as}} that of the coalescence of mercury droplets mentioned previously. If neither the aqueous nor oil phase contained the surface active material, aqueous droplets in the oiI phase always coalesced over the whole range of the applied electrical potential. On the other hand, when the oil phase contained an ionic <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent,</b> the repulsion of the aqueous droplets was observed at po-tentials higher than a certain value. This potential was governed by the ionic strength of the oil phase; the range of electricaI potential of coalescence increased with increasing ionic strength of the oil phase. This tendency was similar to that of the coalescence of mercury droplets in the inorganic electrolyte solution. In the Iatter case the coalescence was prevented by the electrostatic repulsion between mercury droplets. When the oil phase contained the nonionic, instead of ionic, <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent,</b> the condition of coalescence of aqueous droplets was independent of the ionic strength of the oil phase as well as the electrical potential, but depended on the concentration of the nonionic surface active agent; the coalescence was prevented only if the concentration of the agent exceeded a certain value. It was thus concluded that aqueous droplets in the nonionic <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent</b> solution was protected by the adsorbed layer...|$|E

The purpose of this paper was to construct a mathematical model which reveals the relative importance of the surface compressional modulus of elasticity Cs− 1, as opposed to the degree of agitation, which is synonymous with turbulence, hence Reynolds number, as each one tends to offset the other in mass transfer processes.
