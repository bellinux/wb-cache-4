5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance developed northeast of Yap on July 7 and slowly increased in organization. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance {{later that day}} as it moved northwestward. By July 8, it had developed sufficient convection to be designated a tropical depression by the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The depression continued to <b>strengthen,</b> <b>and</b> was designated Tropical Storm Bilis by the JMA early on July 9. The JTWC upgraded Bilis to tropical storm status later that day. On July 10, Bilis moved into the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), and was designated Tropical Storm Florita for local warnings.|$|E
5|$|Danny {{had only}} minor effects on land. However, it {{triggered}} high surf and rip currents from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states, {{leading to the}} death of a 12-year-old boy in North Carolina. The cyclone's remnants contributed to widespread rainfall in the northeast United States. At one point, some weather forecasts predicted Danny to rapidly <b>strengthen,</b> <b>and</b> hit Nantucket as a Category 1 Hurricane, although this never occurred. Localized flooding was reported, particularly in Pennsylvania. It later caused heavy precipitation and power outages in Atlantic Canada.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Joyce caused minor {{impact in}} the ABC and Windward islands during late September and early October 2000. The fourteenth {{tropical}} cyclone, tenth named storm, and sixth hurricane of the season, Joyce developed from a tropical wave located southwest of Cape Verde on September25. Only twelve hours after becoming a cyclone, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Joyce early on September 26. Joyce continued to <b>strengthen</b> <b>and</b> became a hurricane by September 27. On the following day, Joyce peaked with winds of 90mph (150km/h) on September28. After peak intensity on September 28, unfavorable conditions caused Joyce to become disorganized and weaken.|$|E

5|$|Later on September22, the National Hurricane Center began {{noting the}} {{possibility}} of increasing wind shear due to a large upper trough. Despite this, the intensity predictions did not forecast weakening within the next three days. Isaac continued to <b>strengthen</b> <b>and</b> reached hurricane status at 1200UTC on September23. However, the National Hurricane Center did not operationally upgrade Isaac until 2100UTC on September23, at which time the storm was a Category2 hurricane. Thereafter, Isaac significantly intensified, and on the following day, it reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 120mph (205km/h). The National Hurricane Center then predicted Isaac would become a Category4 hurricane on September25, though this did not materialize.|$|E
5|$|On October9, {{the fifth}} {{tropical}} {{depression of the}} 1910season formed from a tropical disturbance in the extreme southern Caribbean, {{to the north of}} Panama. It tracked steadily northwestward, and attained tropical storm intensity on October 11. It continued to <b>strengthen,</b> <b>and</b> became a hurricane the next day. On October13, the storm was observed to the southwest of Cuba. Early on October 14, the hurricane briefly reached an intensity corresponding to Category 3 status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before tracking ashore along the western tip of Cuba. However, it weakened somewhat after crossing the island. Upon emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane slowed considerably.|$|E
5|$|Saomai {{continued}} {{moving toward}} the northwest and passed over the Mariana Islands on August 6 while continuing to <b>strengthen,</b> <b>and</b> was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA later that day. The storm then began organizing and intensifying more rapidly, becoming a typhoon early on August 7. Saomai moved into the area of responsibility of PAGASA on August 8, and was designated Typhoon Juan. Due to Saomai's proximity to Tropical Storm Bopha, located near Taiwan, the two underwent a Fujiwhara interaction. This interaction served to shift Saomai's track slightly {{to the south and}} provided the system with in influx of moisture via southwesterly monsoonal flow on the backside of Bopha.|$|E

5|$|A strong ridge {{over the}} north Atlantic Ocean turned Emmy sharply eastward on August 29. The {{hurricane}} continued to <b>strengthen,</b> <b>and</b> Emmy attained a peak intensity of 105mph (170km/h) shortly after turning to the east while located 500miles (800km) northeast of Bermuda. The hurricane maintained its peak intensity for 42hours while moving eastward at 17mph (27km/h), and slowly weakened after peaking in strength. On September 1, Emmy turned to the east-southeast, and a day later it turned to the northeast as its forward motion decreased. Emmy passed through the Azores on September 3, and the following day it became extratropical {{to the north of}} the islands. The extratropical remnant persisted another six hours before being absorbed by approaching Hurricane Frances.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} August 10, {{computer}} models anticipated the hurricane to accelerate {{to the northeast}} and become extratropical within three days, but this did not materialize. A westerly trough that had been influencing Alberto’s motion outran the storm, and a strong ridge developed {{to the north and}} west, causing the storm to turn abruptly to the south on August 15, and to complete a large loop over the open Atlantic. Alberto turned to the southwest on August 16 and to the west on August 17. The storm then took a sharp turn toward the northwest as a large, slow-moving mid-level trough was carving out over the eastern United States. Alberto began to <b>strengthen,</b> <b>and</b> reached hurricane status for the third time on August 18. The hurricane continued to turn to the north on August 19 and to the northeast on August 20 and August 21. During this time, Alberto reached a third peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) on August 20, and a 70mi (110km) wide eye was observed. Operationally, Alberto reached a peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), but after reanalysis, it was reduced to 105mph (165km/h).|$|E
5|$|As the {{depression}} drifted erratically, the system remained weak {{due to its}} large circulation and lack of deep convection near the center. The center relocated to the south, closer to the center. An approaching upper-level trough lessened the shear over the system, allowing {{the depression}} to intensify into Tropical Storm Alex on August 1. The trough also caused Alex to increase its forward motion to the northeast. Deep convection continued to build over the center due to low shear and warm waters from the Gulf Stream, and Alex intensified into a hurricane on August 3 while located 75miles (120km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The cyclone continued to <b>strengthen,</b> <b>and</b> attained Category 2 status just hours after becoming a hurricane. The hurricane approached the Outer Banks of North Carolina, coming within 11miles (16km) of Cape Hatteras later on the 3rd. The western portion of the eyewall passed over the Outer Banks, though the center remained offshore.|$|E

5|$|Corals are sessile {{animals in}} the class Anthozoa and differ from most other cnidarians in not having a medusa stage in their life cycle. The body unit of the animal is a polyp. Most corals are colonial, the initial polyp budding to produce another and the colony {{gradually}} developing from this small start. In stony corals, also known as hard corals, the polyps produce a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate to <b>strengthen</b> <b>and</b> protect the organism. This is deposited by the polyps and by the coenosarc, the living tissue that connects them. The polyps sit in cup-shaped depressions in the skeleton known as corallites. Colonies of stony coral are very variable in appearance; a single species may adopt an encrusting, plate-like, bushy, columnar or massive solid structure, the various forms often being linked to different types of habitat, with variations in light level and water movement being significant.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Chantal was one {{of three}} {{tropical}} cyclones to make landfall in Texas during the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. The third named storm and the first hurricane of the season, Chantal slowly developed on July 30 in the southern Gulf of Mexico from a tropical disturbance that was previously within Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) while near Trinidad and Tobago. While heading north-northwestward, the depression steadily intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal on the following day. Thereafter, Chantal quickly <b>strengthen</b> <b>and</b> became a hurricane on August1. After intensifying slightly further, Chantal made landfall near High Island, Texas later that day. The storm quickly weakened upon moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity a few hours after landfall. Early on August2, Chantal weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over Oklahoma by August4.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Debby was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to strike the Mexican state of Veracruz since Hurricane Anna in 1956. The eighth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, Debby developed from a tropical wave off {{the west coast of}} the Yucatan Peninsula on August 31. The system slowly intensified as it tracked west-northwestward toward Mexico, eventually reaching tropical storm status on September2. Thereafter, Debby began to rapidly <b>strengthen,</b> <b>and</b> the storm was upgraded to a hurricane later that day. After attaining peak winds of 75mph (120km/h), Debby made landfall near Tuxpan, Veracruz, in Mexico early on September3. The hurricane quickly weakened inland, but managed to reach the eastern Pacific on September5. Debby became Tropical Depression Seventeen-E, which moved northwest but remained poorly organized due to wind shear and dissipated on September8.|$|E
