5|$|Beckham died in Louisville on January 9, 1940, and {{was buried}} in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Beckham County, Oklahoma, was named in his honor at the <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Kentuckian who was serving as a {{delegate}} to Oklahoma's constitutional convention in 1907. Wickland, his birthplace, {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on February 16, 1973.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{discovery}} of post-translational circular permutations and the <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible genetic mechanism for evolving circular permutants, {{it was not}} until 1995 that the first circularly permuted pair of genes were discovered. Saposins are a class of proteins involved in sphingolipid catabolism and antigen presentation of lipids in humans. Chris Ponting and Robert Russell identified a circularly permuted version of a saposin inserted into plant aspartic proteinase, which they nicknamed swaposin. Saposin and swaposin were the first known case of two natural genes related by a circular permutation.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, in {{an effort}} to improve her in-ring skills, Stock {{relocated}} to Monterrey, Mexico to face the female wrestlers there. At the <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> promoter, Stock began working while wearing a mask. She also took on the ring name Dark Angel, on the advice of Eddie Watts. She initially found it difficult to work with the wrestlers in Mexico, as she did not speak Spanish and could not communicate with them throughout the match. On October 17, she defeated Simply Luscious to win the Lucha Libre Femenil Juvenil Championship.|$|E

5|$|Born in Jakarta, Aristo became {{interested}} in films from a young age, {{though he did not}} consider a career in the industry until after graduating from university. At the <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend, he wrote his first screenplay, Tak Pernah Kembali Sama. With feedback on the script from director Rudy Soedjarwo and after a period reading old, successful scripts, Aristo– at the time a film reviewer for a magazine– was able to befriend Hanung Bramantyo, who asked him to write a script about brownies. The resulting film, a critical success, led to Aristo receiving numerous requests for screenplays, including several adaptations of novels. In 2010, he released his directorial debut, Jakarta Maghrib.|$|E
5|$|The League {{kicked off}} in September 1888, with Preston {{one of the}} 12 founder members. North End proved {{superior}} to their opponents, winning the title with several matches to spare. This allowed the club {{to concentrate on the}} FA Cup, which they duly won by defeating Wolverhampton Wanderers. In completing the League and Cup double Preston remained unbeaten for the entire season. The team, nicknamed the Invincibles, contained ten Scots, tempted south by the money on offer as professionalism was still banned in Scotland. Wishing for a grander gesture to celebrate his team's success than the League committee's <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flag bearing the club's name, Sudell convinced the League to spend 50 guineas on a trophy. However, despite being responsible for the creation of the trophy, Preston North End have not won it since.|$|E
5|$|A fan of {{professional}} wrestling {{from an early}} age, James attended a professional wrestling school in the Washington, D.C. area at the <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend. She made her professional debut on the independent circuit in 1999, as a valet for KYDA Pro Wrestling under the ring name Alexis Laree, a name created {{as the result of}} a combination of her stage name from when she was a dancer and her middle name. Laree went on to manage several male wrestlers, including managing Tommy Dreamer to win the KYDA Pro Heavyweight Championship. In March, she wrestled in her first match, an intergender tag team match with Jake Damian against American Mike Brown and Candie. She trained to improve her wrestling abilities by attending training camps such as the Funking Conservatory, a workshop run by Dory Funk Jr., and an Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) dojo. She also started competing for Maryland Championship Wrestling (MCW), where she trained at camps run by Ricky Morton and Bobby Eaton. Beginning in 2002, she also made appearances for Ring of Honor.|$|E

5|$|Rymkus {{was born}} in Royalton, Illinois, {{the son of a}} Lithuanian {{immigrant}} coal miner who owned a small grocery store. After his father was shot and killed outside the grocery store, Rymkus and his family moved to the Back of the Yards neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. With family finances tight, he took a number of odd jobs, including working as a laborer and delivering newspapers and groceries. At the <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend, Rymkus attended Tilden Tech, now known as Tilden High School, and began to display talent as a lineman on the school's football team. He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin High, a play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career. Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football, track and wrestling teams. As a senior, he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep-school wrestling title.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Goble and Williams {{was such that}} it was later alleged that {{government}} practice was {{to ensure that they}} were never in the country at the same time. In October 1921, Goble was posted to Britain for a naval co-operation course; his place on the Air Board was taken by Squadron Leader Bill Anderson. Goble married Kathleen Wodehouse in London on Anzac Day, 1922, and returned to Australia later that year. His first term as CAS began when Williams left the country in December 1922 for study in England. Goble developed a plan to establish a small seaplane base at Rushcutters Bay in Sydney, but Williams cancelled this shortly after he returned to Australia in February 1925 to resume the position of CAS. Goble's <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> separate Fleet Air Arm fostered suspicions that he was too closely aligned with naval interests. He departed for England to undertake study at the British Army Staff College in Camberley and RAF Staff College, Andover, as Williams had done two years before. Goble also served as Air Liaison Officer with the Australian High Commission in London from May 1926 to September 1927. He was promoted to group captain on 1 April 1928.|$|E
5|$|Things {{come to a}} {{head the}} day after the party. As Cassandra uses a voodoo doll on Masha, trying to dissuade {{thoughts}} of selling the house, Sonia receives {{a phone call from a}} man she met at the party, requesting a date. Hesitantly, she accepts. Vanya, who is secretly writing a play inspired by Konstantin's imagined symbolist drama in The Seagull, is convinced by Nina to let her read it in front of the others. During the reading (which stars Nina as a molecule and takes place after the destruction of the earth), Spike rudely answers a text on his phone, and dismisses Vanya's <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> handwritten response. Vanya reacts by launching into an impassioned rant, criticizing America's cultural regression in communication and media, while fondly and wistfully recalling the surroundings and memories of his childhood. Concluding that the intent of such progress seems to make people like him feel lost and forgotten, he retreats into the kitchen in tears.|$|E

However, in reality, most of those heroes did not wear uniforms.|$|E
