5000|$|The <b>self-accelerating</b> <b>decomposition</b> <b>{{temperature}}</b> (SADT) is {{the lowest}} temperature at which an organic peroxide in a typical vessel or shipping package will undergo a self-accelerating decomposition within one week. [...] The SADT is {{the point at which}} the heat evolution from the decomposition reaction and the heat removal rate from the package of interest become unbalanced. When the heat removal is too low, the temperature in the package increases and the rate of decomposition increases in an uncontrollable manner. The result is therefore dependent on the formulation and the package characteristics.|$|E
50|$|All {{peroxides}} {{contain an}} oxygen-oxygen bond that, on heating, can break apart homolytically to generate two radicals. As mentioned previously, this decomposition also generates heat. But {{the stability of}} the oxygen-oxygen bond is dependent on what else is present in the molecule. Some peroxides, due to their chemical make-up, are very unstable and need to be refrigerated to avoid a self-accelerating decomposition. Others, particularly those used for crosslinking purposes, are much more stable and can be stored at normal ambient temperatures without risk of self-acceleration. Due to the large variations in the stabilities of peroxides, each is tested to determine the safe maximum temperature for which the peroxide may be stored, shipped, and handled. The result of this test is the <b>self-accelerating</b> <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperature</b> (SADT).|$|E

In {{order to reduce the}} risk, it is always mixed with different plasticizers during the production, transportation and storage. To research the different influence of plasticizers on CYHPO when it out of control and analyzing the thermal hazard of it, the runaway reaction of CYHPO (sampleA), mixture of CYHPO and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in the same mass (sampleB), mixture of CYHPO and diethylene glycol dibenzoate (DEDB) in the same mass (sampleC), mixture which is mixed by half of mass CYHPO, quarter of mass DBP and quarter of mass DEDB (sampleD) are simulated by Accelerating Rate Calorimeter(ARC). From the test data, the comparison of the initial temperatures and the temperature rise rates of four samples were judged by Origin 8. 6, and the reaction order, the activation energy of four samples were calculated by rate constant model. Then thermal decomposition characteristic data under adiabatic conditions could be modified by thermal inertia factor, and the <b>self-accelerating</b> <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperatures</b> (SADT) were calculated by Semenov model. The results showed that mixture of DBP and DEDB can reduce the thermal hazards efficaciously.

50|$|As peroxo compound, TBPB {{contains}} about 8.16 wt% of active oxygen {{and has a}} self accelerating <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperature</b> (SADT) of about 60 °C. The SADT is the lowest <b>temperature</b> at which <b>self-accelerating</b> <b>decomposition</b> in the transport packaging can occur within a week, and which should not be exceeded while storage or transportation. TBPB should therefore be stored between minimum 10 °C (below solidification) and maximum 50 °C. Dilution with a high-boiling solvent increases the SADT. The half-life of TBPB, in which 50% of the peroxy ester is decomposed, is 10 hours at 104 °C, one hour at 124 °C and one minute at 165 °C. Amines, metal ions, strong acids and bases, as well as strong reducing and oxidizing agents accelerate the decomposition of TBPB even in low concentrations. However, TBPB {{is one of the}} safest peresters or organic peroxides in handling.

In recent years, {{it has caused}} many thermal explosion and runaway reaction accidents in manufacturing processes.

The apparent activation energy (Ea) obtained by the integral isoconversional non-isothermal method based on Kooij formula is used to check the constancy and validity of apparent activation energy by the differential/integral method based on Kooij formula. The most probable mechanism function of thermal decomposition reaction of HNIW is determined by a logical choice method.

40|$|HNF (hydrazinium nitroformate) and ADN (ammonium dinitramide) {{are seen}} as {{possible}} replacements for the common oxidizer ammonium perchlorate (AP) in composite rocket propellants. Both HNF and ADN have the relatively great advantage to be chlorine free. But their chemical stability is {{much lower than the}} one of AP. In spite of this they are still on the list as replacement candidates. This paper intends to review and compile essential features in stability, compatibility and decomposition behavior of the two candidates. HNF alone can be seen as relatively stable at temperatures up to 50 °C. But it shows <b>self-accelerating</b> <b>decomposition</b> behaviour. In such a case normally stabilizers help to suppress autocatalytic behaviour. However, a look on the possible decomposition behaviour reveals that HNF seems not stabilizable. Further problems are chemical compatibility and too high pressure exponents of the propellant formulations. ADN can be qualified as medium stable at lower temperatures similar to NC-based products. Also ADN shows <b>self-accelerated</b> <b>decomposition,</b> but it can be stabilized. Some stabilizers are superior. From the results presented one can conclude that ADN has a perspective to replace AP in propellants designed for selected applications. A ‘universal’ application seems at time not realistic.

50|$|Unlike {{most other}} chemicals, {{the purpose of}} a {{peroxide}} is to decompose. In doing so it generates useful radicals that can initiate polymerization to make polymers, modify polymers by grafting or visbreaking, or cross-link polymers to create a thermoset. When used for these purposes, the peroxide is highly diluted, so the heat generated by the exothermic decomposition is safely absorbed by the surrounding medium (e.g. polymer compound or emulsion). But when a peroxide is in a more pure form, the heat evolved by its decomposition may not dissipate as quickly as it is generated, which can result in increasing temperature, which further intensifies the rate of exothermic decomposition. This can create a dangerous situation known as a <b>self-accelerating</b> <b>decomposition.</b>|$|R
40|$|Insight of {{the thermal}} {{characteristics}} and potential flame spread over lithium-ion battery (LIB) modules {{is important for}} designing battery thermal management system and fire protection measures. Such thermal characteristics and potential flame spread are also dependent on the different anode and cathode materials {{as well as the}} electrolyte. In the present study, thermal behavior and flame propagation over seven 50 A h Li(Ni 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3) O 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 large format LIBs arranged in rhombus and parallel layouts were investigated by directly heating one of the battery units. Such batteries have already been used commercially for energy storage while relatively little is known about its safety features in connection with potential runaway caused fire and explosion hazards. It was found in the present heating tests that fire-impingement resulted in elevated temperatures in the immediate vicinity of the LIBs that were in the range of between 200 °C and 900 °C. Such temperature aggravated thermal runaway (TR) propagation, resulting in rapid temperature rise within the battery module and even explosions after 20 min of “smoldering period”. The thermal runaway and subsequent fire and explosion observed in the heating test was attributed to the violent reduction of the cathode material which coexisted with the electrolyte when the temperature exceeded 260 °C. Separate laboratory tests, which measured the heat and gases generation from samples of the anode and cathode materials using C 80 calorimeter, provided insight of the physical-chemistry processes inside the battery when the temperature reaches between 30 °C and 300 °C. The <b>self-accelerating</b> <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperature</b> of the cell, regarded as the critical temperature to trigger TR propagation, was calculated as 126. 1 and 139. 2 °C using the classical Semenov and Frank-Kamenetskii models and the measurements of the calorimeter with the samples.

The events leading to the explosions in the test for the rhombus layout was further analyzed and two possible explanations were postulated and analyzed based on either internal catalytic reactions or Boiling Liquid Expansion Vapor Explosion (BLEVE) ...|$|E

30|$|We {{have shown}} that {{physical}} properties of the sample such as particle size, carrier gas composition and flow rate, {{as well as the}} geometry of the instrument used, have a large effect on the <b>temperature</b> of a <b>decomposition</b> reaction. The large difference in <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperatures</b> that can be caused by these effects demonstrate the difficulties in developing an analytical model that predicts the change in onset temperatures for minerals under low pressure based on equilibrium thermodynamic properties. However, the fact that the overall shape of the predicted difference in onset temperature is similar demonstrates that equilibrium thermodynamics does predict the measured changes in <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperature</b> to some degree. Furthermore, although {{there appears to be a}} loose trend of an increase in the difference of <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperature</b> at different pressures as the <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperature</b> under terrestrial conditions increases, there is no good empirical fit to the data that would permit predicting the change in <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperature</b> at different pressures.

30|$|Thermal {{analysis}} instruments {{have been}} used on Mars by the Viking, Phoenix, and MSL missions. These instruments can be very useful in identifying volatile-bearing minerals such as carbonates, sulfates, or phyllosilicates down to very low abundances. Mineral identification is done by comparing thermal decomposition behavior of samples with known mineralogy to samples with unknown mineralogy. However, thermal decomposition behavior can change with instrument conditions such as pressure and sample properties such as particle size. The Mars instruments flown to date have used much lower pressures and flow rates than traditional laboratory experiments. The objective of this work was to investigate whether an analytical model based on equilibrium thermodynamics can accurately predict changes in <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperature</b> in instruments operating under lower pressure/flow conditions. We find that while the model predicts the general trend that <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperature</b> drops with decreasing pressure, the difference between modeled and measured temperatures {{can be on the}} order of 100 °C for carbonates and sulfates. These differences can be explained by factors such as sample particle size, carrier gas species, gas flow rate, and oven volume. A calcium carbonate sample shows how particle size can change <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperature</b> by almost 200 °C (<b>decomposition</b> <b>temperatures</b> decrease with decreasing particle size) and that carrier gas species, flow rate, and instrument geometry can affect <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperatures</b> by 20 - 50 °C. These results demonstrate that predicting changes in <b>decomposition</b> <b>temperature</b> based on a thermodynamic or empirical model is not sufficient and that samples must be run under instrument conditions relevant to the instrument that produced the data on Mars. Furthermore, the effects of particle size, carrier gas species and flow rate, as well as instrument geometry {{must be taken into account}} in order to compare Mars data to samples run in terrestrial labs. This work shows the magnitude of these factors, demonstrating why they must be taken into account, providing a framework for how to correctly interpret thermal analysis data from Mars.|$|R
