40|$|A {{new report}} {{published}} {{today by the}} European Network on Statelessness and aditus foundation {{on the use of}} detention of <b>stateless</b> <b>persons</b> in Malta, reveals that the widespread use of administrative detention has a severe impact on <b>stateless</b> <b>persons.</b> The absence of procedures to identify and recognize statelessness results in detention that in many cases is not in conformity with Malta’s human rights obligations. Furthermore, <b>stateless</b> <b>persons</b> are unable to receive any form of legal and social protection since their status remains largely unidentified. The report is nonetheless optimistic that up-coming changes to Malta’s detention regime, as also possible steps towards the 1954 Stateless Convention, could result in dramatic changes to the way <b>stateless</b> <b>persons</b> are treated.

5000|$|In {{international}} law, statelessness is {{the lack}} of citizenship. A <b>stateless</b> <b>person</b> is someone who is [...] "not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law". Some <b>stateless</b> <b>persons</b> are also refugees. However, not all refugees are <b>stateless,</b> and many <b>persons</b> who are <b>stateless</b> have never crossed an international border.|$|R
50|$|The International Law Commission, at {{its fifth}} session in 1953, {{produced}} both a Draft Convention on the Elimination of Future Statelessness and a Draft Convention on the Reduction of Future Statelessness. ECOSOC approved both drafts. In 1954, the UN adopted the Convention {{relating to the}} Status of <b>Stateless</b> <b>Persons.</b> This convention provided a definition of a <b>stateless</b> <b>person</b> (which has since become part of customary international law, according to the International Law Commission) and set {{out a number of}} rights that <b>stateless</b> <b>persons</b> should enjoy. The convention thus became the basis for an international protection regime for <b>stateless</b> <b>persons.</b> However, {{in order to ensure that}} the rights enumerated in the convention are protected, states need to be able to identify stateless individuals.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The European Union and Statelessness According to International law, in principle, {{questions}} of nationality {{fall within the}} domestic jurisdiction of each State. For this reason, {{it is not surprising}} that the EU lacks a specific competence for a comprehensive regulation of the legal status of <b>stateless</b> <b>persons.</b> However, it should be noted that the Lisbon treaty provided, in article 67 TFEU, that <b>stateless</b> <b>persons</b> shall be treated as third-country nationals for the purpose of the area of Freedom, Security and Justice. After having investigated the (few) strengths and the (many) weaknesses of the EU’s action with respect to statelessness, this paper concentrates on the prospects of improvement of the legal status of <b>stateless</b> <b>persons.</b> To reach this goal, the regular residence of the <b>stateless</b> <b>person</b> in the territory of a Member State seems to be the basic precondition of EU’s intervention...|$|R
