50|$|On 24 November 2015, the Marines {{selected}} the SAIC Terrex, {{along with the}} BAE Systems/Iveco SuperAV, {{to move on to}} the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the ACV 1.1 program. SAIC was awarded a $121.5 million contract to build 16 vehicles by late 2016 for testing, which will begin in early 2017 and last one year. The Terrex submitted for the ACV program, called the Terrex 2, is designed to enhance situational awareness, with the troop commander's station equipped with a screen covering all aspects outside the vehicle, also visible to the squad to enable them to see what they would be exiting to. The driverâ€™s station is equipped with several screens with obstacle avoidance, <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>sensor</b> feeds, and other features. Although the Terrex is specialised in ground operations, it also meets the minimum requirements for safe sea operation. The Terrex has a V-over-V hull that creates a crush zone to reduce the impact of a blast on the floor; this creates a spacious interior. Footrests attached to seats across the aisle keep the Marines' feet from absorbing blast energy. The vehicle uses a central tire inflation system, can swim 7 mph in water, and has excess buoyancy of 23 percent. It weighs 32.5 tons (65,000 lb), carries three crew and 11 embarked Marines, and can reach 55 mph on paved roads. Between both vehicles (Terrex and SuperAV), a final winner is planned to be chosen in 2018. The winning company will build 204 vehicles, with the first entering service in 2020 and all delivered by 2023.|$|E

40|$|The complex {{interaction}} between the International Space Station (ISS) and the surrounding plasma environment often generates unpredictable environmental situations that affect operations. Examples of affected systems include extravehicular activity (EVA) safety, solar panel efficiency, and scientific instrument integrity. Models and heuristicallyderived best practices are wellsuited for routine operations, {{but when it comes}} to unusual or anomalous events or situations, especially those driven by space weather, there is no substitute for realtime monitoring. Space environment data collected in realtime (or nearreal time) can be used operationally for both realtime alarms and data sources in assimilative models to predict environmental conditions important for operational planning. Fixed space weather instruments mounted to the ISS can be used for monitoring the ambient space environment, but knowing whether or not (or to what extent) the ISS affects the measurements themselves requires adequate space situational awareness (SSA) local to the ISS. This paper presents a mission concept to use a suite of plasma instruments mounted at the end of the ISS robotic arm to systematically explore the {{interaction between the}} Space Station structure and its surrounding environment. The <b>Situational</b> <b>Awareness</b> <b>Sensor</b> Suite for the ISS (SASSI) would be deployed and operated on the ISS Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) for longterm "survey mode" observations and the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) for shortterm "campaign mode" observations. Specific areas of investigation include: 1) ISS frame and surface charging during perturbations of the local ISS space environment, 2) calibration of the ISS Floating Point Measurement Unit (FPMU), 3) long baseline measurements of ambient ionospheric electric potential structures, 4) electromotive force-induced currents within large structures moving through a magnetized plasma, and 5) wakeinduced ion waves in both electrostatic (i. e. particles) and electromagnetic modes.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedEven though {{success or failure}} depends on it, <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> in emergency operations centers is often poorly prioritized. These centers depend on <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> to manage information, coordinate resources, and support executive-level decision making. Having limited or poor <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> forces emergency responders to act without all the information needed to make good decisions, leading to poor coordination and ineffective response. In order to identify opportunities for improving <b>situational</b> <b>awareness,</b> this thesis used a qualitative case study approach to examine the level of importance <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> plays in the emergency operations center during disasters, and to identify both good and poor practices. Examining four case studies through an organizational-change analytic framework revealed that <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> is a system of interconnected elements that include task, structure, people, and technology. This thesis concludes that <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> in the emergency operations center can be improved by employing an emergency operations center <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> organizational model.

It is stated that collective sensemaking is a vulnerable process which is dependent upon favourable conditions in several domains simultaneously.

40|$|In {{order to}} operate safely civil {{aviation}} is increasingly reliant on {{the collection and}} provision of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness.</b> This <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> is fed to the pilot who uses it {{to know what is}} going on around them and minimise the risk of a dangerous situation occurring. Since their inception military commanders have long used unmanned aerial systems to provide <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> (namely imagery) of remote areas. This <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information is transmit- ted back to them over military data-links so they can use it to make decisions, coordinate forces and plan strategies. However times are changing, or to be more specific the number and variety of decision-makers on the ground, who require <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information generated on airborne platforms, are increasing. The September 11 th 2001 attacks using hijacked aircraft has meant that security is now playing a greater role in aviation alongside safety. Multiple decision-makers on the ground from political heads to air defence commanders now also want access to <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information on the aircraft. Which means that in addition to the flow of safety related <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information to the pilot there will need to be a whole new flow of security information from the aircraft to decision-makers on the ground. The same style of shift is occurring in the military UAS community as a result of implementing the twin doctrines of network centric operations and power to the edge. This means providing a greater amount of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> to lower level decision-makers (soldiers in the field). Which means that instead of providing just one feed to a commander, the unmanned aerial system now has to supply imagery to multiple receivers all of whom could have different <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> needs. This thesis addresses those points and proposes using on-board processing systems for both platform types to create <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information streams capable of simultaneously meeting the requirements of multiple decision-makers. This is accomplished with the use of fuzzy inference systems to turn raw sensor information into pieces of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> that can be acted upon by decision-makers. These systems look for anomalous activity in passenger behaviour, which could indicate a security situation is occurring. It also proposes a method that allows decision-makers to tailor an imagery system to their needs rather than forcing decision- makers to use a one-size fits-all type of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> provision system. The results of this thesis show that using historical patterns of behaviour and scenario generation airborne systems can be built to meet the new needs of multiple decision-makers on the ground. Techniques such as fuzzy inference systems can be tailored to perform the collection and processing of data into <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information allowing it to be communicated over existing bandwidth limited connections. Therefore the overall hypothesis of this thesis is that there are evolving <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> needs that existing systems cannot meet and that through onboard <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> collec- tion and processing systems, ground-based decision-makers can obtain the <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information they need even over the existing bandwidth limited communications channels.

However, current research has not proven beneficial in determining the factors that underpin <b>situational</b> <b>awareness.</b> This study examined <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> among licensed captains and pilots of the inland towing industry. Twenty towboat captains, who operate on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) from New Orleans, LA to Houston, TX and who represented 16 towing vessel companies, were interviewed and participated in an integrated survey that explored fatigue, communication, dangerous drugs and alcohol, social stress, and mental workload. These factors were believed to have a direct influence on <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> among towing vessel captains. These factors were compared and resulted in the identification of mental workload as the predominant factor affecting <b>situational</b> <b>awareness.</b> Upon further examination of mental workload, it was found that loss of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> is likely to occur when a towing vessel captain is distracted by a cell phone conversation with their company or steers his or her tow in the vicinity of recreational vessels. In addition, the results also indicated complacency potential, a function of attitude toward automation and perception of mental workload. It was concluded that outreach and education to recreational boaters, establishing procedures for business conversations, navigation simulators, drills, and strategic thinking could be effective counter-measures against the loss of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> induced by mental workload.
