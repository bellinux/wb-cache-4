40|$|Three {{different}} dosing modes, {{including one}} single dosing <b>mode</b> and two <b>sequential</b> dosing <b>modes,</b> were applied in high-arsenic contaminated water treatment. The results illustrated that the As (V) soluble and the As (V) nonspecifically sorbed were the insignificant species from Fe-As (V) samples in the <b>sequential</b> dosing <b>mode,</b> {{while they were}} higher in the single dosing mode. However, it could be further concluded that the mobility of the Fe-As (V) in <b>sequential</b> dosing <b>mode</b> was greater than that in single dosing mode. Besides, the main arsenic speciation governing the arsenic-borne coagulates was the As (V) associated with poorly crystalline hydrous oxides of Fe in sequential or single dosing mode. Moreover, the particle size distribution analysis indicated that the <b>sequential</b> dosing <b>mode</b> was more prevalent in neutralizing and adsorbing the As (V) compared with the single dosing mode. In the FT-IR spectra, the presence of arsenic was highlighted by a well resolved band at 825 – 829 cm− 1. The positions of the As–O stretching vibration bands were shifted gradually as the dosing mode changed from the single to the sequential. This result could be related to the distribution of arsenic speciation in different dosing modes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Surveys {{of doctors}} are an {{important}} data collection method in health services research. Ways to improve response rates, minimise survey response bias and item non-response, within a given budget, have not previously been addressed in the same study. The aim {{of this paper is}} to compare the effects and costs of three different modes of survey administration in a national survey of doctors. Methods A stratified random sample of 4. 9 % (2, 702 / 54, 160) of doctors undertaking clinical practice was drawn from a national directory of all doctors in Australia. Stratification was by four doctor types: general practitioners, specialists, specialists-in-training, and hospital non-specialists, and by six rural/remote categories. A three-arm parallel trial design with equal randomisation across arms was used. Doctors were randomly allocated to: online questionnaire (902); simultaneous mixed mode (a paper questionnaire and login details sent together) (900); or, <b>sequential</b> mixed <b>mode</b> (online followed by a paper questionnaire with the reminder) (900). Analysis was by intention to treat, as within each primary mode, doctors could choose either paper or online. Primary outcome measures were response rate, survey response bias, item non-response, and cost. Results The online mode had a response rate 12. 95 %, followed by the simultaneous mixed mode with 19. 7 %, and the <b>sequential</b> mixed <b>mode</b> with 20. 7 %. After adjusting for observed differences between the groups, the online mode had a 7 percentage point lower response rate compared to the simultaneous mixed mode, and a 7. 7 percentage point lower response rate compared to <b>sequential</b> mixed <b>mode.</b> The difference in response rate between the <b>sequential</b> and simultaneous <b>modes</b> was not statistically significant. Both mixed modes showed evidence of response bias, whilst the characteristics of online respondents were similar to the population. However, the online mode had a higher rate of item non-response compared to both mixed modes. The total cost of the online survey was 38 % lower than simultaneous mixed mode and 22 % lower than <b>sequential</b> mixed <b>mode.</b> The cost of the <b>sequential</b> mixed <b>mode</b> was 14 % lower than simultaneous mixed mode. Compared to the online <b>mode,</b> the <b>sequential</b> mixed <b>mode</b> was the most cost-effective, although exhibiting some evidence of response bias. Conclusions Decisions on which survey mode to use depend on response rates, response bias, item non-response and costs. The <b>sequential</b> mixed <b>mode</b> appears to be the most cost-effective mode of survey administration for surveys of the population of doctors, if one is prepared to accept a degree of response bias. Online surveys are not yet suitable to be used exclusively for surveys of the doctor population. </p...|$|R

For each L/R, specific h/R regions could be found in which the structure can be analyzed simply with an equivalent beam model.
