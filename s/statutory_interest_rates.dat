Usually lower <b>statutory</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> apply under the County Court (Interest on Judgment Debts) Order 1991, but this it excluded judgment debts on consumer credit agreements under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. So the bank wanted condition 8 {{to get the money}} it would have in interest even after someone had been unable to pay. Under r 8 of the 1994 Reg’s (now r 12) the DG sought an injunction to stop the bank using the term, because it was unfair. Lord Goodhart submitted that the term merely concerned the adequacy of the bank’s remuneration, therefore fell under r 3(2) (now r 6(2)). The DG submitted it was a core term and unfair because complaints were made and the 1991 Order had excluded interest.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of tribunals, mainly those {{deciding}} investment disputes, have re-examined traditional practices concerning the awarding of interest, particularly whether interest should be awarded at market rates and on a compounded basis. However, many tribunals deciding transnational contracts disputes continue to follow the practice of applying national laws on interest, which often results {{in the application of}} domestic <b>statutory</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> calling for a fixed rate of interest to accrue on a simple as opposed to compound basis. These statutory rates often do not change to reflect economic conditions and thus may under compensate or over compensate a claimant. I argue that when tribunals award interest in both international investment disputes and transnational contract disputes they should strive to fully compensate the aggrieved party for the loss of the use of its money. In many cases then, they should award interest at a market rate and on a compound basis. I begin the article by providing an overview of interest and a brief comparative study of laws providing for its payment, the period during which interest should accrue, and the rate of interest. I then compare the practice of awarding interest in international commercial disputes and international investment disputes. I conclude by offering a proposal that essentially provides a framework for awarding interest as damages and achieves the goal of awarding interest to make a party whole after being deprived of the opportunity to earn a return on the use of its money...|$|E

25|$|Prior to 2009 {{regulation}} of consumer credit was primarily {{conducted by the}} states and territories. Some states such as New South Wales and Queensland legislated effective annual <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> caps of 48%. In 2008 the Australian states and territories referred powers of consumer credit to the Commonwealth. In 2009 the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth) was introduced, which initially treated payday lenders no differently from all other lenders. In 2013 Parliament tightened regulation on the payday lending further introducing the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Act 2012 (Cth) which imposed an effective APR cap of 48% for all consumer credit contracts (inclusive of all fees and charges). Payday lenders who provided a loan falling within {{the definition of a}} small amount credit contract (SACC), defined as a contract provided by a non authorised-deposit taking institution for less than $2,000 for a term between 16 days and 1 year, are permitted to charge a 20% establishment fee in addition to monthly (or part thereof) fee of 4% (effective 48% p.a.). Payday lenders who provide a loan falling within the definition of a medium amount credit contract (MACC), defined as a credit contract provided by a non-deposit taking institution for between $2,000–$5,000 may charge a $400 establishment fee in addition to the <b>statutory</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> cap of 48%.

40|$|The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{awarded to}} {{appraisal}} petitioners has recently become a surprising source of controversy. Since 2007, Delaware has presumptively awarded dissenting stockholders prejudgment <b>interest</b> at a <b>rate</b> equal to 5 % above the prevailing federal funds rate. In other work, we have documented a marked increase in appraisal activity {{that began in}} 2011. Despite evidence that petitioners target low-premium transactions and insider privatizations, some practitioner and judicial commentary {{has suggested that the}} <b>statutory</b> <b>interest</b> regime may be driving this increase. In 2015, Delaware’s blue-ribbon corporate law Council proposed a sensible amendment to the <b>statutory</b> <b>interest</b> regime, but it languished through one legislative session, and the issue is again poised for reconsideration. Selecting the appropriate <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is a complex and under-examined issue in the optimal design of legal remedies. We argue that the primary goal of interest in appraisal — or any form of prejudgment interest — is to make parties to the dispute indifferent to the passage of time, with no incentive either to drag out or cut short the proceeding. We propose an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> regime that builds upon the 2015 Council proposal and promotes time-indifference and dispute resolution. Like the Council, we argue that the respondent companies should be given a unilateral option to make an initial payment to dissenting stockholders that would stop the running of interest on the amount paid. To preserve balanced risk for both sides, the initial payment should not constitute a concession about the minimum amount of fair value, and companies should be entitled to recover from petitioners if the trial judgment is lower than the initial payment. We propose two additional and important features: First, the right to make such a payment to dissenting stockholders should be limited to a discrete 30 -day window following the close of the transaction. This ensures that the prepayment right furthers time indifference and is not just a tool of tactical gamesmanship. Second, the prevailing <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> should be equal to the target company’s weighted average cost of capital. This would have beneficial effects on both parties: it would make the surviving company indifferent between paying the fair value after judgment and making an initial payment, and it would also encourage dissenters to be reasonable about litigating in hopes of obtaining more than the initial payment...|$|R
