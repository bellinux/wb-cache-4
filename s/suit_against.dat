5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: an in rem <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> the ship, and an in personam <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E

5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E

On the same day that Taft's ruling was issued, Taylor filed suit in Jefferson County circuit court against Beckham and Adjutant General John Breckinridge Castleman to prevent them from exercising any {{authority}} due the offices they claimed. Unaware of Taylor's suit, Beckham filed <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> Taylor for possession of the capitol and executive building in Franklin County circuit court – a court believed to be favorable to the Democratic cause. Marshall also filed <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> Beckham and state senator L. H. Carter to prevent them from exercising any authority in the state senate, where the lieutenant governor was the presiding officer.|$|E

25|$|While—under Ex parte Young—tribes may obtain some prospective, {{equitable}} relief in <b>suits</b> nominally <b>against</b> state officials (generally, for treaty rights), the Supreme Court in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe (1997) held that state sovereign immunity barred not only quiet title suits but also <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> state officials which would constitute {{the equivalent of}} quiet title. Although Coeur d'Alene involved sovereign title to a lake bed, this precedent {{has been applied to}} bar even <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> states in their capacity as ordinary property owners.|$|R

40|$|Under {{international}} law, official-capacity <b>suits</b> brought <b>against</b> {{a foreign}} state’s officers {{are treated as}} <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> the state itself and thus as subject to the state’s immunity, even in suits alleging human rights abuses. This immunity regime differs from the immunity regime that applies in the United States in <b>suits</b> brought <b>against</b> {{state and federal officials}} for violations of federal law. Despite the federal government’s sovereign immunity and the immunity of state governments under Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, courts often allow <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> federal and state officers for their official actions. This essay attempts to explain why the immunity rules differ between the two regimes. We begin by showing that the differential treatment of foreign and domestic officer suits has deep roots in British and American common law. We then show that Congress has not acted to alter this common law backdrop, and we explain the significance of this fact. Finally, we discuss functional reasons for the long-time differential treatment of <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> domestic and foreign officials...|$|R
