5|$|In August 1981 {{the program}} {{received}} a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers promised {{by a large}} production run, {{and the fact that}} the US was <b>shouldering</b> the expense of development. Under the agreement BAe was relegated to the position of a subcontractor, instead of the full partner status that would have been the case had the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in man-hours, 40 percent of the airframe work-share. Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to Rolls-Royce, which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to Pratt & Whitney. The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.|$|E
5|$|By the First Test at Trent Bridge, Miller was <b>shouldering</b> most of {{the bowling}} load. He sent down 52 overs in a rain-affected match, taking match figures of 6/127. He {{struggled}} with the bat, making a duck and four. The teams headed to Lord's where Miller had to carry the pace attack without the injured Davidson and Lindwall. Crawford and Ken Mackay were called in to make their debut and support Miller with the pace duties. Australia batted first and Miller managed 28. Australia managed only 285 and Crawford injured himself, exacerbating the burden on Miller. Miller had Peter Richardson and then bowled Tom Graveney with an outswinger. England were 2/32 and their captain Peter May received an inswinger from Miller first ball, which he inside edged onto his stumps, but the bail was not dislodged. The next day, Miller beat May four times and then had Watson caught in the gully in his third over. He then removed Bailey and Trueman. Miller's 5/72 was largely responsible for England falling for 171. Australia was in difficulty at 3/69 when Miller came to bat, hitting a counterattacking 30. Australia set England 371 to win. Miller removed Graveney {{at the start of}} the run chase. Resuming the next morning, he bowled Watson, and had May and Evans both caught behind. He bowled Johnny Wardle and took his only ten-wicket match haul in Tests. Australia won by 185runs and Miller had bowled 70.1overs for the match. His knee had taken a heavy toll and Miller was given an extended break had to play purely as a batsman in the Third Test at Headingley. Australia were caught on a wet wicket in response to England's 325, and Miller top-scored with 41 and Australia were forced to follow on. He had attempted to keep Laker and Lock at bay with his pads. In the second innings, Miller fell for 26 to Laker. Australia lost by an innings, for the first time in a Test in 18years.|$|E

40|$|Altered neuromuscular control due to {{compromised}} position sense {{may contribute}} to <b>shoulder</b> instability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects exhibit larger errors than intact <b>shoulder</b> subjects in kinesthetically guided active positioning and reaching that are of greater functional significance than passive testing of <b>shoulder</b> position sense. Ten subjects with a history of anterior <b>shoulder</b> dislocation and 15 intact <b>shoulder</b> subjects participated in the study. <b>Shoulder</b> position sense was examined with three different protocols (imposed motion to remembered <b>shoulder</b> rotation angles and active <b>shoulder</b> abduction/rotation to verbally specified positions) with targets located in both the mid- and end-range of rotation. Three dimensional end-point accuracy of kinesthetically guided reaches to visually specified targets, along with the <b>shoulder</b> rotation angle and scapula orientations at the end-point, were also analyzed. In agreement with previous studies, unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects exhibited significantly larger errors in perception of <b>shoulder</b> joint angles than healthy controls in a protocol involving imposed motion to remembered <b>shoulder</b> rotation angles. However, the clinical significance of the observed deficit is questionable because the averaged rms error differences between unstable and intact <b>shoulders</b> were relatively small (average: 1. 8 °). During tests of active positioning, unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects were able to move the <b>shoulder</b> to verbally defined angles as accurately as healthy controls in both <b>shoulder</b> abduction and rotation. Unstable and intact <b>shoulder</b> subjects exhibited similar reaching accuracy and scapular orientations in the kinesthetically guided reaching test, but unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects consistently used less <b>shoulder</b> rotation angle than healthy controls. However, they were able to point to a remembered target as accurately as intact <b>shoulder</b> subjects, suggesting that a different reaching strategy was adopted by unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects to minimize <b>shoulder</b> rotation. Results of this study show that unstable <b>shoulder</b> subjects can perceive <b>shoulder</b> angles and reach to visually specified targets in space as accurately as healthy controls in functional activities with voluntarily arm movements.

40|$|Background. Altered neuromuscular control due to {{compromised}} joint position sense {{may contribute}} to recurrent <b>shoulder</b> instability. Objective. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine whether individuals with anterior <b>shoulder</b> instability exhibit larger <b>shoulder</b> position sense errors than those with healthy <b>shoulders</b> in both passive matching and active positioning. Design. This was a between-groups study with repeated measures. Methods. Ten people with anterior <b>shoulder</b> instability and 15 people with healthy <b>shoulders</b> participated in the study. <b>Shoulder</b> position sense was examined with 3 different protocols (passive motion to remembered <b>shoulder</b> rotation angles and active <b>shoulder</b> abduction and rotation to verbally specified positions) in posi-tions of both mid-range and end-range of motion. Results. Participants with unstable <b>shoulders</b> exhibited significantly larger errors (by 1. 8 ° on average) in perception of <b>shoulder</b> position compared with those with healthy <b>shoulders</b> during passive matching. During active positioning, participants with unstable <b>shoulders</b> were able to voluntarily move the <b>shoulder</b> to verbally specified angles as accurately as those with healthy <b>shoulders</b> in both abduction (0. 85 ° difference) and rotation (0. 99 ° difference) tasks. Conclusions. Results of this study indicate that people with unstable <b>shoulders</b> can perceive <b>shoulder</b> angles as accurately as people with healthy <b>shoulders</b> in activities with voluntary arm movements. Compared with passive matching, better information from muscle spindles and other sources during voluntary arm move-ments may compensate for the potential joint position sense deficits after the injury.

Following the Mongol invasions of 1274 and 1281, smiths aimed at producing stronger swords that would pierce the heavy armour of the invaders. To achieve this, tachi became wider, thicker with an overall grand appearance (sugata) and a straight temper line. With the Mongol threat dissipated {{at the end of the}} Kamakura period, this trend was partially reversed, as blades grew longer with a more dignified shape than those from the mid-Kamakura period. However the so-called [...] "unchangeable smiths", including Rai Kunitoshi, Rai Kunimitsu, Osafune Nagamitsu and Osafune Kagemitsu, continued to produce swords of the elegant style of the late Heian/early Kamakura period. These swords were particularly popular with Kyoto's aristocracy. The production of tantō daggers increased considerably towards the late Kamakura period. Master tantō makers include Awataguchi Yoshimitsu, Rai Kunitoshi, Shintōgo Kunimitsu, Osafune Kagemitsu, Etchū Norishige and Samonji. The naginata appeared as a new weapon in the late Kamakura period. The confrontation between the Northern and Southern Court resulted in a 60-year-long power struggle between warrior lords known as the Nanboku-chō period and caused a tremendous demand for swords. The stylistic trends of the Kamakura period continued, and tachi were characterized by magnificent shape, growing in overall length and the length of the point (kissaki). They were generally wide and disproportionately thin. Similarly tantō grew in size to [...] and became known as ko-wakizashi or sunnobi tantō (extended knives). But also tantō shorter than those of the Kamakura period were being forged. Enormous tachi called seoi-tachi (<b>shouldering</b> swords), nodachi (field swords) and ōdachi with blades [...] long were forged. The high demand for swords during feudal civil wars after 1467 (Sengoku period) resulted in mass production and low quality swords as swordsmiths no longer refined their own steel.

40|$|Background: <b>Shoulder</b> pain is {{the most}} common and {{well-documented}} site of musculoskeletal pain in elite swimmers. Structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of elite swimmers’ symptomatic <b>shoulders</b> are common. Little has been documented about the association between MRI findings in the asymptomatic <b>shoulder</b> versus the symptomatic <b>shoulder.</b> Objective: To assess clinically relevant MRI findings in the <b>shoulders</b> of symptomatic and asymptomatic elite swimmers. Method: Twenty (aged 16 – 23 years) elite swimmers completed questionnaires on their swimming training, pain and <b>shoulder</b> function. MRI of both <b>shoulders</b> (n = 40) were performed and all swimmers were given a standardised clinical <b>shoulder</b> examination. Results: Both <b>shoulders</b> of 11 male and 9 female elite swimmers (n = 40) were examined. Eleven of the 40 <b>shoulders</b> were clinically symptomatic and 29 were asymptomatic. The most common clinical finding in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic <b>shoulders</b> was impingement during internal rotation, with impingement in 54. 5 % of the symptomatic <b>shoulders</b> and in 31. 0 % of the asymptomatic <b>shoulders.</b> The most common MRI findings in the symptomatic and asymptomatic <b>shoulders</b> were supraspinatus tendinosis (45. 5 % vs. 20. 7 %), subacromial subdeltoid fluid (45. 5 % vs. 34. 5 %), increased signal in the AC Joint (45. 5 % vs. 37. 9 %) and AC joint arthrosis (36. 4 % vs. 34. 5 %). Thirty-nine (97. 5 %) of the <b>shoulders</b> showed abnormal MRI features. Conclusion: MRI findings in the symptomatic and asymptomatic <b>shoulders</b> of young elite swimmers are similar and care should be taken when reporting <b>shoulder</b> MRIs in these athletes. Asymptomatic <b>shoulders</b> demonstrate manifold MRI abnormalities that may be radiologically significant but appear not to be clinically significant. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} and researches {{the influence}} of <b>shoulder</b> movement direction on different <b>shoulder</b> activities movements. Then present recommend of therapy treatment is based on findings. This research {{is divided into two}} parts. First, to find out effective <b>shoulder</b> movement direction that may be more effective therapy, emphasized on influence of range of <b>shoulder</b> motion. Second, indicate and estimate movement direction when and how <b>shoulder</b> muscles are used. Therefore, those findings in this paper can help us to avoid further hurts and can improve effect of therapy treatment. The experiment includes 5 groups, 50 normal people with healthy <b>shoulders,</b> are observed, aging from 40 to 60. There are 5 different kinds of <b>shoulder</b> movement direction, including <b>shoulder</b> abduction, forward flexion, backward extension, <b>shoulder</b> external rotation, and <b>shoulder</b> internal rotation. Based on individual group, patients would do one assigned <b>shoulder</b> movement direction, 3 to 5 minutes a time, twice a day, and total 4 weeks. Results indicate that there is interaction of treatment between <b>shoulder</b> abduction and forward flexion. In other words, when <b>shoulder</b> abduction is effective, range of motion of <b>shoulder</b> abduction increases, as well as range of motion of forward flexion. Doing flexion also increases range of motion of forward flexion and <b>shoulder</b> abduction. On the other hand, there is also interactive rotation and <b>shoulder</b> internal rotation. The results of EMG indicate that not only fewer muscles are used, but also smaller powers are released, because observed estimated IEMG become smaller. Therefore, muscles become stronger...|$|R
