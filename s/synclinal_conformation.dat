40|$|International audienceThe {{microwave}} {{spectrum of}} propargyl selenol, HC[triple bond]CCH(2) SeH, {{has been investigated}} in the 19 - 80 GHz spectral range at - 30 degrees C. The spectra of five isotopologues of one conformer, which has a <b>synclinal</b> <b>conformation</b> for the C-C-Se-H link of atoms, were assigned. This conformational preference allows {{for the formation of}} a weak intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydrogen atom of the selenol group and the pi electrons of the triple bond. This hydrogen-bonded conformer is at least 5 kJ/mol more stable than the rotamer having an antiperiplanar conformation for the C-C-Se-H chain. The microwave spectrum clearly shows that the hydrogen atom tunnels between the two mirror-image synclinal forms, but {{it was not possible to}} determine the tunneling frequency. The microwave study has been augmented by quantum chemical calculations at the MP 2 /aug-cc-pVTZ and B 3 LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ levels of theory. These calculations predict rotational and centrifugal distortion constants that are in good agreement with the experimental counterparts but predict a far too small energy difference of approximately 1. 5 kJ/mol for the energy difference between the antiperiplanar and synclinal forms. The conformational properties and internal hydrogen bonding of HC[triple bond]CCH(2) SeH are compared with similar properties of other selenols, which are stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds...|$|E

The macrocycle was nonaromatic and displayed absorption bands {{in the region of}} 420 - 550 nm. The molecular and electronic structure of the ferrocene-incorpdrated expanded porphyrin was investigated by DFT methods. The DFT calculations indicated a partially twisted structure of the molecule, and the extent of torsional distortion was larger than previously observed for ruthenocenoporphyrinoids and ferrocenothiaporphyrin. The HOMO and LUMO states that were obtained from the DFT calculations indicated partial charge density on all four pyrrole nitrogen atoms and the furanyl oxygen atom in the HOMO state and partial charge density on the alpha and beta carbon atoms in the LUMO state. In addition, the ferrocene moiety displayed the presence of partial charge density on the Fe atom and the cp rings in both the HOMO and LUMO states.

40|$|International audienceThe MW {{spectrum}} of propargyl thiocyanate (HC[triple bond]CCH(2) SC[triple bond]N) {{has been investigated}} {{for the first time}} in the 25 - 80 GHz spectral region at room temperature or at 0 degrees C. The spectra of the ground vibrational state and of the first excited state of the C-S torsional vibration have been assigned for one conformer. This rotamer, denoted ap, has a symmetry plane (C(s) symmetry) and an antiperiplanar arrangement for the C-C-S-C link of atoms. It has previously been claimed that a conformer that has a <b>synclinal</b> <b>conformation</b> for this chain of atoms is present in the gas in approximately the same concentration as ap (approximately 50 % of the gas), but this is not supported by the present experiments, where it is shown that the synclinal rotamer, denoted sc, cannot be present in a concentration exceeding 1 / 3 of the total. It is therefore concluded that ap must be at least 3. 0 kJ/mol more stable than sc.
