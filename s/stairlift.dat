50|$|These {{come under}} the general {{definition}} of <b>stairlift</b> and are usually of much heavier construction than a domestic <b>stairlift.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stairlifts {{are used}} by {{people of all ages}} and child car seats can usually be fixed a {{standard}} <b>stairlift</b> seat using the seat belt provided with the <b>stairlift</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Outdoor <b>Stairlifts</b> {{come with}} seats, perches, footplates or {{platforms}} and are sold worldwide. They {{are similar to}} indoor <b>stairlifts</b> but with improved weatherproofing.|$|R
50|$|Today, self-installation of <b>stairlifts</b> is {{becoming}} a common trend for people interested in DIY projects. <b>Stairlifts</b> are available for purchase that can be self-installed.|$|R
50|$|These are {{the most}} common type of <b>stairlifts</b> used in private {{dwellings}} with straight stairs and have a straight rail (track) which is attached to the steps of the staircase. Straight-rail <b>stairlifts</b> can usually be installed within days of being ordered and, having a rail which is simply cut to length from a stock part, they are the least expensive <b>stairlifts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Codes of {{practice}} and technical specifications apply to <b>stairlift</b> manufacture.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>stairlift</b> chairs {{can also}} be moved and used as indoor wheelchairs.|$|E
5000|$|Stairlifts {{normally}} have [...] "soft" [...] starts so the user is not jerked as the carriage starts to move.Typical travel speed for domestic straight rail <b>stairlift</b> carriages range between 0.07 m/s and 0.15 m/s (0.34 miles per hour). The speed of curved rail <b>stairlift</b> carriages may vary {{on the journey}} if the controls cause them to slow on inclines and bends.|$|E
50|$|The {{power rating}} of drive motors for {{domestic}} straight rail <b>stairlifts</b> may be around 250 watts.The power requirement will be greater for heavy loads, very steep inclines, and wheelchair platform <b>stairlifts.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Stairlifts</b> {{are largely}} {{operated}} using a {{control on the}} arm of the lift. This is either a switch or a toggle type lever. This larger toggle switch enables users even with limited mobility or painful condition to use <b>stairlifts</b> easily and safely.|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} produce <b>stairlifts</b> with trays {{instead of}} seats for moving goods between different levels, usually in commercial or industrial buildings. Some businesses have purchased normal domestic <b>stairlifts</b> purely as goods transporters and put {{items such as}} boxes of stationery on the seat.|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} provide curved-rail stairlifts {{made from}} modular parts. These {{have the advantage}} of quick delivery time (the installer brings many parts and picks from them), though the rail may not follow the shape of the stairs as closely as a factory-made <b>stairlift.</b> Modular stairlifts take longer to install that custom-made stairlifts, so they are usually similar in price to a custom-made curved-rail <b>stairlift.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} specification used by <b>stairlift</b> {{manufacturers in}} Europe was British Standard BS 5776: 1996 Specification For Powered Stairlifts, produced by The British Standards Institution.|$|E
5000|$|Stannah Lifts {{moved from}} London to Andover in 1974, {{produced}} its first <b>stairlift</b> the following year, and began exporting in 1979. [...] From there, it established {{itself as the}} leading manufacturer of stairlifts worldwide, as well as Britain's largest lift manufacturer. Subsidiaries were opened in the United States and The Netherlands in 1992, and Slovakia in 2003. The company also purchased distributors in Ireland in 2005, and Norway in 2010. [...] The company produced its 500,000th <b>stairlift</b> in February 2011 during a visit by the Prince of Wales to the Andover headquarters.|$|E
50|$|The seat of {{a curved}} rail <b>stairlift</b> {{may have to be}} tilted so it remains {{horizontal}} whilst going around curves and negotiates different angles of incline. This requires an additional motor and link system.|$|E
50|$|Most {{platform}} <b>stairlifts</b> {{are used}} in public access buildings or outside private homes.|$|R
50|$|The {{stairways}} to the platforms {{are equipped}} {{on one side}} with <b>stairlifts</b> for wheelchair access.|$|R
50|$|Rails for {{wheelchair}} platform <b>stairlifts</b> may {{be secured}} to walls {{in addition to}} the step fixings.|$|R
50|$|Platforms 1 and 2 can {{be reached}} by the {{entrance}} reserved for match days. With staff attendance platform 3 {{can be reached}} across the causeway from the car park and platforms 4 and 5 by a <b>stairlift</b> from the road-level footbridge.|$|E
50|$|These {{are made}} to follow {{the shape of an}} {{individual}} staircase (curved stairs). On staircases with intermediate flat landings they eliminate the need for multiple straight stairlifts by providing a continuous ride up {{the entire length of the}} staircase. Because the rail is custom-made to follow the staircase, and because the chair is more complex that on a straight-rail <b>stairlift</b> (it has to be able to remain level while traveling along a track which changes direction and angle), curved-rail stairlifts are usually more costly than stairlifts for straight stairs. Specifying a curved-rail stairlifts usually involves careful measurement, design and manufacturing, and the installation process usually takes longer than for a straight domestic <b>stairlift.</b>|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{controls}} are used extensively. Many stairlifts have radio frequency or infrared remote controllers. It {{is known that}} radiation from devices such as fluorescent lights can interfere with infrared <b>stairlift</b> controls. Also, heat and incandescent lights can, in some circumstances, have an adverse effect.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} days of curved rail <b>stairlifts</b> there was no second user market because of the {{difficulty}} of matching rails to a different layout. Even staircases built to the same design specification in neighbouring houses have variations, but in most attempted [...] "transplants" [...] there are too many differences to make it practicable. Many owners have had to pay to have unwanted curved <b>stairlifts</b> removed.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>stairlifts</b> {{are also}} {{fitted with a}} key, to allow the user to prevent others from using the lift.|$|R

50|$|To ensure {{footbridges}} {{are accessible}} to disabled and other mobility-impaired people, careful consideration is also given to provision of access lifts or ramps, {{as required by}} relevant legislation (e.g. Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in the UK). Some old bridges in Venice are now equipped with a <b>stairlift</b> so that residents with a disability can cross them.|$|E
50|$|Most {{swivel seats}} have a safety switch so the <b>stairlift</b> wonâ€™t move unless the seat is locked into its travel position. Special models with seats facing {{the bottom of}} the {{staircase}} have been produced for users with spinal or other conditions which prevent use of the conventional seat layout. More room is need on the landing with these special seats.|$|E
50|$|Control {{circuit design}} varies greatly among the {{different}} manufacturers and models.Curved rail <b>stairlifts</b> have more complex controls than those with straight rails.|$|R
