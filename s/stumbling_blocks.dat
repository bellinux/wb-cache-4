25|$|Diversity proved one of {{the main}} <b>stumbling</b> <b>blocks.</b> Before the program opened, some {{citizens}} attacked the school board for not considering minority issues, and in the first year, only five students were of minority background (three African American, and two Asian).

High-concentration hydrogen peroxide for rocket belts was produced by Peroxide Propulsion (Gothenburg, Sweden) from 2004 to 2010, but after a serious accident Peroxide Propulsion stopped making it.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the U.S. federal {{government}} took up an initiative to provide patients with an explicit list of rights concerning their healthcare. The political philosophy behind such an initiative essentially blended {{ideas of the}} Consumers' Bill of Rights with the field of healthcare. It was undertaken {{in an effort to}} ensure the quality of care of all patients by preserving the integrity of the processes that occur in the healthcare industry. Standardizing the nature of healthcare institutions in this manner proved provocative. In fact, many interest groups, including the American Medical Association (AMA) and Big Pharma came out against the congressional bill. Basically, having hospitals provide emergency medical care to anyone, regardless of health insurance status, as well as the right of a patient to hold their health plan accountable for any and all harm done proved to be the two biggest <b>stumbling</b> <b>blocks</b> for the bill. As a result of this intense opposition, the initiative eventually failed to pass Congress in 2002.|$|E

500|$|Interest in the Galileo {{affair was}} revived {{in the early}} 19th century, when Protestant polemicists used it (and other {{events such as the}} Spanish Inquisition and the myth of the flat Earth) to attack Roman Catholicism.

500|$|Guitar Hero 5 {{was well}} {{received}} upon release. Seth Schiesel of The New York Times called Guitar Hero 5 [...] "the most enjoyable Guitar Hero game in several years" [...] and [...] "generally well-tuned, often exhilarating rock ’n’ roll experience". [...] Keza MacDonald of Eurogamer commented {{that there is}} [...] "just nothing wrong" [...] with Guitar Hero 5, given the various <b>stumbling</b> <b>blocks</b> the developers had made from previous iterations of the game, {{and the way the}} developers have continued to find new additions to the game. Reviewers greatly appreciated the new features in the game {{to make it easier to}} jump in and play music, from the simplification of the menu system to the availability of every song in all the game modes from the start. Erik Brudvig of IGN considers the menu change to be [...] "one of the best things that Neversoft has done", although the menus are a minor part of the game, it removes much of the frustration with the World Tour and other previous Guitar Hero games' menu systems. Arthur Gies of GameSpy noted that by simplification of the interface, [...] "Neversoft stripped Guitar Hero down to what works and built up from there". Reviewers appreciated the immediate launch of the game's Party Mode once the player put the disk in the system and the ability to jump right into that song through the new menus, and considered this to help make the game enjoyable for social gatherings. Chris Watters of GameSpot considered this mode to be [...] "accessible, welcoming, and delightfully low key". The changes in Career mode, in which the players need not stick to the same instrument or difficulty throughout, was well appreciated. Brudvig appreciated how this allows the player to complete the Career mode without getting stuck on a song, having to go back to replay the Career mode on other instruments, and that with the addition of song Challenges, provides enough incentive to return to the songs to improve one's performance. The new multiplayer modes in Rockfest, which replaced more [...] "arcadey" [...] competitive modes, were considered a welcome replacement, as it allowed players of various skill levels to compete fairly against each other, making the game more friendly to the multiplayer experience. However, Matt Helgeson of Game Informer noted that despite the various RockFest modes, it [...] "all comes down to hitting the notes correctly".|$|E

40|$|Most {{countries}} {{are members of}} preferential trade agreements (PTAs).

Despite this long-standing concern with PTAs and the lack of theoretical consensus there is no systematic evidence on whether they are actually a <b>stumbling</b> <b>block</b> to multilateral liberalization.

He married Jane and they live happily in the jungle, {{residing}} in the old treehouse that Tarzan's parents had built before their deaths. Although Tarzan doesn't live with his mother and the other gorillas, Tarzan will still leap into action to protect them at any length, and he often returns to seek Kala's advice in dealing with situations such as the doubts of the other gorillas, and Jane wanting him to be more [...] "civilized". While helping Jane get over her more romantic ideas about jungle life, she acts as his guide to the duplicity in human nature—and insists he eat his food from a plate.

2500|$|Discussions {{since then}} have been complex, {{stemming}} from the Society's insistence that {{the teachings of the}} Second Vatican Council on ecumenism, religious liberty, and collegiality are inconsistent with Catholic teaching and doctrine, a claim that the Holy See views as unacceptable, but recent discussions have indicated the possibility of an understanding. In an interview on 4 March 2017 with DICI, the official news organ of the Society, Bishop Bernard Fellay stated [...] "Whether {{it is a question of}} religious liberty, collegiality, ecumenism, the new Mass, or even the new rites of the sacraments…. all of a sudden, on these points that have been <b>stumbling</b> <b>blocks,</b> the emissaries from Rome tell us that they are open questions." [...] In the same month of March 2017, Archbishop Guido Pozzo, the prelate in charge of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, the Roman Curia's organ for traditionalist societies, stated that the Holy See and the Society were close to an agreement regularizing the Society's status.
