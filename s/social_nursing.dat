Method: A 71 -item scale was constructed based on a literature review and focus group sessions with <b>social</b> <b>nurses</b> and paraprofessionals who had experience with underprivileged families. This scale was applied in {{a random sample of}} 40 home visiting <b>social</b> <b>nurses,</b> who collected data in a sample of 373 nonabusive and 18 abusive/neglectful mothers with a newborn child. Results: Items with prevalence rates below 5 % and items making no significant difference between maltreating and non-maltreating mothers were omitted. The final version contained 20 items. This scale showed high internal consistency (alpha =. 92) and high interrater reliability (r =. 97). Exploratory factor analysis yielded a three-factor solution: Isolation (8 items, explaining 62. 17 % of the common variance), Psychological complexity (6 items, 18. 86 %), and Communication problems (6 items, 8. 41 %). Scores on Communication problems and Isolation significantly predicted scores on a social deprivation scale, which significantly distinguished maltreating from non-maltreating mothers. Mothers scoring high on Communication problems or Isolation obtained higher scores for social deprivation than low-scoring mothers. Conclusions: Home visiting nurses can identify risks for physical abuse and neglect among mothers with a newborn infant by focusing on signs of social isolation, distorted communication and psychological problems.

40|$|Introduction: Demand {{for health}} and social care {{services}} in the community will grow {{as a result of}} the ageing of populations across Europe. At present, however, very little is known about the preparedness of national home care systems for changing demand, which is not just quantitative but also qualitative in kind. There is a need for insight into the state of home care, including policy and regulation and aspects of financing, organisation and provision of services. Methods and Materials: EURHOMAP study has developed an extensive set of indicators to map home care systems that focus on: policy and regulation; financing; organisation & service delivery; and clients & informal carers. Data were collected in 31 European countries. We also used the answers of key informants on questions related to four ‘vignettes’ (hypothetical case descriptions of home living people in need of care). Results: Home care systems widely vary in their degree of development and that the structures of governance, regulation and models of provision are very heterogeneous. An aspect of home care that creates challenges at all levels is the mix of <b>social,</b> <b>nursing</b> and health services, which are supposed to be delivered in an integrated way to clients and patients. Cost control in community care is a common issue of most countries, but budgetary and efficiency measures taken and mechanisms developed are very different. Maintaining and improving home care services is a priority in many countries which does not always match with needs to increase efficiency. Conclusion: Although home care is a major point of policy in many countries, it is not heavily regulated. In many countries home care governance is split between different types of care and, consequently, not well integrated. Despite the dominance of public provision, tendencies towards more privatisation, contracting and competition can be identified. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Health {{services}} in the newborn Czechoslovak Republic had to cope {{not only with the}} consequences of the First World War, but also with the new approaches to health policy. Modern social medicine challenged the conventional model of the so-called “police medicine” – the deep-rooted concept of Public Health in the Middle European countries. The necessity to resolve the contradiction between preventative and curative care led {{to the conclusion that the}} form and tasks of health centres, whether run by voluntary bodies or by the state/regional authorities, had to be reconsidered. The ambitious goal was to find new and more effective ways to cooperation between the various subjects of health assistance, consultancy, and – eventually - social aid. As an example of such an institution, providing both curative and preventive/consultant service, can be found in one of the most rapidly developing parts of the city of Prague – the new Czechoslovak capital. The “model district” in Prague XIII should have become the location utilizing the latest methods of social hygiene and healthcare organization, an enterprise of coordinated social work and health service. Only in the first years of its existence did it function in accordance with its aims; especially as a teaching arrangement - a tutorial service of the State Health Institute for the education of medical personnel, especially health and <b>social</b> <b>nursing</b> sisters, – and as a source of statistical research. The work of the voluntary organizations and health officers was successfully coordinated. But plans to reorganise the Health Office of the City of Prague, and to extend the system to other districts, faltered and eventually failed.

40|$|Abstract Re-engineering the Care of Older People in North Singapore SingaporeÃ�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�s {{population}} is aging {{at an alarming}} rate. By 2030, 25 % of its 4 million population will be {{over the age of}} 65. This increase in the elderly population will place an increasing pressure on an already overstretched healthcare system. Many developed countries have also experienced this universal problem of how to provide the appropriate care for their elderly population. Various measures, both at a local and national level have been tried and tested with varying degrees of success in these countries. In Singapore, {{there is a shortage of}} trained personnel with the right skills to provide the necessary care to frail elderly persons. The delivery of care is poorly coordinated and fragmented. This places increase pressures on acute hospital beds and the emergency services. However, many of the needs of frail elderly persons can better met by tailoring the right care at the right time and at the place for them. Aim: The aim of this dissertation is to explore new ways of delivering a high quality, seamless, patient-centred health service to the elderly population in Singapore. Method: Working through a Whole System Approach with the Department of Geriatric Medicine at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, the Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital, the Community Rehabilitation and nursing service, social service and primary care, we developed a model of Intermediate Care called the Rapid Response Integrated Care Service (RRICS). This service has as its key components elements for a rapid assessment of the elderly personÃ�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�s needs by joint medical, <b>social,</b> <b>nursing</b> and rehabilitation personnel in a single assessment process. The right package of care is then delivered with regular monitoring and reassessment as the patientÃ�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�s condition changes. RRICS aim to prevent inappropriate hospital admissions and facilitates early hospital discharge of elderly patient by maximising rehabilitation to help them return to their previous level of independence. Results: A saving of 13, 512 bed days or an equivalent of $ 4, 864, 077 was achieved in a year. 83. 2 % of patients were rehabilitated to their full potential. An audit of the service after its introduction revealed a high level of patients and users satisfaction. Conclusion: We showed that in our context, the RRICS model is a cost-effective, high quality, seamless and coordinated system of healthcare delivery that is able to meet the complex healthcare needs the elderly population. We hope that similar groups in other parts of Singapore will adopt this model for the elderly persons in their catchment are...|$|E
40|$|O presente estudo teve por objetivo identificar as representações sociais dos profissionais de Medicina e Enfermagem de nível {{superior}} do Programa Saúde da Família acerca do Pré-Natal. A pesquisa foi qualitativa sob a ótica da Teoria das Representações Sociais de Serge Moscovici, do Núcleo Central de Jean-Claude Abric e da Análise de Conteúdo de Laurence Bardin. Trabalhamos com os seguintes instrumentos para coleta de dados: questionário, com dados sociodemográficos; associação livre de palavras, com os termos indutores Gestação, Cuidado e Pré-natal; produção de imagem mental e entrevista semi-estruturada, com a seguinte questão norteadora: O que representa o pré-natal para você?. Entrevistamos todos os profissionais de Enfermagem e Medicina do Programa Saúde da Família do município de Santa Cruz/RN (dez para cada profissão) no período de fevereiro e março de 2007. Da análise dos dados sociodemográficos, identificamos os seguintes percentuais para Enfermagem e Medicina respectivamente: predominou o sexo feminino para Enfermagem (90 %); a idade entre 24 e 33 anos (70 e 60 %); a religião católica (80 e 50 %) e 50 % dos dois grupos têm até dois anos de formação e de trabalho no cenário da pesquisa. A análise dos demais instrumentos resultou em duas categorias: Visão Institucionalizada e Visão do Senso comum. Na associação livre de palavras, a categoria visão institucionalizada configura-se como Núcleo Central e a do senso comum como Núcleo Periférico, demonstrando que as representações sociais do atendimento pré-natal são pautadas nos universos consensual e reificado. Nas imagens mentais, identificamos essa mesma construção. No conteúdo das entrevistas, a visão institucionalizada é permeada pela responsabilidade do fazer e a disponibilidade do ter assistência pré-natal recomendada pelo Ministério da Saúde e recursos necessários enquanto a visão do senso comum pode ser representada pela categoria gênero, cujo papel de profissionais do pré-natal é reforçar a responsabilidade da mulher diante de uma maternidade socialmente construída. Em suma, os discursos analisados refletem que ao conhecimento adquirido na academia, são incorporados saberes do cotidiano profissional, regido por mitos populares. Medicina e Enfermagem reconhecem a importância do atendimento tanto pela oportunidade de educar as mulheres para a maternidade quanto pela possibilidade de prevenir complicações, mas em seus discursos excluíram desse processo a figura masculina. Concluímos que o significado do termo indutor cuidado parte do senso comum e é incorporado ao discurso institucionalizado para humanizar a assistência. Entretanto, a gestação deixa de ser vista no seu sentido biológico natural e passa a ser analisada como um momento de fragilidade e predisposição às doenças. Por fim, o Núcleo Central das representações sociais do pré-natal para os(as) pesquisado(as) é ancorado nos discursos institucionalizado e do senso comum, refletindo a preocupação em estabelecer uma assistência humanizada e de qualidadeThe {{present study}} had the objective to identify to the Social Representations of the professionals {{of medicine and}} nursing superior level of the Program Health of the Family concerning the assistance for the gestation. The research was qualitative under the optics of the Theory of the Social Representations of Serge Moscovici, of the Central Nucleus of Jean-Claude Abric and of the Analysis of Content of Laurence Bardin. We worked with the following instruments for the collection of data: Questionnaires, with social-demographic data; Free association of Words, with the inductive terms Pregnancy, Assistance for Gestation and Care; Production of mental image and half-structuralized Interview, with the following question: What does the assistance for the gestation represent for you?. We interviewed all the professionals of nursing and medicine of the Program Health of the Family {{in the city of}} Santa Cruz /RN (ten for each profession) in the period of February and March of 2007. From the analysis of the social-demographics data, we respectively identified the following percentages for nursing and medicine: the feminine sex for nursing predominated (90 %); the age between 24 and 33 (70 and 60 %); the religion catholic (80 and 50 %) and 50 % of the two groups has up to two years of formation and work in the score of the research. The analysis of the others instruments resulted in two categories: Institutionalized vision and Vision of the Common-sense. In the free association of words, the category institutionalized vision is configured as Central Nucleus and of the common sense one as nucleus Peripheral, demonstrating that the Social Representations of the assistance for the gestation attendance are in the universes consensual. In the mental images, we identified to this same construction. In the content of the interviews, the institutionalized vision is permeated by the responsibility of making and the availability of having - assistance for the gestation is recommended by the Health department and necessary genders - while the vision of the common-sense can be represented by the category sort, whose role of professionals of the assistance for the gestation is to strengthen the responsibility for the woman of a maternity socially constructed. In short, the analyzed speeches reflect that, to the knowledge acquired in the academy, are incorporated in the knowledge of the daily professional, and conducted by popular myths. Medicine and nursing recognize the importance of the attendance in such a way for the chance to educate the women for the maternity as for the possibility to prevent complications, but in its speeches they had excluded from this process the masculine figure. We conclude that the meaning of the inductive term take care, part of the common-sense and is incorporated the institutionalized speech to humanize the assistance. However, the pregnancy ceases from being seen in its natural biological direction and starts to be analyzed as a moment of fragility and predisposition the illnesses. Finally, the <b>social</b> <b>nursing</b> and the central nucleus representations for the assistance in gestation for medicine is anchored in the speeches institutionalized and of the common-sense, reflecting the concern in establishing a humanized assistance with qualit...|$|E
