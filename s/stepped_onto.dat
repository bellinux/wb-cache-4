A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there {{did not seem to be}} any American pickets and thus began to search the area.

5000|$|The Shag Basic: (from the lead's {{point of}} view) Beat 1: <b>STEP</b> <b>onto</b> left foot, beat 2: HOP on left, beat 3: <b>STEP</b> <b>onto</b> right foot, beat 4: HOP on right, beat 5: <b>STEP</b> <b>onto</b> left foot, and beat 6: <b>STEP</b> <b>onto</b> right foot. The {{movement}} during beats 5 and 6 {{is often described}} as a shuffling motion. As mentioned above, this is usually broken down verbally as [...] "slow, slow; quick, quick" [...] where the 'slows' cover two beats (or 'counts') each and the 'quicks' mark a single beat (or 'count') each. Hence, for the lead this would be two counts with the weight on the left leg while the right leg moves, two counts with weight on the right leg while the left leg moves, followed by a quick <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> the left and then a quick <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> the right. The follow's movement would be the exact opposite.|$|R

However, it was unclear which color the smoke was for over an hour; some of the {{cardinals}} had personally deposited their notes and tally sheets in the stove, causing black smoke after white had already appeared. Pericle Felici, as the ranking Cardinal Deacon, then <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and delivered the Habemus Papam announcement in Latin, declaring Luciani's election. John Paul I then appeared on the balcony; shortly after his withdrawal, the crowd's applause remained so loud that he was compelled to appear again.|$|E

In January 1996, at the European Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, {{she became the first}} Russian woman to win the European title, {{performing}} six triples in the free skating to dethrone the five-time defending champion Surya Bonaly. Slutskaya also won the Centennial on Ice, combining with Butyrskaya to hand Kwan her only defeat of the season. At the Champions Series Final, held in Paris in late February 1996, she finished ahead of reigning World champion Chen Lu (4th) and took the silver medal behind Michelle Kwan. In March, she competed at the 1996 World Championships in Edmonton, Canada. Third in the short program, she held onto her position in the next segment after recovering from an early fall to complete six triples. She was awarded the bronze medal and <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> her first World podium, alongside Kwan (gold medalist) and Chen (silver).|$|E

25|$|Minnesota {{got off to}} a bad {{start and}} never recovered. After the opening kickoff, Collins led the Giants 74 yards in just four plays, {{throwing}} a 46-yard touchdown pass to Hilliard to give them a 7–0 lead less than two minutes into the game. Then Giants defensive back Lyle West recovered a fumble from kick returner Moe Williams on the Vikings 18-yard line and Collins capitalized with an 18-yard touchdown pass to fullback Greg Comella on the next play, giving New York a 14–0 lead before the Vikings offense had even <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> the field. Minnesota eventually got a chance to score when defensive back Robert Tate intercepted a pass from Collins and returned it to the Giants 37-yard line. But Culpepper soon returned the favor with a pass that was intercepted in the end zone by Emmanuel McDaniel. Collins threw another interception on New York's following drive, this one to Don Morgan on the Vikings 12-yard line. However, Minnesota could not advance the ball, and Mitch Berger's 26-yard punt gave the Giants great field position on the Minnesota 41-yard line. Collins then threw a 22-yard pass to Amani Toomer that set up a Brad Daluiso field goal on the first play of the second quarter.|$|E

500|$|Jardine divided opinion {{among those}} with whom he played. He could be charming and witty or {{ruthless}} and harsh, while many people who knew him believed him to be innately shy. David Frith describes him as a complex figure who could change moods quickly. Although he could be friendly off the field, he became hostile and determined once he <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> the field. At his memorial service, he was described by Hubert Ashton as being [...] "provocative, austere, brusque, shy, humble, thoughtful, kindly, proud, sensitive, single-minded and possessed of immense moral and physical courage," [...] and Frith argues that these varied qualities are easily proven by what was said about him.|$|E
