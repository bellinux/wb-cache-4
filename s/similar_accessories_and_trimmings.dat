Working in the Philippines, and titling her line the 'Virus Project,' Wizer created {{a set of}} costumes made entirely from post consumer plastic waste to celebrate Earth Day. The first plastic packaging tote bags were accessories to these costumes.

40|$|Both HIV and SIV encode {{a unique}} set of {{accessory}} proteins that enhance viral replication in the host. Two <b>similar</b> <b>accessory</b> proteins, Vpx <b>and</b> Vpr, are encoded by HIV- 2. In contrast, HIV- 1 encodes Vpr but not Vpx. Recent studies have indicated that Vpx counteracts a particular host restriction factor, thereby facilitating reverse transcription in MDMs. This mechanism of counteraction {{is similar to that of}} the <b>accessory</b> proteins Vif <b>and</b> Vpu which antagonize other host factors. In 2011, the protein SAMHD 1 was identified as the restriction factor counteracted by Vpx. Studies have since revealed that SAMHD 1 degrades dNTPs, which are components of viral genomic cDNA, in order to deprive viruses of dNTPs. Although interactions between SAMHD 1 and Vpx continue to be a major research focus, Vpx has also been shown to have apparent ability to enhance nuclear import of the viral genome in T lymphocytes. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding SAMHD 1 -dependent and -independent functions of Vpx, and discusses possible reasons why HIV- 2 encodes both Vpx and Vpr, unlike HIV- 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii antigens, T 4 + cells from seropositive donors produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by different mechanisms; one (T. gondii) dependent upon {{and the other}} (CMV) largely independent of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and its receptor. To determine whether IFN-gamma-generating mechanisms unrelated to IL- 2 also differ, we examined the requirement for <b>accessory</b> cells <b>and</b> their expressed or secreted products. In {{response to}} both specific antigens, IFN-gamma secretion was strictly dependent upon the presence of <b>accessory</b> cells (monocytes), <b>and</b> was largely inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to class II (HLA-DR and -DQ) but not class I MHC antigens. Both CMV and T. gondii antigens stimulated monocytes to release interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), and IFN-gamma production in response to both antigens was abolished by pretreatment with anti-IL- 1 antibody. In contrast, the secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) was not stimulated by either antigen, and IFN-gamma production was not diminished by antisera directed at TNF-alpha or TNF-beta. We conclude that CMV and T. gondii antigen-induced IFN-gamma production requires a <b>similar</b> <b>accessory</b> cell mechanism, <b>and</b> that soluble antigen-stimulated IFN-gamma secretion by human T 4 + cells is dependent on monocytes, expression of class II MHC antigens, {{and the presence of}} IL- 1...|$|R

Some Resto-Cal VW's veer towards the Los Angeles Cal-Style VW influenced, because of the stance, early Fuch alloys and the number of correct period accessories on the vehicle. There is a large tendency toward the resto Cal look because these cars can be fairly easily returned to a 'stock' unmodified status. Resto Cal cars also have the nickname [...] "Buckaroo cars", a light-hearted dig about the amount of items like luggage loaded onto the roof racks like the child's game from the 1980s. Enthusiast sites such as BugMe.co.uk show what sort of modifications are often done to create or restore a resto Cal Beetle.|$|R
5000|$|Windows 1.0 was {{released}} to mixed reviews. Most critics considered the platform to have future potential, but that Windows 1.0 had not fulfilled expectations. Many reviews criticized its demanding system requirements, especially noting the poor performance experienced when running multiple applications at once, and that Windows encouraged {{the use of}} a mouse for navigation, a relatively new concept at the time. The New York Times compared the performance of Windows on a system with 512 KB of RAM to [...] "pouring molasses in the Arctic", and that its design was inflexible for keyboard users due to its dependency on a mouse-oriented interface. In conclusion, the Times felt that the poor performance, lack of dedicated software, uncertain compatibility with DOS programs, and the lack of tutorials for new users made DOS-based software such as Borland Sidekick (which could provide a <b>similar</b> assortment of <b>accessories</b> <b>and</b> multitasking functionality) more desirable for most PC users.|$|R
