40|$|Gamma {{radiation}} in {{the environment}} is mainly due to naturally occurring radionuclides. However, {{there is also a}} contribution from anthropogenic radionuclides such as 137 Cs which originate from nuclear fission processes. Since 1986, the accident at the Chernobyl power plant has been a significant source of artificial environmental radioactivity. In order to assess the radiological impact of these radionuclides, it is necessary to measure their activities in samples drawn from the environment and in plants and animals including human populations. The whole body counter (WBC) at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff makes in vivo measurements of gamma emitting radionuclides using a <b>scanning</b> <b>ring</b> of six large-volume thallium-doped sodium iodide (Nal(Tl)) scintillation detectors. In this work the WBC was upgraded by the addition of two high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The performance and suitability of the detection systems were evaluated by comparing the detection limits for Cs. Sensitivities were measured using sources of known activity in a water filled anthropomorphic phantom and theoretical minimum detectable count-rates were estimated from phantom background pulse height spectra. The theoretical minimum detectable activity was about 24 Bq for the combination of six Nal(Tl) detectors whereas for the individual HPGe detectors it was 64 Bq and 65 Bq, despite the much improved energy resolution Activities of 137 Cs in the human body between 1993 and 2007 were estimated from the background Nal(Tl) spectra of 813 patients and compared with recent measurements in 14 volunteers. The body burden of Cs in Cardiff patients increased from an average of about 60 Bq in the early and mid 1990 s to a maximum of about 100 Bq in 2000. By 2007 it had decreased to about 40 Bq. This latter value was similar to that of Cardiff residents {{at the time of the}} Chernobyl accident and to that of the volunteers measured in 2007 (51 Bq). However, it was less than the mean activity of Cardiff residents in 1988 (130 Bq) indicating an overall decrease over a period of about 20 years. The variation in the in vivo activity is probably due to complex inter-relationships between a number of factors such as the removal of deposited 137 Cs into the sea by rainfall, individual dietary choices, the imposition and removal of restrictions on foodstuffs from Chernobyl-affected areas and travel to countries that suffered greater initial fall-out than the UK...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a class of}} observational strategies for probing the anisotropies in {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) where the instrument <b>scans</b> on <b>rings</b> which can be combined into an n- torus, the ring torus. This class has the remarkable property that it allows an exact maximum likelihood power spectrum estimation in operations of order N- 2 (if the size of the data set is N) under circumstances which would previously have made this analysis intractable: correlated receiver noise, arbitrary asymmetric beam shapes and far side lobes, nonuniform distribution of integration time on the sky, and partial sky coverage. This ease of computation gives us an important theoretical tool for understanding the impact of instrumental effects on CMB observables and hence for the design and analysis of CMB observations in the future. There are members of this class which closely approximate the MAP and Planck satellite missions.

40|$|A new online {{method to}} analyse water {{isotopes}} of speleothem fluid inclusions using a wavelength <b>scanned</b> cavity <b>ring</b> down spectroscopy (WS-CRDS) instrument is presented. This novel technique allows us simultaneously to measure {{hydrogen and oxygen}} isotopes for a released aliquot of water. To do so, we designed a new simple line that allows the online water extraction and isotope analysis of speleothem samples. The specificity of the method {{lies in the fact}} that fluid inclusions release is made on a standard water background, which mainly improves the δ D robustness. To saturate the line, a peristaltic pump continuously injects standard water into the line that is permanently heated to 140 °C and flushed with dry nitrogen gas. This permits instantaneous and complete vaporisation of the standard water, resulting in an artificial water background with well-known δ D and δ 18 O values. The speleothem sample is placed in a copper tube, attached to the line, and after system stabilisation it is crushed using a simple hydraulic device to liberate speleothem fluid inclusions water. The released water is carried by the nitrogen/standard water gas stream directly to a Picarro L 1102 -i for isotope determination. To test the accuracy and reproducibility of the line and to measure standard water during speleothem measurements, a syringe injection unit was added to the line. Peak evaluation is done similarly as in gas chromatography to obtain &delta D; and δ 18 O isotopic compositions of measured water aliquots. Precision is better than 1. 5 ‰ for δ D and 0. 4 ‰ for δ 18 O for water measurements for an extended range (− 210 to 0 ‰ for δ D and − 27 to 0 ‰ for δ 18 O) primarily dependent on the amount of water released from speleothem fluid inclusions and secondarily on the isotopic composition of the sample. The results show that WS-CRDS technology is suitable for speleothem fluid inclusion measurements and gives results that are comparable to the isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) technique...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) allows quantification of {{the thickness}} of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness, a potential biomarker for neurodegeneration. The estimated annual RNFL loss in multiple sclerosis amounts to 2 mm using time domain OCT. The recognition of measurement artifacts exceeding this limit is relevant for the successful use of OCT as a secondary outcome measure in clinical trials. Methods: Prospective study design. An exploratory pilot study (<b>ring</b> and volume <b>scans)</b> followed by a cohort study (1, 980 OCT <b>ring</b> <b>scans).</b> The OCT measurement beam was placed off–axis to the left, right, top and bottom of the subjects pupil and RNFL thickness of these scans were compared to the centrally placed reference scans. Results: Off–axis placement of the OCT measurement beam resulted in significant artifacts in RNFL thickness measurements (95 %CI 9 mm, maximal size of error 42 mm). Off–axis placement gave characteristic patterns of the OCT live images which are not necessarily saved for review. Off–axis placement also causes regional inhomogeneity of reflectivity in the outer nuclear (ONL) and outer plexiform layers (OPL) which remains visible on scans saved for review. Conclusion: Off–axis beam placement introduces measurement artifacts at a magnitude which may mask recognition of RNFL loss due to neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis. The resulting pattern in the OCT live image can only be recognised by the technician capturing the scans. Once the averaged scans have been aligned this pattern is lost...|$|R

Towards her the taut Norah Creina, vulture-wise, wriggled to windward: come from so far to pick her bones.

Dose distributions of individual and multiple beams were plotted in a cylindrical water phantom. Radiobiological experiments with mammalian cells in gel and with mouse feet were performed. A special beam geometry using a sector of 15 beams was selected for the first treatments of patients with metastatic skin nodules. Six patients were treated. Acute skin reactions were scored and compared with those from orthovoltage therapy with comparable beam geometry. The RBE for 10 fractions is between 1. 4 and 1. 5. The next step involved treatment of patients inside water-bolus rings in preparation for dynamic therapy. Patients were then treated with the spot scan dynamic mode in the water bolus. The initial responses and reactions are favorable and confirm the feasibility and accuracy of dynamic pion therapy. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} rate of retinal {{ganglion}} cell (RGC) layer and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) changes in nonoptic neuritis (NON) eyes of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients, and to find a specific imaging parameter useful for identifying disease progression. Methods: Forty-five consecutive RRMS patients and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were enrolled. All patients were followed up for 3 years with annual optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, which included a peripapillary <b>ring</b> <b>scan</b> protocol for RNFL analysis and a macular radial star-like scan to obtain RGC/inner plexiform layer (IPL) thickness measures. Healthy controls were scanned twice, 3 years apart. Results: Retinal ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer and temporal RNFL (tRNFL) demonstrated highly significant thinning (P < 0. 01), but all nasal segments and global RNFL (gRNFL) {{were not significantly different}} from normal controls. While receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed no advantage of RGC/IPL over tRNFL in cross-sectional detection of thinning, cut-off point based of fifth percentile in healthy controls demonstrated higher rate of abnormality for RGC/IPL. There was a significant progressive loss of RGC/IPL and tRNFL during the follow-up period. The largest thickness reduction was observed in tRNFL. ROC analysis demonstrated that tRNFL provided better sensitivity/specificity for detecting change over time than RGC/IPL (area under the curve [AUC] 0. 78 vs. 0. 52), which was confirmed by higher detection rate when 95 th percentile of progression in healthy controls was used as a cut-off. Conclusions: This study confirmed significant thinning of RGC/IPL and tRNFL in NON eyes of RRMS patients. Progressive losses were more apparent on tRNFL, while RGC/IPL showed less change over the follow-up period. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. With the {{introduction}} of spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), changes in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and macular volume (MV) can be detected with high precision. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether there is a physiological quantifiable degree of variation of these structures in humans. METHODS. This study took place during a 10 -km charity run at VU University Medical Center Amsterdam. Weight, height, hydration status, RNFL thickness (<b>ring</b> <b>scan,</b> 12 ° around the optic nerve head), and MV (20 ° × 20 °) were assessed in 69 subjects (44 runners, 25 controls) using SD-OCT with eye-tracking function. The SD-OCT scans were assessed before running (normal status), after running (more dehydrated status), and 1 to 1. 5 hours after finishing the run (rehydrated status). Controls were measured at the same time intervals as the runners but did not participate in the running event. Changes over time were assessed by general linear models, correcting for repeated measurements. RESULTS. In runners, a significant increase in both RNFL thickness (94. 4 μm [baseline] to 95. 2 μm [rehydration], P = 0. 04) and MV (288. 9 μm [baseline] to 291. 0 μm [rehydration], P < 0. 001) over time was observed. Controls did not show significant changes over time. Anatomically, the physiological change of RNFL thickness was most marked in the nasal sectors. CONCLUSIONS. This prospective study demonstrated a significant physiological variation of the RNFL thickness and MV at a proportion that, on an individual patient level, may be relevant for longitudinal studies in neurodegenerative diseases. © 2012 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc...|$|R
