50|$|<b>Serving</b> <b>suggestion</b> is a {{disclaimer}} used on food packaging. The phrase {{is used as}} legal fine print {{with a picture of}} the product. The picture attempts to portray the manufacturer's food in the most favorable or appetizing way possible, sometimes including other foods that the package does not contain. For example, the labeling on a box of cereal may feature a picture of a cereal bowl filled with that cereal, milk and a fruit garnish, or a jar of mustard may picture a hot dog in a bun with mustard on it. The <b>serving</b> <b>suggestion</b> may portray the serving size of the food used, but just as often a much larger serving is shown as part of the marketing of the item. As {{a disclaimer}} a <b>serving</b> <b>suggestion</b> also <b>serves</b> to remove any legal obligation {{on the part of the}} manufacturer to provide the other items pictured with their product.In Ireland this is an illegal practice.|$|R

50|$|After {{an article}} about her and her cooking {{appeared}} in the New York Times in 1966, she received a book contract from an independent editor {{to write a book}} on Indian cooking. Madhur started compiling all the recipes learnt by her through correspondence with her mother and adapted for the American kitchen. Due to a period of rapid consolidation in the American publishing industry, the book went to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich but got no attention there either. Madhur took the book to her friend, Ved Mehta, who in turn mentioned it to publisher André Schiffrin. Schiffrin passed on the book to Knopf editor Judith Jones, who had championed Julia Child's cookbook at a time when no other publisher would touch it. Judith Jones snapped up the book immediately, only asking Madhur to add <b>serving</b> <b>suggestions</b> and menus for people not familiar with Indian cooking. In 1973 An Invitation to Indian Cooking was published, Madhur's first cookbook. During the 1970s, she taught classes in Indian cooking, both at the James A. Beard School of Cooking and in her Manhattan apartment. She was hired by the BBC to present a show on Indian cooking. In 1986, the restaurant Dawat opened in Manhattan using recipes that she provided.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that portion sizes and food energy-density influence children's eating behavior. However, the potential effects of front-of-pack image-sizes of <b>serving</b> <b>suggestions</b> and sugar content have not been tested. Using a mixed experimental design among young children, this study examines the effects of image-size manipulation and sugar content on cereal and milk consumption. Children poured and consumed significantly more cereal and drank significantly more milk when exposed to a larger sized image of serving suggestion as compared to a smaller image-size. Sugar content showed no main effects. Nevertheless, cereal consumption only differed significantly between small and large image-sizes when sugar content was low. An advantage of this study was the mundane setting in which the data were collected: a school’s dining room instead of an artificial lab. Future studies should include a control condition, with children eating by themselves to reflect an even more natural context.

The empirical evidence is based on a quantitative data, gathered through an email by structured self-assessment tool (check-list) which yielded 194 qualified responses. For the analysis of gained data there was used factor analysis within evaluation by factorial loadings. Results of the factor analysis provide possible groups according their similarity of variability and create new variables. Observed indexes were verified by coefficient Cronbach’s alpha.

40|$|Abstract Background Extensive {{work has}} focused on the effects of {{nutrition}} label information on consumer behavior on the one hand, and on the effects of packaging graphics on the other hand. However, little work has examined how <b>serving</b> <b>suggestion</b> depictions - graphics relating to serving size - influence the quantity consumers serve themselves. The current work examines the prevalence of exaggerated serving size depictions on product packaging (study 1) and its effects on food serving in the context of cereal (study 2). Methods Study 1 was an observational field survey of cereal packaging. Study 2 was a mixed experimental cross-sectional design conducted at a U. S. university, with 51 student participants. Study 1 coded 158 US breakfast cereals and compared the serving sizes depicted {{on the front of the}} box with the suggested serving size stated on the nutrition facts panel. Study 2 measured the amount of cereal poured from exaggerated or accurate serving size depictions. Study 1 compared average servings via t-tests. Study 2 used a mixed model with cereal type as the repeated measure and a compound symmetry covariance matrix. Results Study 1 demonstrated that portion size depictions on the front of 158 cereal boxes were 64. 7 % larger (221 vs. 134 calories) than the recommended portions on nutrition facts panels of those cereals. Study 2 showed that boxes that depicted exaggerated serving sizes led people to pour 17. 8 % more cereal compared to pouring from modified boxes that depicted a single-size portion of cereal matching suggested serving size. This was 42 % over the suggested serving size. Conclusions Biases in depicted serving size depicted on cereal packaging are prevalent in the marketplace. Such biases may lead to overserving, which may consequently lead to overeating. Companies should depict the recommended serving sizes, or otherwise indicate that the depicted portion represents an exaggerated serving size...|$|R
