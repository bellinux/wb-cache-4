40|$|Secondary controlCausal {{uncertainty}} {{beliefs are}} continual doubts about a person’s {{ability to detect}} the causes {{of events in the}} social world. For some people, these beliefs are persistently accessible. Due to the association between causal uncertainty and negative psychological outcomes, the present study was concerned with testing strategies for uncertainty management. <b>Secondary</b> <b>control</b> can moderate the relationship between causal uncertainty and negative affect by increasing adjustment and acceptance to uncontrollable events. The present study aimed to manipulate <b>secondary</b> <b>control,</b> and used a scrambled sentence priming task to do this. Seventy three participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two conditions, designed to prime high or low <b>secondary</b> <b>control.</b> Participants’ state affect and endorsement of <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> beliefs were used as dependent measures. It was predicted that participants would have higher <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> beliefs after the high <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> primes, compared to after the low <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> primes. It was also predicted that the primes would moderate the relationship between causal uncertainty and negative affect, such that for participants who received the high <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> primes, higher causal uncertainty would not be associated with greater negative affect. For participants who received the low <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> primes, higher causal uncertainty would be associated with greater negative affect. No effect of condition was found on <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> beliefs or affect. Main effects of causal uncertainty were found for <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> beliefs and affect, such that such that higher levels of causal uncertainty were associated with lower positive affect, <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> beliefs and higher negative affect. A relationship between perceived control and causal uncertainty was found, such that at lower levels of causal uncertainty and perceived <b>control,</b> people endorsed <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> beliefs less. The results were discussed in terms of theoretical implications and directions for future research...|$|R

40|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>control</b> (acceptance of and {{adjustment}} to negative events) {{is thought to}} promote positive affect.

In two studies, participants completed a causal uncertainty scale, thought about a problem while listening to affect-inducing music or no music, and then completed items that assessed <b>secondary</b> <b>control.</b> In Study 1, the music induced positive or negative affect.

40|$|Background: Reactive {{nitrogen}} species (RNS) derived from dietary and salivary inorganic nitrogen oxides foment innate host defenses {{associated with the}} acidity of the stomach. The mechanisms by which these reactive species exert antimicrobial activity in the gastric lumen are, however, poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: The genetically tractable acid tolerance response (ATR) that enables enteropathogens to survive harsh acidity was screened for signaling pathways responsive to RNS. The nitric oxide (NO) donor spermine NONOate derepressed the Fur regulon that <b>controls</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>lines</b> of resistance against organic acids. Despite inducing a Fur-mediated adaptive response, acidified RNS largely repressed oral virulence {{as demonstrated by the}} fact that Salmonella bacteria exposed to NO donors during mildly acidic conditions were shed in low amounts in feces and exhibited ameliorated oral virulence. NO prevented Salmonella from mounting a de novo ATR, but was unable to suppress an already functional protective response, suggesting that RNS target regulatory cascades but not their effectors. Transcriptional and translational analyses revealed that the PhoPQ signaling cascade is a critical ATR target of NO in rapidly growing Salmonella. Inhibition of PhoPQ signaling appears to contribute to most of the NO-mediated abrogation of the ATR in log phase...|$|R

40|$|In {{standard}} implementations of distributed <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> for DC MicroGrids (MGs), {{the exchange}} of local measurements among neighboring control agents is enabled via off-the-shelf wireless solutions, such as IEEE 802. 11. However, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the wireless interface through jamming prevents the <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> system from performing its main tasks, which might compromise {{the stability of the}} MG. In this paper, we propose novel, robust and secure <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> reconfiguration strategy, tailored to counteract DoS attacks. Specifically, upon detecting the impairment of the wireless interface, the jammed <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> agent notifies its peers via a secure, low-rate powerline channel based on Power Talk communication. This triggers reconfiguration of the wireless communication graph through primary control mode switching, where the jammed agents leave the <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> by switching to current source mode, and are replaced by nonjammed current sources that switch to voltage source mode and join the <b>secondary</b> <b>control.</b> The strategy fits within the software-defined networking framework, where the network control is split from the data plane using reliable and secure side power talk communication channel, created via software modification of the MG primary control loops. The simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the solution and prove that the MG resilience and performance can be indeed improved via software-defined networking approaches.

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that older consumers have a reduced capacity to engage in primary control behaviors that involve active responses to counteract threats, and thus compensate with <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> processes that involve perceiving negative events as less threatening. Two studies were conducted to examine <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> processes in older vs. younger consumers in relation to product harm crises. In both studies, older consumers perceived themselves as less vulnerable to the product harm crisis and viewed the crisis as less severe than younger consumers. Older consumers also placed less blame on the company involved in the crisis than younger consumers, and had stronger intentions to purchase and recommend products associated with the involved company in the future.

40|$|Causal {{uncertainty}} (CU) {{is defined}} as having a chronic lower than desired level of understanding (Weary & Edwards, 1996). <b>Secondary</b> <b>control</b> refers {{to the extent to}} which people accept and adapt to negative life events (Morling & Evered, 2006) and can buffer against the negative affective outcomes of CU (Tobin & Raymundo, 2010). This study investigates whether CU moderates the effectiveness of strategies in increasing <b>secondary</b> <b>control,</b> specifically, reappraisal and positive affect induction via music. A 2 (CU: high, low) × 3 (condition: music, reappraisal, control) between-subjects design was used. Eighty-eight participants completed the causal uncertainty scale and thought about a problem for two minutes while either listening to calming music (music condition), or under instructions to reinterpret the event in a positive light (reappraisal condition), or they received no additional instructions other than to think about their problem (control condition). Higher negative affect that associates with CU was hypothesised to impede reappraisal. Pleasant music should create a positive affective state that will allow high CU people to draw conclusions about their problem via affect-as-information and affect priming processes, and thus reflect higher levels of <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> than the control condition. Results showed that CU did not moderate either effect of (music or reappraisal) condition on <b>secondary</b> <b>control.</b> Adding an additional predictor, the initial understanding of problem, revealed significant results: participants low in CU and high in initial understanding of their problem, who were in the reappraisal condition, had higher levels of <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> than the control condition.

A micro-grid without energy storage capability is even more vulnerable to stability issues. This paper investigates a distributed <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> to maintain the rated voltage in a stand-alone micro-grid.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve a coordinated {{integration}} of distributed energy resources in the electrical network, an aggregation of these resources is required.

Microgrid <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> deals with other aspects such as resource allocation, economic optimization and voltage profile improvements.
