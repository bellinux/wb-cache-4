Our approach does not rely on a parametric model (such as, e. g., an autoregressive model) for the vector random process; rather, it only assumes certain spectral smoothness proper- ties. The proposed inference scheme is compressive in that it works for sample sizes that are (much) smaller {{than the number of}} <b>scalar</b> <b>process</b> components.

40|$|In blind array processing, {{the array}} {{manifold}} is unknown but, under the signal independence assumption, the signal parameters {{can be estimated}} by resorting to higher-order information. We consider the 4 th-order cumulant tensor and show that sample cumulant enhancement based on rank and symmetry properties yields cumulant estimates with the exact theoretical structure. Any identification procedure based on enhanced cumulants is then equivalent to cumulant matching, bypassing the need for initialization and optimization. 1. INTRODUCTION This paper deals with a linear data model where a m- dimensional complex vector x(t) {{is assumed to be}} the superposition of n linear components, possibly corrupted by additive noise. An observation can then be written as: x(t) = X p= 1;n sp(t) ap +N(t) (1) where each sp(t) is a complex stationary <b>scalar</b> <b>process,</b> each ap is a deterministic m 21 vector, and the m 21 vector N(t) represents additive noise.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{inferring}} the conditional independence graph (CIG) of a high-dimensional Gaussian vector time series (discrete-time process) from a finite-length observation. By contrast to existing approaches, we do not rely on a parametric process model (such as, e. g., an autoregressive model) for the observed random process. Instead, we only require certain smoothness properties (in the Fourier domain) of the process. The proposed inference scheme works even for sample sizes {{much smaller than the}} number of <b>scalar</b> <b>process</b> components if the true underlying CIG is sufficiently sparse. A theoretical performance analysis provides conditions which guarantee that the probability of the proposed inference method to deliver a wrong CIG is below a prescribed value. These conditions imply lower bounds on the sample size such that the new method is consistent asymptotically. Some numerical experiments validate our theoretical performance analysis and demonstrate superior performance of our scheme compared to an existing (parametric) approach in case of model mismatch.

40|$|The. first-passage probability, {{describing}} {{the probability that}} a <b>scalar</b> <b>process</b> exceeds a prescribed threshold during an interval of time, is of great engineering interest. This probability is essential for estimating the reliability of a structural component whose response is a stochastic process. When considering the reliability of an engineering system composed of several interdependent components, the probability that two or more response processes exceed their respective safe thresholds during the operation time of the system is an equally essential quantity. This paper proposes simple and accurate formulas for approximating this joint first-passage probability of a vector process. The nth order joint first-passage probability is obtained from a recursive formula involving lower order joint first-passage probabilities and the out-crossing probability of the vector process over a safe domain. Interdependence between the crossings is approximately accounted for by considering the clumping of these events. The accuracy of the proposed formulas is examined by comparing analytical estimates with those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations for stationary Gaussian processes. As an example application, the reliability of a system of interconnected equipment items subjected to a stochastic earthquake excitation is estimated by linear programming bounds employing marginal and joint component fragilities obtained by the proposed formulas...|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{properties of}} the error in uniform scalar quantization have been analyzed {{by a number of}} authors in the past, and is a well-understood topic today. The analysis has also been extended to the case of dithered quantizers, and the advantages and limitations of dithering have been studied and well documented in the literature. Lattice vector quantization is a natural extension into multiple dimensions of the uniform scalar quantization. Accordingly, there is a natural extension of the analysis of the quantization error. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to present this extension and to elaborate on some of the new aspects that come with multiple dimensions. We show that, analogous to the one-dimensional case, the quantization error vector can be rendered independent of the input in subtractive vector-dithering. In this case, the total mean square error is a function of only the underlying lattice and there are lattices that minimize this error. We give a necessary condition on such lattices. In nonsubtractive vector dithering, we show how to render moments of the error vector independent of the input by using appropriate dither random vectors. These results can readily be applied for the case of wide sense stationary (WSS) vector random processes, by use of iid dither sequences. We consider the problem of pre- and post-filtering around a dithered lattice quantifier, and show how these filters should be designed in order to minimize the overall quantization error in the mean square sense. For the special case where the WSS vector process is obtained by blocking a WSS <b>scalar</b> <b>process,</b> the optimum prefilter matrix reduces to the blocked version of the well-known scalar half-whitening filter...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this chapter}} was to {{estimate}} the trajectory probability of failure by using metric (or distance) between the trajectories starting from data of experimental measurements. Initially, after having defined the trajectory of the vehicle and its properties, we considered a sample of trajectories resulting from the same stochastic process vectorial. The trajectories of the process are the solutions of a stochastic differential equation controlled by the system of control. Then, we projected the data measurements of this process on IR {{in order to bring}} back to have scalar problem. This step passes by the use of judiciously selected functional (one based {{on the use of the}} Euclidian distance, the other based on the use of the Mahalanobis distance). Afterwards, we considered the process (scalar) of deviations with the average distance of the sample. It is process which we sought to characterize. A statistical analysis was carried out on this <b>scalar</b> <b>process</b> with an aim of studying the stationary. The stationary assumption was not rejected for these processes. Then, to identify the model of distance between trajectories, on the one hand, we characterized each process by estimating the probability law, the function of distribution and the power spectral density. In addition, we identified the laws of probability of each process by a reasonable approximation. The validation of this approximation was made by using the integral criterion. Then, after having identified the law of maximum of the two preceding laws and by using of the safety and comfort criteria of the trajectory, we estimated the probability of failure. Finally, we present simulation results of the proposed methods...|$|E

Drawing on a case study of agri-environmental policy implementation in central Spain between 1992 and 1998, the authors use this nuanced new institutional approach to elucidate the flows of knowledge, territorial representation, and power between multiscalar policy elites.

40|$|The recent {{application}} of reliability analysis to controller synthesis {{has created the}} need for a computationally efficient method for the estimation of the first excursion probabilities for linear dynamical systems in higher dimensions. Simulation methods cannot provide an adequate solution to this specific application, which involves numerical optimization of the system reliability with respect to the controller parameters, because the total computational time needed is still prohibitive. Instead, an analytical approach is presented in this paper. The problem reduces to the calculation of the conditional upcrossing rate at each surface of the failure boundary. The correlation between upcrossings of the failure surface for the different failure events may be addressed by the introduction of a multi-dimensional integral. An efficient algorithm is adopted for the numerical calculation of this integral. Also, the problem of approximation of the conditional upcrossing rate is discussed. For the latter there is no known theoretical solution.
