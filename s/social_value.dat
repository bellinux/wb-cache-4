5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack <b>social</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

His argument relied on a comparison with Mademoiselle de Maupin by Théophile Gautier, which had been cleared of obscenity in the 1922 case Halsey v. New York. Mademoiselle de Maupin described a lesbian relationship in more explicit terms than The Well did. According to Ernst, The Well had greater <b>social</b> <b>value</b> because it was more serious in tone and made a case against misunderstanding and intolerance.|$|E

40|$|Heritage {{values are}} multivalent. To make {{informed}} decisions in conservation, a comprehensive understanding {{of all types of}} values that a heritage place holds is essential. Among these heritage <b>values,</b> <b>social</b> <b>values</b> have come to the foreground of heritage conservation recently. It is recognized that {{there is a lack of}} methods to assess <b>social</b> <b>values.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>values</b> have not been successfully integrated into the study of a heritage place. Neglecting the <b>social</b> <b>values</b> poses risks to the comprehensive and successful conservation. To understand and gauge <b>social</b> <b>values,</b> several questions should be answered first: What are <b>social</b> <b>values?</b> What define them? How would they be measured? By exploring answers to these questions, this paper aims to develop some key assessment indicators for <b>social</b> <b>values.</b> Then, these proposed assessment indicators will be tested out on a case study: the Peel and Graham Street Market in the Central District in Hong Kong. The process and the findings will also be discussed and presented in the paper. To go through the process of measuring <b>social</b> <b>values</b> is another aim of this paper.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>social</b> <b>values</b> in self-regulation. Across eight studies, I investigate the distinct self-regulatory processes influenced by specific types of <b>social</b> <b>values.</b> Chapter 1 reviews research on the concepts of <b>social</b> <b>values</b> and self- regulation, and highlights the main issues that are addressed in the subsequent chapters. In Chapter 2, four studies tested the hypothesis that <b>social</b> <b>values</b> (e. g., equality) vary in {{the extent that they}} act as self-guides that people hold as 'ideal' standards versus 'ought' prescriptions. Results revealed that central values function as ideal self-guides, whereas peripheral values function as ought self-guides. In addition, violations of central values evoked dejection-type emotions, whereas violations of peripheral values evoked agitation emotions, but only in a public setting. Focusing on a second stream of research, Chapter 3 utilised three studies to test the hypothesis that the role of <b>social</b> <b>values</b> as self-guides depends on the type of motivation that they serve. Results revealed that openness values (e. g., freedom) are more likely to serve as ideal self-guides than as ought self-guides and perceptions of failure to fulfil openness values uniquely predicts the experience of more dejection- type emotions. Chapter 4 demonstrated that, following central value violation, subsequent value-affirmation dissipated dejection-type emotions. Finally, Chapter 5 reviews the contribution of the present research to theories that examine the manner in which <b>social</b> <b>values</b> influence cognitions, affect, and behaviour and outlines potential directions for future research. Overall, these results provide the first direct support for longstanding assumptions about a close link between <b>social</b> <b>values</b> and affect, while providing more precise information about which types of <b>social</b> <b>values</b> elicit which types of emotion...|$|R

40|$|The ‘death of evidence’ {{issue in}} Canada raises {{the specter of}} politicized science, and thus the {{question}} of what role <b>social</b> <b>values</b> may have in science and how this meshes with objectivity and evidence. I first criticize philosophical accounts that have to separate different steps of research to restrict the influence of social and other non-epistemic values. A prominent account that <b>social</b> <b>values</b> may play a role even in the context of theory acceptance is the argument from inductive risk. It maintains that the more severe the social consequences of erroneously accepting a theory would be, the more evidence is needed before the theory may be accepted. However, an implication of this position is that increasing evidence makes the impact of <b>social</b> <b>values</b> converge to zero; and I argue for a stronger role for <b>social</b> <b>values.</b> On this position, <b>social</b> <b>values</b> (together with epistemic values and other empirical considerations) may determine a theory’s conditions of adequacy, which among other things can include considerations about what makes a scientific account unbiased and complete. I illustrate this based on recent theories of human evolution and the social behaviour of non-human primates, where some of the <b>social</b> <b>values</b> implicated are feminist values. While many philosophical accounts (both arguments from inductive risk and from underdetermination) conceptualize the relevance of <b>social</b> <b>values</b> in terms of making inferences from evidence, I argue for the need for a broader philosophical framework, which is also motivated by issues pertaining to scientific explanation...|$|R
40|$|My aim is {{identifying}} {{the role of}} non-epistemic <b>values,</b> especially <b>social</b> <b>values,</b> in the justification of beliefs/theories. I will propose a new theory {{of the relation between}} <b>social</b> <b>values</b> and evidence. Beyond Underdetermination • The value-ladeness of scientific knowledge is relatively uncontroversial among HPS scholars. • It is commonly argued that <b>social</b> <b>values</b> “fill the gap ” of underdetermination of theory by evidence: “I take the general lesson of underdetermination to be that any empirical reasoning takes place against a background of assumptions that are neither self-evident nor logically true. Such assumptions, or auxiliary hypotheses, are the vehicles by which <b>social</b> <b>values</b> can enter into the scientific judgement. If, in principle, {{there is no way to}} mechanically eliminate background assumptions, then there is no way to mechanically eliminate <b>social</b> <b>values</b> and interests from such judgement ” (Longino 2004, 132 - 3). • However, as Rolin (2004) argues, the underdetermination thesis does not exhaust the role of values in science. • I identify another role of <b>social</b> <b>values</b> in science: substituting evidential support for theories, and I propose an epistemic mechanism (as opposed to psychological) for how this is done.

40|$|Background: Welfare {{states and}} the welfare {{policies}} in practice in welfare states have implications for population health. Studies have shown that attitudes towards welfare and welfare policies vary between welfare regimes, and that different factors, including <b>social</b> <b>values,</b> matter in the explanation of welfare attitudes. Objectives: The main {{purpose of this study}} has been to investigate how <b>social</b> <b>values</b> matter in the explanation of attitudes towards the welfare state's scope and responsibilities, and of attitudes towards taxation and financing in different welfare regimes. A second objective has been to investigate the levels of welfare attitudes and <b>social</b> <b>values</b> in different welfare regimes. Material and method: The analyses were conducted on the basis of data from the European Social Survey Round 4 2008 / 2009. The sample used consisted of all of the respondents from Germany, Great Britain and Sweden, which are examples of different types of welfare regimes. Descriptive analyses together with analysis of variance and hierarchical multiple regression analysis, were conducted in order to investigate <b>social</b> <b>values</b> and welfare attitudes. Results: The levels of the welfare attitudes and <b>social</b> <b>values</b> varied between the countries. In Sweden, the respondents were more positive to the welfare state's scope and responsibilities as well as to taxation and financing than the respondents in Germany and Great Britain. <b>Social</b> <b>values</b> had implications for welfare attitudes in all three countries; however, the explained variance in the attitudes was relatively low. Conclusion: The differences found in the levels of welfare attitudes and <b>social</b> <b>values</b> indicate that welfare attitudes vary between welfare regimes. <b>Social</b> <b>values</b> matter in the explanation of variance in attitudes towards the welfare state's scope and responsibilities, and in attitudes towards taxation and financing. The somewhat limited explanatory power indicates that more, and more thorough, studies on the mechanisms behind welfare attitudes are needed...|$|R

We sought to bring these issues together by employing a participatory approach to elicit ethical and <b>social</b> <b>values</b> in HTA. Our primary objective was to elicit a set of ethical and <b>social</b> <b>values</b> from citizens {{that could be used to}} guide Ontario's HTA evidentiary review and appraisal process. A secondary objective was to explore the feasibility of using participatory approaches to elicit these values. A 14 -person Citizens' Reference Panel on Health Technologies was established to provide input to the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee in developing its recommendations. A mixed methods approach was used where informed, deliberative discussions were combined with pre- and post-questionnaires, which assessed the relative importance of various ethical and <b>social</b> <b>values</b> as well as their stability over time. Over the course of five meetings, panel members progressed toward the identification of a set of core values - universal access, choice and quality care. These values were consistently prioritized as the core values that should be considered in the evaluation of health technologies and ensuing recommendations.

Other criticism focuses on the effect of the impact factor on behavior of scholars, editors and other stakeholders. Others have criticized the impact factor more generally on the institutional background of the neoliberal academia, claiming that what is needed is not just its replacement with more sophisticated metrics but a democratic discussion on the <b>social</b> <b>value</b> of research assessment and the growing precariousness of scientific careers.|$|E

25|$|The <b>social</b> <b>value</b> {{attached}} to the game – seen as a prestigious pastime associated with nobility and high culture – {{is clear from the}} expensive and exquisitely made chessboards of the medieval era. The popularity of chess in the Western courtly society peaked between the 12th and the 15th centuries. The game found mention in the vernacular and Latin language literature throughout Europe, and many works were written on or about chess between the 12th and the 15th centuries. H. J. R. Murray divides the works into three distinct parts: the didactic works e.g. Alexander of Neckham's De scaccis (approx. 1180); works of morality like Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium sive super ludo scacchorum (Book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the Book of Chess), written by Jacobus de Cessolis; and the works related to various chess problems, written largely after 1205. Chess terms, like check, were used by authors as a metaphor for various situations.|$|E
25|$|From a more {{academic}} {{point of}} view, Barak Libai, Eitan Muller and Renana Peres constructed a {{research in the}} subject which is {{among the first to}} shed light on the actual value created by word of mouth programs and explore issues such as how targeting opinion leaders creates more value than targeting random customers. In seeding programs, word-of-mouth can gain customers who would not otherwise have bought the product, this is called expansion. However, word-of-mouth can also accelerate the purchase process of customers who would have purchased anyway, the faster the adoption, the greater the profits. These processes of expansion and acceleration integrate to create <b>social</b> <b>value</b> in a word-of-mouth seeding program for a new product. Furthermore, when deciding upon an optimal seeding program, the researchers conclude that “Influencer Seeding Programs” yield higher customer equity than “random Seeding Programs”. Of course, the decision about which program type to adopt depends on how much the company is willing to invest in discovering their influencers.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{modern and}} foreign {{influences}} in Mexico’s {{culture in the}} 19th and 20th centuries, waves of nationalism have kept much of the country’s folk dance tradition alive to the present day. The next wave of popularity came after the Mexican Revolution, which also created new songs in folk styles such as the still popular La Adelita, La Valentina, and La Cucaracha. The years after the Revolution also sparked interest in Mexico’s indigenous heritage shifting away from the European emphasis of the Porfirian era. This was reinforced by the muralists and other artists of the 1920s and 1930s whose political aims were to forge a Mexican identity, rejecting foreign influences and politics. In the 1930s, {{the popularity of the}} dance prompted education and more formal training in it, with educational centers all over Mexico offering classes including the Departamento de Bellas Arts (Fine Arts Department) of Mexico City. Interest in folk dance declined in the 1950s and 1960s, but the Mexican government continued to subsidize it for its aesthetic and <b>social</b> <b>value.</b> This included the support of folk dance or ballet folklórico companies, the most famous of which is the Ballet Folklórico de México founded by Amalia Hernández in 1952.|$|E
