5|$|After the Allies {{landed in}} Sumatra, {{many of the}} Muslim Indian {{soldiers}} brought by the English deserted and joined the native revolutionaries. They planned <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mosque, including the assault on a British barracks. One of these Indian soldiers, {{who had died in}} the assault, was buried at the mosque. Since 1950, after Indonesia's independence was recognised, the Ganting Grand Mosque has hosted numerous statesmen from both Indonesia and abroad, including Vice President Mohammad Hatta, Minister of Defence Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, and General Abdul Haris Nasution. Foreign dignitaries who have visited the mosque included people from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions.

Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E

5|$|William I. McLaughlin {{proposed}} a new <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable {{events such as}} nova explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1988, which used outbursts of Nova Cygni 1975 as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
5|$|Athens was {{prevented}} from sending more effective aid by events on Euboea in 348 BC. A pre-eminent politician from Chalcis, Callias, sought {{to unite the}} cities of Euboea in a new confederation, inevitably meaning {{the end of the}} hitherto strong Athenian presence on the island. Strategically, this was unacceptable for the Athenians. In 410 BC, the strait between Euboea and the mainland, the Euripos, had been narrowed, and then bridged at Chalcis. If Euboea, and in particular Chalcis, was no longer controlled by Athens then Philip could potentially cross into Euboea from Thessaly, and then cross back into Boeotia via the bridge at Chalcis, thus outflanking Thermopylae. The whole Athenian <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years after 352 BC therefore required that they hold Euboea.|$|E
5|$|Despite Cimon's massive victory, {{something}} of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks {{do not appear to}} have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way. If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Aegean for the next decade and a half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about Stefan's childhood. His family {{could not afford to}} send him to a {{university}} abroad (only one of his brothers would do so); hence he embarked early on a military career. Before that, he attended a jesuit college, either in Kraków or Sandomierz, achieving a solid secondary education. After finishing his schooling, he became a courtier to then-royal prince and future king of Poland John II Casimir Vasa. As Stefan could not afford the equipment needed to join a hussar unit, he learned the art of war serving with the Lisowczycy mercenaries, joining them as towarzysz (companion, a junior cavalry officer) in the spring of 1621. Already an officer at the age of eighteen, he took part in the battle of Chocim (Khotyn) in 1621, where the Commonwealth army stopped the Ottomans and ended the Polish–Ottoman War (1620–21). His years with the brutal Lisowczycy mercenaries would impact his <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter years, where he would not hesitate to use any means necessary – including mistreatment of civilians – to achieve victory.|$|E
5|$|The Down Relief {{line between}} Bristol Temple Meads and Parson Street {{is to be}} {{partially}} reinstated {{as part of the}} MetroWest scheme in order to ease congestion.

It was predicted that by 2019, trains working the line would be completely full during peak hours. While the three tracks could cope with traffic generated by the reopening of the Portishead Line, campaigners note it would leave little room for growth. Parson Street Junction will also be upgraded during the works.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{did not see}} the Canadian Corps's {{capture of}} Vimy Ridge as a loss. Contemporary German sources viewed the action, at worst, as a draw, given that no {{full-scale}} breakthrough occurred following the attack. The Germans did not attempt to recapture the ridge, even during the Spring Offensive and it remained under British control {{until the end of the}} war. The loss of Vimy Ridge forced the Germans to reassess their defensive <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. Instead of mounting a counterattack, they pursued a scorched earth policy and retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line. The complete failure of the French Nivelle Offensive in the week after the Arras Offensive placed pressure on Field Marshal Douglas Haig to keep the Germans occupied in the Arras sector to minimize French losses. The Canadian Corps participated in several of these actions including the Battle of Arleux and the Third Battle of the Scarpe in late April and early May 1917.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese had {{captured}} Bougainville in early 1942, and had subsequently built {{it into a}} significant base {{with large numbers of}} aircraft and troops, {{in order to protect the}} fortress at Rabaul. Following this, Allied planners determined that their key <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region would be reduction of the base at Rabaul. To do this, they needed airfields within range, and as such, it was decided to secure the western part of Bougainville, landing around Torokina in November 1943. Heavy fighting followed the landing, but after a large-scale Japanese counter-attack was defeated in March 1944, the Japanese withdrew from the US lodgement and subsequently a period of relative quiet followed as the US forces limited themselves to patrolling and establishing outposts, rather than large-scale operations.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is {{responsible}} for general <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oil and gas sectors and for monitoring the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. The oil, gas and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco, which has a near monopoly in these areas. It is the world's biggest oil producer, the Middle East's biggest company and is {{generally considered to be}} the most important energy company in the world. However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves. This was the first time since the 1970s that foreign companies have been permitted to search for oil or gas.|$|E
5|$|The Seditionista raid on Ojo de Agua had a vast {{impact on}} American {{military}} <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The {{severity of the}} raid led the commanding American general in the region, General Frederick Funston, to reinforce the Texas–Mexico border region with troops and to contact Washington with demands that he be allowed to give no quarter to any Mexican raiders who attacked the United States in the future. Although Washington denied General Funston his request, the raids did {{come to an end}} when Washington finally gave diplomatic recognition to the Mexican government under Carranza. Wishing to maintain good relations with the American government, Carranza ordered the Seditionista commanders to cease their raiding activities. Without support from the Mexican federal government the Plan of San Diego movement fell apart and there were no further Mexican invasions of the United States until the Villistas raids began in 1916.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} the storm finished, the Allied fleet {{returned}} to Artemisium to protect the flank of the army at Thermopylae. The following day, (the fifth since the Persians had arrived at Thermopylae) the Persian army began their attacks on the Allied army at Thermopylae. The same day, the Persian fleet finally appeared through the Gap of Sciathos, and began mooring on the coast opposite Artemisium, at Aphetae. According to Herodotus, 15 Persian ships blundered into the Allied lines, and were captured. Although clearly storm damaged, the Persian fleet still probably outnumbered the Allies by nearly 3:1. As a result, the Allies contemplated withdrawing completely. The Euboeans, {{not wanting to be}} abandoned to the Persians, bribed Themistocles to try to ensure that the Allied fleet remained. Since the joint operation at Thermopylae and Artemisium was his <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first place, it is likely this is exactly what Themistocles wanted, and this bribe allowed him in turn to bribe the Spartan and Corinthian admirals, Eurybiades and Adeimantus to remain at Artemisium.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Tulagi, on 3–4 May 1942, {{was part of}} Operation Mo, the Empire of Japan's <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South Pacific and South West Pacific Area in 1942. The plan called for Imperial Japanese Navy troops to capture Tulagi and nearby islands in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The occupation of Tulagi by the Japanese was intended to cover the flank of and provide reconnaissance support for Japanese forces that were advancing on Port Moresby in New Guinea, provide greater defensive depth for the major Japanese base at Rabaul, {{and serve as a}} base for Japanese forces to threaten and interdict the supply and communication routes between the United States and Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|To {{disrupt the}} {{preparations}} of this army, the British Royal Navy, which had controlled {{most of the}} Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, seized the Dalmatian Island of Lissa in 1807 and {{used it as a}} base for raiding the coastal shipping of Italy and Illyria. These operations captured dozens of ships and caused panic and disruption to French <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. To counter this, the French government started a major shipbuilding programme in the Italian seaports, particularly Venice, and despatched frigates of their own to protect their shipping. Commodore Bernard Dubourdieu's Franco-Venetian forces were unable to bring the smaller British force under William Hoste to a concerted action, where Dubourdieu's superior numbers might prove decisive. Instead, the British and French frigate squadrons engaged in a campaign of raids and counter-raids during 1810.|$|E

5|$|Two French frigates {{were lost}} at Tamatave, taking {{the number of}} frigates lost by the French Navy during the {{campaign}} to ten. The defeat {{marked the end of}} the campaign and the end of French hopes of seriously disrupting British trade with India: the only remaining safe harbours in the region were a few Dutch colonies on Java, which became the next target of the Royal Navy forces in the region. The Mauritius campaign also had an effect on British post-war <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean, demonstrated by the retention of Mauritius as a colony. Bourbon was returned to France in 1814 after Napoleon's abdication. With strategic bases placed along their trade routes, British convoys were assured a greater degree of safety and the Royal Navy provided with the infrastructure to operate worldwide.|$|E
5|$|When the Ionians and Persians {{arrived at}} Naxos, they were faced by a well-fortified and {{supplied}} city. Herodotus does not explicitly say, {{but this was}} presumably the eponymous capital of Naxos. He provides few details of the military actions that ensued, {{although there is a}} suggestion that there was an initial assault on the city, which was repelled. The Ionians and Persians thus settled down to besiege the city. However, after four months, the Persians had run out of money, with Aristagoras also spending a great deal. Thoroughly demoralised, the expedition prepared to return to Asia Minor empty handed. Before leaving, they built a stronghold for the exiled Naxian aristocrats on the island. This was a typical <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Greek world for those exiled by internal strife, giving them a base from which to quickly return, as events permitted.|$|E
5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars that {{followed}} them, British {{dominance in the}} Indian Ocean was repeatedly challenged by the depredations of French vessels sailing from the isolated and well protected French colonies of Réunion (later Île Bonaparte) and Île de France. Although French Navy cruisers were periodically stationed on the islands, the majority of ships that preyed on British commerce from the islands were privateers, independently funded armed ships issued with letters of marque giving them permission to attack military and civilian ships belonging to the enemies of France. French naval <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean was so reliant on privateers that entire squadrons developed, including a powerful force under the wealthy privateer captain Robert Surcouf. Although most privateers were small, carrying only a few cannon, some could be very large, rivalling professional warships in size. One such ship was the Bellone, which carried 34 guns, a crew of nearly 200 men and was commanded by Captain Jacques François Perroud, a notorious privateer who had caused significant damage to British trade in the Indian Ocean. In 1803, Perroud had gained significant notoriety with the capture of the valuable East Indiaman Lord Nelson on 14 August 1803.|$|E
