25|$|The {{day after}} {{arriving}} in Portland, Ladd rented a small store at 42 Front Street and sent an order to Tilton for more liquor. At that time, Portland contained 6-8 saloons and retail liquor stores, with approximately 30 retail stores. One saloon had just received its first billiard table. Ladd only grossed $41.40 {{in the last two}} weeks of April and was unable to pay the $6 property tax, instead exchanging several nights and mornings to remove two stumps from the street in lieu of payment. Early May proved better for Ladd, selling a large amount of gin to Barrell, adding the local Skidmore's California House hotel and Ainsworth's Lot Whitcomb steamer as customers. Ladd began to branch out, adding eggs, chickens, and other local goods to his liquor store. He then earned $250 by selling goods from W. D. Gookin on consignment, adding <b>shaving</b> <b>soap,</b> tobacco, paper, farm tools, blasting powder to his store. In August 1851, Ladd's gross sales were $1000.|$|E
25|$|The {{radio was}} built and {{operated}} in the British other ranks' compound. The {{maker of the}} radio was Warrant Officer Leonard A. T. Beckett, an experienced radio engineer, who was assisted in its construction, operation, and concealment by {{a core group of}} three other soldiers. Before Beckett could begin on the radio he first had to make some of the tools needed, such as a lathe and a soldering iron. In addition to the genuine radio parts provided by the Chinese family and a few parts brought along with the men from Tanjung Priok, the radio was constructed from items as diverse as a deaf aid, the steering damper of a Norton motorcycle, a bakelite <b>shaving</b> <b>soap</b> container, an army mess tin, the backing of an old map case, pieces of glass, wire, mica and barbed wire, and parts stolen from Japanese-owned motor cars and motorcycles. The receiver was completed within four weeks of starting.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Frederick J. McNulty, the ship's {{assistant}} surgeon, {{eventually became}} a resident of Boston, Massachusetts, where he was first employed as Superintendent of the City Lunatic Asylum at Austin Farm and, later, opened there a private sanitarium called Pine Grove Retreat at Roslindale while continuing to reside at 706 Huntington Avenue, Boston. He became a primary historical source for chroniclers of the adventures of the Shenandoah. A man of adventurous and irascible temper, Whittle recounts McNulty having laid the ship's barber out with a single blow when the barber shoved <b>shaving</b> <b>soap</b> in his mouth {{as part of the}} crew's hazing of the ship's officers in celebration of crossing the equator. McNulty enlisted as a surgical officer in the Chilean Navy immediately after the surrender of the Shenandoah and later in 1869 accepted a commission in the Cuban Patriot Army, but was repeatedly prevented from traveling to join the Army by U.S. government authorities before settling in Boston in 1879. McNulty is variously reported to have been a native of Ireland, the District of Columbia and Richmond, Virginia, but was most likely a native of Ireland. He graduated from the Georgetown University School of Medicine in the District of Columbia and lived in Richmond, Virginia before resigning his commission in the medical service of the U.S. Navy to accept a commission in the Confederate States Navy. McNulty died at his home in Boston on June 14, 1897, at the age of 62.|$|E

2500|$|During Murrow's {{tenure as}} vice president, his {{relationship}} with Shirer ended in 1947 {{in one of the}} great confrontations of American broadcast journalism, when Shirer was fired by CBS. He said he resigned in the heat of an interview at the time, but was actually terminated. The dispute began when J.B. Williams, maker of <b>shaving</b> <b>soap,</b> withdrew its sponsorship of Shirer's Sunday news show. CBS, of which Murrow was then vice president for public affairs, decided to [...] "move in a new direction," [...] hired a new host, and let Shirer go. There are different versions of these events; Shirer's was not made public until 1990.|$|E

6000|$|There was {{considerable}} {{delay in the}} production of dinner, and poor Mrs Todgers, being reproached in confidence by Jinkins, slipped in and out, at least twenty times to see about it; always coming back as though she had no such thing upon her mind, and hadn't been out at all. But there was no hitch in the conversation nevertheless; for one gentleman, who travelled in the perfumery line, exhibited an interesting nick-nack, {{in the way of a}} remarkable cake of <b>shaving</b> <b>soap</b> which he had lately met with in Germany; and the gentleman of a literary turn repeated (by desire) some sarcastic stanzas he had recently produced on the freezing of the tank at the back of the house.

At thirty-two minutes after twelve {{he was in his}} room, packing his wicker {{suitcase}} by the method of throwing things in and stamping on the case till it closed. In it he had absolutely all of his toilet refinements and wardrobe except the important portion already in use. They consisted, according to faithful detailed report, of four extra pairs of thick yellow and white cotton socks; two shirts, five collars, five handkerchiefs; a pair of surprisingly vain dancing pumps; high tan laced boots; three suits of cheap cotton underclothes; his Sunday suit, which was dead black in color, and unimaginative in cut; four ties; a fagged toothbrush, a comb and hairbrush, a razor, a strop, <b>shaving</b> <b>soap</b> in a mug; a not very clean towel; and nothing else whatever.|$|E

(You {{get used to}} little things like that.) He said he'd found it, and please would I identify, because if {{it was one of}} Ibn Makarrah's men there might be a reward. It was an old Mohammedan, with a strong dash of Arab--a smallboned, bald-headed chap, and I was just wondering how it had kept so well in our climate when it sneezed. You ought to have seen the nigger! He fetched a howl and bolted like--like the dog in 'Tom Sawyer,' when he sat on the what's-its-name beetle. He yelped as he ran, and the corpse went on sneezing. I could see it had been sarkied. (That's a sort of gum-poison, pater, which attacks the nerve centres. Our chief medical officer is writing a monograph about it.) So Imam Din and I emptied out the corpse one time, with my <b>shaving</b> <b>soap</b> and trade gunpowder, and hot water.|$|E
50|$|Shaving oil is {{normally}} a vegetable oil, blend of vegetable oils or siloxanes with essential oils {{that can be}} used as a stand-alone shaving lubricant or as pre-shave underneath <b>shaving</b> cream, <b>soap</b> or gel, to facilitate the shaving of facial and other body hair. Often these products would work best by wetting the area before the razor is used.|$|R
25|$|The {{electric}} razor has a rotating, vibrating or oscillating {{blade to}} remove unwanted hair. The electric razor {{does not require}} the use of <b>shaving</b> cream, <b>soap,</b> or water.

Jacob Schick.|$|R
25|$|Vegans {{will not}} use {{personal}} care products or household cleaners that contain animal products. Animal ingredients are ubiquitous because they are cheap. After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers are put through the rendering process, and some of that material, particularly the fat, ends up in toiletries. Common ingredients include tallow in soap, and collagen-derived glycerine, used as a lubricant and humectant in many haircare products, moisturizers, <b>shaving</b> foams, <b>soaps</b> and toothpastes.|$|R
6000|$|Englishmen, as a rule, shave {{themselves}} {{when they do not}} wear beards. The author of the little pamphlet before us gives a dozen curious hints which prove the difficulty of the art. Almost all razors, he seems to think, were [...] "made to sell." [...] He suggests that razors of tried and trusty character, razors whose public form can be depended upon, should be purchased of barbers. But it is not every barber who will part with such possessions. Razors are like Scotch sheep dogs; no one would keep a bad one, or sell, or give away a good one. Coelebs did not find the quest of a wife more arduous than all men find that of a really responsible razor. You may be unlucky in the important matter of lather. For soap our author gives a recipe which reminds one of Walton's quaint prescriptions and queer preparations. <b>Shaving</b> <b>soap</b> should be made at home, it seems, and the mystery of its manufacture is here disclosed. The only way to keep razors [...] "set" [...] is to persevere in sending them to various barbers till the genius who can [...] "set" [...] them to your hand is discovered. Perhaps he lives at Aleppo; perhaps, like the father of a heroine of comic song, at Jerusalem. Till he is discovered the shaver wins no secure happiness, and in the search for the barber who has an elective affinity for the shaver may be found material for an operetta or an epic. The shaver figures as a sort of Alastor, seeking the ideal setter of razors, as Shelley's Alastor sought ideal beauty in the neighbourhood of Afghanistan, and in the very home of the Central Asian Question. No razor should be condemned till it has been [...] "stropped" [...] well and carefully. And this brings us to the great topic of strops. Some say that soldiers' old buff belts make the best strops. The Scotch peasantry use a peculiar hard smooth fungus which grows in decaying elm trees. Our author has heard that [...] "Government now demands the return of" [...] the old buff belts. Government cannot want them all for its own use, and perhaps will see to it that old buff strops once more find an open market. In the lack of old buff belts, you may mix up tallow and the ashes of burnt newspaper, and smear this unctuous compound on the strop. People who neglect these [...] "tips," [...] and who are clumsy, like most of us, may waste a forty-eighth part of their adult years in shaving. This time is worth economizing, and with a little forethought, an ideal razor-setter, tallow, buff belts, burnt newspapers, and the rest, we may shave in five minutes daily.|$|E
50|$|Traditional <b>shaving</b> <b>soap</b> {{is often}} {{sold as a}} round puck, either with a rounded bottom {{intended}} for use with a shaving scuttle or a flat bottom {{for use in a}} mug. High-end soaps may be sold with their own dishes, typically made of either wood or ceramic, and be formed to fit the dish with which the puck is sold. <b>Shaving</b> <b>soap</b> may also be formed in a stick, sold either in a plastic tube or wrapped in foil or paper. <b>Shaving</b> <b>soap</b> is more rarely sold as rectangular bars (as is common with body soap).|$|E

On Sunday morning, after breakfast, when Billy was starting {{to go to the}} barber shop, she led him into the bedroom, whisked a towel aside, and revealed the razor box, <b>shaving</b> mug, <b>soap,</b> brush, and lather all ready. Billy recoiled, then came back to make curious investigation. He gazed pityingly at the safety razor.|$|R
50|$|The {{electric}} razor (also {{known as}} the dry razor, electric shaver, or simply shaver) has a rotating or oscillating blade. The electric razor usually {{does not require the}} use of <b>shaving</b> cream, <b>soap,</b> or water. The razor may be powered by a small DC motor, which is either powered by batteries or mains electricity. Many modern ones are powered using rechargeable batteries. Alternatively, an electro-mechanical oscillator driven by an AC-energized solenoid may be used. Some very early mechanical shavers had no electric motor and had to be powered by hand, for example by pulling a cord to drive a flywheel.|$|R
50|$|The {{personal}} equipment {{issued to}} every enlisted guardsmen {{and expected to}} be brought to training included: a coverall, issue shoes, a helmet liner, a gas mask, a water canteen, a web belt, a bayonet, a denim coat, trousers and a hat: a raincoat, a rifle, a waist belt, and a revolver. For non-commissioned officers, gear included a khaki cotton shirt, trousers, a tie, a cap, dress shoes, towels, a wash cloth, underwear, socks, a tooth brush and paste, a bathing suit, a <b>shaving</b> outfit, <b>soap,</b> shoe polish and a rag, a comb and brush, and a small mirror.|$|R

50|$|<b>Shaving</b> <b>soap</b> {{typically}} {{refers to}} a hard soap that is whipped into a lather using a shaving brush. The lather it produces is used to coat the face during shaving, providing protection and lubrication for the razor. Among cartridge razor users, <b>shaving</b> <b>soap</b> has largely been displaced by canned shaving foam or gel, but hard shaving soaps are still utilized by users of double-edge safety razors and straight razors.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{advantages}} of <b>shaving</b> <b>soap</b> over aerosol shaving creams is the additional hydration provided by shaving soaps. For optimal softening of whiskers, the natural oils {{on the face}} and whiskers must be removed. After oil {{is removed from the}} whiskers by the <b>shaving</b> <b>soap</b> and brush, water can more easily penetrate the whiskers. This results in whiskers being more easily cut than when using soapless creams and not brushing.|$|E
