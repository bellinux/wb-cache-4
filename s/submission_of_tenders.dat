ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Expenditure on South African {{public sector}} {{projects}} {{is vital to}} infrastructure development and creating employment opportunities in the country. The <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenders</b> by contractors is the traditional procurement method utilised in awarding contracts. The traditional tender procurement method is not only costly, but the lowest-bid method does not ensure that the eventual project at completion is the most cost effective. Although regulatory frameworks are in place to ensure that public sector projects are awarded to suitable contractors, there are numerous examples of public sector projects that have been awarded to incompetent contractors. The traditional tender procurement method is non-collaborative in its composition, as the contractors executing the work {{are not part of}} the design team. Furthermore, industry stakeholders’ perceptions influence procurement method preferences. This research project investigates whether the tender procurement method is best suited to meet the South African public sector’s requirements and achieve infrastructural development so desperately required, or whether it needs to be replaced in its entirety or adapted...|$|E
40|$|In {{the modern}} {{building}} industry {{it is important}} for a contracting company to be awarded contracts on a constant basis and to be present on the market with its services and tenders. All large constructing companies constantly apply for invitations to tenders and prepare relevant bidding prices. A well-prepared bidding price is essential in for a company to be awarded the contract and to sign the construction contract. Bidding price is prepared for the clients who sign, based on this price, the construction contract with a contracting company. The bidding price of a facility is determined in the contract or bidding price preparation process. This is a part of a construction project which is repeated in each project. The bidding price accuracy is crucial for the project’s final financial success. Analysis of the bidding price preparation and a description of procedures from the reception of the tender documents to the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenders,</b> and the types of construction and trade works are presented in the thesis. The thesis also provides a brief presentation of an example of construction works calculation and analysis of subcontracting tenders drawn up for the facility of the Red Cross of Slovenia at Debeli rtič, for which a contracting company Energoplan was preparing a bidding price...|$|E
40|$|The UK's NJCC Code of Procedure for Single Stage Selective Tendering (now withdrawn) and its successor, the CIB's Code of Practice for the Selection of Main Contractors are {{criticized in}} the light of {{decisions}} of the common law courts with regard to regulation of the tendering process. It is argued that a new 'Tendering Code' should be produced in the style and format of a contract document which reflects not only the statutory regulation imposed on public bodies, but common law decisions of the courts. The nature of this tendering contract is explained as a means of regulating the tendering process. Issues discussed are: dealing with errors and irregularities found in tenders; dealing with non-compliant tenders; dealing with tender withdrawal prior to its acceptance or rejection; making provisions as to time for <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenders</b> and dealing with late tenders; making provision for submission of tender by fax or other electronic means; making provision for evaluation of tenders received; and imposing or negotiating reductions in price with tenderers prior to acceptance. The paper concludes that the common law obligations placed on the owner to treat all tenderers equally and fairly and to apply the tender conditions when evaluating tenders and awarding contracts seems to be good common sense and of commercial advantage, not only to the immediate parties concerned but also to the wider community.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. In 1999, WB and ADB conducted joint review of the country portfolio procurement performance and prepared an action plan for government on public procurement. The World Bank {{in agreement with the}} Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has prepared the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) in 2002 and identified several deficiencies in the procurement system of the GoB. As per recommendations of the CPAR, the GoB established a procurement policy unit within the Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) under planning ministry. GoB then issued “The Public Procurement Regulations 2003 ” in September 2003 for streamlining the process and to ensure unified procurement systems for government’s departments as well as autonomous, semi-autonomous bodies and corporations. In July’ 2006 GoB then enacted “The Public Procurement Act, 2006 ” (PPA 2006) and consequently in January’ 2008 issued “The Public Procurement Rules, 2008 ” (PPR 2008) to ensure transparency and accountability in the procurement of goods, works and services using public funds. On the other hand, the world bank guidelines are used for the procurement under IDA financed project. The objectives of the research was to study the effectiveness of the procurement course of actions in LGED under IDA and GoB funded projects as well as to find out the factors affecting procurement management systems and to suggest for further enhancement of the procurement process. The methodology of this research was a combination of literature review, questionnaire survey, key informants interview and secondary data collection from project offices. The major literatures that reviewed are world bank procurement guidelines, PPA 2006, PPR 2008, website documents, different procurement journals and reports. The questionnaire survey data were collected from 30 different levels LGED officials as well as from 8 contractors and 2 consultants. The major findings in this research are; Tender Notices floated as per Rule 61 (4) of PPR 2008 keeping sufficient time for the preparation and <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenders</b> from the date of advertisement on the basis of official estimated costs. 93 % and 87 % of TER approved within specified timeframe for GoB funded IRIDP project and IDA financed RTIP II project respectively. The main reasons for time extension is due to fund flow crisis, shortage of labour, price hike of construction materials and natural calamities delay works. The main causes for contract variation are scope of work change, faulty estimate preparation and design variation. Barriers for proper contract implementation are; lack of commitment both PEs and contractors, lack of knowledge on procurement processing for the PE’s staffs, massive tender documents, lack of Procurement Effectiveness in LGED Page vi training and development, political influences, lack of knowledge of the contractors and their staffs, attitudal problems, fund flow crisis and so on related issues. 100 % respondents commented that introduction of e-procurement system increased efficiency and decreased malpractices in the procurement process. It is observed that IDA financed RTIP II project is better performing than GoB funded IRIDP project because of better fund flow, extensive monitoring & supervision systems, application of donor’s compliances and so on related issues. Major suggestions provided by the researcher for effective implementation of the procurement process are; Publication of user friendly simplified tender documents, Strict applications of the procurement rules and regulations, Estimate should be prepared more cautiously to avoid variation order preparation, Time extension should be discouraged by applying liquidated damages, Ensuring training and development both for PE’s staffs as well as for contractor’s concern personnel for adapting them in effective procurement practices, Ensuring governance and internal control for making it more effective, Introducing reward system for better performance and punishment for poor performance for effective implementation of the contracts, Ensuring extensive use of e-procurement systems to increase efficiency, transparency and quick processing.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to discuss}} the process of {{concluding}} contracts resulting from public tender, and its comparison with the draft law on procurement procedures approved by the Czech government. The thesis describes the current legislation on concluding contracts resulting from public tender and its subsequent amendments in three separate chapters. The first chapter briefly defines the basic terminology of the public procurement procedure, which is crucial for {{the whole process of}} concluding public procurement contracts. The second chapter deals with selected aspects of conclusion of public procurement contracts in open procedure. These aspects are commencing <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> procedure, boundness <b>of</b> the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender,</b> security, opening <b>of</b> envelopes with <b>submissions,</b> and the selection <b>of</b> the best <b>submission</b> and obligations <b>of</b> public authorities after conclusion of public procurement contract. Chapter three is the most detailed part of the thesis, which deals with changes in public procurement contracts. Chapter three first describes the development of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and then is followed by changes in the subject of public procurement contracts and changes in the contracting parties of public procurement contracts.

Misrepresentations, specifically to the Department of Public Works, are made in various forms and stages during the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> documentation by contractors. The status of BEE company owners is abused in order to secure contracts. Apartheid in South Africa prevented black citizens from entering the corporate world and thereby attaining a quality education. The South African government has, since 1994, adopted the BEE policy in order to redress racial and economic imbalances of the past. Fronting (which is regarded as fraud) is detrimental to {{the objectives of}} BEE, which are governed by legislation. Fronting further negatively affects the transformation of the South African economy which could be globally competitive.

40|$|Tendering {{processes}} {{are considered to}} be a suitable mechanism for governments to fairly assign contracts for construction projects and procurement. The demand for efficiencies to be created in the process has resulted in a significant number of governments implementing e-tendering systems. E-tendering systems generally involve the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> offer documents to a secure system hosted by the government (principal). An electronic environment presents obvious opportunities for collusion between principal and certain tenderers, fraud by tenderers and a minefield of legal uncertainties for fuelling protracted disputes. Critical examination of the security and legal requirements for e-tendering systems does not appear in the current literature. This paper identifies key security and legal issues to be addressed in the design of e-tendering systems, which may be included in e-procurement software, and proposes a new e-tendering architecture, using distributed trusted third parties which may be suitable for secure large scale operations such as the construction industry...|$|R

The prescribed bomb load and range requirements were routinely revised upwards by the Air Ministry; by November 1935, figures within the Ministry were interested in the possibility of operating the aircraft at an all-up weight of 30,500lb, which aviation author C.F.

40|$|Qualification {{requirements}} for foreign suppliers in Public Procurement (PP) {{are quite different}} in each European Union (EU) member state. The most complex {{requirements for}} foreign suppliers {{in the context of}} public purchases are included in the Czech PP law. The aim {{of this paper is to}} make an overview of the problem of qualification requirements for foreign suppliers in the PP law of the CR. Its sub-objectives are the identification and explanation of solutions to the problem in the PP legislation of neighboring countries of the CR that are also members of the EU. The methodological part of the contribution is based mainly on the analysis and critical evaluation of the current state of legal issues relating to the proof of qualification of foreign suppliers in PP orders of the CR; with examples of fairly extensive decision-making practices of the Office for the Protection of Competition and law courts, including the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. The paper highlights the unnecessary complexity of qualification requirements that, on purely formal grounds, inhibits <b>submissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenders</b> from potential foreign suppliers that would otherwise be able to submit a bid for a public contract without any problems whatsoever. The authors are using and applying a comparative-legal method in the context of the comparison of the PP legislation of neighboring countries of the CR that are also members of the EU. The case study of foreign suppliers bidding for above-threshold public tenders in the CR at the minimum legal requirements of the contracting authority (CA) for proof of qualification, the comparation study with selected EU countries or analysis of the development of the proportion of public contracts awarded to foreign suppliers in 2010 – 2014 shows that there is legislation uncertainty in EU PP law that should be reduced and simplified on an EC basis...|$|R
40|$|Today {{more than}} ever, {{the world of}} Public Procurement is {{regulated}} by a large and diverse body of law, constantly updated and enriched. The environmental issue {{is one of the}} subjects that is gaining more and more on the international level and so the new regulations of Procurement must consider it in its articles.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 58 - 59). Transparency, efficiency, accountability, competitiveness, equitable treatment and free & fair competition are essential for using public funds. To streamline these objectives through public procurement, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh has enacted Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2006 and thereafter issued Public Procurement Rules (PPR) 2008. The Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) is continually monitoring the compliance procurement activities in 04 target agencies {{in the light of}} 45 predetermined Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Among the four target agencies, LGED and RHD are the largest in terms of budget allocation against the projects in the Annual Development Programme (ADP). It is generally said that a total of 80 % of ADP allocation are spent for procurement of goods, works and services. Thus, {{it seems to be a}} good consideration to have a look at the compliance issues of PPR 2008 in RHD and LGED’s procurement activities. The present study seeks to provide an assessment of the current procurement performance of LGED & RHD and to find out the gap of compliance with scope of improvement for implementation of PPR 2008. A semi structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data from randomly selected 60 procurement practitioners working in LGED (30) and RHD (30). The Responses were analyzed by using SPSS 17 version package. The related literatures and reports, particularly from LGED and SRGB, have been thoroughly reviewed before conducting the main research work. The key findings of these reports have been compared and analyzed to draw conclusion of the study. The highest proportion of the respondent was middle aged and male. Majority of them were from engineering background with post graduate education and were trained in public procurement. The study found that LGED performed better in respect of KPI 4 (Percentage <b>of</b> <b>Tenders</b> following Development Partner Rules), KPI 6 (Average number of days between publishing <b>of</b> advertisement and <b>Tender</b> <b>submission</b> deadline), KPI 7 (Percentage <b>of</b> <b>Tenders</b> having sufficient tender submission time), KPI 10 (Ratio <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>Tender</b> <b>submission</b> and number <b>of</b> <b>Tender</b> document sold), KPI 11 (Percentage of cases TOC included at least ONE member from TEC) and KPI 12 (Percentage of cases TEC formed by Contract Approving Authority) and KPI 13 (Percentage of cases TEC included two external members outside the Ministry or Division), KPI 14 (Average number <b>of</b> days between <b>Tender</b> opening and completion of evaluation), KPI 15 (Percentage <b>of</b> cases <b>Tender</b> evaluation has been completed within timeline), KPI 16 (Average number <b>of</b> responsive <b>Tenders),</b> KPI 19 (Average number of days taken between <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tender</b> Evaluation and approval of contract), KPI 22 (Percentage of cases contract award decision made within timeline by Contract Approving Authority after submitting Tender Evaluation Report), KPI 23 (Percentage of cases TER reviewed by person/ committee other than the Contract Approving Authority), KPI 25 (Average number of days between final approval and Notification of Award (NOA), KPI 27 (Average number of days between Invitation for Tender (IFT) and Notification of Award), KPI 32 (Percentage of Contracts fully completed and accepted). On the other hand RHD complied better on KPI 8 (Average number <b>of</b> Tenderers purchased <b>Tender</b> Documents), KPI 17 (Percentage of cases TEC recommended for Re- Tendering), KPI 20 (Percentage <b>of</b> <b>Tenders</b> approved by the proper financial delegated authority), KPI 24 (Percentage <b>of</b> <b>Tenders</b> approved by higher tier than the Contract Approving Authority), KPI 28 (Percentage of Contract awards published in CPTU’s website), KPI 34 (Percentage of cases (considering each installment as a case) with delayed payment), KPI 38 (Percentage of cases complaints have been resolved), KPI 41 (Percentage of Contracts with unresolved disputes), and KPI 44 (Percentage of procuring entity which has at least one trained/ certified procurement staff). The perceptions of the respondents regarding procurement performance need to investigate more cautiously as there are ambiguity among the findings of present study, individual consultant’s reports and SRGB’s report. The scenario may be more or less similar in other target agencies. Although LGED is being complied better than RHD against most of the KPIs, there is scope and need for improvement to have a 100 % compliance of PPR 2008 in both of the organizations. Abu Sayed Md.

40|$|In 2004 the {{competitive}} dialogue (CD) {{was introduced by}} the European Parliament and the Council. It was presented as a public sector procurement procedure for particularly complex contracts. The purpose of CD is to provide the public client with a flexible procedure to enable a discussion concerning {{all aspects of the}} contract with several contenders - to identify and define the means best suited to meeting its objectives - in an intervening stage between the tender announcement and the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> final <b>tenders.</b> The discussions during the drafting of the CD procedure pivoted around transparent trust based collaboration, preserving fair competition and providing stimulus for innovation. This paper presents the first results of an evaluation study of 15 CD projects (partly still ongoing) in the realm of construction. The findings indicate that clients as well as contenders struggle with a number of practical issues related to the organisation of the dialogue. Furthermore, both struggle with the dynamics of risk avoidance pushing them towards detailing and high transaction costs. The research indicates that {{the competitive}} dialogue is an ambivalent procedure: both parties involved in the procedure balance between the wish to cooperate and the sensed need of keeping information to themselves because of competition. Nevertheless both see the potential of the CD procedure. Further research is needed to find out how the two principles of cooperation and competition during the CD procedure are related...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 33 - 34). Transparency, efficiency, accountability, competitiveness, equitable treatment and free & fair competition are essential to be ensured in the procurement using public funds. In Bangladesh, these could not be ensured earlier {{due to a lack}} of proper rules and regulation. To streamline the public procurement activities, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh has enacted Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2006 and thereafter issued Public Procurement Rules (PPR) 2008. Since then government agencies are bound to abide by the Act and Rules very strictly in their procurement activities. The Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) is continually monitoring the compliance of PPA 2006 and PPR 2008 by the target agencies in the light of 45 predetermined Key Performance Indicators (KPI). In spite of being a major procuring agency of the country PWD is not among the four target agency. At the time of selection of the target agency the amount of procurement in PWD is not in the first four. But after that the amount of procurement has increased substantially. Now PWD has procured more than Water development Board (one of the four target agency). For not being in the list of initial selection, the procurement activities of PWD are not monitored keenly. Now it is required to take a look on PWD’s procurement activities. The research has been designed under the questions if PWD is following PPR 2008 completely or not; and if not, then the causes behind that. The main objectives of the present study are to find out the extent of compliance of PPR 2008 by PWD and to find out the gap of compliance and scope of improvement for implementation. The related literatures and reports, particularly from PWD and SRGB, have been thoroughly reviewed before conducting the main research work. The key findings of these reports have been compared and analyzed which helped to draw important conclusion of the study. A questionnaire survey was carried out to collect data of different projects undertaken by PWD. The study result shows a clear noncompliance to the rules of PPR 2008 in PWD in carrying out some of the compliance related KPIs. Among the 11 different compliance issues, it has been revealed that PWD is doing well in 7 KPIs. For other 4 issues namely <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> report by the TEC, Average number of days taken between <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tender</b> Evaluation Report and approval of contract, Average number of days between final approval and Notification of Award (NOA) and Percentage of Contracts where interest for delayed payments was made are not satisfactory and a clear improvement is required in these areas. For improvement of these situations, some specific recommendations have been drawn. These are (i) Compiling the contractors profile (ii) Empowering the lower tier will decrease the time in approval process (iii) Strong adherence of law and effective internal auditing payment of interest in case of delayed payment should be considered carefully to protect the interests of both the parties. (v) Introduction to e-gp (vi) Training on Procurement law (vii) to ensure the timely payment to the contractors, tender should be floated only after availability of sufficient fund.

40|$|The {{construction}} business, {{like any}} other business, is risky. However, construction projects are perceived to have more inherent risks due to the involvement of many contracting parties such as owners, designers, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, etc. Construction projects are unique and built only once. During the bidding stage contractor is facing {{a greater risk of}} having mistakes in pricing Bill of quantities and preparing project schedule, due to lack of details about site, client, construction drawings, etc. It is a tiresome exercise for the Quantity surveyors to accurately price a bill of quantities which normally comprises over two hundred measured work items. Contractor’s risk exposure to have errors (mistakes) commences with the receipt <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> and in order to arrive at a commercially viable and competitive tender price, the tenders often adopt rule of thumb and various guesswork within the restricted time frame available for <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> duly completed <b>tender.</b> This research discusses about the risk areas in the construction industry and what are the errors happened to contractors and their importance and contribution in a dispute case.

From the survey and the data analysis, it is identified the importance of each bidding error, made by contractors, and their relationship to dispute case, at the post contract stage. By this research it is expected to establish a relationship between risks in the construction industry and mistakes of contractors at the bidding stage.

40|$|The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1 {{provides}} that organs of state {{must comply with}} five principles when procuring goods or services: procurement procedures must be fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective. In short, this means that organs of state should make use of competition when procuring goods or services. They should shop around and attract {{the maximum number of}} contractors who will participate in such competition. The aim should be the attainment of value for money, meaning, public money should be spent in an effective and efficient manner. Those who participate in competitions should also be treated fairly and without bias. In principle, no preferences should be afforded to different contractors; all contracting parties should have equal access to competition; some contractors should not be afforded more time for the preparation and <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> quotes or <b>tenders</b> than others; and the same information should be made available to all contracting parties. Government procurement procedures should further be transparent, meaning public or open. Thus, organs of state should not contract behind closed doors – government contracts should, as a rule, be advertised. Depending on the nature and value of a particular contract, the use of a public call for tenders is generally the best way to ensure compliance with the principles in the Constitution. By nature, a pubic call for tenders is open, it assists in the prevention of fraud and favouritism, and it ensures that the maximum number of contractors is approached to compete for a contract. Organs of state can also compare prices and quality and can contract with whoever offers the best deal. Most legislation therefore proceeds on the basis that procurement takes place by way <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> Generally, contracts above R 200 000 are subject to public tender procedures. In certain instances, however, a public call for tenders may be inappropriate regardless of the high value of the contract. For this reason, exceptions are provided for in legislation. Since tendering, however, is generally the best way to ensure compliance with all the principles in the Constitution, it is important for there to be sufficient guidance on the non-use <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> procedures. Proper guidance will, to a large extent, ensure uniformity and transparency in government procurement procedures which will, in turn, assist in the combating of corruption. In this article, attention is given to the legislation that provides for exceptions to the use <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> at all three levels of government. Recommendations are then made as to how some of the legislative provisions should be interpreted in order to align them with the principles in the Constitution. In doing so, reference is made to a number of international instruments dealing with government procurement and specifically, the non-use <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> procedures...|$|R
50|$|R v Ron Engineering and Construction (Eastern) Ltd, of 1981 is {{the leading}} Supreme Court of Canada {{decision}} on the law <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> for contracts. The case concerned {{the issue of whether}} the acceptance of a call for tenders for a construction job could constitute a binding contract. The Court held that indeed in many cases the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> an offer in response to a call for tenders constitutes a contract separate from the eventual contract for the construction. With the release of the decision, the tendering process practiced in Canada was fundamentally changed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} {{process in}} the procurement <b>of</b> infrastructure is <b>tendering.</b> Tendering involves invitation to submit tender by clients or their representative, <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> required documents by contractors and selection of appropriate contractors to execute the project. This study examines important constituents <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> price submitted by a contractor and factors affecting their tender price in Nigeria {{with a view to}} improving their competitiveness and success rate locally and internationally. Using quantitative design approach, data were obtained through questionnaires administered on registered construction professionals and contracting firms with adequate practicing experience. Prior to the study, pilot study was carried out to ensure proper validity and reliability of the instrument. From the final survey, there is no significance difference in the significance, importance and level of contractors' awareness <b>of</b> constituents <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> price. This implies that contractors are conversant of important elements <b>of</b> their <b>tender</b> price but the major factors affecting this price are related to incorrect/incomplete design as well as buildability and technicality associated the project. These factors are more of project characteristics than that of stakeholders and external variables. In view of this, nature and size of projects should be considered as major factors in estimating <b>tender</b> figure <b>of</b> construction projects by contractors. More so, for the contractors to remain in construction business, {{there is a need for}} training, innovation and advancement in the use of new and modern technology...|$|R

This has involved reviewing work done in Australia and overseas as well as exploring the efforts within the construction industry to collect cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> information.

This paper explores the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> Throughout the worldwide construction industry tendering is acknowledged to be complicated, adding considerable cost to construction. Efforts to understand the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> are confounded by issues that are both visible and invisible to formal accounting of the construction process. This paper intends to demonstrate the problems and their causes. Anecdotes are derived from the literature, observations of construction purchases, and interview data to demonstrate the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> This is augmented by corresponding observations of other major purchases. Problems and causes are described in terms of these anecdotes. Because of the diverse activities undertaken by constructors and limitations of accounting categories, expenses associated with tendering are difficult to capture and quantify. These problems are explained through examples. Even in those cases where there are genuine intentions to capture costs <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> there is a failure to do so. It appears that implementation difficulties are so insurmountable that either people do not bother or management redirects effort from collecting cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> data. It is also shown that the expense <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> and uncertainty <b>of</b> outcomes leads tenderers to engage in concealed behaviour to reduce the uncertainty and cost associated with tendering. That is, collusion. For this reason especially, it is concluded that tendering and associated costs need to be understood in greater detail...|$|R
