Laboratory based research over {{the past fifty years}} has described the possible harm caused to central nervous system cells by normal saline, and has advocated the use of safer alternatives such as lactated Ringer’s solution and artificial cerebrospinal fluid. However, there is a dearth of corresponding clinical studies to <b>support</b> <b>this</b> <b>standpoint.</b> Worldwide, normal saline remains the most widely used neurosurgical irrigation fluid. We have attempted to document the preference of practicing neurosurgeons worldwide regarding the irrigation fluids via an electronic mail survey, and have analyzed the available evidence on the relative safety of various irrigation fluids. We recommend the use of lactated Ringer’s solution and artificial cerebrospinal fluid as neurosurgical irrigants, especially during neuroendoscopy and longer procedures requiring application of copious amount of irrigation fluid...|$|R
40|$|A limited {{inventory}} {{was taken}} among Dutch health-care practitioners {{on the use}} of lasers, including the type and extent of their applications. This inventory arose from the consideration on whether certain medical laser applications should be reserved for treatment according to the Act on Occupations in individual health care (BIG Act). Here, the focus was on applications used outside hospitals. On the basis of this inventory it can be concluded that practitioners, like physicians and dentists, who are registered according to the BIG Act, use class 2, 3 and 4 lasers. Practitioners from non-registered occupations in individual health care use lasers relatively less frequently. Since the use of class 4 lasers was not recorded in this inventory, the chance of harmful effects from the non-registered use will, in principle, be smaller and the effects less serious. The threshhold for using class 4 lasers is, however, being constantly lowered since lasers are becoming more versatile and less costly. In view of this development {{it would be wise to}} avoid incompetent use of the high-risk class 4 lasers (and possibly class 3 B). The observation that laser safety heterogeneously, both in intramural and extramural use, is regulated and that their use is not insensitive to serious consequences, was found to <b>support</b> <b>this</b> <b>standpoint.</b> The balanced <b>support</b> given to <b>this</b> <b>standpoint,</b> leading to a completely justifiable solution to the research problem will, nevertheless, require a more extensive inventory on the extramural use and applications of lasers...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{how the two}} {{concepts}} of representing and constituting are used in relation to design practice. The terms representing and representation are often {{used to describe the}} relation a model or prototype has to the end result. In this exploratory paper we investigate the potential impact of a change in terms, from represent to constitute. One inspiration is the writing of John Stewart on the post-semiotic approach to communication. The examples used in the paper are from practice rooted in both traditional industrial design and co-design. I argue {{that it is important to}} see design work as a constituting practice rather than a representative one. <b>Supporting</b> <b>this</b> <b>standpoint</b> are both the fact that the future does not yet exist and therefore is difficult to represent, and the strong argument that knowledge is created in dialogue and constituted in action. Thus, when we stop interpreting design matter as representations, design can matter to the world. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} of conversion is a semantic relation between lexemes (or between other typ es of language expressions) that is assessed- {{as far as}} its appurtenance to the system oflanguage is concemed - in various theories of language in a different way. Informally, these expressions are usually considered {{to be in the}} {{relation of}} conversion which "denote the same situation always from a different perspective", such as e. g. the verbs dát - dostat, prodat - koupit, půjčit- půjčit si, vyhrát- prohrát or the nouns vítězství- porážka. In this thesis, the relation of conversion is regarded as a type of a semantic relation that is inherent in the language system and therefore it {{should be included in the}} whole theoretical description of language. The author tries to <b>support</b> <b>this</b> <b>standpoint</b> that issues from a more or less intuitive observation of the properties of lexemes in the conversion relation and from their comparison with other lexemes by a consequent description of the nature of the semantic relation of conversion within the formally constructed theory of the Functional Generative Description of Language (FGD). This task is necessarily associated with specific modifications (extensions) of the terrninological framework of FGD because in the theory of FGD the field of lexical semantics has not yet been [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we discuss {{long-term}} digital preservation from an information perspective, rather than the predominant approaches; the Archival and the Technocratic Approach. Our standpoint is that information {{is at the core}} of long-term digital preservation. This means that information is the object of preservation in the long term. Information lives longer than people, organizations and tools (software). The Information Continuum Model provides <b>support</b> for <b>this</b> <b>standpoint.</b> However, we find that there exists no concept to support practical action in preservation from the information perspective. Existing concepts as information object, digital object, preservation object, electronic record, information package and significant properties are context dependent and focus on the object to be preserved, rather than preservation of information. Consequently, they are not suitable for realizing the information perspective in long-term digital preservation. The concept of Digital Information Preservation Object is therefore introduced and a tentative definition of the concept is presented...|$|R

40|$|Work-for-welfare style {{unemployment}} {{policies have}} been introduced {{in the majority of}} western countries as part of an overarching contractual regime, which demands various prescribed forms of reciprocation of citizens who require government income support. Communitarian scholar, Lawrence Mead, argues that such policies are ethically justified because they demand 'civic equality' of unemployed citizens. This paper contends that the coercive dimension of work-for-welfare has the potential to reinforce public perceptions that unemployed citizens are morally inferior, which itself reinforces the social stigma of being unemployed. Based on this interpretation, the concept of civic equality underpinning work-for-welfare is inconsistent with a belief in the dignity of the individual. One could argue that this belief is an important prerequisite for designing unemployment and employment policies that take seriously the notion of civic equality. To <b>support</b> <b>this</b> paper's argument, it will briefly discuss the philosophy and practice of a Queensland-based employment agency that begins from <b>this</b> <b>standpoint...</b>|$|R

40|$|Most recent {{developments}} {{in the study of}} social dilemmas give an increasing amount of attention to cognition, belief systems, valuations, and language.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show peculiarities of {{traditional}} and experiential marketing and describe why experiential marketing is better way to understand consumer behaviour. Comparative analysis shows the main characteristics of traditional and experiential marketing. Traditional marketing characteristics are there: product functional characteristics and superiority, narrow determinate product categories, point of view to the consumer as a rational thinker, application analytical, quantitative and verbal methods, mechanical standpoint to the consumer “Stimulus- Reaction”. Experiential marketing present these characteristics: orientation to the consumer experience, looking to the consumer experience holistically, point of view to the consumer as rational thinker and emotional too, exclectizm of methodical, “from Stimulus to Reaction”. As we can see out of traditional marketing characteristics <b>this</b> <b>standpoint</b> to the consumer is insufficient, because it evaluate just one side of consumer behaviour: rational conduct so looking the biggest benefit from purchase.
