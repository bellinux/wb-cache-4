5|$|Prior to 1900, the {{similarity}} in {{shape of the}} <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> Amphidromus to that of South American tree snails in the family Bulimulidae had misled taxonomists. However, the dissections made by Wiegmann and Jacobi clearly showed that the inner anatomical features of Amphidromus {{were the same as}} those of the Asian-Indonesian Camaenidae, and that the resemblance of the <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> Amphidromus to that of bulimulids was merely an example of parallelism.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{affinity}} generally increases {{across a}} period. This {{is caused by}} the filling of the valence <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore more stable.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, a toffee apple is a {{traditional}} confection made by coating an apple in hot toffee and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are candy apples (coated in a hard <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> crystallized sugar syrup), and caramel apples, coated with cooled caramel.|$|E

50|$|A callus {{exists in}} the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> various species of {{gastropods}} (snails) {{and also in the}} <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> several species of Nautilus, a cephalopod.A callum is an anatomical feature of some mature bivalve <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> species in the family Pholadidae, the piddocks. The callum is an area <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> material that fills the gap between the two valves.|$|R
50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} can {{be observed}} in the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> this species: the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> the males tend to be more elongate with a smoother outer surface, whereas the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> the females are generally wider and more nodulose. The angle of the spire also differs between males and females.|$|R
5|$|The <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} shell is usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height of the shell is 4–6.5mm, or up to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of the <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> brackish water populations is 9.3mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of the shell is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E
5|$|The {{shells of}} Amphidromus are {{relatively}} large, {{from one to}} three inches high, and colorful. Amphidromus has an elongate-conic or ovate-conic helicoid <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> 5 to 8 whorls. The shell may be thin and fragile, or very heavy and solid, with no known correlation of shell structure with distribution or habitats.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, {{it became apparent that}} each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a quantum <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> electrons. Larger atoms have more electron sub-shells, so later tables have required progressively longer periods.|$|E
5000|$|As well as {{sea snail}} shells, shell jewelry also {{sometimes}} uses the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> clams (bivalves) and tusk shells (scaphopods). Occasionally shell jewelry {{is made from}} the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> non-marine mollusks such as the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> land snails http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1627/2907.full, or the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> freshwater mollusks. Not all shell jewelry is made from whole shells; some kinds are made from parts <b>of</b> <b>shells,</b> including the shell layer known as mother of pearl or nacre, and the [...] "trapdoor" [...] or operculum {{which is part of}} some sea snails.|$|R

50|$|Lirae (singular lira) {{are fine}} lines or ridges (much finer than ribs) {{that are a}} sculptural feature of the outside <b>of</b> the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> various animals. The term is {{commonly}} applied to the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> molluscs such as gastropods, bivalves and nautiloids. It {{can also be used}} to describe similar sculpture on the surface <b>of</b> the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> brachiopods.|$|R
5|$|After {{the star}} has fused the helium of its core, the carbon product fuses {{producing}} a hot core with an outer <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> fusing helium. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) that parallels the other described red giant phase, {{but with a}} higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo {{a brief period of}} carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate.|$|E
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the hotel}} was {{occupied}} by Japanese troops, and the Japanese flag was flown above the walls for {{the entirety of the}} war.

The <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> the building survived the blaze and the structure was later reconstructed.|$|E
5000|$|Juvenile cowry shells {{are not at}} all {{similar to}} adult cowry shells. The {{juvenile}} <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> cowries perhaps more closely resemble the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> some [...] "bubble snails" [...] in the order Cephalaspidea. Also the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> juvenile cowries seldom exhibit the same color patterns as the adult shells do, and thus can be hard to identify to species.|$|R
50|$|Beds of Ostrea and Corbicula shells {{are common}} in the basal, {{brackish}} water portion of the formation. The overlying freshwater beds include <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> freshwater and terrestrial molluscs. <b>Shells</b> <b>of</b> Unionidae {{are common in}} the fluvial sandstones.|$|R
50|$|The genera Provanna and Desbruyeresia have {{smaller and}} slender shells, while the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> Alviniconcha and Ifremeria are larger and swollen. The <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> these two last genera house a hypertrophied ctenidium large {{quantities}} of symbiotic bacteria.|$|R
5|$|In {{shells of}} most of the species in the {{subgenus}} Amphidromus, resting stages are marked by the deposition of a brown or black radial band called a varix. This appears to be rare in the subgenus Syndromus, although the <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> A. laevus does show evidence of interruption of the spiral banding after a resting phase.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993–94 season, the Bulls, without Jordan, {{achieved}} a 55–27 record, {{and lost to}} the New York Knicks {{in the second round}} of the playoffs. But the 1994–95 Bulls were a <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one point in mid-March. The team received help, however, when Jordan decided to return to the NBA for the Bulls.|$|E
5|$|Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{has a small}} (an {{average of}} 20.9mm in length in adult individuals), delicate, ovate <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> 3¼ whorls, with deep sutures. The shell is almost translucent, and varies in color from a chalky pale yellow to white, with a glossy surface. Several {{internal}} organs of the animal can be distinguished through the shell's outer surface. The visible soft parts of the animal are of a pale subtranslucent yellow color, with different markings during distinct stages of development.|$|E

5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, as well {{as traditional}} Chinese medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people {{with high blood pressure}} are traditionally advised not to consume durian.|$|E
5|$|The Zytglogge's {{internal}} layout {{has changed}} over time to reflect the tower's change of purpose from guard tower to city prison to clock tower. The thirteenth-century guard tower was {{not much more than}} a hollow <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> walls that was open towards the city in the east. Only in the fourteenth century was a layer of four storeys inserted.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} elements are often {{displayed in a}} periodic table that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with {{the same number of}} valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the noble gases.|$|E
50|$|The <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> Nannamoria {{have a small}} blunt protoconch, {{their overall}} shape varies but most species have a {{shoulder}} with nodules or spines. The base colour <b>of</b> the <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> Nannamoria is white, and they are overlaid with brown axial lines.|$|R

5|$|The first {{published}} {{depictions of the}} <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> this species appeared in 1681 in the earliest book solely about sea shells, Recreatio mentis et oculi in observatione animalium testaceorum (Refreshment {{of the mind and}} the eye in the observation of shell-bearing animals) by Italian scholar Filippo Buonanni. The species was shown in the 1742 Index Testarum Conchyliorum, quae adservantur in Museo Nicolai Gualtieri (List of the shells of shellfish which are preserved in the museum of Niccolò Gualtieri) by Italian physician and malacologist Niccolò Gualtieri. In both books, the morphology of an adult shell was shown from different perspectives.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} name Octopoda was first coined and given as {{the order of}} octopuses in 1818 by English biologist William Elford Leach, who classified them as Octopoida the previous year. The Octopoda consists of 300 known species and {{can be divided into}} two suborders, the Incirrina and the Cirrina. The incirrate octopuses (the majority of species) lack the cirri and paired swimming fins of the cirrates. In addition, the internal <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> incirrates is either present as a pair of stylets or absent altogether.|$|E
5|$|The <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is ovate, slender, acute, and of {{moderate}} thickness. The shell suture is deep. The spire is gently convex, laterally compressed, with 3¼ whorls. The spire is long, {{slightly less than}} half the shell length, and the aperture is very oblique. The shell color is subtranslucent, calcareous pale yellow to white. The surface is somewhat glossy and marked with growth wrinkles and lines. The size varies somewhat, but adult specimens of the type lot averaged 20.9millimeters (mm) in shell length. Various adult specimens measured during the summer of 1981 and 1982 ranged from 19 to 24mm.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> {{the different}} species of Limacidae are not recognizable to the species level. Therefore, the fossil distribution of Limax maximus (and other Limacidae species) is unknown. Unidentified calcitic <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> Limacidae are known from European Tertiary and Quaternary deposits.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{quite similar to}} Hexaplex nigritus. The <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> these two species mainly differ in the length, width and in the {{proportion}} of blackish-brown versus white. Moreover <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> H. radix are less oblong and show less spines in black.|$|R
50|$|These, and {{a series}} of climaxing events such as the Russian <b>shelling</b> <b>of</b> Mashad's Goharshad Mosque in 1911, and the <b>shelling</b> <b>of</b> the Persian National Assembly by the Russian Colonel V.
