40|$|Background: Migration {{has long}} been {{understood}} as an underlying factor for HIV transmission, and sexual partner concurrency has been increasingly studied as {{an important component of}} HIV transmission dynamics. However, less work has examined the role of <b>short-term</b> <b>mobility</b> in sexual partner concurrency using a network approach. <b>Short-term</b> <b>mobility</b> may be a risk for HIV for the migrant’s partner as well either through the partner’s risk behaviors while the migrant is away, such as the partner having additional partners, or via exposure to the return migrant. Methods: Using data from the 2010 – 11 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey, weighted generalized linear regression models were used to investigate the associations between <b>short-term</b> <b>mobility</b> and partnership concurrency at the individual and partnership levels. Results: At the individual level, we find strong evidence of an association between <b>short-term</b> <b>mobility</b> and concurrency.

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} on human mobility ranges and their regional impacts. We first introduce an interpretative framework that situates place populations within {{a continuum of}} transiences and intensities: according to this, short- and long-term mobilities, generally associated with a binary of work-related migration and tourism, can be revisioned as a spectrum of fluid situations by which the permanence of people into places results from an articulated range of factors of attraction or place characteristics, and dynamically modifies this context. Indeed we postulate that different attraction factors attract different flows that could be characterised in this way as "regional audiences"; {{the fact that the}} same factors could be attractive to different audiences means that regions have to "tune" to an accommodate different users and uses, and as foreseen by Martinotti (1992) in his "four populations" urbanisation model, the success in doing that is a fundamental aspect of sustainable development We then use results from the ESPON 2013 Program (ATTREG project) to classify regions according to the populations {{that they were able to}} attract in the 2001 - 2008 period, and reflect upon the complex process of embedding different "audiences" into places in terms of attraction strategies and issues of resiliency. Our findings challenge the conventional wisdom that migrants are attracted by economic buoyancy and tight labour markets for highly skilled workers, and cast an interesting light about the synergetic effects of different population groups. We show for instance that "tourist regions", or regions that are particularly endowed for (and have been able to) attracting <b>short-term</b> <b>mobilities,</b> have had a good score in attracting longer-term forms of mobility, but only until economic conditions were favourable and some upper threshold have been reached; whereas regions with lower attractiveness scores have been better able to face the direct effects of the global crisis...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—HIV {{is spread}} through {{structured}} sexual networks, which {{are influenced by}} migration patterns, but network-oriented studies of mobility and HIV risk behavior have been limited. OBJECTIVE—We present a comprehensive description and initial results from our Migration & HIV in Ghana (MHG) study in Agbogbloshie, an urban slum area within Accra, Ghana. METHODS—The MHG study was a population-based cross-sectional study of adults aged 18 – 49 in Agbogbloshie in 2012. We used a one-year retrospective relationship history calendar to collect egocentric network data on sexual partners as well as migration and <b>short-term</b> <b>mobility,</b> and tested for prevalent HIV- 1 / 2 infection. RESULTS—HIV prevalence was 5. 5 %, with prevalence among women (7. 2 %) over twice that of men (2. 8 %). Three-quarters of residents were born outside the Greater Accra region, but had lived in Agbogbloshie an average of 10. 7 years. Only 7 % had moved housing structures within the past year. However, <b>short-term</b> <b>mobility</b> was common. Residents {{had an average of}} 7. 3 overnight trips in the last year, with women reporting more travel than men. Thirty-seven percent of men and 9 % of women reported more than one sexual partner in the last year. CONCLUSIONS—Population-based surveys of migration and sexual risk behavior using relationship history calendars in low-resource settings can produce high quality data. Residents in Agbogbloshie are disproportionately affected by HIV, and have high levels of <b>short-term</b> <b>mobility.</b> HIV prevention interventions targeted to highly mobile populations in high prevalence settings may have far-reaching and long-term implications...|$|E

40|$|In {{eastern and}} {{southern}} Africa, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic appeared first in urban centres and then spread to rural areas. Its overall prevalence is lower in West Africa, with the highest levels still found in cities. Rural areas are also threatened, however, because of the population's high mobility. We conducted a study in three different communities with contrasting infection levels to understand the epidemiology of HIV infection in rural West Africa. A comparative cross-sectional study using a standardized questionnaire and biological tests was conducted among samples in two rural communities of Senegal (Niakhar and Bandafassi, 866 and 952 adults, respectively) and a rural community of Guinea-Bissau (Caio, 1416 adults). We compared the distribution of population characteristics and analysed risk factors for HIV infection in Caio at the individual level. The level of HIV infection was very low in Niakhar (0. 3 %) and Bandafassi (0. 0 %), but 10. 5 % of the adults in Caio were infected, mostly with HIV type 2 (HIV- 2). Mobility was very prevalent in all sites. <b>Short-term</b> <b>mobility</b> {{was found to be}} a risk factor for HIV infection among men in Caio (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2. 06; 95 % CI: 1. 06 - 3. 99).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold: it {{analyses}} how far the external opening-up process of the Spanish economy that started with its integration into the EEC in 1986 has led to a higher effective degree of capital mobility; and it examines what kind of capital flows, exchange-rate pressures and monetary policy effects can be expected once capital controls are eliminated by 1993. The results suggest that, in spite of the extensive network of legal capital controls prevailing in Spain, the effective degree of <b>short-term</b> capital <b>mobility</b> [...] measured by covered interest-parity deviations [...] has in fact been lower since Spain's entry into the EEC than before. It is the case, moreover, that although capital outflows are more restricted legally than inflows, controls are at present binding for short-run capital inflows but not for outflows. Finally, it is also found that the disappearance of capital controls by 1992 will make it impossible to pursue money and exchange rate targets simultaneously. It will thus be necessary for the Spanish macroeconomic policy-mix to be altered in the direction of reducing interest rate and inflation differentials vis-a-vis other EMS countries.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show that open economies that (i) have (<b>short-term)</b> capital <b>mobility</b> and (ii) a low degree of organization in financial markets may have bubbles in asset prices if there is an exogenous shock to these economies that produces a real exchange rate appreciation. In order to do that, we will present a post keynesian macroeconomic model for small open economies based in Taylor (1983) and Taylor and O ´ Connell (1985). Our model differs from models developed by these authors in several aspects. First of all, we will consider a broad list of assets (9 assets). Second, we will consider the fulfillment of Marshall-Lerner condition, so that a real exchange appreciation will produce a reduction in net exports. Third, we will suppose, contrary to Taylor and O´Connell, that profits are expected to increase if current rate of interest is bigger than normal or safe rate of interest. Finally, we will suppose that there is imperfect capital mobility – in the sense of Mundell and Fleming – so that interest rate diferencial is a major factor determining capital inflows to emerging countries.

Remittances are the fastest growing of these three capital sources and now total NZ$ 600 million per year from all sources. Remittances can be expected to grow even further as <b>short-term</b> labour <b>mobility</b> is used as a mechanism to deal with seasonal labour shortages in New Zealand and limited job opportunities in the Pacific. However the transactions costs of sending remittances to the Pacific Islands are very high for the most widely used methods. This paper examines the New Zealand – Tonga remittance corridor, where typical transactions involve transfers of about NZ$ 200, with costs in the order of 15 - 20 percent for bank drafts and money transfer companies like Western Union. Cheaper transfer methods using Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) are feasible and have transactions costs of less than five percent but are not widely used. This ten percentage point spread between the most popular and the cheapest remittance methods means a potential loss for Tonga equivalent to four percent of GDP.

30|$|Only one {{complete}} {{evaluation of}} the Mobility Partnership {{has so far been}} conducted. Initiated by the IOM, the European Commission and the government of Moldova, the 2012 {{evaluation of the}} Moldovan Mobility Partnership revealed some of its lacunae as perceived by the stakeholders. The facilitation of legal migration and the international protection pillars of the Mobility Partnership received insufficient attention according to those surveyed. Moldovans admitted being disappointed by the limited mobility opportunities offered to their nationals. Just by its title, the “Mobility” Partnership holds the premise of offering greater mobility perspectives to the nationals of the participating third countries. Even though the concept of circular migration appears as a top priority from the partner countries in all of the Mobility Partnerships, the member states have been reticent, to say the least, to propose such schemes. Taking {{a closer look at the}} projects implemented in both the Moldovan and the Georgian Mobility Partnerships, one can notice the broad and vague meaning of the “facilitation of legal migration and mobility” category under which they fall. Most of their objectives are focused towards the return of migrants and their social and economic reintegration, the reinforcement of the national employment services capacities and the diffusion of information on the possibilities to legally migrate to the EU and of the risks of irregular migration. It appears from the evaluation that Moldovans did not share the same understanding of “mobility” than their European counterparts. In the context of the Mobility Partnership, even though circular migration schemes were initially identified as one of the benefits from this cooperation, only the <b>short-term</b> <b>mobility</b> of selected categories of individuals (students, tourists, researchers and business people) has been included in the framework, notably through the visa facilitation agreement linked to the conclusion of the community-wide readmission agreement.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in integrated {{land use and}} transport modeling have included a shift from aggregate-level modeling to disaggregate, household-level modeling. One potential advantage of this shift is that interdependencies of changes that influence household decisions can be more systematically modeled. However, existing models have not embraced this opportunity fully. Especially {{in the context of}} long-term mobility decisions (relocation/car ownership), decisions {{made on the basis of}} various dimensions are modeled as independent and cross sectional, whereas in reality they are strongly interlinked. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that offers a more general approach to modeling the dynamics and interdependences across different time horizons of a household’s lifecycle and mobility decisions. The framework incorporates the concept of stress, defined as a discrepancy between a household’s present situation and its aspiration level, which in turn depends, among other things, on the household’s social network. Bayesian belief networks are used to represent the complex direct and indirect dependencies between life-cycle events and long- and <b>short-term</b> <b>mobility</b> decisions...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Recently, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} dual mobility systems in the treatment of hip instability. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the re-revision rate of dual mobility cup compared to different surgical concepts when used for first-time hip revisions due to recurrent dislocations. Methods: The data were derived from the Lithuanian Arthroplasty Register. For survival analysis, we used both re-revision for all reasons and for dislocations as an end-point. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the influence of various covariates (age, gender, and implant concept). Results: A total of 1388 revisions were recorded from 2011 to 2015, of which 362 were performed due to recurrent dislocation. Of the revisions, 247 were performed using dual mobility cups, while 115 were performed using a variety of other surgical constructs including constrained acetabular cups, conventional cups, femoral head exchanges, stem exchanges or anti-luxation rings. There were 27 re-revisions of which 15 were for additional dislocations. There were only 2 % re-revisions due to dislocation with dual mobility vs 9 % when using other surgical constructs. Cox regression adjusting for age and gender showed that in the <b>short-term,</b> dual <b>mobility</b> cup had a lower risk of revision due to dislocation as well as for all reasons compared to the other surgical constructs. Conclusion: In revision of total hip arthroplasties for dislocation, significantly lower short-term re-revision rate was observed for patients revised with dual mobility cup...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a report on a week-long {{international}} student program for UEC’s partner university, Harbin Engineering University (China), carried out by Center for International Programs and Exchange (CIPE), UEC, in August 2014. Financially supported by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) under SAKURA Exchange Program in Science, CIPE successfully implemented this short-term program. In an increasingly globalized world, international student mobility is an essential topic in the world’s higher education. Under the trend, “The 300, 000 International Students Plan” was proposed by the Prime Minister in 2008 in Japan. In order to foster global student <b>mobility,</b> <b>short-term</b> exchange programs will further {{play an important role}} since they can provide opportunities for more students compared to traditional longer programs (semester or year-long), with the relatively lower cost, less influence of the academic calendar of the home institution, and so on. However, we face some issues to overcome to continue and develop short-term programs...|$|R
40|$|Climate and {{environmental}} change {{has become one}} of the great challenges at the end of the 20 th century and it is expected that it also keeps science, policy makers and the general population concerned for the decades, if not centuries to come. Especially in developing countries where exposure to the impacts of climate change is serious and where resilience and the capacities to adapt to a changing climate is small risks and threats to experience unwanted, extreme negative consequences seem to be greatest. Not only in the scientific community it is widely assumed that in extreme cases entire states like Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and the Maldives will become inhabitable. People living in these states need to resettle to other countries. For the Pacific Islands alone Campbell (2009) estimates that by 2050 a population between 665, 000 and 1, 725, 000 will be displaced as a result of climate change. Some 320, 000 of them live on atolls and require international resettlement, while in many of the other cases resettlement within the same country might be an option. The book chapter looks from an historical perspective on major movements of people that have taken place in regions of the Pacific Islands due to either sudden-onset events (e. g. earthquakes, tsunamis, or volcano eruptions) or slow-on set movements (e. g. sea level rise, desertification, droughts) or other events. It gives ideas of the challenges that come along when bigger numbers of people migrate or get resettled. Finally the paper looks at different programs and activities promoting <b>short-term,</b> temporary <b>mobility</b> and permanent migration as an adaptation strategy to environmental changes in developing countries, with a particular focus on the Pacific region. ...|$|R
