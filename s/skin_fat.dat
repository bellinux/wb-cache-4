5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dwarf Fortress is anatomically detailed. Combat is {{displayed}} by viewing the log which describes each weapon striking a specific {{part of the}} character's body. Internal organs can get punctured, combatants can fall to the ground, vomit and lose body parts. Each dwarf has individually detailed limbs, each with damageable bone, fat, muscle and <b>skin.</b> <b>Fat</b> can be bruised without breaking bones and vice versa. Injuries sometimes can be permanent. There is a medical system where a hospital {{can be set up}} containing crutches for disabled dwarves, traction benches, plasters and cloth for casts and bandages, thread for suturing, and splints.|$|E

25|$|Surgical post-mastectomy breast {{reconstruction}} requires general anaesthesia, {{cuts the}} chest muscles, produces new scars, and requires a long post-surgical recovery for the patient. The surgical emplacement of breast implant devices (saline or silicone) introduces a foreign {{object to the}} patient's body (see capsular contracture). The TRAM flap (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap) procedure reconstructs the breast using an autologous flap of abdominal, cutaneous, and muscle tissues. The latissimus myocutaneous flap employs <b>skin</b> <b>fat</b> and muscle harvested from the back, and a breast implant. The DIEP flap (Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforators) procedure uses an autologous flap of abdominal skin and fat tissue.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{strains of}} Pekin ducklings {{were used to}} compare a breast <b>skin</b> and <b>fat</b> {{measurement}} with the percentage fat in the whole carcass. All of the ducklings were fed the same diets {{and raised in the}} same controlled environ-ment. The ducklings were commercially processed at 45 d of age and chilled. Two breast skin measurements were then made. A caliper was used to measure the pinched breast <b>skin</b> and <b>fat</b> thickness on the whole carcass. The breast <b>skin</b> with adhering <b>fat</b> was then removed and weighed. The weight of the breast <b>skin</b> with <b>fat</b> was calculated as a percentage of ready-to-cook carcass (with neck). The carcasses were then frozen and shipped to the university for analysis of whole carcass fat. The bone-in carcasses were thawed, ground, and individually mixed to create homogeneous samples. The whole carcass fat was then determined using ether extraction. Correlation of percentage breast <b>skin</b> and <b>fat</b> to percentage whole carcass fat {{for each of the three}} strains ranged from. 58 to. 76. When all the strains were combined, the correlation was. 90. All of the correlations were significant to at least the. 01 level.

25|$|Liposuction, {{also known}} as lipoplasty, is a {{cosmetic}} surgical procedure that slims and reshapes specific areas of the body by removing excess fat deposits, improving the body's contours and proportion, and ultimately, enhancing the patient's self-image. Liposuction {{involves the use of}} a small stainless steel tube, called a cannula. The cannula is connected to a powerful suction pump and inserted into the fat through small incisions in the <b>skin.</b> <b>Fat</b> removal is accomplished as the suction cannula creates tiny tunnels through the fatty layers. Liposuction can be performed on both men and women. Ideal for this type of procedure are non-smokers, healthy individuals who do not have a life-threatening illness or medical conditions that can impair healing, adults within 30% of their ideal weight who have firm and elastic skin.|$|E
25|$|Beluga whale {{or white}} whale Delphinapterus leucas (cetuaq, assigarnaq, qecip'atuli in Yup'ik cituaq in Cup'ik, cetuar in Cup'ig) {{is used for}} human and dog food. Beluga {{harvested}} in spring are used primarily for human food, although some are used for dog food. Beluga harvests in the fall usually are lower than in spring. The late fall beluga hunts were used to produce food for the dogs. Parts of the beluga used for human food include the <b>skin,</b> <b>fat,</b> backstrap, and intestines. Backstrap meat is sometimes dried, and beluga skin is sometimes pickled. Beluga products are prepared a number of ways, such as boiling skin and meat (eaten hot or cold); flouring and frying or barbecuing backstraps; and processing fat into oil for use with dried fish and meat. Ways of preserving and using beluga products show local differences between communities and families.|$|E
25|$|Blood flow to {{skin and}} fat are {{affected}} by skin and core temperature, and resting muscle perfusion {{is controlled by the}} temperature of the muscle itself. During exercise increased flow to the working muscles is often balanced by reduced flow to other tissues, such as kidneys spleen and liver. Blood flow to the muscles is also lower in cold water, but exercise keeps the muscle warm and flow elevated even when the skin is chilled. Blood flow to fat normally increases during exercise, but this is inhibited by immersion in cold water. Adaptation to cold reduces the extreme vasoconstriction which usually occurs with cold water immersion. Variations in perfusion distribution do not necessarily affect respiratory inert gas exchange, though some gas may be locally trapped by changes in perfusion. Rest in a cold environment will reduce inert gas exchange from <b>skin,</b> <b>fat</b> and muscle, whereas exercise will increase gas exchange. Exercise during decompression can reduce decompression time and risk, providing bubbles are not present, but can increase risk if bubbles are present. Inert gas exchange is least favourable for the diver who is warm and exercises at depth during the ingassing phase, and rests and is cold during decompression.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Chicken skin is not {{removed from}} the whole carcass before cooking in Iran and people prefer chicken with higher weight. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to distinguish the mean percentage of chicken <b>skin</b> and visible <b>fat</b> to chicken carcass weight. The ratio of chicken <b>skin</b> and visible <b>fat</b> to total chicken carcass weight in 10 weight groups were studied. These groups had approximate weight of 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 g. Samples were randomly collected 10 times, each time 20 chickens from Kordan slaughterhouse product from each weight were selected. The <b>skin</b> and visible <b>fat</b> were {{removed from the}} carcass and weighted. The mean percentage of <b>skin</b> and visible <b>fat</b> ratio to total chicken carcass weight were calculated in these 10 chicken weight groups separately. The mean percentage of poultry <b>skin</b> and visible <b>fat</b> ratio to total chicken carcass weight in these 10 weight groups were 11. 7 ± 1. 5, 12. 3 ± 1. 8, 12. 8 ± 1. 9, 13. 2 ± 1. 2, 14. 1 ± 1. 3, 14. 3 ± 1. 9, 14. 1 ± 1. 5, 14. 7 ± 2. 1, 14. 9 ± 1. 9, 15. 2 ± 2. 1 respectively. The minimum percentage was 8 % and the maximum was 20 % in total samples. Chicken carcass was conditioned in plastic bags without removing the <b>skin</b> and visible <b>fat</b> by the slaughterhouse. <b>Skin</b> and visible <b>fat</b> comprise 8 - 20 % of chicken carcass weight, chicken with higher weight have higher percentage of <b>skin</b> and visible <b>fat.</b> Hence, chicken carcass with lower weight should be purchased and <b>skin</b> and visible <b>fat</b> has to be removed before cooking...|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, Price's Candles, based in London {{was the largest}} candle {{manufacturer}} in the world.

Later he tried palm oil from palm trees. An accidental discovery swept all his ambitions aside when his son George Wilson, a talented chemist, distilled the first petroleum oil in 1854.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of TEE over TTE is usually clearer images, especially of structures {{that are difficult}} to view transthoracically (through the chest wall). The explanation for this is that the heart rests directly upon the esophagus leaving only millimeters that the ultrasound beam has to travel. This reduces the attenuation (weakening) of the ultrasound signal, generating a stronger return signal, ultimately enhancing image and Doppler quality. Comparatively, transthoracic ultrasound must first traverse <b>skin,</b> <b>fat,</b> ribs and lungs before reflecting off the heart and back to the probe before an image can be created. All these structures, along with the increased distance the beam must travel, weaken the ultrasound signal thus degrading the image and Doppler quality.|$|E
