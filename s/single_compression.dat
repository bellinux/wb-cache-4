40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} safety of using <b>single</b> {{complete}} <b>compression</b> ultrasonography in pregnant and postpartum women to rule out deep vein thrombosis. DESIGN: Prospective outcome study. SETTING: Two tertiary care centres and 18 private practices specialising in vascular medicine in France and Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: 226 pregnant and postpartum women referred for suspected deep vein thrombosis. METHODS: A single proximal and distal compression ultrasonography was performed. All women with a negative complete compression ultrasonography result did not receive anticoagulant therapy and were followed up for a three month period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms of venous thromboembolism, second compression ultrasonography or chest imaging, a thromboembolic event, and anticoagulant treatment. RESULTS: 16 women were excluded, mainly because of associated suspected pulmonary embolism. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 22 out of the 210 included women (10. 5 %). 10 patients received full dose anticoagulation despite a negative test result during follow-up. Of the 177 patients without deep vein thrombosis and who did not receive full dose anticoagulant therapy, two (1. 1 %, 95 % confidence interval 0. 3 % to 4. 0 %) had an objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of venous thromboembolic events after <b>single</b> complete <b>compression</b> ultrasonography in pregnant and postpartum women seems to be {{within the range of}} that observed in studies in the non-pregnant population. These data suggest that a negative <b>single</b> complete <b>compression</b> ultrasonography result may safely exclude the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in this setting.

50|$|The GA16DE is a 1.6 litre (1597 cc) engine {{produced}} from November 1990 through 1999. All GA16DEs have sixteen valves and a DOHC head. There are three versions: the North-American first-generation (1991-94) NVCS (VTC), which produces 110 hp (80 kW) at 6000 rpm and 110 lb·ft (146 Nm) at 4000 rpm, the North-American second-generation (1995-1999) NVCS (VTC), which produces 115 hp (85 kW) at 6000 rpm and 110 lb·ft (146 Nm) at 4000 rpm, and a non-NVCS version (European-spec) which makes 102 hp (76 kW). The two variants of the North American NVCS engine are distinguished as such: {{in addition to}} differences in the intake manifolds and (resultantly) the heads, earlier motors used pistons with two compression rings and a single oil ring and put out five less horsepower, while later GA16DEs have a <b>single</b> <b>compression</b> ring and a single oil ring. The GA16DE shares its block and crankshaft with its predecessor, the GA16i; however, their timing chain covers, connecting rods and pistons are altogether different. It is possible to interchange connecting-rod/piston assemblies between the GA16i and GA16DE with no danger to the valve train. Some engines have siamesed exhaust manifolds, while others keep the exhausts separated until the catalytic converter. Earlier ECUs contained the fuel & ignition maps on a discrete ROM IC, making retuning relatively easy, later ECUs buried the maps on a larger more integrated microcontroller's firmware, making retuning {{require the use of}} a daughterboard.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to model unsteady fluid dynamics in a compressor network {{by using a}} bond graph is presented. The model is intended in particular for compressor control system development. First, we develop a bond graph model of a <b>single</b> <b>compression</b> system. Bond graph modeling offers a different perspective to previous work by modeling the compression system based on energy flow instead of fluid dynamics. Analyzing the bond graph model explains the energy flow during compressor surge. Two principal solutions for compressor surge problem are identified: upstream energy injection and downstream energy dissipation. Both principal solutions are verified in bond graph modelings of <b>single</b> <b>compression</b> system equipped with a surge avoidance system (SAS) and <b>single</b> <b>compression</b> system equipped with an active control system. Moreover, the bond graph model of single compressor equipped with SAS is able to show the effect of recycling flow to the compressor upstream states which improves the current available model. The bond graph model of a <b>single</b> <b>compression</b> system is then used as the base model and combined to build compressor network models. Two compressor networks are modeled: serial compressors and parallel compressors. Simulation results show the surge conditions in both compressor networks. © SAGE.
