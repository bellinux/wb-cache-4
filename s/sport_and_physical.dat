5|$|The Paris region hosts France's highest {{concentration}} of the grandes écoles – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered grands établissements. Most of the grandes écoles were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses {{much larger than the}} old campuses within the crowded city of Paris, though the École Normale Supérieure has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement. There are a high number of engineering schools, led by the Paris Institute of Technology which comprises several colleges such as École Polytechnique, École des Mines, AgroParisTech, Télécom Paris, Arts et Métiers, and École des Ponts et Chaussées. There are also many business schools, including HEC, INSEAD, ESSEC, and ESCP Europe. The administrative school such as ENA has been relocated to Strasbourg, the political science school Sciences-Po is still located in Paris's 7th arrondissement and the most prestigious university of economics and finance, Paris-Dauphine, is located in Paris's 16th. The Parisian school of journalism CELSA department of the Paris-Sorbonne University is located in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Paris is also home to several of France's most famous high-schools such as Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Lycée Henri-IV, Lycée Janson de Sailly and Lycée Condorcet. The National Institute of <b>Sport</b> <b>and</b> <b>Physical</b> Education, located in the 12th arrondissement, is both a physical education institute and high-level training centre for elite athletes.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{the current status}} of the nationwide implementation process of a <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity stimulation programme to gain insight into how <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity were integrated into Dutch rehabilitation care. METHODS: The current implementation status of a <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity stimulation programme in 12 rehabilitation centres and 5 hospitals with a rehabilitation department was described by scoring fidelity and satisfaction. Seventy-one rehabilitation professionals filled out a questionnaire on how <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity, including stimulation activities, were implemented into rehabilitation care. Total fidelity scores (in %) were calculated for each organization. Professionals' satisfaction was rated on a scale from 1 to 10. RESULTS: In most organizations <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity were to some extent integrated during and after rehabilitation (fidelity scores: median[*]=[*] 54 %, IQR[*]=[*] 23 %). Physical activity stimulation was not always embedded as standard component of a rehabilitation treatment. Professionals' satisfaction rated a median value of 8. 0 (IQR[*]=[*] 0. 0) indicating high satisfaction rates. CONCLUSIONS: The fidelity outcome showed that activities to stimulate <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity during <b>and</b> after rehabilitation were integrated into rehabilitation care, but not always delivered as standardized component. These findings have emphasized the importance to focus on integrating these activities into routines of organizations. Implications for Rehabilitation Components of an evidence-based programme to stimulate <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity during <b>and</b> after rehabilitation can be used to measure {{the current status of}} the integration of <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity in rehabilitation care in a structural and effective way. The method described in the current study can be used to compare the content of the rehabilitation care regarding the integration of <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity among organizations both on a national <b>and</b> international level. <b>Sports</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity are seen as important ingredients for successful rehabilitation care in The Netherlands...|$|R

25|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Manchester Institute of <b>Sport</b> <b>and</b> <b>Physical</b> Activity (MISPA) at the Manchester Metropolitan University and the Youth Sports Trust, Wright Robinson has taken part in a ten-year research project. The project was designed to support the school's strategic aim of raising academic standards and increasing whole school participation in Physical Education and Sport. In ten years over 10,000 children and 1,000,000 hours of PE have been assessed. The evidence shows that participation in physical activity enables young people to significantly improve their physical competence, confidence and self-esteem. More active pupils were also found to generally achieve higher academic attainment with 62% of physically active pupils achieving five or more A*-C GCSE grades including mathematics and English compared to 38% of the least active pupils.|$|E
