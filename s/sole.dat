Porter Gage, a veteran raider, contacts the <b>Sole</b> Survivor after boarding a monorail and tells {{them that they}} are walking into a death trap. Upon arrival, the <b>Sole</b> Survivor must navigate an increasingly-deadly obstacle course called the Gauntlet, which culminates in a fight with the raider leader, Overboss Colter. Gage reveals that the fight is rigged as Colter is wearing invulnerable electrically-charged armor, and that no-one survives the Gauntlet.

Once the entire park is under raider control, the <b>Sole</b> Survivor sets about expanding raider influence in the Commonwealth by conquering settlements, restoring power to Nuka-World to make the park self-sufficient, and thwarting attempts by the Gunnersa band of amoral mercenariesto seize control of Nuka-World for themselves.|$|E
