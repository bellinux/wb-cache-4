2500|$|A futures {{exchange}} or futures {{market is a}} central financial exchange where people can trade standardized futures contracts; that is, a contract to buy <b>specific</b> <b>quantities</b> of a commodity or financial instrument at a specified price with delivery set at a specified time in the future. These types of contracts fall {{into the category of}} derivatives. The opposite of the futures market is the spots market, where trades will occur immediately (2 business days) after a transaction agreement has been made, rather than at a predetermined time in the future.|$|E

50|$|In {{food safety}} {{regulations}} in the EU it is a catch-all restriction for artificial food ingredients (especially food additives) which are harmless {{enough to have}} no <b>specific</b> <b>quantity</b> restriction.|$|R
50|$|In a {{physical}} setting a measurement instrument may be gauged to measuring substances of a <b>specific</b> physical <b>quantity.</b> In such a context the <b>specific</b> physical <b>quantity</b> {{is called a}} measured quantity.|$|R
50|$|The limit {{cycle is}} orbitally stable if a <b>specific</b> <b>quantity</b> called the first Lyapunov {{coefficient}} is negative, and the bifurcation is supercritical. Otherwise it is unstable and the bifurcation is subcritical.|$|R
50|$|Although Menger {{accepted}} the marginal utility theory, he made {{deviations from the}} work of other neoclassical pioneers. Most importantly he fundamentally rejected the use of mathematical methods insisting that the function of economics was to investigate the essences rather than the <b>specific</b> <b>quantities</b> of economic phenomena.|$|E
50|$|Insufficient {{labeling}} requirements. Consumer products {{generally are}} required to list ingredients, but not the quantities of each, which makes angel dusting difficult for the consumer to detect. A partial exception is {{in the area of}} food products, where some helpful ingredients, like vitamins, may have <b>specific</b> <b>quantities</b> listed, although others, like omega-3 fatty acids, may not.|$|E
50|$|Megawatt {{laundering}} is the term, {{analogous to}} money laundering, coined {{to describe the}} process of obscuring the true origins of <b>specific</b> <b>quantities</b> of electricity being sold on the energy market. The California energy market allowed for energy companies to charge higher prices for electricity produced out-of-state. It was therefore advantageous {{to make it appear}} that electricity was being generated somewhere other than California.|$|E

50|$|On the channel, an {{item was}} advertised with a <b>specific</b> <b>quantity,</b> and a bid-up from price triangle. Customers phoned in and bid {{up from the}} {{particular}} amount. The quantity {{was used to determine}} which customers 'win' the auction. For example, if there was a quantity of 50 for the product, then the top 50 bidders would win the auction.|$|R
50|$|For {{structural}} engineering scale models, {{it is important}} for several <b>specific</b> <b>quantities</b> to be scaled according to the theory of similitude. These quantities can be broadly grouped into three categories: loading, geometry, and material properties. A good reference for considering scales for a structural scale model under static loading conditions in the elastic regime is presented in Table 2.2 of the book Structural Modeling and Experimental Techniques.|$|E
50|$|A central {{authority}} (usually a governmental body) allocates or sells {{a limited number}} of permits to discharge <b>specific</b> <b>quantities</b> of a specific pollutant per time period. Polluters are required to hold permits in amount equal to their emissions. Polluters that want to increase their emissions must buy permits from others willing to sell them. Financial derivatives of permits can also be traded on secondary markets.|$|E
50|$|The sector {{regulator}} has {{a number}} of roles and responsibilities for operationalizing and implementing RE. The policy instruments include those oriented towards prices and quantities. The former (such as Feed-in Tariffs) provide the supplier with certainty regarding price, but the volume depends on whether that price is high or relatively low. The latter includes renewable portfolio standards that require distribution companies to purchase <b>specific</b> <b>quantities</b> of electricity generated by renewable technologies.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the most}} {{significant}} artifacts unearthed at Tel Arad are 91 ostraca in paleo-Hebrew referring to the citadel as the House of Yahweh. They are mostly orders to the quartermaster, commands and lists of names. The Eliyashiv Ostraca, all found in the same room, are addressed to a person named Eliyashiv, ordering him to deliver a <b>specific</b> <b>quantity</b> of wine, flour, etc.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1993, SANNA {{instituted a}} program to monitor the quality of water and {{maintain}} the standards set by the National Technical Standard. The goal was to deliver water at a <b>specific</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality adequate {{to the needs of}} the city. This has been difficult to achieve as urbanization rates have been high and municipal and industrial effluents have been a growing and constant challenge.|$|R
5000|$|On Imperialism II raw {{materials}} {{have to be}} transported first and then processed, access is not enough. In order to build a unit or an improvement a <b>specific</b> <b>quantity</b> of <b>specific</b> {{raw materials}} needs to be transported and processed into semi-finished materials before it becomes possible to build a unit. An example, to build 1 Ship-of-the-line unit the following quantities of semi-finished materials are required: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{specific}} enthalpy of {{a uniform}} system {{is defined as}} h = [...] where m is {{the mass of the}} system. The SI unit for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram. It can be expressed in other <b>specific</b> <b>quantities</b> by h = u + pv, where u is the specific internal energy, p is the pressure, and v is specific volume, which is equal to , where ρ is the density.|$|E
50|$|The strongest {{evidence}} of overprecision comes from {{studies in which}} participants are asked to indicate how precise their knowledge is by specifying a 90% confidence interval around estimates of <b>specific</b> <b>quantities.</b> If people were perfectly calibrated, their 90% confidence intervals would include the correct answer 90% of the time.In fact, hit rates are often as low as 50%, suggesting people have drawn their confidence intervals too narrowly, implying that they think their knowledge is more accurate than it actually is.|$|E
50|$|Batch - Some {{applications}} {{require that}} <b>specific</b> <b>quantities</b> {{of raw materials}} be combined in specific ways for particular duration to produce an intermediate or end result. One example is the production of adhesives and glues, which normally require the mixing of raw materials in a heated vessel {{for a period of}} time to form a quantity of end product. Other important examples are the production of food, beverages and medicine. Batch processes are generally used to produce a relatively low to intermediate quantity of product per year (a few pounds to millions of pounds).|$|E
50|$|The {{continuous}} current ion chamber instrument can easily measure dose but cannot measure counts. However the Geiger counter can measure counts {{but not the}} energy of the radiation, so a technique known as energy compensation of the detector tube is used to produce a dose reading. This modifies the tube characteristic so each count resulting from a particular radiation type is equivalent to a <b>specific</b> <b>quantity</b> of deposited dose.|$|R
3000|$|In the {{proposed}} SLA allocation mechanism, participating buyer agents (i.e., electricity customers) purchase quantities of electricity through contracts of a <b>specific</b> <b>quantity,</b> reliability, and price, subject to uncertain supply and its availability. In our setting, we consider only one seller and no outside {{option for the}} buyers. Let s denote the seller and B the set of buyer agents, there are n buyer agents in the set B, such that B = [...] 1, [...]..., n [...].|$|R
50|$|A {{sample of}} the {{soybeans}} are ground, mixed with a <b>specific</b> <b>quantity</b> of water, and the two are then blended together at a specific rpm for a specific time. The resulting mixture and original bean flour then have their protein content measured using a combustion test, and the PDI is calculated {{as the percentage of}} the protein in the mix divided by the percentage in the flour - a PDI of 100 therefore indicates total solubility.|$|R
50|$|The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act defines {{individual}} transferable quotas (ITQs) as {{permits to}} harvest <b>specific</b> <b>quantities</b> of fish {{of a particular}} species. Fisheries scientists decide the maximum annual harvest in a certain fishery, accounting for carrying capacity, re-generation rates and future values. This amount is called the total allowable catch (TAC). Under ITQs, participants in a fishery receive rights to {{a portion of the}} TAC without charge. Quotas can be fished, bought, sold, or leased. Twenty-eight U.S. fisheries have adopted ITQs as of 2008. Concerns about distributional consequences led to a moratorium on moving other fisheries into the programme that lasted from 1996 to 2004.|$|E

5000|$|Competition is {{widespread}} throughout the market process. It {{is a condition}} where [...] "buyers tend to compete with other buyers, and sellers tend to compete with other sellers." [...] In offering goods for exchange, buyers competitively bid to purchase <b>specific</b> <b>quantities</b> of specific goods which are available, or might be available if sellers were to choose to offer such goods. Similarly, sellers bid against other sellers in offering goods on the market, competing for the attention and exchange resources of buyers. Competition results from scarcity—there is never enough to satisfy all conceivable human wants—and occurs [...] "when people strive to meet the criteria that {{are being used to}} determine who gets what." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{spaghetti}} {{bridge is}} a bridge (architectural model) made of spaghetti or other hard, dry, straight noodles. Bridges are constructed for both educational experiments and competitions. The aim is usually {{to construct a}} bridge with a <b>specific</b> <b>quantity</b> of materials over a specific span, that can sustain a load. In competitions, the bridge that can hold the greatest load {{for a short period}} of time wins the contest. There are many contests around the world, usually held by schools and colleges.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{relates to}} a paint based on hydrolyzable silanes, said paint producing after drying highly wear-resistant and flexible coatings and obtainable by reacting {{one or more}} hydrolyzable silicon compounds, having an epoxy ring, with water in a <b>specific</b> <b>quantity</b> range. Drying takes place preferably thermally by adding a tertiary amine, in particular an N-alkylimidazole acting as the polymerization initiator for the epoxy groups. Particularly successful results are obtained by using a cyclical carbon acid anhydride {{in addition to the}} tertiary amine...|$|R
