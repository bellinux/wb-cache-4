40|$|International audienceABSTRACT. During {{the last}} decade, {{pharmaceutical}} producers did not evaluate the products' price considering the real cost, but rather considering {{on what the}} market can bear. Currently, the competitive pressures pushes to better refine the products prices in the perspective of increasing the market share. The major concern in the vaccine industry is to compare the financial input of the released products batches with the invested amount to define the actual product cost. The variation of the product costs is generally presented as the results of demand levels or capacity use. The estimation of the actual product cost in the vaccine industry leans strategic planning directives to drive production level. In this paper, we propose an extension of an approach that we have recently proposed to calculate actual production costs, considering {{the integration of the}} information along the products' lifecycle. From the cost point of view, the product lifecycle has three major cost phases: (i) R&D program cost, (ii) procurement cost, and (iii) operating and support cost. For each phase, we will focus on the identification of fixed, variable or <b>semi-variable</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} quantitative research performed {{as part of}} a project on cost variability and cost management systems. The main goal was to analyze principal findings that arise through seeking to determine levels of cost management, as well as from comprehending various types of cost behavior affecting manufacturing enterprises in the Czech Republic. The first part summarizes contemporary theories on approaches to cost management that place emphasis on overhead cost management and general and asymmetric cost behavior. The second section deals with the procedure and methodology of the research conducted. Moreover, presentation is given of surveyed questions and hypotheses that form the basis for analysis of particular areas within cost management. The subsequent part presents actual results from research verified through statistically inspecting dependence relations. It was found that the share of overheads was still relatively high, although it had decreased in comparison with figures from previous surveys. Furthermore, there was evidence of significant association between the size of a company and the attention paid to a broadened perception of cost behavior and to monitoring the same. In addition, it was confirmed that senior executives were not aware of issues regarding asymmetric cost behavior or the influence of factors beyond production capacity. It was proven that a dependence exists between the prevalent type of production and complications arising in research, e. g. utilization of the ABC method or monitoring semi-fixed and <b>semi-variable</b> <b>costs.</b> These findings are discussed in the final part of the paper...|$|E
40|$|One of {{planning}} forms on cost management is target costing method, {{where it can}} be used to determine the expected cost for one product based on competitive price, so the product will be able to compete and to made an expected profit. Target costing risen because it is happened a tight competition which directly affecting the price competition. Thus, the present condition is cost determined by price and not the otherwise, where price is determined by cost. This research has purpose to explain the application of target costing with profit volume cost (BVL) analysis as the alternative of cost planning on tempeh chips industry of Ar-Ridho Malang. The contribution of this research on small industry is as the consideration or alternative to make decision in cost planning, so it can avoid the swell up of cost expensed by the company. The conclusion of this research is the amount of cost is determined by sale price and not the otherwise in target costing. One function of profit volume cost analysis is cost planning. Thus, target costing has effect on the determination of variable cost amount, break-even point, and the appropriate target costing. Based on the analysis result it can be known that the sale pricing of new product is tempeh chips product with price of Rp. 2000,- decreasing Rp. 500,- from the past sale price to be Rp. 1. 500,-. While, sale price of tempeh product/box is Rp. 11. 500,- from the past price to be Rp. 12. 000,-. The result of target costing determination is Rp. 1. 500,- for tempeh chips product and Rp. 8. 625,- for tempeh product. The amount of new variable cost as the result of sale price changes, it can be determined the amount of variable cost for tempeh chips product is Rp. 1. 167 /ons and Rp. 5. 955 /box of tempeh product. The amount of break-even point can be determined by using weighed average contribution margin approach. Because of the tempeh chips industry of Ar-Ridho Malang is the company with more than one product using the same fixed cost. The amount of break-even point for tempeh chips product is 2. 802, 22 ons and tempeh product 188. 48 boxes. Some suggestions can be submitted from the research result that the company is expected to conduct analysis on profit volume cost with the expectation that it can be more accurate in presenting cost planning, break-even point and the expected profit. It is expected that the company conduct some correction in separating <b>semi-variable</b> <b>costs</b> to be fixed cost and variable cost.
