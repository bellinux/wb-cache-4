5|$|As {{had been}} the case with several {{previous}} films in the series, an entirely original story was required as there remained no Ian Fleming novels or stories to adapt. The <b>scriptwriting</b> process was finished very late due to lengthy disputes.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{has turned}} {{his hand to}} <b>scriptwriting,</b> co-authoring Chemical Wedding with {{director}} Julian Doyle. The film, in which Dickinson played a few small cameo roles and composed the soundtrack, was released in 2008 and starred Simon Callow.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Davies quit {{all of his}} {{producing}} jobs, and {{was offered}} a <b>scriptwriting</b> role on the late-night soap opera Revelations, created by him, Tony Wood, and Brian B. Thompson. The series was a tongue-in-cheek deconstruction of organised religion, and featured his first overtly homosexual character: a lesbian vicar portrayed by Sue Holderness, {{who came out of}} the closet in a two-hander episode with Carole Nimmons.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting. Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director. Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for the antiwar film director Satsuo Yamamoto's film, A Triumph of Wings (Tsubasa no gaika, 1942). This outside <b>scriptwriting</b> would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{the role}} of No’man in both season one and two is Saudi Arabian actor and {{entertainer}} Abdullah Kassem who's passion for acting is beyond words. He has over 15 {{years of experience in}} the field of children’s theatre across painting, acting, directing and <b>scriptwriting,</b> with all his work certified by the Ministry of Culture and Information, Saudi Arabia. Abdullah is the founder of a media and production company specialized in producing edutainment programs for children. Abdullah plans to further explore the world of animation and start producing animated films.|$|E
5|$|A live-action {{film was}} {{announced}} {{to be in}} production in October 2011. In December 2012, {{it was reported that}} Tetsuya Nakashima left his position as director. According to film distributor Toho, Nakashima had considerable creative differences on the <b>scriptwriting</b> and other matters. In December 2013, Shinji Higuchi was revealed to be directing, and would also be responsible with the special effects. Writer Yūsuke Watanabe and critic/subculture expert Tomohiro Machiyama was announced to be scripting the movie with series creator Isayama. In July 2014, it was revealed that two films will be released in the summer of 2015. A teaser trailer for the first live-action film was released in March 2015. The following month, Toho released the second trailer for the first film, and announced the second installment will be called Attack on Titan: End of the World. In June 2015, a third trailer for the first film was released, revealing the Three-Dimensional Maneuvering Gear, as well as confirming the film will be released in IMAX theaters in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{positive}} initial reviews, which {{praised the}} film as a well-made cinematic transfer of the Thunderbirds television series, Thunderbirds Are Go soon {{proved to be a}} box office failure for the Andersons. The disappointment of this outcome was intensified by the knowledge that Series Two of Thunderbirds would be cut down to six episodes and that AP Films' upcoming television project would be a brand-new series, which would later be titled Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and screened from 1967. To add to the lukewarm public response, negative critical reception of Thunderbirds Are Go has targeted, besides other aspects, the characterisation of the puppet cast, which has been seen as too minimal to sustain a feature-length production, the running time dedicated to model and effects shots, and the fantasy dream sequence starring Cliff Richard and The Shadows, which {{has been described as a}} poor <b>scriptwriting</b> idea on the part of the Andersons.|$|E
5|$|On Why Don't You?, Davies took on varying jobs, {{including}} researcher, director, illustrator, assistant {{floor manager}} and unofficial publicist for fan-mail. He was offered his first professional <b>scriptwriting</b> job in 1986 by show producer Dave Evans; he had entered Evans's office {{to collect his}} wages and was offered an extra £100 to write a replacement script. Davies' script was positively reviewed in the department and led to increasingly larger roles that culminated in a six-month contract to write for the show after it relocated to Manchester in 1988. He worked for the show for two more years and eventually became the show's producer. He oversaw an increase in drama which tripled its audience—despite the fact BBC Manchester was not permitted by the corporation to create children's dramas—which reached its climax with his last episode: a drama where the Why Don't You? protagonists, led by the show's longest running presenter Ben Slade, were trapped in a café by a supercomputer that tried to kill them.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{an early}} {{interest}} in comics and role-playing games, Johnston {{started his career}} as a graphic designer. He began his writing career with work for role-playing magazines before the Mark Salisbury-edited Writers on Comic <b>Scriptwriting</b> (Titan Books, 1999) rekindled his interest in comics. Drawing on his design skills, he now designs many of his own comics and graphic novels.|$|E
25|$|Clemens {{created the}} BBC TV sitcom, My Wife Next Door (1972) but left the <b>scriptwriting</b> to Richard Waring. The series won a BAFTA Award as Best Situation Comedy Series. Made {{around the same}} time, the TV movie The Woman Hunter (also 1972) was scripted by Clemens and fellow ITC writer Tony Williamson from the former's story. It was Clemens' first American credit.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to school and earned a Master of Fine Arts in sculpture at the University of Arizona before moving to Los Angeles to join the city's art scene. However, he felt more kinship in telling stories than in creating performance art. His break into filmmaking came with <b>scriptwriting</b> credits on the films Under Fire and The Best of Times.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Kiarostami directed Ten, revealing {{an unusual}} method of filmmaking and abandoning many <b>scriptwriting</b> conventions. Kiarostami {{focused on the}} socio-political landscape of Iran. The images are seen {{through the eyes of}} one woman as she drives through the streets of Tehran {{over a period of several}} days. Her journey is composed of ten conversations with various passengers, which include her sister, a hitchhiking prostitute, and a jilted bride and her demanding young son. This style of filmmaking was praised by a number of critics.|$|E
25|$|Dixon {{headed to}} New York City and {{enrolled}} in the Frobisher School to study drama. As an actor, Dixon's physical appearance became a problem – he was six foot three inches tall but only weighed 150 pounds, making for a very lanky appearance. One producer remarked that because of his appearance Dixon would not succeed as an actor, but he complimented Dixon for his intelligence and attention to detail and recommended that Dixon put his love for the stage into <b>scriptwriting.</b> Despite the compliment, Dixon returned home to North Carolina in shame.|$|E
25|$|Lambert {{was born}} in London, the {{daughter}} of a Jewish accountant, and was educated at Roedean School. She left Roedean at sixteen and studied at the Sorbonne in Paris for a year and at a secretarial college in London for eighteen months. She later credited her interest in the structural and characterisational aspects of <b>scriptwriting</b> to an inspirational English teacher. Lambert's first job was the typing of menus at the Kensington De Vere Hotel, which employed her because she had been to France and could speak French. In 1956, she entered the television industry as a secretary at Granada Television's press office. She was sacked from this job after six months.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Malcolm McLaren hired Meyer {{to direct}} a film {{starring}} The Sex Pistols. Meyer handed the <b>scriptwriting</b> duties over to Ebert, who, in collaboration with McLaren, produced a screenplay entitled Who Killed Bambi? According to Ebert, filming ended after {{a day and a}} half when the electricians walked off the set after McLaren was unable to pay them. (McLaren has claimed that the project was scrapped at the behest of the main financier and Meyer's erstwhile employer, 20th Century Fox, whose board of directors considered the prospect of a Meyer production to be untenable and incompatible with the insurgent family values ethos in popular culture.) The project ultimately evolved into The Great Rock & Roll Swindle.|$|E
25|$|Other {{cast members}} {{included}} Yvonne Mitchell, who had {{starred in the}} Kneale/Cartier Wuthering Heights, as Julia, and André Morell as O'Brien. Wilfrid Brambell, later known for his roles in Steptoe and Son and as Paul McCartney's grandfather in A Hard Day's Night, appeared in two roles, as the old man Winston speaks with in the pub and as a prisoner later on when Winston is incarcerated. Nigel Kneale who had briefly acted in the 1940s before turning to <b>scriptwriting,</b> had a small voice-over role as an announcer. The face of Big Brother was Roy Oxley, {{a member of the}} BBC design department whose inclusion was something of an in-joke {{on the part of the}} production team.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} {{half of his}} career, NTR became a screenwriter. Despite having no formal {{training}} in <b>scriptwriting,</b> he authored several screenplays for his own movies {{as well as for}} other producers. He also produced many of his films as well as other actor's films through his film production house National Art Theater Private Limited, Madras and later Ramakrishna Studios, Hyderabad. He actively campaigned {{for the construction of a}} large number of cinemas through this production house. He was influential in designing and implementing a financial system that funded the production and distribution of movies. He was so dedicated to his profession that he would often learn new things in order to portray a particular character on-screen perfectly and realistically. At the age of 40, he learnt dance from the renowned Kuchipudi dancer Vempati Chinna Satyam for his role in the film Nartanasala (1963).|$|E
500|$|He {{expanded}} on his email {{two weeks}} later in response to Cook's query about the supposed link between major depressive disorder and creativity. He explained that his anxiety and melancholy during the <b>scriptwriting</b> period still allowed him to keep {{on top of his}} work; on the other hand, he thought [...] "Depression with a capital D [...] any such luxury".|$|E
500|$|Bhardwaj co-wrote the {{screenplay}} with Sabrina Dhawan, Abhishek Chaubey, and Supratik Sen. Bhardwaj bought the original script for [...] from Kenyan writer Cajetan Boywhom he had mentored at a <b>scriptwriting</b> workshop in Uganda. Kaminey {{was released on}} 14 August 2009 and became a box-office success worldwide, grossing over [...] against a budget of [...] The film's soundtrack album also became a commercial success, with the song [...] "Dhan Te Nan" [...] topping the charts on various platforms.|$|E
500|$|The head of Ealing Studios, Michael Balcon, was {{initially}} unconvinced {{by the thought}} of the film, and stated that [...] "I'm {{not going to make a}} comedy about eight murders"; the studio's creative staff persuaded him to rethink. Balcon, who produced the film, chose Robert Hamer as director and warned him that [...] "You are trying to sell that most unsaleable commodity to the British – irony. Good luck to you." [...] Hamer disliked Pertwee, who withdrew from the project, leaving the <b>scriptwriting</b> to Hamer and John Dighton. Hamer saw the potential of the story and later wrote ...|$|E
500|$|Wodehouse {{also wrote}} scripts and screenplays and, in August 1911, his script A Gentleman of Leisure was {{produced}} on the Broadway stage. In the 1920s and 1930s he collaborated with Jerome Kern and Guy Bolton in {{an arrangement that}} [...] "helped transform the American musical" [...] of the time; in the Grove Dictionary of American Music Larry Stempel writes, [...] "By presenting naturalistic stories and characters and attempting to integrate the songs and lyrics into {{the action of the}} libretto, these works brought a new level of intimacy, cohesion, and sophistication to American musical comedy." [...] His writing for plays also turned into <b>scriptwriting,</b> starting with the 1915 film A Gentleman of Leisure. He joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1930 for a year, and then worked for RKO Pictures in 1937.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to The Day After Tomorrow remains mixed. The model {{effects and}} music have been praised; however, commentators have been both favourable and unfavourable in their {{comparisons of the}} special's [...] "psychedelic" [...] images to the visual style employed by film director Stanley Kubrick. Although Byrne's <b>scriptwriting</b> {{has been described as}} [...] "lyrical", and {{it has been suggested that}} The Day After Tomorrow contains homages to the 1960s TV series Lost in Space, the plot has been criticised for a lack of suspense, which critics have generally attributed to the fact that the special is primarily a science education programme. Further criticism has been directed at the acting, with Martin Lev's performance attracting a particularly negative response. Author Douglas R. Mason's novelisation of the special remains unpublished, but a new novelisation by Gregory L Norris was released by Anderson Entertainment in September 2017.|$|E
500|$|Science-fiction author John Peel {{considers}} Captain Scarlet {{inferior to}} Thunderbirds, arguing {{that although the}} special effects had improved, {{it was to the}} detriment of the <b>scriptwriting.</b> He compares this schism to the disappointing reception to Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) following the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981): [...] "Anderson made the same mistake that George Lucas made, assuming that if the effects were praised in Thunderbirds, the public wanted a show with more effects." [...] Peel also finds fault with the nature of Scarlet himself, suggesting that the use of an [...] "indestructible" [...] hero made the conclusions to the episodes too predictable. Furthermore, he expresses a concern that Scarlet, who is often seen to risk his life in a bid to thwart Mysteron plots, served as a poor role model to a target audience of impressionable children.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on his online blog, {{literary}} critic John Kenneth Muir praises Johnny Byrne's [...] "lyrical" [...] <b>scriptwriting,</b> judges Brian Johnson's effects to be [...] "top-notch for the era", and deems Frank Watts' filming [...] "stunning". For Muir, {{the message of}} the special implies a [...] "high-tech, science-minded update of the whole Lost in Space format", while the plot effectively mixes elements of the [...] "claustrophobic" [...] and [...] "action-packed" [...] with [...] "psychedelic" [...] elements such as the descent into the black hole, a subject on which he alludes to the work of Stanley Kubrick: the sequence is [...] "a Kubrickian wonder, a montage dominated by double images, slow-motion photography and the use of a creepy distortion lens. Pretty powerful stuff for a kids' show." [...] Law, meanwhile, considers the faster-than-light shots to be the special's best effects, and compares the black hole sequence unfavourably to the closing act of Kubrick's 1968 film : [...] "Kubrick's Star-Gate it is not." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} {{published}} in The Times in October 1969, John Russell Taylor praised {{the concept of}} the film as [...] "quite ingenious" [...] but suggested that the title and pre-release marketing had revealed too much of the plot for the film to sustain the interest of its audience. Commenting in New York magazine in November, Judith Crist introduced Doppelgänger as [...] "a science-fiction film that comes up with a fascinating premise three-quarters of the way along and does nothing with it." [...] She praised the production as being [...] "nicely gadget-ridden" [...] and raising questions on the conflict between politics and science, but criticised the editing. Variety magazine cited a confusing plot, and related the crash of the Dove module to the coherence of the <b>scriptwriting</b> in its declaration that, [...] "Astronauts take a pill to induce a three-week sleep during their flight. Thereafter the script falls to pieces in as many parts as their craft." ...|$|E
500|$|Dave Golder of SFX {{gave the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars, {{describing}} it as [...] "slight and fluffy and silly, with the occasional creaky bit of plotting ... but enormously entertaining". He was pleased that the guest characters were played [...] "straight" [...] rather than for comedy, and found the dinosaur effects [...] "great" [...] and the Silurian twist [...] "enriching continuity". However, he felt that the teaser was too fast-paced, Nefertiti was [...] "rather bland", and wrote that it was unlikely the Doctor would have a friendship with a big game hunter. IGN's Matt Risley rated [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] 7 out of 10, noting that it [...] "isn't going to win any awards for <b>scriptwriting</b> or pathos, but it certainly succeeded on a family-friendly level full of whimsy". Though he wrote that Brian was [...] "brilliant", he overall criticised the [...] "gang", feeling that they [...] "served little purpose other than to inject some conveniently timed plot devices when needed". He also did not like the [...] "bickering Marvin the Paranoid Android-lite" [...] robots. However, Neela Debnath of The Independent enjoyed the gang, writing, [...] "the more companions there are the more variety it adds to the show because each one has their own flaws and backstory".|$|E
500|$|To ensure {{accuracy}} in <b>scriptwriting,</b> the serial employs {{a team of}} researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo role in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon, and another, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in Holby City as a scrub nurse. Another adviser, a heart surgeon, has occasionally left open-heart surgery to advise Holby City writers over the telephone. The programme utilises surgeons from different disciplines, who check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is particularly important in case viewers copy procedures they have seen in the show, such as CPR. Series star Amanda Mealing commented: [...] "We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to know what you are doing and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones." [...] Cast members are taught how to give realistic injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some are given the opportunity to observe procedures in real hospitals. Original cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer, while Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.|$|E
500|$|Influenced by his {{television}} and film scripting background, Martin {{tries to keep}} readers engrossed by ending each Ice and Fire chapter with a tense or revelational moment, a twist or a cliffhanger, similar to a TV act break. <b>Scriptwriting</b> has also taught him the technique of [...] "cutting out the fat and leaving the muscle", which is {{the final stage of}} completing a book, a technique that brought the page count in A Dance with Dragons down almost eighty pages. Dividing the continuous Ice and Fire story into books is much harder for Martin. Each book shall represent a phase of the journey that ends in closure for most characters. A smaller portion of characters is left with clear-cut cliffhangers to make sure readers come back for the next installment, although A Dance with Dragons had more cliffhangers than Martin originally intended. Both one-time and regular POV characters are designed to have full character arcs ending in tragedy or triumph, and are written to hold the readers' interest and not be skipped in reading. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not rely on the hero to come through unscathed and will instead feel the character's fear with each page turn.|$|E
500|$|The {{narrative}} {{was divided}} into smaller [...] "pieces of drama" [...] similar to a television series rather than one overarching story piece. This was reflected by the game's working title Final Fantasy XIII: Season 2 when the project was first proposed within the company. Unlike Final Fantasy X-2, which had a more cheerful and humorous feel than Final Fantasy X, the staff members wanted the overall tone of Final Fantasy XIII-2 to be serious as well as darker and more mysterious than its predecessor. The original scenario had called for Serah to travel alone with Mog. However, Kitase felt that their dialogue was [...] "quite girly, almost camp and a bit over the top" [...] and resulted in a tonal shift that was too {{similar to the one}} from X to X-2. Noel was added to the story to counter this. Watanabe considered <b>scriptwriting</b> for the game's two-character party difficult. With the lack of varied personality traits provided by an ensemble cast, he had to ensure that conversations between Serah and Noel would not be repetitive or unrealistic. Unfamiliar concepts and terms in Final Fantasy XIII, such as [...] "l'Cie" [...] and [...] "fal'Cie", were deemed too difficult to understand and hence avoided in the sequel. A story link to Final Fantasy Type-0 via the location Valhalla was planned but later discarded.|$|E
500|$|MacFarlane was {{recruited}} during the senior film festival by development executive Ellen Cockrill and President Fred Seibert. He {{went to work}} at Hanna-Barbera (then Hanna-Barbera Cartoons) based on the writing content of The Life of Larry, rather than on cartooning ability. He was one of only a few people hired by the company solely based on writing talent. He worked as an animator and writer for Cartoon Network's Cartoon Cartoons series. He described the atmosphere at Hanna-Barbera as resembling an [...] "old-fashioned Hollywood structure, where you move from one show to another or you jump from a writing job on one show to a storyboard job on another". MacFarlane worked on four television series during his tenure at the studio: Dexter's Laboratory, Cow and Chicken, I Am Weasel, and Johnny Bravo. Working as both a writer and storyboard artist, MacFarlane spent the most time on Johnny Bravo. He found it easier to develop his own style at Johnny Bravo through the show's process of <b>scriptwriting,</b> which Dexter's Laboratory, Cow and Chicken, and I Am Weasel did not use. As a part of the Johnny Bravo crew, MacFarlane met actors and voiceover artists such as Adam West and Jack Sheldon of Schoolhouse Rock! fame. Meeting these individuals later became significant to the production and success of his Family Guy series.|$|E
500|$|Davies' <b>scriptwriting</b> was {{affected}} {{by the development of}} a head cold and overrunning script constraints; he was annoyed that he had written [...] "dialogue [...] been dying to write" [...] with a [...] "faint heart" [...] because he would have to cut it. Because he was behind schedule, he was forced to cancel plans to attend Piper's wedding and almost cancelled plans to celebrate the New Year with his boyfriend. These problems affected his first draft of the Doctor's conversation with his companions and encounter with Davros; he dismissed it as [...] "lame shit" [...] which would waste licence-payers' money, and replaced it with a different version hours later. The conversation features all of the Doctor's companions simultaneously talking to the Doctor; Tate, Tennant, and director Graeme Harper made the creative decision to have the Doctor ignore any mention of the Daleks because they thought the Doctor's joviality in the scene would be otherwise inappropriate. He eventually finished the script at 1am on New Year's Eve. Cook reviewed the last pages of the script and suggested that the episode should air without a trailer; Davies agreed by noting that [...] " [...] never send out preview discs of the last episode" [...] and that any advertisements for [...] "Journey's End" [...] could [...] "just show lots of Daleks and a repeat of [...] "I'm regenerating" [...] The episode was officially submitted on : the preparation date for [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] and [...] "Journey's End".|$|E
500|$|During a <b>scriptwriting</b> {{workshop}} held by Mira Nair in 2005, Cajetan Boy, a Kenyan {{writer from}} Nairobi, showed Vishal Bhardwaj a script about twin brothers from the city's slums {{and the events}} that occur in their lives during a 24-hour period. Bhardwaj liked Boy's approach to the script; Nair and Bhardwaj discussed it {{and thought it was}} a typical Bollywood masala film. Boy sent Bhardwaj another draft of his script. Three years later, Bhardwaj asked Boy to sell him the idea, and he later bought the script for US$4,000. Bhardwaj revisited the idea and added some Bollywood elements and a dark, serious side to the script. He worked on the original idea with writers Sabrina Dhawan, Abhishek Chaubey and Supratik Sen. He included Dhawan in writing the screenplay because as he thought she would give it a [...] "solid structure". Bhardwaj said that during the writing of the screenplay, most of the original ideas were changed and the climax was [...] "Indianized". His re-worked version now included one brother with a stammer and the other with a lisp. Bhardwaj said that despite the complicated structure, Kaminey is [...] "anything but arty" [...] and could not alienate audiences in any part of India, and that it is a simple story but with a complicated structure. Dhawan said that the film's script was complex and has multiple stories which required excessive writing and rewriting to make each character sound distinct.|$|E
500|$|The {{script was}} written by Jerry Gracio, {{influenced}} by the poem The Hound of Heaven, and won first prize at the <b>scriptwriting</b> competition hosted by the Film Development Council of the Philippines in 2000. This {{attracted the attention of}} Laurice Guillen, who bought the script (the first time in her career that she had done so) and signed on to direct the eventual film. The script was brought to Star Cinema, who became interested in producing it, but production stalled due to difficulties finding an appropriate actress to play Malen. Guillen stated that [...] "Since she was a Magdalene, she had to be sexy but she also had to be much more than that....I was shown many sexy actresses, some of them name stars, but I couldn't find my Santa-Santita. I felt that the role should go to someone relatively new, who had no fixed image, so {{that there would be no}} expectations". An additional problem was over the religious content of the film, which met with controversy. Guillen eventually found Angelica Panganiban to play Malen, and after five years without production, work on the film began for Unitel Pictures International, whose CEO stated that [...] "the majority of Filipinos, the so-called masses, are not the targets of this movie. Those who frequent the cineplexes and look for fresh material in the movies are". The title, Santa Santita, translates as [...] "saint who is not really a saint".|$|E
500|$|In September 2008, BBC Books, {{an imprint}} of Random House Publishing, {{published}} The Writer's Tale, {{a collection of}} emails between Davies and Radio Times and Doctor Who Magazine journalist Benjamin Cook. Dubbed the [...] "Great Correspondence" [...] by Davies and Cook, The Writer's Tale covers a period between February 2007 and March 2008 and explores his writing processes {{and the development of}} his scripts for the fourth series of Doctor Who: [...] "Voyage of the Damned", [...] "Partners in Crime", [...] "Midnight", [...] "Turn Left", [...] "The Stolen Earth", and [...] "Journey's End". The book's first chapter focuses on Cook's [...] "big questions" [...] on Davies' writing style, character development—using the Doctor Who character Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) and the Skins character Tony Stonem (Nicholas Hoult) as contrasting examples—, how he formulated ideas for stories, and the question [...] "why do you write?". After several weeks, Cook assumes an unofficial advisory role to the <b>scriptwriting</b> and the development of the series. The book's epilogue consists of a short exchange between Davies and Cook: Cook changes from his role as [...] "Invisible Ben" [...] to [...] "Visible Ben" [...] and strongly advises to vastly alter the denouement to [...] "Journey's End" [...] from a cliffhanger that led into [...] "The Next Doctor"—which had occurred in the previous three series finales, [...] "The Parting of the Ways", [...] "Doomsday", and [...] "Last of the Time Lords"—to a melancholy ending that showed the Doctor alone in the TARDIS. After three days of deliberation, Davies accepts Cook's suggestion and thanks him for improving both episodes.|$|E
