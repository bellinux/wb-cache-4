40|$|High {{magnetic}} fields increase are advantageous for MRS, since sensitivity and spectral dispersion are increased, however, spectral peaks are also broadened in vivo due to stronger susceptibility-induced effects. The shim requirements on our 7 T monkey system exceeded the capabilities for active shimming tenfold, which were {{overcome by the}} optimized combination of passive and active shimming. Simple ferro-shim geometries of only two pieces per shim term were numerically optimized to generate the second order spherical harmonic shim fields. The removal of large scale field inhomogeneities was achieved by mounting the ferro-shims on a cylinder surface that surrounded the monkey head and the RF coils. Subsequently, high <b>accuracy</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the active shims was done with FASTMAP. The experimental effort for the passive shimming was acceptable, the shimming was reproducible between sessions; no eddy current or spike artifacts were introduced. The presented methods are of high practical relevance for shimming on high field systems and/or shimming of anatomical regions which inherently require high shim fields...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{research}} projects {{have demonstrated that}} the efficiency of inventory systems does not relate directly to demand forecasting performance, as measured by <b>standard</b> forecasting <b>accuracy</b> measures. When a forecasting method is used as an input to an inventory system, it should therefore always be evaluated with respect to its consequences for stock control through accuracy implications metrics, {{in addition to its}} performance on the <b>standard</b> <b>accuracy</b> measures. In this paper we address the issue of judgementally adjusting statistical forecasts for ‘fast’ demand items, and the implications of such interventions in terms of both forecast accuracy and stock control, with the latter being measured through inventory volumes and service levels achieved. We do so using an empirical dataset from the pharmaceutical industry. Our study allows insights to be gained into the combined forecasting and inventory performance of judgemental estimates. It also aims to advance the practice of forecasting competitions by arguing for the consideration of additional (stock control) metrics when such exercises take place in an inventory context...|$|R
40|$|The <b>standard</b> quantum <b>accuracy</b> {{threshold}} theorem {{states that}} if storage errors and gate imperfections at the physical level are sufficiently improbable, local and Markovian, then quantum computation of arbitrary accuracy and scale can be efficiently implemented by concatenated encoding. However, this theorem {{does not apply}} straightforwardly to the alternative model of quantum computation using measurements on graph states. This is mainly because, when simulating any quantum circuit within this model, a single physical error can propagate forward and induce multiple correlated errors making the effective noise unavoidably non-Markovian. Thus, simulating a fault-tolerant circuit in this model does not automatically imply that there exists an accuracy threshold for the simulation similar to that applicable to the simulated fault-tolerant computation itself. Prior works have addressed the problem of obtaining such an accuracy threshold result by invoking a more general threshold theorem that holds for non-Markovian noise. Taking a different approach, we exploit {{the features of the}} fault-tolerant circuit design to show that this particular type of non-Markovian noise can in fact be handled by the <b>standard</b> <b>accuracy</b> threshold theorem...|$|R
