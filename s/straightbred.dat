Crossbred cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with <b>straightbred</b> cows. However, the benefits of hybrid vigour in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to the cow, and increase if a new breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge that the major production benefits of hybrid vigour occur in crossbred cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E

In the first experiment, New Zealand White CNN) and Flemish Giant (FG) straightbreds and FG sire x (Florida White-New Zealand White dam) terminal-crossbreds (TX) were involved. Reproductive performance was generally lower for small crossbred compared to <b>straightbred</b> doe groups, which were similar. However, doe group comparisons based on total {{production per unit}} of building area were not made. For NN straightbreds compared to FG <b>straightbred</b> and TX groups, litter size was larger and litter weight was heavier at 56 d and feed intake was increased. Average daily gain and 56 d weight per rabbit were larger but mortality from respiratory diseases was higher for FG straightbreds, while performance was similar between NN and TX groups. Total mortality was lowest in TX compared to <b>straightbred</b> litters. From carcass appraisal investigations, FG-sired progeny had more favorable body composition than NN progeny. Comparisons of terminal-crosses to <b>straightbred</b> groups revealed crossbred advantages for body measurement and lean yield traits. In the second experiment, three sire breeds: Californian (CC), NN and FG and four dam genetic groups: CC and NN straightbreds and Californian x New Zealand White (CN) and New Zealand White xCalifornian (NC) reciprocal crossbred does were involved.

O modelo animal foi utilizado para se estimarem as PTAs dos touros, considerando-se apenas as filhas puras Gir, apenas as filhas mestiças e todas as filhas ao mesmo tempo. Posteriormente, estimaram-se as regressões e correlações das PTA dos touros, obtidas sob as diferentes alternativas, com as produções de leite de suas filhas puras e/ou mestiças. O coeficiente de regressão estimado das PTAs de 48 touros Gir avaliados com filhas puras sobre a produção de suas filhas mestiças foi de 0, 75, enquanto o da regressão das PTAs de 50 touros Gir avaliados com base na produção de filhas mestiças, sobre a produção de suas filhas puras, foi de 1, 11. Os coeficientes de correlação entre as PTAs dos touros e a produção de leite de suas filhas, para as diferentes alternativas, variaram de 0, 05 a 0, 17. As correlações de ordem entre os valores das PTA variaram de 0, 34 a 0, 94, em que a menor foi observada entre as PTAs com informações das filhas mestiças e as PTAs obtidas com informações das filhas puras, e a maior, entre as PTAs obtidas pela média ponderada das PTAs obtidas com as filhas puras e mestiças com as PTAs obtidas com dados de filhas puras.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{simulation}} study was to maximise the amount (kg) of high value meat arising from surplus males and females per kilogram of the goat population and, maximise weight gains to turnoff age. Subsequently, the study aimed to decrease turnoff age, maximisation of reproduction rates and minimisation of the mature weight of does in the low-input livestock production system in Kenya. Three crossbreeding systems and a synthetic breed development were evaluated, namely; (a) straight breeding system that utilised pure Small East African goat (SEAG) where parental lines were maintained to generate the desired terminal crosses, (b) three-breed crossbreeding system that utilised SEAG as pure breed, Galla goat (GG) as the first cross sire breed, and Improved Boer goat (IBG) as the terminal sire, (c) two-breed rotational crossbreeding system where the SEAG and IBG were purebreds, and (d) synthetic breed development system utilising SEAG X IBG. The HotCross crossbreeding simulation software {{was used to assess}} the predicted performance of the different goat breed crosses under conditions of agro ecological zones (AEZ) V and VI. A model was developed to compare these crossbreeding systems, and showed the optimum numbers required in each stage of a cross to maximise production.

A random sample of 392 barrows {{was used to evaluate}} carcass traits. The data were analyzed to determine breed of sire and breed of dam effects, to evaluate differences between reciprocal crosses and to estimate heterosis. Breed of sire and breed of dam effects were significant for many of the traits evaluated. <b>Straightbred</b> Durocs had a higher average daily gain, were fatter and produced carcasses that were firmer and had more marbling than <b>straightbred</b> Hampshires or Yorkshires (P 3 ̆c. 05). Yorkshires were the most efficient <b>straightbred</b> while Hampshires had the largest longissimus muscle areas and leanest carcasses of the straightbreds. Significant differences were noted between reciprocal crosses. When Yorkshires were involved in the cross, the pigs were more efficient, consumed less feed per day and produced carcasses that were leaner and had larger longissimus muscle areas when the Yorkshire was used as the dam rather than as the sire (P 3 ̆c. 05). Significant and favorable heterosis was found for average daily gain, age at 100 kg, feed efficiency, feed consumption and carcass length when averaged over all crosses. The general lack of heterosis for carcass traits indicates that the carcass merit of crossbred pigs can be approximated by the average of the purebreds involved in the cross...|$|E

40|$|Story In Brief: Increasing {{reproductive}} efficiency {{will have}} the greatest influence on ranch profitability. New Mexico ranches will typically wean between a 90 and 110 % lamb crop. However, the potential is much greater. Willingham et al. (1986) found that range ewes (west Texas) ovulated 1. 52 eggs per ewe and with a lambing and weaning percent of 117 % and 101 %, respectively. The greatest reproductive loss is between ovulation and lambing with the most vulnerable period pre-implantatin. Therefore, to increase reproductive efficiency, we need to increase implantation rates and reduce early embryonic death. A second way to increase reproductive efficiency {{is to increase the}} pounds of lamb marketed per ewe. Therefore, we need to increase weaning weight of lambs going to market in the fall. For many years, producers in New Mexico and the west have used mutton sires as terminal crosses on western white face ewes. This system fit well into the selection system developed by Prof Neale. However, little information is published regarding the actual benefits of the crossbred lamb. Objectives: The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the stage/s of greatest reproductive loss in Western Whiteface range ewes. The secondary objective was to determine if terminal cross breeding will effectively produce more pounds of weaned lamb than <b>straightbred</b> Western whiteface lambs on native rangelands. Expected Outcomes: Our hypothesis was that we would see about 40 – 50 % loss of potential lambs (potential lambs = ovulation rates) with the greatest loss in the first few weeks following breeding. Also, we expected the cross bred lambs to wean about 10 % heavier than the <b>straightbred</b> lambs...|$|E

O experimento teve como objetivo avaliar o desenvolvimento até os vinte e oito meses de idade e o desempenho reprodutivo no primeiro acasalamento aos vinte e cinco meses de fêmeas de dois sistemas de acasalamento, puras (Charolês – C e Nelore – N) e cruzadas (½ CN, ½ NC) submetidas a duas idades de desmame, sendo T 3 – desmame aos três meses de idade e T 7 – desmame aos sete meses de idade. Após o manejo do desmame, as fêmeas foram mantidas exclusivamente em condições de pastagem. Os dados avaliados foram os pesos ao nascer, aos três, sete, doze, dezoito, vinte e quatro e vinte e oito meses de idade, os ganhos de peso médios diários (GMD) entre as diferentes idades e a condição corporal aos vinte e quatro e vinte e oito meses de idade, área pélvica e percentagem de prenhez. Não houve interação significativa entre sistema de acasalamento e idade de desmame, para as variáveis estudadas. O GMD das fêmeas do T 3 foi inferior dos três aos sete meses (296 contra 434 g), e superior dos sete aos doze meses (541 contra 417 g). Nas demais fases não houve diferença no GMD. A única diferença para peso mostrou-se aos sete meses, sendo superior para os animais do T 7 (144 contra 128 kg). Os pesos aos vinte e quatro meses foram de 333 e 331 kg, respectivamente, para T 3 e T 7. As fêmeas cruzadas apresentaram maior ganho de peso dos três aos dezoito meses de idade e apresentando-se mais pesadas aos doze (11, 73 %), dezoito (17, 10 %) e vinte e quatro (14, 89 %) e vinte e oito meses (19, 03 %). Não se verificaram diferenças significativas entre as idades de desmame, nas variáveis condição corporal e área pélvica. A taxa de prenhes foi similar entre T 7 (66, 7 %) e T 3 (63, 0 %). As fêmeas cruzadas apresentaram melhor estado corporal aos 24 meses (3, 8 contra 3, 3 pontos) e 28 meses (3, 66 contra 3, 07 pontos), maior área pélvica (185, 29 contra 166, 28 cm²) e maior percentagem de prenhez (79, 1 contra 38, 7 %) do que as fêmeas puras.

40|$|Foram avaliadas as características quantitativas da carcaça de novilhos puros (Charolês - C e Nelore - N) e mestiços da segunda (G 2) (¾C ¼N e ¾N ¼C), terceira (G 3) (5 / 8 C 3 / 8 N e 5 / 8 N 3 / 8 C) e quarta (G 4) (11 / 16 C 5 / 16 N e 11 / 16 N 5 / 16 C) gerações de cruzamento, terminados em confinamento. Os animais mestiços apresentaram maiores pesos de abate e de carcaças quente e fria que a média dos puros, com heterose total, respectivamente, de 14, 95; 18, 72 e 18, 39 % na G 2, 19, 98; 24, 16 e 24, 59 % na G 3, e 18, 38; 22, 55 e 22, 88 % na G 4. A heterose total para as três características acompanhou as oscilações do grau de heterozigose individual. As heteroses para rendimento de carcaça quente e fria foram significativas em todas as gerações do cruzamento, sendo a heterose retida 3, 22 e 3, 71 %, respectivamente. A perda de líquidos durante o resfriamento da carcaça na G 2 não diferiu dos animais puros, mas foi significativamente menor na G 3 (- 16, 73 %) e na G 4 (- 12, 84 %). Para maturidade fisiológica da carcaça, a heterose foi negativa e significativa na G 3 e na G 4. A espessura de gordura foi maior nos mestiços das três gerações de cruzamento, mas foi significativa apenas na G 4. Para as características que expressam a musculosidade da carcaça, a heterose foi significativa nas três gerações para conformação e área do músculo Longissimus dorsi, para espessura de coxão e perímetro de braço, embora positiva nas três gerações, alcançou significância na G 3 e na G 4, sendo a heterose retida de 8, 09; 11, 33; 7, 45 e 5, 95 %, respectivamente. As características relacionadas ao desenvolvimento {{corporal}} apresentaram heterose significativa em todas as gerações de cruzamento, sendo a heterose retida de 8, 55; 5, 73 e 4, 99 % para comprimento de carcaça, de perna e de braço, respectivamente. A proporção dos cortes comerciais na carcaça não foi afetada pela heterozigose, mas, para os seus valores absolutos, a heterose foi significativa, acompanhando o comportamento do peso da carcaça. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the carcass characteristics of feedlot finished steers, <b>straightbreds</b> (Charolais - C and Nellore - N), and crossbreds from second (G 2) (¾C ¼N and ¾N ¼C), third (G 3) (5 / 8 C 3 / 8 N and 5 / 8 N 3 / 8 C) and fourth (G 4) (11 / 16 C 5 / 16 N and 11 / 16 N 5 / 16 C) generations of rotational crossbreeding. Crossbreds showed higher slaughter, hot and cold carcass weights than {{the average of the}} purebreds, being the total heterosis, respectively, 14. 95; 18. 72 and 18. 39 % in G 2, 19. 98; 24. 16 and 24. 59 % in G 3 and, 18. 38; 22. 55 and 22. 88 % in G 4. Total heterosis for the three characteristics followed the fluctuation of individual heterozygosis. Heterosis for hot and cold carcass dressing percentage was significant in all generations, being the retained heterosis, respectively, 3. 22 and 3. 71 %. Carcass chilling loss in G 2 did not differ from purebreds, but was significantly lower in G 3 (- 16. 73 %) and G 4 (- 12. 84 %). For carcass physiological maturity, heterosis was negative and significant in G 3 and G 4. Subcutaneous fat thickness was higher for the crossbreds of the three generations, however, was only significant in G 4. For the characteristics related to carcass muscling, heterosis was significant in the three generation for conformation and Longissimus dorsi area, for cushion thickness and arm perimeter, although positive in the three generations, reached significance only in G 3 and G 4, being the retained heterosis, respectively, 8. 09; 11. 33; 7. 45 and 5. 95 %. The characteristics related to corporal development showed significant heterosis in all generations, being the retained heterosis 8. 55; 5. 73 and 4. 99 %, respectively, for carcass, leg and arm length. The proportion of commercial cuts of the carcass was not affected by heterozygosis, but for their absolute values, heterosis was significant following the carcass weight behavior...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive, maternal, {{and weight}} traits were {{analyzed}} for Angus (A), Brahman (B), and Hereford (H) <b>straightbred</b> cows; F 1 and F 2 BA and BH cows; and 3 / 8 B 5 / 8 A first (Bn) and second (Bn 2) generation cows in Central Texas. Heterosis was estimated for calf crop born (CCB), calf crop weaned (CCW), and cow weight at palpation (PW) by linear contrasts within cow breed groups. F 1 BA cows expressed heterosis (P 0. 10) for CCB or CCW. Only the F 1 BA (22. 9 kg) and F 2 BH (42. 1 kg) groups expressed heterosis (P< 0. 10) for PW. Bn 2 cows (- 65. 7 kg) expressed negative heterosis (P< 0. 01) for PW. Heterosis for calf survival (CS), birth weight (BW), and weaning weight (WW) was estimated by linear contrasts within calf breed groups for B- and H-influenced calves. F 1 BH (0. 11) and F 2 BH (0. 14) calves expressed heterosis (P 0. 10) for BW, but B-sired F 1 BH calves were 5. 5 kg heavier (P< 0. 01) than H-sired F 1 calves at birth. F 1 BH (22. 4 kg) and F 2 BH (26. 2 kg) calves expressed heterosis (P< 0. 001) for WW, and H-sired F 1 BH calves were 20. 7 kg heavier (P< 0. 10) than B-sired F 1 calves at weaning...|$|E
40|$|Economic values {{derived from}} a {{terminal}} crossbreeding system based on Brahman cows and a tropically adapted composite herd targeted to meet specifications of the grass-finished Japanese market were compared to a <b>straightbred</b> Brahman herd. The model represented a typical individual central Queensland integrated breeding/finishing enterprise or a northern Australian vertically integrated enterprise with separate breeding and finishing properties. Due mainly to a reduced age of turnoff of Crossbred and Composite sale animals and an improved weaning rate in the Composite herd, Crossbred and Composite herds returned a gross margin of $ 7 and $ 24 per Adult Equivalent (AE) respectively above that of the Brahman herd. The benefits of changing 25 % of the existing 85 % of Brahmans in the northern Australian herd to either Crossbreds or Composites over a 10 -year period were also examined, using either no premium or a 5 c per kg premium for carcass quality in Crossbred and Composite sale animals. With no premium, annual benefits were $ 16 m and $ 61 m for Crossbreds and Composites in 2013. The cumulative Present Value (PV) of this shift over the 10 -year period was $ 88 m and $ 342 m respectively, discounted at 7 %. When a 5 c per kg premium for carcass quality was included, differences in annual benefits rose to $ 30 m and $ 75 m and cumulative PVs to $ 168 m and $ 421 m for Crossbreds and Composites respectively...|$|E
