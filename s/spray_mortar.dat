40|$|Static-cyclic {{shear load}} tests and tensile tests on {{retrofitted}} masonry walls were conducted at UAS Fribourg for {{an evaluation of}} the newly developed retrofitting system, the S&P ARMO-System. This retrofitting system consists of a composite of carbon mesh embedded in a specially adapted high quality <b>spray</b> <b>mortar.</b> It can be applied with established construction techniques using traditional construction materials. The experimental study has shown that masonry walls reinforced by this retrofitting system reach a similar strength and a higher ductility than retrofits by means of bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer sheets. Hence, the retrofitting system using carbon fiber meshes embedded in a high quality mortar constitutes a good option for static or seismic retrofits or reinforcements for masonry walls. However, the experimental studies also revealed that the mechanical anchorage of carbon mesh may be delicate depending on its design...|$|E

" These proceedings are available from: [URL] paper examines the fresh and hardened performance of wet-process <b>sprayed</b> <b>mortars</b> {{and the influence of}} rheology on the pumping and <b>spraying</b> of these <b>mortars.</b> Seven commercially available preblended repair mortars designed for hand application, together with a laboratory-designed fine mortar, were investigated using the Tattersall two-point rotational viscometer, the pressure bleed test, the slump test, and a vane shear strength test. The mortars were pumped and sprayed with a small diameter worm pump and the build thickness determined. Hardened properties measured include compressive strength, tensile bond strength, hardened density and drying shrinkage. Tests were conducted on cast and in-situ specimens and, where possible, on specimens produced by spraying directly into a cube or beam mould. Initial findings for predicting the pumpability and sprayability of the mortars are presented and this is linked together with the hardened performance.

A laboratory designed mortar was also worm and piston pumped. The properties measured included compressive and flexural strength, tensile bond strength, hardened density, modulus of elasticity, air permeability, sorptivity and drying and restrained shrinkage. In-situ test specimens were extracted from 500 mmx 500 mmx 100 mm deep sprayed panels. Tests were also conducted on corresponding cast specimens and, where possible, on specimens that had been sprayed directly into a cube or beam mould. A new test to quantify the degree of reinforcement encasement has been developed and an initial investigation into the measurement of the restrained shrinkage of in-situ repairs is presented. The compressive and flexural strengths of the laboratory mix were comparable with the best of the commercially available preblended mortars. The values for modulus of elasticity, when compared with the compressive strength, were lower than published formulas for this relationship would suggest, especially at lower strengths. The air permeability of most of the mortars was lower than that for normal wet-cured concrete and decreased with an increase in compressive strength. The sorptivity values showed no clear relationship with the compressive strength. The type of wet-process pump was found to have little effect on the insitu compressive and flexural strengths, but did affect the bond strength, although mainly due to the stream velocity and w/c ratio rather than the pumping process. The pump type also effected the reinforcement encasement with higher stream velocities producing better encasement. The mixes exhibited a wide range of drying shrinkage, but the data from the restrained specimens suggest an actual repair is influenced as much by ambient conditions as it is by the mix proportions...|$|R

This paper, which reports on part of a 3 -year research project into wet-process <b>sprayed</b> <b>mortars</b> and concretes for repair, investigates the hardened performance of wet-process sprayed fine concretes. It follows on from an earlier paper by the authors on the performance of hardened wet-process <b>sprayed</b> <b>mortars</b> and some comparisons with these are made here (Austin SA, Robins PJ, Goodier CI (2000). Magz Concr Res 52 : 195 – 208). Work has also been completed by the authors on the pumping and rheology of the fine concrete mixes presented here (Austin SA, Goodier, CI, Robins PJ (2005). Mater Struc, RILEM 38 : 229 – 237). Nine laboratory-designed fine concretes were pumped and sprayed through a wet-process piston pump and one through a dry-process pump. The properties measured included compressive and flexural strength, tensile bond strength, hardened density, elastic modulus, sorptivity and drying and restrained shrinkage. In situ test specimens were extracted from 500 × 500 × 100 mm deep sprayed panels. Hardened property tests were also conducted on corresponding cast specimens and, where possible, on specimens that had been sprayed directly into a cube or beam mould. The compressive strengths of the cast cubes, although very similar, were usually slightly greater than the in␣situ cubes, the opposite of what was found for wet-sprayed mortars (Austin SA, Robins PJ, Goodier CI (2000). Magz Concr Res 52 : 195 – 208). Inconsistent results for compressive and flexural strengths obtained from spraying directly into a steel mould suggest that this method is not as reliable when using a piston pump as it is when using a low-output worm pump (Austin SA, Robins PJ, Goodier CI (2000). Magz Concr Res 52 : 195 – 208). The bond strength of all the mixes exceeded 2. 1 MPa at 7 days. The values for modulus of elasticity, when compared with the compressive strength, were similar to published data for this relationship. The sorptivity values showed only a slight relationship with the compressive strength. The mixes exhibited a wide range of drying shrinkage, but the data from the restrained specimens suggest an actual repair is influenced as much by ambient conditions as it is by the mix proportions...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{hydraulic}} lime specifications {{changed with the}} new version of standard EN 459 - 1 : 2010 and a new Portuguese NHL 3. 5 appeared in the market. The characteristics of mortars depend on many different parameters such as the type of binder, the type of aggregates, the use of fillers and of superplasticizers; also on mixing and curing conditions. In this paper NHL 3. 5 mortars with binder:aggregate volumetric proportions 1 : 3 were prepared, varying the aggregates type and proportions between them. Two coarse sands, a medium sand, a river sand, a finer sand, a calcareous filler and a ceramic powder were used. The two last mentioned aggregates were byproducts from industry. Prismatic mortar samples and samples of mortar applied over brick were prepared and conditioned in two different situations – following standard EN 1015 - 11 and at 65 % relative humidity with initial daily water <b>spray.</b> <b>Mortars</b> were characterized in the fresh state and {{at the age of}} 28 days. Results showed the influence namely of the curing, particularly in terms of water capillary, of the superplasticizer and of the fillers.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The primary aim {{of this research was}} to improve the understanding of the influence of the process and the mix constituents on the fresh and hardened properties of wetprocess <b>sprayed</b> <b>mortars</b> and concretes. The main objectives were: to improve the wetmix spraying process; to specify, measure and optimise in-situ properties; and to disseminate the information obtained in appropriate form to practising engineers to accelerate the use of wet-process <b>sprayed</b> <b>mortar</b> and concrete for repair. The research focused on three types of repair mortars/concretes: pre-blended proprietary mortars (< 3 mm aggregate), designed laboratory/site batched mortars and fine concretes (< 8 mm aggregate). Thirty mixes were pumped and sprayed using seven pumping/spraying systems. Nineteen types of test were conducted to measure the fresh and hardened properties using three types of specimen production (cast mould, sprayed mould and in-situ specimen). Ten repair scenarios generally encountered in the UK were identified and classified in terms of their characteristics and relevant mixes were identified to satisfy these differing requirements. A rheological audit has been developed and a variety of tests were used to characterise the pumpability and sprayability of each mix, including: rotational viscometers (Tattersall two-point test and Viskomat), pressure-bleed, shear vane, slump, build, fresh density, output, stream velocity (using high-speed video), reinforcement encasement and core grading. A new approach that defines the build in terms of the maximum shear and tensile bending stresses generated at failure was also developed. Hardened properties measured include: compressive and flexural strength, tensile bond strength, drying and restrained shrinkage, elastic modulus, air permeability, sorptivity and hardened density. The hardened performance was generally higher when sprayed with the wet process compared with hand application and lower when compared with the dry process (which was expected), although the values obtained were more than sufficient for normal repair work. All the pre-blended mortars could be pumped and sprayed with a small worm pump. Twelve laboratory-designed mortars were pumped and sprayed in a dedicated spraying chamber constructed at Loughborough and the best of these performed as well as, and produced hardened properties that equalled or surpassed, the pre-blended materials. For worm pumping the grading of a mortar was found to be important and a suitable combined material grading zone has been determined. Two pre-blended and a laboratory-designed <b>mortar</b> were <b>sprayed</b> with a piston pump as were the nine designed concrete mixes, the former producing similar in-situ properties to worm pumping. One pre-blended mix was sprayed successfully with five different wet-process pumps (four worm plus one piston) and three pre-blended mortars and one designed fine concrete were sprayed by the dry-process to benchmark performance, along with data from three repair contracts. The hardened property measurements obtained from spraying directly into steel moulds with a low-volume worm pump were consistent enough to have applications for quality control. The research demonstrated that low-volume wet spraying is a healthier, cleaner and more controllable process (compared with the dry process) which can produce consistently high quality mortars and fine concretes suitable for a range of applications in the UK...|$|R

These tests were used to form a rheological audit of each mortar. The two-point apparatus was successful with low-workability mortars and their flow resistance and torque viscosities were determined. These parameters were also obtained with the Viskomat, although problems were encountered due to their low workability. The pressure bleed test measured both the rate and the total volume of liquid emitted from the mixes whilst the vane shear strength test provided an instantaneous reading of the shear strength of the mortars and is compared with their slump. The mortars were pumped and sprayed through a worm pump to assess their suitability and to measure their adhesion to a substrate by build thickness. This value is a measure of sprayability and is converted into values of maximum shear and bending stress which are then compared with the workability parameters in order to determine their inter-relationship...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, cement {{coatings}} {{are often}} used as an anticorrosion protection of the internal surfaces of manufactured ductile iron water pipes. The protective cement linings are also commonly used for old water pipe renovation. In both cases, the cement lining is an excellent anticorrosion protection of the pipelines, effectively separating the pipe wall from the flowing water. Moreover, cement linings protect the pipelines not only by a mechanical barrier, but also by a chemical barrier creating a highly alkaline environment in water contact with the metal pipe wall. In addition, cement coatings have an ability for so-called self-regeneration and provide the improvement of hydraulic conditions inside the pipelines. In turn, {{the differences between the}} analysed cement coatings mainly depend on the types of cements used and techniques of cement <b>mortar</b> <b>spraying.</b> As was expected, they influence the quality of water having contact with the coating.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of energy (in {{the form of}} heat) between the building and its surroundings affects its thermal performance. When a given building system is thermally inefficient it will require that the HVAC equipment will be in permanent activity, increasing the underlying energy costs. This work evaluates the influence of using a TiO 2 -coated plastering mortar in the thermal performance of a building wall model. The TiO 2 aqueous solution was <b>sprayed</b> onto the <b>mortar</b> surface, in its fresh state, by using an atmospheric air compressor {{at a distance of}} about 20 cm, during 30 s and the speed of the aqueous solution jet set at 100 mL/min, thus leading to a coverage rate of about 12 mg/cm 2. For the first time, as far as the authors’ knowledge, this research work allowed to test the previously speculated hypothesis and verify its feasibility in the building industry context. It has been observed that the application of a TiO 2 -coated mortar worsens the thermal behaviour of the wall model, in 10 % and 13 % for the conduction thermal resistance and for thermal transmission coefficient, respectively. Furthermore, the deposition of TiO 2 nanoparticles on the exterior wall surface enhances the water evaporation rate in 136 %.

This roof, both insulating and watertight, is supported by short struts, which form part of a vertical surface of concrete covered with [...] "gunite" [...] and which, in addition, brace the walls of old Vosges stone provided by the former chapel which was destroyed by the bombings. These walls which are without buttresses follow, in plan, the curvilinear forms calculated to provide stability to this rough masonry. A space of several centimeters between the shell of the roof and the vertical envelope of the walls furnishes a significant entry for daylight. The floor of the chapel follows the natural slope of the hill down towards the altar. Certain parts, in particular those upon which the interior and exterior altars rest, are of beautiful white stone from Bourgogne, as are the altars themselves. The towers are constructed of stone masonry and are capped by cement domes. The vertical elements of the chapel are surfaced with <b>mortar</b> <b>sprayed</b> on with a cement gun and then white-washed — both on the interior and exterior. The concrete shell of the roof is left rough, just as it comes from the formwork. Watertightness is effected by a built-up roofing with an exterior cladding of aluminium.
