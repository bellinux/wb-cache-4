40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} study of the shape, size, and spatial {{orientation}} of <b>superclusters</b> of galaxies.

Abell 3627 is thus theorized to be the Great Attractor, a massive object that is pulling the Local Group, the Virgo <b>Supercluster,</b> and the Hydra-Centaurus <b>Supercluster</b> towards its location at 600–1000 kilometres per second.|$|E
5|$|In the Local <b>Supercluster</b> it is {{possible}} to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the Local Group (see Cepheids). However, outside the Local <b>Supercluster</b> of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.|$|E
5|$|With {{advent of}} {{automated}} telescopes {{and improvements in}} spectroscopes, a number of collaborations {{have been made to}} map the Universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the large-scale structure of the Universe. The Great Wall, a vast <b>supercluster</b> of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.|$|E

The absence of very luminous <b>superclusters</b> in simulations can be explained either by non-proper treatment of large-scale perturbations, or by some yet unknown processes in the very early Universe. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the magnitude2.2 Alpha Coronae Borealis. The yellow supergiant R Coronae Borealis is {{the prototype of}} a rare class of giant stars—the R Coronae Borealis variables—that are extremely hydrogen deficient, and thought to result from the merger of two white dwarfs. T Coronae Borealis, {{also known as the}} Blaze Star, is another unusual type of variable star known as a recurrent nova. Normally of magnitude10, it last flared up to magnitude2 in 1946. ADS 9731 and Sigma Coronae Borealis are multiple star systems with six and five components respectively. Five star systems have been found to have Jupiter-sized exoplanets. Abell 2065 is a highly concentrated galaxy cluster one billion light-years from the Solar System containing more than 400 members, and is itself part of the larger Corona Borealis <b>Supercluster.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Coma <b>Supercluster,</b> itself {{part of the}} Coma Filament, {{contains}} the Coma and Leo Cluster of galaxies. The Coma Cluster (Abell 1656) is 230 to 300 million light-years away. It {{is one of the}} largest known clusters, with at least 10,000 galaxies (mainly elliptical, with a few spiral galaxies). Due to its distance from Earth, most of the galaxies are visible only through large telescopes. Its brightest members are NGC 4874 and NGC 4889, both with a magnitude of 13; most others are magnitude 15 or dimmer. NGC 4889 is a giant elliptical galaxy with one of the largest known black holes (21 billion solar masses), and NGC 4921 is the cluster's brightest spiral galaxy. After observing the Coma Cluster, astronomer Fritz Zwicky first postulated the existence of dark matter during the 1930s. The massive galaxy Dragonfly 44 discovered in 2015 was found to consist almost entirely of dark matter. Its mass is very similar to that of the Milky Way, but it emits only 1% of the light emitted by the Milky Way.|$|E

They form a 45-degree triangle, from which Berenice's {{imaginary}} tresses, formed by the Coma Star Cluster, hang. The constellation's brightest star is Beta Comae Berenices, a 4.2-magnitude main sequence star similar to the Sun. Coma Berenices contains the North Galactic Pole and one of the richest known galaxy clusters, the Coma Cluster, part of the Coma <b>Supercluster.</b> Galaxy Malin 1, in the constellation, is the first known giant low-surface-brightness galaxy. Supernova SN 2005ap discovered in Coma Berenices is the brightest known, and SN 1940B was the first observed example of a type II supernova. The star FK Comae Berenices is the prototype of an eponymous class of variable stars. The constellation is the radiant of one meteor shower, Coma Berenicids, which has one of the fastest meteor speeds, up to 65km/s (40 mps).|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{properties of}} the correlation function of clusters of galaxies using geometrical models. We show that the correlation function contains useful information on the geometry {{of the distribution of}} clusters. On small scales the correlation function depends on the shape and the size of <b>superclusters.</b> On large scales it describes the geometry of the distribution of <b>superclusters.</b> If <b>superclusters</b> are distributed randomly then the correlation function on large scales is featureless. If <b>superclusters</b> have a quasi-regular distribution then this regularity can be detected and measured by the correlation function. <b>Superclusters</b> of galaxies separated by large voids produce a correlation function with a minimum which corresponds to the mean separation between centres of <b>superclusters</b> and voids, followed by a secondary maximum corresponding to the distance between <b>superclusters</b> across voids. If <b>superclusters</b> and voids have a tendency to form a regular lattice then the correlation function on large scales has quasi-regularly spaced maxima and minima of decaying amplitude; i. e., it is oscillating. The period of oscillations is equal to the step size of the grid of the lattice...|$|R
