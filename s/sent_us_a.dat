500|$|Warren denies {{claims of}} an imitation, noting the {{discrepancies}} between the production schedules: when Inseminoid entered the shooting stage, Alien, {{which had been}} filmed in closed studios, had been released months before. While the director accepts the often [...] "uncanny" [...] similarities between the two films, he states that Alien distributors 20th Century Fox discounted the possibility of derivation after watching the final cut of Inseminoid: [...] "... in fact, the head of Fox <b>sent</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> very nice letter saying how much he enjoyed the film and wished us luck with the release ... I find it flattering that anyone can compare Alien, which cost {{in the region of}} $30million, with Inseminoid which cost less than £1million. We must have done something right." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Raine Maida {{first brought}} {{up the idea of}} a concept album after {{excerpts}} from the book began influencing his songwriting. Passing time on the road, he had amassed a backlog of songs and had begun to record demos. He jokingly suggested an album title of Kurzweil. [...] "That was not the most graceful sounding name in the world, so we went with Spiritual Machines instead," [...] Turner said. While the other band-members were less enthusiastic about the idea due to its weighty subject matter, Maida and Turner decided to pursue it and Turner contacted Ray Kurzweil via email to ask for permission to use the title of his book for their project. Kurzweil's excitement at the prospect prompted them to invite him to record spoken excerpts from his book for the album and a correspondence developed. “I think it’s amazing that Ray Kurzweil <b>sent</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> bunch of pieces, and for whatever reason, they really tie in with {{what we were trying to}} say on this record,” said Maida.|$|E

2500|$|Ironically, Drummond {{claimed that}} in 1991 The KLF were offered {{the job of}} {{producing}} or remixing a new Whitney Houston album, as an inducement from the boss of her record label (Clive Davis of Arista Records) to sign with them.

Geordie Walker, Killing Joke's guitar player, said that the band was [...] "very pissed off about that, but it's obvious to everyone. We had two separate musicologists' reports saying it was.

Their other future bandmates Ed O'Brien, who Greenwood met during a production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury, and Phil Selway also attended the school. When Greenwood was 15 years old he bought his first guitar, studying classical guitar with his teacher Terence Gilmore-James, who introduced him and the other future members of Radiohead to jazz, film scores, postwar avant-garde music, and 20th-century classical music. Greenwood said: [...] "When we started, {{it was very important}} that we got support from him, because we weren't getting any from the headmaster.

2500|$|Libby {{told the}} grand jury [...] "it seemed {{to me as if}} I was {{learning}} it for the first time" [...] when, according to his account, Russert told him about Plame on July 10 or 11, 2003. Only later, when looking at his calendar and notes, Libby said, did he remember that he actually learned the information from Cheney in June 2003. Libby told {{the grand jury}}: [...] "In the course of the document production, the FBI <b>sent</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> request for documents, or Justice Department, I'm not sure technically. In the course of that document production I came across the note that is dated on or about June 12, and the note... shows that I hadn't first learned it from Russert, although that was my memory, I had first learned it when he said it to me." [...] The note Libby referred to contains no suggestion that either Cheney or Libby knew at the time of Ms. Wilson's undercover status or that her identity was classified, but they do show that Cheney did know and told Libby that Ms. Wilson was employed by the CIA and that she may have helped arrange her husband's trip.|$|E

The clips he <b>sent</b> <b>us</b> were often very personal and affectionate and had been filmed by the families themselves. They were like early home movies but they were beautifully made. Jan Faull found so many unexpected gems in the BFI Archive for us too. One of my favorite moments is a little girl in a village school being crowned May Queen. Also Piccadilly is an amazing film. It stars Anna May Wong who I’d never even heard of. She is spectacular and the acting is mostly very understated and truthful." ...|$|R
