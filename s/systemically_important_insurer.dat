40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} systemic risk in insurance and investigates how financial markets evaluate {{the introduction of a}} new regulation addressed to global <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>insurers</b> (G-SIIs). We analysed the stock price reactions and the evolution of the distance-to-default of a sample of 44 of the world's largest insurers to the publication of the first list of 9 G-SIIs and the release of information regarding their new capital requirements and other policy measures. The results of our event study suggest that, overall, investors doubt the effectiveness of the new regulatory framework in reducing systemic risk in the insurance sector and curbing the moral hazard implications of a “too systemic to fail” policy...|$|R

40|$|A {{sovereign}} debt crisis can have significant knock-on {{effects in the}} financial markets and put financial stability at risk. This paper focuses on the transmission of sovereign risk to insurance companies as some of the largest institutional investors in the sovereign bond market. We use a firm level panel dataset that covers large insurance companies, banks and non-financial firms from nine countries in the time period January 1 st 2008 to May 1 st 2013. We find significant and robust transmission effects from sovereign risk to domestic insurers. The impact on insurers is larger than for non-financial firms and slightly smaller than for banks. We find that <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>insurers</b> were more closely linked to the domestic sovereign. Based on European data, we show that risks in sovereign bond portfolios are an <b>important</b> driver of <b>insurer</b> risk, which is not reflected in current insurance regulation (incl. upcoming Solvency II in Europe) ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} IAIS Global Seminar in June 2017, IAIS {{disclosed}} {{the agenda for}} a gradual shift in the systemic risk assessment methodology from the current Entity Based Approach (EBA) to a new Activity Based Approach(ABA). The EBA, which {{was developed in the}} aftermath of the 2008 / 2009 financial crisis, defines a list of Global <b>Systemically</b> <b>Important</b> <b>Insurers</b> (G-SIIs) based on a pre-defined set of criteria related to the size of the institution. These G-SIIs are subject to additional regulatory requirements since their distress or disorderly failure would potentially cause significant disruption to the global financial system and economic activity. Even if size is still a needed element of a systemic risk assessment, the strong emphasis put on the too-big-to-fail approach in insurance, i. e. EBA, might be partially missing the underlying nature of systemic risk in insurance. Not only certain activities, including insurance activities such as life or non-life lines of business, but also common exposures or certain managerial practices such as leverage or funding structures, tend to contribute to systemic risk of insurers but are not covered by the current EBA (Berdin and Sottocornola, 2015). Therefore, we very much welcome the general development of the systemic risk assessment methodology, even if several important questions still need to be answered...|$|R
40|$|The {{state-based}} {{model of}} U. S. insurance regulation has been remarkably enduring to date, {{in part because}} the traditional rationales for a greater federal role – efficiency, uniformity, and consumer protection – have not succeeded in displacing it. However, the 2008 financial crisis, the federal government’s unprecedented bailouts of parts of the insurance sector, and the need for a coordinated international approach radically shifted the debate about the proper allocation of power between {{the federal government and the}} states by supplanting traditional concerns about efficiency, uniformity, and consumer protection in insurance with a new federal mission to control systemic risk. Unprepared and ill-equipped to counter this shift, the states face the biggest threat to their domination of U. S. insurance regulation in years. Already, the federal government has made inroads into insurance regulation for purposes of systemic risk oversight. That federal presence creates several openings for a broader federal role in insurance than just regulation of <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>insurers.</b> For instance, solvency regulation, which traditionally has been reserved to the states, increasingly could be subsumed under the rubric of systemic risk. Over time, other types of federal incursions could include higher reporting requirements for insurers, regulation of discrete, systemically risky activities (regardless of an insurer’s size), oversight of captive reinsurers, and greater consolidated supervision of insurance groups...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} several network {{measures of}} connectedness {{applied to the}} network extracted using pairwise quantile regressions, i. e. it proposes the use of quantile based network measures to estimate the importance of Globally <b>Systemically</b> <b>Important</b> Financial Institutions. The purpose is to assert the different informative content between quantile based network measures and quantile based loss measures such as CoVaR. We consider Globally <b>Systemically</b> <b>Important</b> Banks and <b>Insurers</b> and several Hedge Fund indices. We investigate whether systemic risk indicators based on network measures {{are similar to those}} based on CoVaR and show that they are capturing different features. In particular, quantile regression based on network measures capture the indirect effect of risk spillovers that is instead ignored by quantile based loss measures. Finally, we compare quantile based network measures and quan- tile based losses measures highlighting the predicting power of the former during the global systemic crisis of 2007 / 2008...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAfter {{the recent}} global {{financial}} crisis, great {{focus has been}} raised on the identification of <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks. Therefore, simple and intuitive indicators on banks’ systemic importance are urgently needed. This paper provides a new estimation method to measure and identify <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks. We define quantitatively a systemic importance score (SIS) as the expected number of bank failures in the banking system given one particular bank fails. The SIS concentrates mainly on an existence of a contagion effect in an average meaning. In the empirical analysis, the SIS index is applied to identify the <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks of China. The empirical results demonstrate that the big five state-owned banks are <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has demonstrated serious {{flaws in the}} corporate governance of <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> financial firms. In particular, the norm that managers should seek to maximize shareholder value, {{as measured by the}} stock price, proves to be a faulty guide for managerial action in <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> firms. This is not only because the failure of such firms will have spillovers that defy the cost-internalization of the tort system but also because these spillovers will harm their own majoritarian shareholders. The interests of diversified shareholders fundamentally diverge from the interests of managers and other controllers because the failure of a <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> financial firm will produce losses throughout a diversified portfolio, not just own-firm losses. Among the consequences: the business judgment rule protection that makes sense for officers and directors of a non-financial firm leads to excessive risk-taking in a <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> financial firm. To encourage appropriate modification of incentives, we propose officer and director liability rules as a complement to (and substitute for) the prescriptive rules that have emerged from the {{financial crisis}}. 1...|$|R
