50|$|The grey-headed chickadee or <b>Siberian</b> <b>tit</b> (Poecile cinctus, {{formerly}} Parus cinctus) is a passerine {{bird in the}} tit family Paridae. It is {{a widespread}} resident breeder throughout subarctic Scandinavia and northern Asia, and also into North America in Alaska and the far northwest of Canada. It is a conifer specialist. It is resident, and most birds do not migrate. Curiously (with respect to its name), the bird has no grey on its head, which is black, white, and brown.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Genetic {{diversity}} in three taiga specialists – the <b>Siberian</b> <b>tit</b> (Parus cinctus), the Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) and the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) – {{was assessed by}} comparing DNA sequence variation across the mitochondrial control region and allele frequencies of microsatellites from samples collected from Fennoscandia and Siberia. Population sizes of these species have declined in association with fragmentation and loss of suitable forest habitat due to modern forestry practices in Fennoscandia. The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) served as a reference for the flying squirrel. Genetic differentiation among species studied ranged from a panmictic population in the <b>Siberian</b> <b>tit</b> {{to that of the}} strong differentiation of populations (θST =  53 %) in the flying squirrel in Finland. MtDNA and microsatellite data, together with assignment studies, showed the Siberian jay population to be significantly genetically structured and supported the existence of a metapopulation like structuring in Fennoscandia. Division of genetic variation among flying squirrel populations along the ancient shoreline of the Littorina Lymnea Sea stage of the Baltic Sea (7000 BP) and two geographically associated branches in the minimum spanning network supported a two-way colonisation history for the species. The Finnish inland appears to have been colonised from the east in association with the arrival of Norway spruce. At the same time, Coastal Finland was colonised from the south-east through the Karelian Isthmus. Gene flow of the species appeared female biased and restricted. Species exhibiting more restrictive dispersal characteristics and habitat requirements possessed stronger population genetic structure than those with opposite characteristics. Growth or contractions in population size leave characteristic signatures in mtDNA that can be studied by comparing different sequence diversity estimates among populations. I applied this method to the species studied. Significant differences in nucleotide diversities indicated restrictions in gene flow among populations in all species studied. Half of the Siberian jay populations gave a signal of population size bottleneck. All the species studied showed differences in their population genetic structures across their entire distribution ranges consistent with the multirefugia model, most likely to be attributable to differences in their ecological characteristics and Pleistocene histories...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>tit</b> is a {{northern}} taiga species and a habitat specialist. There {{is a small}} population in South Norway, with a limited range in northern parts of Hedmark county and adjoining areas in Oppland and Sør‐Trøndelag counties. The Finnish population declined considerably {{in the latter half}} of the 1900 s as a result of clear‐cutting of forest. Little new information about the South Norwegian population has been obtained since Bengtson & Sonerud (1991) published their review of population status and trends up to the 1980 s. In the present study, a line‐transect census was carried out along a total length of 314 km of suitable biotope. The aim was to obtain up‐to‐date information on population status and, in the event that there had been a decline, whether this could be due to forestry or to more intense interspecific competition as a result of climate change and/or winter feeding by humans. Only five <b>Siberian</b> <b>tit</b> territories were found, while 191, 38 and 109 territories respectively were recorded for willow tit, crested tit and great tit. The census also indicated that the range of the <b>Siberian</b> <b>tit</b> has shrunk over the past 30 years, becoming restricted to three core areas: around the northern half of Lake Femunden, Aumdalen and Folldal. Some areas that were censused in the late 1970 s, were recensused during the present study, and no Siberian tits were found in areas where the species previously made up 9 % of the avian community. The proportion of willow and great tits was considerably higher than in the late 1970 s. Analyses showed little difference between the tit species in habitat choice. Nor was there any tendency for Siberian tits to be observed at higher elevations than previously, which would be a probable response to climate change. Bengtson & Sonerud (1991) estimated that the <b>Siberian</b> <b>tit</b> population in South Norway was at least 1000 pairs in the late 1970 s. On the basis of the new census, it is estimated that the population is now roughly 70 – 140 pairs, which corresponds to a population decline of 86 – 93 %. This may be linked to the general decline that has been observed in the Swedish population during roughly the same period. Possible reasons suggested for the population decline are a combination of felling of old‐growth forest and more intense competition with other species of tits, which could in turn be a result of milder winters and more winter feeding. The thesis discusses possible management measures in response to the decline. Lappmeis er en nordlig taigaart og en habitatspesialist. Den sørnorske populasjonen er liten, og utbredelsen begrenser seg til de nordlige delene av Hedmark med tilgrensende områder i Oppland og Sør‐Trøndelag. Den finske bestanden har gått kraftig tilbake på siste halvdel av 1900 –tallet på grunn av hogst. Det er lite ny kunnskap om den sør‐norske bestanden siden Bengtson & Sonerud (1991) sin oppsummering av status fram til 1980 ‐tallet. For å få ny kunnskap om bestandsutviklingen, og om årsaken til en eventuell nedgang i bestanden kan skyldes hogst eller økt interspesifikk konkurranse grunnet klimaendringer og/eller vinterfôringer, takserte vi 314 kilometer i egnet biotop. Vi fant 5 territorier av lappmeis, mens for granmeis, toppmeis og kjøttmeis fant vi henholdsvis 191, 38 og 109 territorier. Lappmeisens utbredelse hadde også i løpet av de siste 30 årene krympet mot tre gjenværende kjerneområder i Femundstraktene, Aumdalen og Folldal. Også retakseringer av områder som ble undersøkt på slutten av 1970 –tallet, viste at lappmeis ikke ble observert i områder hvor den utgjorde 9 % av fuglesamfunnet tidligere. I den samme perioden hadde andel av granmeis og kjøttmeis økt nokså betydelig. Analyser viste også at det var liten forskjell i habitatvalg mellom meiseartene. Med hensyn til eventuelle klimaendringer viste analysene også at det var ingen trend på at lappmeisfunn lå høyere over havet nå enn før. På slutten av 1970 –tallet var bestandsestimatet fra Bengtson & Sonerud (1991) minst 1000 par. I dag anslår vi en bestandsstørrelse på omtrent 70 – 140 par. Lappmeisens nedgang i bestanden vil etter dette være på 86 – 93 %. Nedgangen kan relateres til en generell bestandsnedgang i Sverige i omtrent samme periode. Vi antar at bestandsnedgangen kan skyldes en kombinasjon av avvirkning av eldre skog og økt konkurranse fra andre meiser, som igjen kan skyldes både mildere vintre og økt fôring om vinteren. Mulige forvaltningstiltak blir diskutert...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Mitochondrial DNA {{sequences}} {{were used}} to study the phylogeny, population structure and colonisation history of Parus species. The phylogenetic relationships of seven European and three American species were examined by sequencing {{a part of the}} cytochrome b gene. Phylogenetically the closest species were the great tit (Parus major) and the blue tit (P. caeruleus). Subgenus Poecile was divided into two clades, one consisting of the <b>Siberian</b> <b>tit</b> (P. cinctus), the Carolina chickadee (P. carolinensis) and the Black-capped chickadee (P. atricapillus) and the other consisting of the marsh tit (P. palustris) and the willow tit (P. montanus). The coal tit (P. ater) and the crested tit (P. cristatus) did not group with any of the species studied. The population structure and the colonisation history of the willow tit, the great tit and the blue tit were examined by using control region sequences. The results suggest that the historical effective population size in the willow tit has been large and not contracted by the last ice age. Current gene flow must also be extensive as no population structuring was detected. No population structuring was evident either in the great tit and the populations showed distinctive signs of a recent population expansion. The patterns of genetic variation probably reflect a population bottleneck during the ice age, and a recolonisation of the European continent thereafter, presumably from a refugium situated in the Balkans. Two maternal lineages were found in the blue tit. The southern lineage was restricted to the Iberian peninsula whereas the northern lineage was detected from all the populations. The colonisation history has been similar to the one suggested for the great tit. The southern lineage, however, may have survived the ice age in a different refugium in the Iberian peninsula and was not as successful as the northern lineage in colonising available regions when the ice retreated. Both, the blue tit and the great tit have continued to expand their distribution northwards during this century and gene flow {{plays an important role in}} homogenising the populations...|$|E
