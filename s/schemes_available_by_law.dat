In order for the Department to provide water allocations among competing uses and users, it asked the Klamath and other Indian Tribes to consult with the Bureau of Reclamation over future allocations. A memorandum of understanding solidified this relationship. When the Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs filed claims {{on behalf of the}} Klamath Tribe in Oregon to allocate water rights, the two exchanged written memoranda on the appropriate scope of the claims submitted by the Government {{for the benefit of the}} Tribe. Afterwards, the Klamath Water Users Protective Association, a nonprofit group whose members receive water from the Project and, generally, have interests adverse to the tribal interest because of the scarcity of water, filed requests with the Bureau under the Freedom of Information Act to gain access to communications between the Bureau and the Basin Tribes. Some documents were turned over, but the Bureau held other documents under the deliberative process privileges incorporated in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Exemption 5, which exempts from disclosure [...] "inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be <b>available</b> <b>by</b> <b>law</b> to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."

The U.S. Marine Corps evaluated the MICH during its own search for a PASGT replacement, but chose to adopt a helmet that retains the profile of the PASGT, known as the Lightweight Helmet, which incorporates improvements in the MICH such as the liner and retention system. However, marines in some activities, primarily shipboard, have been photographed wearing MICH-like helmets. MICH helmets are <b>available</b> for purchase <b>by</b> <b>law</b> enforcement agencies and the public. They have become popular with various SWAT units and private security companies for the very same reasons the MICH supplanted the PASGT: weight, modularity, comfort, and situational awareness.|$|R

It has changed ATMA’s academic orientation and it includes the introduction and active use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT). It also describes the evolution of the construction of a series of digital databases relating to Malay World Studies, the one and only on-line Malay World Studies database available in the world today that has more than 22, 000 single-text articles on various aspects of the Malay world written in a number of languages gathered from a number of resources. Besides, ATMA has also built a number of other digital databases, including on pantun and peribahasa, all of which could be reached at URL www. atma. ukm. my. The underpinning concept of and the motivation that has propelled the project shall be described too including the technical aspect. The challenges that ATMA has to confront in the whole effort shall be outlined, and the possible one on our way to reach the 50, 000 single-text articles target.

40|$|OGLE III and MOA II are {{discovering}} 600 - 1000 Galactic Bulge microlens events each year. This stretches {{the resources available}} for intensive follow-up monitoring of the lightcurves in search of anomalies caused by planets near the lens stars. We advocate optimizing microlens planet searches by using an automatic prioritization algorithm based on the planet detection zone area probed by each new data point. This optimization scheme takes account of the telescope and detector characteristics, observing overheads, sky conditions, and the time available for observing on each night. The predicted brightness and magnification of each microlens target is estimated <b>by</b> fitting to <b>available</b> data points. The optimisation scheme then yields a decision on which targets to observe and which to skip, and a recommended exposure time for each target, designed to maximize the planet detection capability of the observations. The optimal strategy maximizes detection of planet anomalies, and must be coupled with rapid data reduction to trigger continuous follow-up of anomalies that are thereby found. A web interface makes the <b>scheme</b> <b>available</b> for use <b>by</b> human or robotic observers at any telescope. We also outline a possible self-organising scheme that may be suitable for coordination of microlens observations by a heterogeneous telescope network.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{financial markets}} with agents exposed to external sources of risk caused for example by short term climate {{events such as}} the South Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies widely known under the name El Nino. Since such risks cannot be hedged through investments on the capital market alone, we face a typical example of an incomplete financial market. In order to make this risk tradable, we use a financial market model in which an additional insur-ance asset provides another possibility of investment besides the usual capital market. Given one of many possible market prices of risk each agent can maxi-mize his individual exponential utility from his income obtained from trading in the capital market, the additional security, and his risk exposure function. Under the equilibrium market clearing condition for the insurance security the market price of risk is uniquely determined by a backward stochastic differential equa-tion. We translate these stochastic equations via the Feynman-Kac formalism into semi-linear parabolic partial differential equations. Numerical <b>schemes</b> are <b>available</b> <b>by</b> which these semilinear pde can be simulated. We choose two simple qualitatively interesting models to describe sea surface temperature, and with an ENSO risk exposed fisher and farmer and a climate risk neutral bank three model agents with simple risk exposure functions. By simulating the expected appreciation price of risk trading, the optimal utility of the agents as a function of temperature, and their optimal investment into the risk trading security we obtain first insight into the dynamics of such a market in simple situations...|$|R
