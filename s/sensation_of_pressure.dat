These modality domains exhibit an organization that is unlike the discontinuous modality maps in visual area V 2 but more like the continuous visual orientation maps in V 1.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the {{development}} of a Tactile Vest, a wearable, torso-based haptic device. The tactor for the Tactile Vest was designed and built based on NiTi shape memory alloys. Four of these tactors were manufactured to form a 2 x 2 and 4 x 1 array, and tested for use in a wearable device. The tactors are self-contained, and are 42 mm x 22 mm x 17 mm. The tactors were able to generate a mean of 133 kPa in pressure, which is over twice the touch threshold of the torso, and the tactor pin contacting the skin was able to displace 3 mm at a bandwidth of 0. 3 Hz. The tactor array was attached to a fitting garment, and preliminary tests were conducted.

40|$|Objective: Cryotherapy is {{commonly}} used to treat orthopedic pain because it induces numbness. Longer and colder immersion treatments result in greater numbness. We were unable to find numbness data for other cryotherapy modes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare numbness, cold discomfort, and skin temperature in uninjured ankles using ice bag and cold water immersion therapies. Design and Settings: A 2 x 6 repeated measures design guided this laboratory study. Independent variables were cryotherapy mode (20 minute 1 °Cold water immersion & 20 minute, 1 kg, ice bag application) and time (1 min pre-treatment & 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 min post-treatment). Dependent variables were cold discomfort (visual analog scale), skin temperature (OC), and <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> (Monofilaments, grams of pressure). Subjects: Twenty, healthy college students (M: 6 F: 14, age: 20. 6 yrs, ht: 162 cm, wt: 63. 2 kg) volunteered. Subject exclusion criteria included: allergies to cold (including Raynaud's phenomenon), cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, abnormal sensation in their extremities, or lower extremity injury in the last 6 months. Measurements: We measured discomfort with a 10 em visual analog scale; skin, room and water temperatures with Copperconstant thermocouples connected to an Iso-Thermex unit; and <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> with Semmes-Weinstein nylon monofilaments. Measurements were taken 1 min pre-, and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 min post-treatment. Subjects were treated with a 20 minute ice bag application or ice water immersion (1 °C) on 2 days separated by a minimum of 24 hours. Treatment order was randomized. Group means and standard deviations were calculated for each time. A repeated measures ANOV A determined differences and Tukey-Kramer comparisons located those differences. Our P-level was. 05. Results: For both treatments, sensation was reduced at 2 min post-treatment (5. 7 ± 4. 3 g) compared to 1 min pre-, 4, 6, 8, & 10 min-post (3. 6 ± 2. 1 g; 3. 7 ± 2. 1 g; 3. 2 ± 1. 8 g; 3. 3 ± 1. 7 g; 3. 0 ± 1. 9 g respectfully) (FS, 9 S= 13. 94, P<. OOOOI; Tukey-Kramer <. 05). For both conditions, skin temperature was lowest at 2 and 4 min post-immersion (11. 2 ± 1. 5 °C, 12. 6 ± 3. 1 °C, respectfully) (FS. 9 S= 6. 38, P=. 00004; Tukey-Kramer, p<. 05). There was more discomfort at 2 min post-immersion (17. 5 ± 23. 5 mm) than all other pre-and post-ice bag and immersion measurements, except for 4 min post-immersion (12. 7 ± 19. 1 mm) (Fs. 9 s= 5. 93, p=. 00008). Conclusions: Decreases in skin temperature are related to sensation loss for both conditions. Immersion is more uncomfortable than ice bag treatment, and both are most uncomfortable at 2 min post-treatment. Despite differences in temperature decreases, both cryotherapy treatments caused numbness. Ice bag treatments appear to induce numbness without as much discomfort as immersion treatment.

50|$|Chest pain is {{the most}} common symptom of acute {{myocardial}} infarction and is often described as a <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> tightness, <b>pressure,</b> or squeezing. Pain radiates most often to the left arm, but may also radiate to the lower jaw, neck, right arm, back, and upper abdomen. The pain most suggestive of an acute MI, with the highest likelihood ratio, is pain radiating to the right arm and shoulder. Similarly, chest pain similar to a previous heart attack is also suggestive. The pain associated with MI is usually diffuse, does not change with position, and lasts for more than 20 minutes. Levine's sign, in which a person localizes the chest pain by clenching one or both fists over their sternum, has classically been thought to be predictive of cardiac chest pain, although a prospective observational study showed it had a poor positive predictive value. Pain that responds to nitroglycerin does not indicate {{the presence or absence of}} a myocardial infarction.|$|R
40|$|Wind {{turbines}} generate {{low frequency}} sounds {{that affect the}} ear. The ear is superficially similar to a microphone, converting mechanical sound waves into electrical signals, but does this by complex physiologic processes. Serious misconceptions about low frequency sound and the ear have resulted from a failure to consider in detail how the ear works. Although the cells that provide hearing are relatively insensitive to infrasound, other sensory cells in the ear are much more sensitive, which can be demonstrated by electrical recordings. Responses to infrasound reach the brain through pathways that do not involve conscious hearing, but instead may produce <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> fullness, <b>pressure,</b> tinnitus or have no <b>sensation.</b> Activation <b>of</b> subconscious pathways by infrasound could disturb sleep. Based on our current knowledge of how the ear works, {{it is quite possible}} that low frequency sounds at the levels generated by wind turbines could affect those living nearby.

40|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} {{considered}} to be reaching epidemic proportions where obese children tend to become obese adults. As obese individuals have increased mass they are at greater risk of developing musculoskeletal dysfunction, which may in tum alter quality of life. One main musculoskeletal concern is the feet of obese individuals, as the feet are the foundation for stance and gait. Musculoskeletal foot pathologies have not been widely investigated in relation to childhood obesity. However, previous research has found a general trend for obese children to have flatfeet and generate higher pressures under the forefoot during gait. These high pressures in the forefoot region have potentially serious negative consequences and urgently need to be further investigated. At present, it is unknown to what extent these flatfeet and higher pressures in the forefoot region can alter foot function. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to assess foot structure and function, foot sensation and plantar pressure distributions in both an obese and non-obese sample of children aged 6 to 12 years. Sixty-five consenting 6 to 12 year olds participated in the assessment of foot structure, function, <b>sensation</b> and plantar <b>pressure.</b> <b>Of</b> the sample tested, 10 children classified as obese according to BMI for age and gender criteria and 10 non-obese children matched for age, height and gender participated as subjects.

The mark of bodily ownership FREDERIQUE DE VIGNEMONT When I touch the table, I have a <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> on my hand. My tactile sensation includes sensations of resistance, texture and temperature, {{as well as the}} sensation of the hand location where the pressure occurs. But does it also include a distinctive experience of the hand as of my own? I am aware that this hand is mine. But is the sense of ownership of my hand manifested to me in a more primitive form than beliefs or judgements? Is there an experi-ence of ownership independent of the judgement of ownership at the doxastic level (for a similar distinction within the sense of agency, see Bayne and Pacherie 2007) ? Bermúdez (2011) has recently argued in favour of a defla-tionary account of the sense of ownership, according to which there is noth-ing it feels like to experience one’s body as of one’s own. On his view, the sense of ownership is exclusively judgemental; it has no counterpart at the experiential level. To some extent, Martin (1992, 1995) defends a similar view, according to which there is no distinctive positive phenomenology of ownership as such, no felt ‘myness ’ that goes over and above the mere ex-perience of one’s bodily properties. In his view, bodily experiences are the be-all and end-all of the sense of ownership. On the deflationary conception of ownership the sense of ownership consists, first, in certain facts about the phenomenology of bodily sen-sations and, secondly, in certain fairly obvious judegments about the body (which we can term judgements of ownership).

40|$|Abstract Background Hwa-byung, a Korean culture-bound {{syndrome}} {{with both}} psychological and somatic symptoms, {{is also known}} as ‘anger syndrome’. It includes various physical symptoms including anxiety, a feeling of overheating, a <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> on the chest, heart palpitations, respiratory stuffiness, insomnia, and anxiety. Methods/design The proposed study is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial with two parallel arms: an oriental medicine music therapy (OMMT) group and a control music therapy (CMT) group. In total, 48 patients will be enrolled into the trial. The first visit will be the screening visit. At baseline (visit 2), all participants fulfilling both the inclusion and the exclusion criteria will be split and randomly divided into two equal groups: the OMMT and the CMT (n = 24 each). Each group will receive treatment sessions over the course of 4 weeks, twice per week, for eight sessions in total. The primary outcome is the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the secondary outcomes are the Hwa-byung scale (H-scale), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Hwa-byung visual analogue scale (H-VAS) for primary symptoms, the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale, brief version (WHOQOL-BREF), and levels of salivary cortisol. Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires at the baseline visit (visit 2), after the last treatment session (visit 9), and at 4 weeks after the end of all trial sessions (visit 10). From the baseline (visit 2) through the follow-up (visit 10), the entire process will take a total of 53 days. Discussion This proposed study targets patients with Hwa-byung, especially those who have exhibited symptoms of anxiety. Therefore, the primary outcome is set to measure the level of anxiety. OMMT is music therapy combined with traditional Korean medicinal theories. Unlike previously reported music therapies, for which patients simply listen to music passively, in OMMT, patients actively move their bodies and play the music. Because Hwa-byung is caused by an accumulation of blocked emotions and anger inside the body, OMMT, because of its active component, is expected to be more efficacious than pre-existing music therapies.

40|$|CONTEXTO: A doença {{arterial}} obstrutiva periférica (DAOP) se destaca por deteriorar a qualidade de vida dos pacientes, quando associada a elevado risco de eventos cardiovasculares e cerebrovasculares. O diagnóstico clínico é sensível e específico, por meio do índice tornozelo-braquial (ITB), que, se precocemente detectado, otimiza o controle dos fatores de risco. OBJETIVO: Avaliar a percepção da DAOP em pacientes classe I ou II de Fontaine assistidos pela Estratégia de Saúde da Família em Pará de Minas (MG), analisando características socioeconômicas e determinantes da qualidade de vida. MÉTODOS: Após cálculo amostral estratificado por gênero e idade, um questionário elaborado para o estudo foi respondido por 123 indivíduos com diagnóstico de DAOP classe I ou II de Fontaine. Para as associações, utilizaram-se testes do c² e exato de Fisher (p BACKGROUND: The peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) {{is characterized}} by the deterioration in {{the quality of life of}} patients when associated with high risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. The clinical diagnosis is sensitive and specific, by means of the Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI), and, when there is early detection, the control of risk factors is optimized. OBJECTIVE: To assess the perception of PAOD in Fontaine class I or II patients by means of the Family Health Strategy in Pará de Minas (MG), Brazil, through an analysis of the socioeconomic characteristics and life quality determinants. METHODS: After the sample calculation, stratified by genre and age, a questionnaire elaborated for the purposes of this study was applied to 123 individuals who were diagnosed with Fontaine class I or II PAOD. Aiming at the associations, the c² and Fisher's exact tests were used (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Among the participants who answered to the questionnaire, 96 (78 %) were women and had low schooling. An association between intermittent claudication, the most common symptom, and the <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> on the legs, cramps, foot paresthesia, fatigue, swelling, and tingling was observed. There was no association with smoking, systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes and cholesterol alterations. Among the participants, 76 (61. 8 %) had never heard about the disease despite the fact that they had it. Pain during activities at home or elsewhere was reported by 48 individuals (39 %). The practice of physical activities was more recommended by clinicians - mentioned by 18 (14. 6 %) individuals - and walking, the only activity that was practiced according to the recommended levels, was reported by 102 participants (27. 7 %). CONCLUSION: This population needs to be better oriented about the clinical and non-pharmacological treatment intended to the control of irreversible chronic manifestations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the feasibility of quantifying pressure-related socket discomfort by using psychophysical methods. The first experiment involved the application <b>of</b> known uniform <b>pressure</b> to the residual limbs of three transtibial amputees. Category ratio scales were used to measure <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure,</b> pain, and perceived discomfort. The second experiment involved altering the geometry at the fibula head and distal tibia of the subjects’ fitted PTB sockets with wafers of varying thickness and use of the same three scales to measure response to the variations in local point-specific <b>pressures.</b> Two <b>of</b> the subjects had more than 32 years of experience with PTB sockets, whereas the third subject had just been fitted with a temporary prosthesis. Results indicated that response functions for global uniform pressure varied among the subjects but were similar for the modifications at specific locations. Both experienced amputees reported constant pressure sensations between 10 and 40 mm Hg of applied uniform global pressure, whereas the inexperienced subject reported a linear increase in pressure sensation over the same range. Pressure and discomfort sensations appeared to be isolated subjectively and assigned different magnitudes among subjects, creating unique response functions for each subject. Possible explanations for unique uniform global pressure response functions could involve years of experience using a PTB socket, residual limb tissue thickness, and morphology or the way in which the amputation surgery was performed. For pressure variations at the fibula head and distal tibia, pressure sensation and perceived discomfort were highly correlated and appeared not to be distinct sensations. Response functions were similar among subjects. Psychophysical measurement could be adapted for use in a clinical setting during the fitting process and offer researchers additional tools for evaluating alternative socket designs and materials. The methods permit the patient to communicate discomfort sensations more precisely and provide the prosthetist with additional insight into the patient’s perception of quality of socket fit...|$|R

We represent the haptic model using the shape-retaining chain link (or S-Chain) framework for a fast and stable computation of the contact force and distributed pressure from a volumetric virtual object. In addition, we developed a compact pin-array type of tactile display unit and attached it to PHANToM TM haptic device to complement each other. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, related experiments have been conducted with non-homogenous volumetric cubic objects consisting of approximately 500, 000 volume elements at a haptic update rate of 1000 Hz. The experimental results show that compared to the point-contact the area-contact provides the users with more precise perception of the shape and softness of the object’s composition, and that our proposed system satisfies the real-time and realism constraints to be useful for virtual reality applications. ...|$|R
