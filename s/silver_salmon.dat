25|$|Historically, in late May {{and early}} June, Nez Perce villagers crowded to {{communal}} fishing sites to trap eels, steelhead, and chinook salmon, or haul in fish with large dip nets. Fishing took place {{throughout the summer}} and fall, first on the lower streams {{and then on the}} higher tributaries, and catches also included salmon, sturgeon, whitefish, suckers, and varieties of trout. Most of the supplies for winter use came from a second run in the fall, when large numbers of Sockeye <b>salmon,</b> <b>silver,</b> and dog <b>salmon</b> appeared in the rivers.|$|R

25|$|Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) {{are also}} {{known in the}} US as <b>silver</b> <b>salmon.</b> This species is found {{throughout}} the coastal waters of Alaska and British Columbia and {{as far south as}} Central California (Monterey Bay). It is also now known to occur, albeit infrequently, in the Mackenzie River.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{populations have}} been {{established}} in all the Great Lakes. Coho stocks were planted {{by the state of}} Michigan in the late 1960s to control the growing population of non-native alewife. Now Chinook (king), Atlantic, and coho (<b>silver)</b> <b>salmon</b> are annually stocked in all Great Lakes by most bordering states and provinces. These populations are not self-sustaining and do not provide {{much in the way of}} a commercial fishery, but have led to the development of a thriving sport fishery.|$|E
25|$|The many mountains, {{streams and}} rivers form a major {{spawning}} ground for several species of trout and salmon; yet recently, in the last 50 years, some of the fish stocks have fallen drastically, particularly salmon stocks. The ecoregion's rivers and streams are home to nine species of native salmonids. The depletions occur mainly because dams and clearcutting on the rugged slopes of the area contribute to large amounts of silt in the stream beds, which in turn interfere with spawning salmon, as they lay their eggs in exposed gravel beds. The notable fish species are king, kokanee, and <b>silver</b> <b>salmon,</b> brown, brook, and rainbow trout (including steelhead), and crappie, bluegill, catfish, and largemouth and smallmouth bass.|$|E

Each year, the Coleman National Fish Hatchery alone produces 600, 000 yearling steelhead smolts and releases them into Battle Creek, {{a tributary of the}} upper Sacramento River. Smolts are young, <b>silver</b> trout (or <b>salmon)</b> that are ready to migrate to sea for the first time.

From introduction: This {{report is}} {{intended}} to present a resume of the fish passage facilities used, the methods of operation, and problems encountered during construction of Ice Harbor Dam. Large runs of chinook salmon and steelhead trout, with lesser numbers of <b>silver</b> and blueback <b>salmon,</b> were the principal anadromous species present. An even larger total number of resident species also had {{to be considered in}} the design. Chinook salmon migrate into the Snake River from April through October in three main runs which peak in early May, late June, and September.

25|$|Historically, in Alaska, {{hand hook}} and line {{trolling}} {{were used to}} catch king and <b>silver</b> <b>salmon</b> in salt water. This method required minimal gear-boat, lines and hooksâ€”and was used to catch fish that were still feeding in open water before returning to spawn. Trolling was very successful in southeast Alaska and historically the catch {{was used by the}} fresh and mild-cured fish packing industries. Power boats located near feeding grounds conducted most of the trolling. Each boat had four to ten lines, extending from tall poles hung outboard when fishing; each line carried several hooks, with heavy lead sinkers and spoons or baits as lures. Trolling lengthened the fishing season, allowing fishermen to fish in early spring before spawning runs.|$|E
25|$|Several of Redoubt's recent explosions have {{resulted}} in measurable ash fall over populated areas as distant as Delta Junction (340 miles northeast of Redoubt), with more significant ash fall in more proximate areas, including the Susitna Valley, the Kenai Peninsula and the Anchorage bowl. On the afternoon of March 28, ash fall in Anchorage closed the airport from 17:00 until 07:00 the next morning (March 29). The maximum ash fall measured so far in a populated area is about 1/16 inch (1.5mm) near Seldovia following the April 4 explosion. A measurement of about 1/8 inch (3mm) following the explosion on March 26, was recorded near <b>Silver</b> <b>Salmon</b> Creek Lodge, about 30 miles (48km) south of the volcano. Trace ash fall has also been observed between explosive events during times when the volcano is emitting a continuous low altitude (< 15,000 feet ASL) gas and ash plume.|$|E
25|$|Wrist-length mittens {{used to be}} {{commonly}} made of seal or caribou {{skin with}} the fur and the rough edge of the seam on the outside. Sealskin mittens were frequently made from leftover pieces of skin after boots were cut from them. The back and palm were separate pieces and the thumb one piece; gloves were unknown. Women wore fur mittens reaching nearly to the elbow with wolverine trim along the upper edge. Mittens of <b>silver</b> <b>salmon</b> skins which reached to the elbow were worn by men when hunting in a kayak in spring. The fish were cut down the back and the belly skins used for mittens. These sometimes were lined with grass or had grass mittens, woven all in one piece, inside; often they had a border of bleached sealskin. The combination of fish skin mittens with grass padding was less bulky for paddling than fur mittens. According to Curtis (1930, p.11), mittens of dehaired sealskin that reached barely to the wrist were also worn by men in the spring.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} support the historical presence of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in San Francisquito Creek. Archaeological remains of unspecified salmonids ("possibly coho") {{were reported by}} Gobalet in the creek. Leidy concluded that coho salmon were likely present and cited that the most suitable habitat for coho salmon was in perennial, well shaded reaches of mainstem San Francisquito Creek, and several small, perennial tributaries including Los Trancos, Corte Madera, Bear, and West Union creeks.

500|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray feeds mainly on bony fishes, including anchovies, herring, hake, mackerel, croakers, rockfishes, surfperches, kelp bass, and flatfishes, {{but will also}} take cephalopods and invertebrates given the opportunity. Its jaws are highly distensible, allowing it to swallow surprisingly large prey: one female [...] long has been observed ingesting a <b>silver</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus kisutch) nearly half her length. During the day, the Pacific {{electric ray}} is an ambush predator: when a fish approaches its head, the ray [...] "jumps" [...] forward from its resting place and folds down its disc to envelop it, while delivering strong shocks. Once the fish is subdued, the ray repositions itself to swallow it head-first. The entire process takes about two minutes.|$|E
500|$|In June 1964 the Natural Resources Council asked Stephen H. Spurr, {{dean of the}} Graduate School of the University of Michigan and an {{authority}} on forestry and forest ecology, to form a group to evaluate the proposed Rampart Dam. The Spurr report determined that the scenarios offered as justification for the project were overly optimistic with respect to Alaskaâ€™s projected long-term population growth, its per capita use of electricity, and the predicted rate of entry of electroprocess industries like the aluminum industry (which had substantial power requirements) into Alaska. Moreover, the proposed dam would have greatly reduced the catch of five species of Pacific salmon, especially the chinook (king), chum (dog) and coho (<b>silver)</b> <b>salmon.</b> It would also eliminate vast numbers of migratory waterfowl, including an estimated 1.5 million ducks and 12,500 geese that migrated annually from the Yukon flats. [...] There would also have been {{a sharp decline in}} both large mammals - the moose, black and grizzly bear, and caribou - and smaller mammals: [...] muskrats, mink, beavers, and river otters in aquatic habitats, and marten, wolverines, weasels, lynx, snowshoe hares, red fox and red squirrels in terrestrial or upland habitats. Spurrâ€™s report noted: [...] "is a truism of wildlife ecology that displacement of a population from the area where it normally lives is tantamount to eliminating it completely. Adjoining habitats ordinarily are carrying all the wildlife that the local resources will support. In short, loss of habitat is synonymous with loss of the animal population supported by the inundated habitat." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Growing {{interest}} in fancy hen breeding motivates people undertake more research into {{assessment of their}} production traits. The purpose {{of this research is}} to assess the quality of eggs and results of hatch of three hen breeds: partridge italian, <b>silver</b> brahma, and <b>salmon</b> faverolle. Eggs were assessed in three periods of laying. Hatching was carried out with the use of eggs from the period of production peak. The qualities of eggs changed according to the period of the production. The biggest differences were found in terms of the color and height of yolk, the weight of albu-men and yolk and the eggshell thickness. Among the considered breeds of hens were found statistically significant differences for the egg shape index and the albumen and shell weight. Eggs of italian partridge were characterized by the highest statistically significant weight of albumen and index of shape (35. 99 g and 75. 58 %), whereas the smallest were observed for brahms (33. 33 g and 72. 21 %). Fertilization of italian hen eggs was 97. 8 % and of feverolle 100 %. Also a high percentage share of healthy hat-ched chickens from fertilized and set eggs was observed.

Fish skin parkas in the past were worn by both men and women when hunting and traveling. In winter they were worn over a fur parka just as cloth covers have been in more recent times. A Yukon fish skin parka made of dog salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) skin. Nunivaarmiut men wore parkas made of <b>silver</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus kisutch) skin, while those of women were made of salmon trout (charr) (Salvelinus malma) skin and often had a white fox ruff on the hood.

2500|$|Traditionally, {{most people}} {{continued}} to make tepa in the summer. Heads (pakegvissaaq is head of fish including pectoral fins) of chinook (king), sokeye (red), chum (dog), and occasionally, coho (<b>silver)</b> <b>salmon</b> were prepared by burying them {{in the ground and}} allowed them to ferment before eating. The traditional way to prepare tepa was to bury the heads in the ground along with most of the fish guts in a wooden barrel covered with burlap material. Earthern pits lined with grass were used for this process. Salmon milt and eggs were added to the heads which were then covered with another layer of grass before being covered over with earth. The fermenting process took from one to two weeks depending on temperature of the ground. One salmon production unit prepared four pits of tepa. The pits measured approximately 18 inches deep and 2 feet square and contained approximately 75 salmon heads each. The heads of 1,000 chinook, 726 sockeye, 1,246 chum, and 41 coho salmon were prepared as tepa by Kwethluk households during 1986. One resident told the researchers, [...] "to the Native it's like candy or bubblegum, sweet and sour, in between the two." [...] However, with the introduction of plastic buckets, the danger of botulism has surfaced and informants stressed the importance of avoiding these types of modern containers since the [...] "oldfashioned" [...] methods allowed oxygen to circulate and prevented the growth of bacteria which causes botulism. Heads stored underground in plastic bags are more likely to develop botulism than fish stored in grasses. It was soon discovered that the traditional method of preparing the tepas was safer than the modern way.|$|E
