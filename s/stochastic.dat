5|$|If {{the state}} space is the {{integers}} or natural numbers, then the <b>stochastic</b> process {{is called a}} discrete or integer-valued <b>stochastic</b> process. If the state space is the real line, then the <b>stochastic</b> process {{is referred to as}} a real-valued <b>stochastic</b> process or a process with continuous state space. If the state space is -dimensional Euclidean space, then the <b>stochastic</b> process is called a -dimensional vector process or -vector process.|$|E
5|$|A <b>stochastic</b> or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a {{collection}} of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the <b>stochastic</b> process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a <b>stochastic</b> process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A <b>stochastic</b> process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a <b>stochastic</b> process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
5|$|After World War II {{the study}} of {{probability}} theory and <b>stochastic</b> processes gained more attention from mathematicians, with signification contributions made {{in many areas of}} probability and mathematics as well as the creation of new areas. Starting in the 1940s, Kiyosi Itô published papers developing the field of <b>stochastic</b> calculus, which involves <b>stochastic</b> integrals and <b>stochastic</b> differential equations based on the Wiener or Brownian motion process.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to apply}} the neuro-fuzzy {{technique}} to refine the <b>Stochastics</b> technical trading rules to forecast the Asian stock market. Essentially in this hybrid technique, fuzzy logic plays the role to formulate the relationship among the <b>Stochastics</b> indicators and stock price changes by using knowledge base. Neural networking is used to tune the formulated knowledge base based on historical data. The empirical results show that this hybrid technique could capture the relationship among the <b>Stochastics</b> indicators and stock price changes very effectively.

5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time <b>stochastic</b> process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a <b>stochastic</b> process, {{it is assumed that}} the sample functions of the <b>stochastic</b> process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the separability assumption, but such a <b>stochastic</b> process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E
5|$|If a continuous-time real-valued <b>stochastic</b> process meets certain moment {{conditions}} on its increments, then the Kolmogorov continuity theorem {{says that there}} exists a modification of this process that has continuous sample paths with probability one, so the <b>stochastic</b> process has a continuous modification or version. The theorem can also be generalized to random fields so the index set is -dimensional Euclidean space {{as well as to}} <b>stochastic</b> processes with metric spaces as their state spaces.|$|E

5|$|Skorokhod {{function}} {{spaces are}} frequently {{used in the}} theory of <b>stochastic</b> processes because it often assumed that the sample functions of continuous-time <b>stochastic</b> processes belong to a Skorokhod space. Such spaces contain continuous functions, which correspond to sample functions of the Wiener process. But the space also has functions with discontinuities, which means that the sample functions of <b>stochastic</b> processes with jumps, such as the Poisson process (on the real line), are also members of this space.|$|E
