50|$|The Tweel {{consists}} of a band of conventional tire rubber with molded tread, a <b>shear</b> <b>beam</b> just below the tread that creates a compliant contact patch, a series of energy-absorbing polyurethane spokes, and an integral inner rim structure. Both the <b>shear</b> <b>beam</b> and the polyurethane spokes can be {{designed to provide a}} calibrated directional stiffness in order that design engineers are able to control both how the Tweel handles and how it handles loads. The inner hub structure may be either rigid or compliant, depending on the application requirements, and as such may contain a matrix of deformable plastic structures that flex under load and subsequently return to their original shape. By varying the thickness and size of the spokes, Michelin can manipulate the design elements to engineer a wide array of ride and handling qualities. The tread can be as specialized as any of today's tires and is replaceable when worn.|$|E

Through the statistical analysis of test data and comparative analysis of the theoretical calculation based on the current standard and the existing calculation model, the size of ultimate strain of bending <b>beam</b> and <b>shearing</b> <b>beam</b> reinforced with FRP was shown. It {{was found that the}} effective strain of most test members was less than the lower limit value of current design code.

Within a well posed analytical framework, the basic equations governing the interaction problem, can be obtained in strong form by a differential formulation based on both the constitutive equation of the Timoshenko beam and the direct and inverse constitutive equation of the supporting local elastic medium. A general finite element is then derived for <b>shear</b> deformable <b>beams</b> with or without a continuous Winkler type elastic support. The obtained analytical results are discussed in the light of nonlocal elasticity of Eringen differential type, applied to an Euler–Bernoulli beam model. As a result the stiffness–matrix and equivalent nodal loads of an Euler–Bernoulli nonlocal elastic beam, can be defined in analogy to those of a first order <b>shear</b> deformable <b>beam.</b> This conclusion allows handling the elastostatic problem of nanobeams, modelled according to Eringen’s nonlocal elasticity, by slight modifications of the existing computational tools for the solution of the elastostatic problem of a local <b>shear</b> deformable <b>beam...</b>|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The Northridge Earthquake of 1994 caused unexpected cracking in the connections of Steel Moment-Resisting Frame (SMRF) buildings. This thesis investigates the possibility that higher-than-expected strain rates in the near-field region of the earthquake were partially responsible for the cracking. A shear-beam model is proposed as possibly a better model for evaluating structural strain rate response for near-held ground motion. The shear-beam model is used to predict seismic response of a 20 -story structure. The results from the <b>shear</b> <b>beam</b> are compared to seismic analysis using a more traditional vibratory model to see if the <b>shear</b> <b>beam</b> predicts higher relative values in the near-field region. It is found that the <b>shear</b> <b>beam</b> does indeed predict higher strain rates. However, the increased stain rates are not limited to the near-field region. The correlation between relative strain rates and epicentral distance is found to be negative-indicating higher relative slain rates in the near-field region-but the magnitude of the correlation is too low to be considered significant. The analysis is repeated with increased damping and it is found that the magnitude of the correlation increases, but is still not significant. Long-period wave forms are analyzed with the <b>shear</b> <b>beam</b> and vibratory models to determine if the band-pass altering of the seismic records could be altering the results. The analysis indicates that the <b>shear</b> <b>beam</b> does not predict response levels that are significantly higher than the vibratory model for long-period wave forms. A truncated (first-mode) modal analysis is conducted to determine how limiting the structure to a single degree of freedom affects results. It is found that the first-mode analysis predicts much lower stain rates than both the shear-beam and complete vibratory models. However, the results do not show significant correlation with epicentral distance. It is concluded that increased slain rate in the near-held region of the Northridge Earthquake was unlikely to have been a significant factor in the observed connection cracking. It also appears that traditional vibratory analysis may underpredict both the strain and the strain rate in seismic response...|$|E

40|$|Although Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) {{composite}} sheets have showed excellent {{results in}} laboratory for strengthening reinforced concrete structures, {{it could not}} get wide popularity in field application cost. To address this problem {{the present study was}} carried out to explore the possibility of using Glass FRP (GFRP) composite sheets which is relatively cheap material. GFRP has relatively low modulus of elasticity and therefore disregarded for strengthening in the past. Active strengthening technique i. e. prestressing was used for maximum utilization of GFRP strength. Prestressing has not only helped in achieving this goal but also improved the behaviour of strengthened member under service load and delayed premature delamination. Long term losses associated with prestressing were also studied and it was found in acceptable range. The research work comprised of both experimental and analytical investigations. The experimental program consisted of testing twenty three (eight flexure and fifteen shear), rectangular section, simply supported reinforced concrete beams. The variables in flexure beams were levels of prestressing, number of GFRP layers, and conventional reinforcement ratio. In <b>shear</b> <b>beams</b> variables were <b>shear</b> span to effective depth (a/d) ratio, number of prestressed GFRP layers, non-prestressed GFRP U-straps and U-jackets. Flexure beams strengthened with prestressed GFRP sheet showed higher increase in flexural capacity and better serviceability behaviour. <b>Shear</b> <b>beams</b> strengthened with prestressed GFRP sheets showed increase in shear capacity. Delay in sheet delamination was noted in prestressed GFRP sheet. Long term retention of prestressing force in GFRP sheets was noted in strengthened beams. An innovative and easy to apply prestressing system was developed in this study. Recommendation was framed for modification in the prestressing system for field application. The analytical tool i. e. Response 2000, used in this study accurately predicts the flexural beam behaviour whereas prediction of shear capacity was underestimated due to ignoring the effect of transverse clamping force on shear capacity. For the rest of <b>shear</b> <b>beams,</b> the model accurately predicted the shear capacity. Comparison of predicted and observed results of <b>shear</b> and flexure <b>beams</b> was carried out and it was concluded that prestressing of GFRP sheet is a useful and economical technique for strengthening of structural members...|$|R

40|$|The {{problems}} of vibration suppression, stabilization, motion planning, and tracking for flexible beams {{are important for}} many practical mechanical systems, such as the cantilevered beam in an atomic force microscope, a solar panel array on a satellite, the boom on a crane, or a structure mounted on a shake table. This work approaches the aforementioned control design problems using two methods; backstepping for partial differential equations (PDEs), and extremum seeking. PDE backstepping {{is a form of}} model reference control for infinite dimensional systems where boundary control is used to make a closed- loop system perform like a target system, which is the reference model with desirable performance characteristics. Infinite dimensional state transformations, relating plant and target systems, are the key to PDE backstepping designs and are used to find the desired boundary controllers. PDE backstepping techniques are presented for motion planning and tracking for the string and <b>shear</b> <b>beam</b> with Kelvin-Voigt (KV) damping, and a combination of PDE backstepping and gain scheduling is presented for extending linear PDE backstepping techniques to stabilization, motion planning, and tracking for the string and <b>shear</b> <b>beam</b> with KV damping and boundary-displacement dependent free-end nonlinearities. Explicit motion planning reference solutions for the <b>shear</b> <b>beam</b> are found, using backstepping transformations, {{as a function of the}} target system reference solution, which itself is a function of the string solution. The string solution is the easiest to find, and is done using traditional motion planning tools. Tracking controllers are found as a combination of vibration suppression and motion planning controllers. Gain scheduling is a method that replaces nonlinear control design with the design of a family of linear controllers. When combined with linear PDE backstepping techniques, it provides a means of extending vibration suppression, stabilization, motion planning and tracking results to the string and <b>shear</b> <b>beam</b> with free-end nonlinearities. Gain scheduling based designs, which produce locally stabilizing controllers parameterized by a function of the nonlinearity, are a more simple and manageable alternative to full-state feedback linearizing nonlinear PDE control designs. Extremum seeking (ES) is a non-model based method used for tuning parameter(s) to optimize an unknown nonlinear map. ES tuning for positive- position-feedback compensators is presented as a method of selecting the parameter(s) of the compensator to improve vibration suppression on a mechanical system forced by a persistent sinusoidal disturbance. ES tuning for motion planning and tracking is presented as a method for tuning the amplitude and phase of a sinusoidal input to a stable linear plant to generate and track a sinusoid of desired amplitude and phase at the outpu...|$|E
