5|$|It {{was also}} {{around this time}} that the Rockets would unveil their classic yellow and red logo and {{accompanying}} uniforms used {{until the end of}} the 1994–95 season. Winter left soon after, being fired in January 1973 following a ten-game losing streak, and was replaced by Johnny Egan. Egan led the Rockets back to the playoffs in 1975, where the franchise also managed to win their first round against the New York Knicks, subsequently losing to the veteran Boston Celtics in 5 games. At that time the Rockets gained popularity in Houston, <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> several home games during the regular season as the Rockets battled for a playoff spot and then <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> all of their home playoff games.|$|E
5|$|Evgeni Malkin scored 106points in {{the regular}} season, helping to offset the gap left while Sidney Crosby was injured.

The Rockets averaged 18,123 spectators during the 2013–14 season, <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> 39 out of the 41 home games. 2014–15 had even better numbers, with 40 sellouts and an average of 18,230 tickets sold.|$|E

5|$|The Barnes Review edition was {{subsequently}} translated into Japanese in 2004 {{by a pair}} of Japanese translators, Hideo Tanaka and Kenkichi Sakita, and became an instant success, <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> 10 successive re-printings before 2007 when it was reissued as a mass market paperback. Gregory Clark noted that the Japanese edition of Ways That Are Dark, which was entitled Ankoku Tairiku Chūgoku no Shinjitsu ("The Truth About the Dark Continent China"), had garnered widespread popularity among members of the Japanese right-wing.|$|E

5|$|The album {{proved to}} be Nas’s most commercially {{successful}} release, debuting at #1 on the US Billboard 200 chart. It also heralded Nas’s mainstream popularity and followed the success of other mafioso rap albums such as Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… (1995) and Reasonable Doubt (1996). However, his stylistic changes and increased mainstream success fostered accusations of <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> within the hip hop community. It remains Nas' best-selling release, with over 2 million copies in the United States alone.|$|E
5|$|Despite having {{completely}} {{dropped out}} of mainstream radio play since 2008, while being relegated almost solely to alternative rock stations in the United Kingdom, Silent Cry reached #8 on the albums chart in its first week of release in 2008 with 16,000 units sold. It has sold less than 50,000 units to date according to Chrysalis, {{the owners of the}} now defunct Echo Label. The subsequent Silent Cry tour was Feeder's longest playing up to 29 different dates, with many <b>selling</b> <b>out.</b> Nevertheless, Silent Cry remains their first album since 1997's Polythene not to achieve at least gold status. The 2010 follow-up Renegades, was less successful only spending two weeks in the chart after entering at #16, while also being their first since the aforementioned Polythene not to chart within the Top 10.|$|E

5|$|Harvard set {{a school}} record by <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> 10 of 12 home games at Lavietes Pavilion (the sellouts came in all seven Ivy League matchups, as well as versus MIT, Saint Joseph's, and George Washington). All five of Harvard's {{starters}} and 12 total players returned from the previous year's championship team, but freshmen accounted for over 22% of minutes played in the 2011-12 season. By sweeping its four games against Massachusetts rivals, Harvard extended an in-state winning streak to 14 games. The program also defeated teams from a record-setting 11 conferences, plus an independent. Other school records set during the season included best Ivy League start and most road wins, with 12. Harvard's 14 non-conference wins {{in the regular season}} tied an Ivy-League record.|$|E
5|$|Progressive Field {{set a new}} MLB record between June 12, 1995 and April 4, 2001 in <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> 455 {{straight}} games. Demand {{for tickets}} {{was so great that}} all 81 home games were sold out before opening day in five separate seasons. The Indians retired the number 455 in honor of the sellout record. The Boston Red Sox later surpassed this record when Fenway Park recorded 456 straight sellouts on September 9, 2008. The record for the largest attendance at Progressive Field was set in Game 3 of the 1997 ALDS when 45,274 people attended the game. On Saturday, April 2, 2011, the Indians' lowest attendance record was broken with a very small crowd of 9,853, and again the following day with an even smaller attendance figure of 8,726.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after their}} debut, the ads {{came under fire}} from several fronts. Fans complained that the legendary {{musician}} was debasing himself by doing the commercials, that he was <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> by allowing his image {{to be used to}} peddle fast food. Other groups such as the American Diabetes Association pointed out that King, known for having weight issues and poorly controlled diabetes, was a questionable spokesperson for a burger chain that sells products that are not part of a healthier diet. Finally, several firms complained off the record that King was inconsistent in his endorsements, selling a highly fattening product while similarly endorsing diabetic products manufactured by the Johnson & Johnson company.|$|E

5|$|The {{concert was}} {{initially}} {{scheduled for a}} single performance, but after <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> within twelve hours a second concert was added prior in the same day in Cologne. This too sold out, {{resulting in a total}} attendance of over 4000. A third performance was held almost six years later on June 18, 2017 in Paris, and a fourth just after on June 20, 2017 in London. A recording of the concert was published as a two-disc album on December 28, 2011 by Dog Ear Records, Uematsu's own record label. The albums, along with the concerts themselves, received varied reviews, with some critics giving enthusiastic praise, especially in regards {{to the quality of the}} performance, the choice of source material, and the quality of the arrangements, while other critics greatly disliked several of the arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to tour {{in support of}} the album was made before it was even complete. Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason and Wright were completely out of practice, and realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters, and threatened to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs (Mason, separated from his wife, used his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral). Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in Toronto, <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> within hours.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, The Last Story topped Japanese gaming charts, selling 114,722 units. Assessments by Media Create {{stated that}} while the game had {{achieved}} higher sales than Xenoblade Chronicles due to higher interest in the title, Wii hardware sales remained low, indicating that the title was mostly bought by gamers who already owned a Wii console. By the end of 2011, the game sold just over 157,000 units. Upon its release in the UK, it debuted at #15.

5|$|Although issue #7 sold out, Image Comics PR & Marketing Director Jennifer deGuzman {{announced}} in a December 12, 2012 letter to retailers {{that it would}} not reprint select comics, such as that issue. DeGuzman explained the move as a result of decreasing orders on well-performing titles like Saga, despite critical acclaim and consistently <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> at a distributor level, and pointed to orders on Saga #8, which decreased 4% from orders on issue #7. Rather than invest in second printings, deGuzman explained, Image would instead focus its attention on ensuring that the first printing garners the sales desired. This move displeased some retailers, which prompted Image Publisher Eric Stephenson to announce the following day that Image would indeed publish a second printing of issue #7 at a considerable discount, but cautioned that the publisher {{would not be able to}} reprint every issue of the series indefinitely, and implored retailers not to under-order the series.|$|E
5|$|As {{reported}} by {{a writer of}} Jet in September 2007, the tour had been <b>selling</b> <b>out</b> in every city it appeared at. In October 2009, when Knowles was chosen for the Woman of the Year Award presented by Billboard magazine, the gross from her tours was revealed. Between April 21 and September 8, 2007 it was reported to the magazine that The Beyoncé Experience grossed $24.9 million and 272,521 fans attended the twenty nine shows which were submitted to the boxscore at that time.
