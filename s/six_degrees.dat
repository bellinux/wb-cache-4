40|$|Abstract—We are {{developing}} an autonomous mobile robotic system to emulate <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> of freedom relative spacecraft motion during proximity operations. A mobile omni-directional base robot provides x, y, and yaw planar motion with moderate accuracy through six independently driven motors. With a <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> of freedom micro-positioning Stewart platform {{on top of}} the moving base, <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> of freedom spacecraft motion can be emulated with high accuracy. This paper presents our approach to dynamic modeling, control, and simulation for the overall system. Compared with other simulations that introduced significant simplifications, we believe that our rigorous modeling approach is crucial for the high fidelity hardware in-the-loop emulation.

5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately <b>six</b> <b>degrees</b> from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} Descent and Descent II, Descent 3 is a <b>six</b> <b>degrees</b> of freedom shooter where the player controls a flying ship from a first-person perspective in zero-gravity. It is differentiated from standard first-person shooters {{in that it}} allows the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is free to move forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies, turn on the ship's afterburners to temporarily increase its acceleration and speed, and fire flares or turn on the ship's headlight to explore darkened areas.|$|E

The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles {{made it impossible for}} riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The Cat in the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E

40|$|An amended <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> {{of freedom}} {{helicopter}} stability and control derivative model {{was developed in}} which body acceleration and control rate derivatives {{were included in the}} Taylor series expansion. These additional derivatives were derived from consideration {{of the effects of the}} higher order rotor flapping dynamics, which are known to be inadequately represented in the conventional <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> of freedom, quasistatic stability derivative model. The amended model was a substantial improvement over the conventional model, effectively doubling the unsable bandwidth and providing a more accurate representation of the short period and cross axis characteristics. Further investigations assessed the applicability of the two stability derivative model structures for flight test parameter identification. Parameters were identified using simulation data generated from a higher order base line model having sixth order rotor tip path plane dynamics. Three lower order models were identified: one using the conventional stability derivative model structure, a second using the amended <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> of freedom model structure, and a third model having eight degrees of freedom that included a simplified rotor tip path plane tilt representation...|$|R
