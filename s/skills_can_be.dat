Once drained, the skill cannot be activated until the meter refills, which it does during battles. Four <b>skills</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> equipped for each character. After battles, characters earn Enhancement Points (EP), {{which can be used}} to strengthen equipped armor, weapons and accessories, instead of using Gald (the in-game currency) as with previous Tales titles. EP can be transferred between weapons. An optional battle arena was added in the PSP version of the game with both single-player and multiplayer matches: in both modes, players need to defeat an enemy team (either AI-controlled enemies or an opposing team) within a time limit.|$|E
5|$|Between battles, {{characters}} can {{be managed}} at a Base. In this location, <b>skills</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> assigned, weapons can be traded, purchased, and forged, and bonus experience points earned in battle can be given to characters. There is also a Support system accessible through the Base where player characters can talk {{with each other and}} improve their relationships. These conversations improve affinity between characters and grant stat boots in battle. Supports are ranked from C to A, with A being the highest rank and granting the best bonuses.|$|E
5|$|Lords of Shadow is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the main character, Gabriel Belmont. The combat involves a retractable chain whip called the Combat Cross. The player can perform up to forty unlockable combos with it. The commands consist of direct attacks for dealing damage to single enemies, and weak area attacks when surrounded by them. It is also capable of interactions with secondary weapons, such as knives, holy water and other items which can be upgraded. In addition, the Combat Cross's melee <b>skills</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> combined with the Light and Shadow magic system, which are spells aimed at defense and aggression, respectively. The whip is upgradeable and {{can also be used}} to guard against an opponent's attack.|$|E

5|$|He also gains {{the ability}} to constrict objects and enemies with a band of energy, {{although}} this feature {{was one of the}} few abilities not to feature in future games. Players can find an ancient relic that gives Raziel the power to fire bolts of telekinetic energy, which cause little damage by themselves but can knock enemies into hazards and push objects from a distance. Baptism in holy flame can transform the Soul Reaver into the Fire Reaver, which can set enemies aflame and adds fire to Raziel's telekinetic bolts. Players can also find magical glyphs that allow Raziel to expend magical energy to attack groups of enemies simultaneously. These glyphs typically involve vampire weaknesses such as sunlight, fire, water, or sound, as well as additions such as telekinetic force (available well before the normal telekinesis becomes available) and the causing of earthquakes to temporarily stun enemies. Glyphs are acquired through finding glyph altars, specific locations in Nosgoth where the <b>skills</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> learned, and solving a puzzle before being granted the magical ability. However, Raziel begins the game with access to the 'Shift' glyph, granting {{the ability to}} shift between the material and spectral planes, with no glyph altar necessary.|$|E

Thorton's <b>skills</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> extensively customized. Players earn experience points while completing certain actions. Skills points are earned when players level-up after earning sufficient experience points, {{which can be}} used to upgrade nine aspects of Thorton's skills; namely Stealth, Pistols, Submachine Guns, Shotguns, Assault Rifles, Sabotage, Technical Aptitude, Toughness and Martial Arts. Spending points on these aspects unlocks new skills that can be activated to enhance Thorton's combat efficiency. For instance, a skill known as Chain Shot slows the passage of time and allows players to kill enemies in rapid succession. Players can specialize in three skills, whose level caps are fifteen.|$|E

In general, for a particular game the maximum value which can be reached for an ability is 100*. Quest for Glory V allows stat bonuses which can push an attribute over the maximum and lets certain classes raise certain attributes beyond the normal limits. Quest for Glory V also features special kinds of equipment which lower some stats while raising others.

25|$|Being {{a genetically}} {{enhanced}} human being gives the Agent various skills namely Strength (punching and lifting power), Agility (jumping and movement speed), Driving (handling vehicles), Explosives (the use of grenades and rocket launchers), Firearms (shooting ability). These <b>skills</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> upgraded by collecting specific orbs and killing enemies. Upgrading strength and agility increases the Agent's physicality, while upgrading Driving, Explosives and Weapons gives unlocks new vehicles and weapons. The Agent is also {{covered in a}} high-tech armor with a rechargeable shield that protects him from melee attacks, firearms and explosions. The armor also evolves as the Agent upgrade his skills, becoming more thicker and bulkier. Crackdown 2 improved upon this gameplay by allowing the player to unlock new armor abilities as they upgrade their armor, such as a ground and pound ability that causes powerful shockwaves, a charge ability, and a wingsuit and thrusters that gives the Agent the ability to fly. The player can also play various minigames such as on-foot and vehicle racing as well as street and aerial stunts.|$|E
500|$|The role of [...] "enforcer" [...] on {{a hockey}} team is unofficial. Enforcers {{occasionally}} play regular shifts like other players, but their primary role is deterring opposing players from rough play. Coaches often send enforcers out when opposing enforcers {{are on the}} ice or any time when {{it is necessary to}} check excessively physical play by the opposing team. Enforcers, particularly those with questionable playing <b>skills,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> colloquially referred to as goons (a term also occasionally used for a related position, the pest, who may not fight but will agitate an opponent with rough play and goad the opponent into a fight).|$|E

500|$|Fighting {{takes the}} form of {{real-time}} hack and slash combat, with players attacking randomly-generated enemies highlighted by the mouse. Available weapon types for characters include swords, clubs, axes, and staves. In addition to the standard attack with an assigned weapon, offensive <b>skills</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> deployed. Using active skills triggers a cooldown meter, rendering that skill unusable until the meter depletes. Items and equipment can also be looted from fallen enemies and chests scattered through environments: these range in quality, with grey standing for low-quality gear while purple stands for a [...] "Legendary" [...] item, and orange denotes a Relic or Charm which can be equipped to the player to increase an attribute such as elemental damage resistance. The majority of items and equipment are randomly generated, and are associated with particular types of enemies. The world's currency, Gold, can be gained through quest completion, opening chests and defeating certain enemies. Gold is used with the various shop NPCs in exchange for their services.|$|E

500|$|A Crackdown demo was {{released}} via Xbox Live Marketplace on 23 January 2007. It was originally dated for 18 January 2007, but was delayed due to Microsoft's certification process. This demo includes both single player and co-op play, {{but does not}} allow for jump-in co-op as seen in Gears of War. Silver account members received the demo one week later. [...] The demo lasts for, at most, one hour, with a timer starting when either the player trains a skill to the second level, has eliminated two of the gang Generals, or has been playing for a half-hour. At that point, a 30-minute timer will start, after which the demo automatically ends. During the demo, in-game <b>skills</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> trained up to the highest level, and this occurs at an accelerated rate in order to give players an example of higher-level abilities.
