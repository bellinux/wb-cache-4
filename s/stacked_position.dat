50|$|In most cases, a handcuff {{cover is}} used in {{combination}} with a belly chain which fixes the at waist level. When using a handcuff cover in combination with a belly chain, the hands may be cuffed in a parallel or in a <b>stacked</b> <b>position.</b> In this constellation, the shackled person's freedom of movement is strongly restricted and the arms are kept in a rather unnatural position which may cause discomfort or even pain. This is because when the covered handcuffs are used in combination with a belly chain, the prisoner's wrists are restrained {{in close proximity to}} the prisoner's torso. When the hands are cuffed in a parallel position, this will cause the wrists to spread outwardly in an angular relationship. As the handcuff cover provides a rigid structure, the prisoner's wrists may be bruised or cocked, restricting blood circulation in the prisoner's wrists. Overall, a handcuff cover in combination with a belly chain provide a rather uncomfortable way of restraint and may result in injury to the prisoner if maintained {{for an extended period of}} time.|$|E

Subjects are supine with the head counter-rotated 45 degrees using a head pillow. The jugular vein and carotid artery are located and positioned in a vertical stacked orientation. The transducer is rotated 90 degrees around the centerline of the transverse image of the stacked structure to obtain a longitudinal image while maintaining the vessels in a <b>stacked</b> <b>position.</b> A computerized methodology assists operators to accurately replicate images obtained over several spaced-apart examinations. The methodology utilizes a split-screen display in which the arterial ultrasound image from an earlier examination is displayed {{on one side of}} the screen while a real-time live ultrasound image from a current examination is displayed next to the earlier image on the opposite side of the screen. By viewing both images, whether simultaneously or alternately, while manually adjusting the ultrasound transducer, an operator is able to bring into view the real-time image that best matches a selected image from the earlier ultrasound examination. Utilizing this methodology, measurement of vascular dimensions such as carotid arterial IMT and diameter, the coefficient of variation is substantially reduced to values approximating from about 1. 0 % to about 1. 25 %. All images contain anatomical landmarks for reproducing probe angulation, including visualization of the carotid bulb, stacking of the jugular vein above the carotid artery, and initial instrumentation settings, used at a baseline measurement are maintained during all follow-up examinations...|$|E

40|$|Using {{the power}} of present-day {{supercomputers}} {{makes it possible to}} solve Newton’s equations of motion numerically, even for large systems. Molecular Dynamics provides a powerful simulation method to get insight in the behaviour of molecules under many conditions when considering atoms as charged solid spheres and hiding the quantum mechanics in effective potentials. We use this method to characterise the physical properties of different systems, e. g. polymers, water, organic and inorganic molecules. As an example of our work, we present a model of the pi-pi stacking dynamics of a perylene bisimide molecule when solvated in aromatic solvents. Our calculations show that the transition from the open (unstacked) to the stacked configuration is hindered by a small free energy barrier of approx. 1 kBT in the aromatic solvent toluene. The origin of this barrier is traced back to pi-pi interactions between perylene and the aromatic solvent which are very similar in nature to those between two PBI monomers. The stacking process proceeds in three phases via two well-defined transition states: (i) in the first phase, the two PBI molecules share part of their respective solvation shells forming the first transition state. Further approach needs to squeeze out the shared solvent layer thus creating the energy barrier. (ii) After removal of the separating solvent the two PBIs form a second transition state with one monomer located at a random position in the other’s solvation shell. (iii) Finally, the two PBIs slide {{on top of each other}} into their final <b>stacked</b> <b>position...</b>|$|E
40|$|The time-resolved {{fluorescence}} of 2 -aminopurine (2 AP) {{has been}} used to investigate DNA base flipping by the adenine methyltransferases and to study aspects of the DNA-enzyme interaction. 2 AP is an excellent fluorophore to probe base flipping in the adenine methyltransferases because, as demonstrated in the present work on M. TaqI, the 2 AP is delivered into the same position inside the enzyme as the natural target adenine and with the same orientation that prepares the adenine for enzyme catalysis. 2 AP emits two types of fluorescence when in DNA. The first is the well-known 370 -nm emission, which emanates from 2 AP as a monomer species. The second is 450 -nm emission and comes from a 2 AP which is π-stacked with a neighbouring DNA base, a heterodimer species. Additionally, 450 -nm emission is produced by a 2 AP-tyrosine or 2 APphenylalanine heterodimer when a flipped 2 AP is π-stacked inside a DNA-methyltransferase complex. Steady state fluorescence of the 2 AP-heterodimer {{has been used}} to complement the time-resolved investigations. Combined crystal- and solution-phase studies on M. TaqI have shown that when 2 AP is flipped into the active site of M. TaqI it is significantly quenched by face-to-face π- stacking with the tyrosine from the NPPY catalytic motif. Not all of the flipped bases are held inside NPPY; in a minority of complexes, the flipped 2 AP experiences very little quenching within the interior of the enzyme. In the sequence of bases recognised by M. TaqI, the thymine opposite the target adenine does not actively cause base flipping, as previously suggested, however, its presence aids the successful delivery of the target base into NPPY. For the DNA-M. TaqI-cofactor ternary complex, the effect of varying the cofactor has been investigated. The use of 5 ’-[2 (amino) ethylthio]- 5 ’-deoxyadenosine (AETA) or sinefungin as cofactor analogue causes M. TaqI to show different base flipping behaviour compared with the natural cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and with the cofactor product S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH). In the ternary complex containing SAM the flipped base is held the most tightly within the catalytic motif. M. TaqI mutants have been studied in which the tyrosine (Y) in the NPPY motif is mutated to alanine (A) or phenylalanine (F). Stabilisation of the flipped base inside these mutants is more reliant on edge-to-face π-stacking with phenylalanine 196 and the available hydrogen-bonding in the adenine binding pocket. The NPPF-phenylalanine does not π-stack with the flipped base as NPPY-tyrosine does. Solution-phase time-resolved fluorescence studies have confirmed that M. EcoRI and M. EcoRV use a base-flipping mechanism to extrude their target bases. For M. EcoRI, with sinefungin cofactor, the majority of the flipped 2 APs are not held in the NPPF catalytic motif. When the natural SAM cofactor is used, however, the flipped 2 AP strongly associates with NPPF inside M. EcoRI. Non-cognate sequence binding has been investigated, in which M. EcoRI encounters a base that is in almost the same sequence context as the methylation target. M. EcoRI forms some direct contacts with the pseudo-target adenine but does not extrude the base that is in a highly <b>stacked</b> <b>position</b> inside the duplex. The H 235 N mutant of M. EcoRI, measured under the same conditions as the wild-type enzyme, shows different behaviour to the wild-type enzyme in a small proportion of complexes, when bound to the cognate recognition sequence, and is far more discriminating than the wild-type when bound to the non-cognate sequence. The M. EcoRV methyltransferase was found to be less efficient at flipping its target base than with M. TaqI or M. EcoRI. When M. EcoRV binds to its GATATC recognition sequence, the base-enzyme interactions of the target (GAT) and non-target (TAT) adenine position are shown to be quite different.
