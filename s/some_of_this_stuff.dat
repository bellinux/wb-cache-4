I regret that James is not here to attend me; but since he is not you and I will have to carry <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> upstairs," [...] and together {{they returned to the}} floor above, their arms laden with pieces of the dilapidated milk rack.

6000|$|... "Why, Mr. Parker, of course!" [...] said Mrs. Brown severely, {{with the}} air of having {{repeated}} the name a great many times,--"the old gentleman in the room above. The simple question I want to ask," [...] she continued with the calm manner of one who has just convicted another of gross ambiguity of language, [...] "is only this: If <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> were put in a saucer, and left carelessly on the table, and a child, or a baby, or a cat, or any young animal, should come in at the window, and drink it up,--a whole saucer full,--because it had a sweet taste, would it be likely to hurt them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{waste time}} in asking questions," [...] said Orme as the Professor {{approached}} with caution. [...] "I'll explain. We {{are going on}} a queer journey to-night--four white men with about a dozen half-bred mongrel scamps of doubtful loyalty, so you see Quick and I thought it as well to have <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> handy. Probably {{it will never be}} wanted, and if wanted we shall have no time to use it; still, who knows? There, that will do. Ten canisters; enough to blow up half the Fung if they will kindly sit on them. You take five, Quick, a battery and three hundred yards of wire, and I'll take five, a battery, and three hundred yards of wire. Your detonators are all fixed, aren't they? Well, so are mine," [...] and without more words he proceeded to stow away his share of the apparatus in the poacher pockets of his coat and elsewhere, while Quick did likewise with what remained. Then the case that they had opened was fastened up again and removed to be laden on a camel.|$|E

60|$|Well, {{the thing}} was easy--I was a doctor and I had a supply of glycerinated lymph; I had {{procured}} some fresh tubes of it only the other day, to hold it up before my audiences while I dilated on its foulness and explained the evils which resulted from its use. Supposing now that I made a few scratches on my arm and rubbed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> into them, {{who would be the}} wiser? The inflammation which would follow would not be sufficient to incapacitate me, and nobody can see through a man's coat sleeve; even if the limb should become swollen or helpless I could pretend that I had strained it. Whatever I had preached to prove my point and forward my ambition, in truth I had never doubted the efficacy of vaccination, although I was well aware of the dangers that might result from the use of impure or contaminated lymph, foul surroundings, and occasionally, perhaps, certain conditions of health in the subject himself. Therefore I had no prejudice to overcome, and certainly I was not a Conscientious Objector.|$|E

6000|$|The {{desire for}} {{self-expression}} may become overwhelming. After Sir Isaac {{had talked to}} himself about Georgina and Lady Harman for some time in his study, he was seized with a great longing to pour <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> spirited <b>stuff</b> into the entirely unsympathetic ear of Mrs. Sawbridge. So he went about the house and garden looking for her, and being at last obliged to enquire about her, learnt from a scared defensive housemaid whom he cornered suddenly in the conservatory, that she had retired to her own room. He went and rapped at her door but after one muffled [...] "Who's that?" [...] he could get no further response.|$|R

For the {{storytelling}} of what Gore’s memory was like of growing up on the farm, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> 8mm <b>stuff</b> that I shot is very impressionistic. And for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his memories of his son’s accident, these grainy black-and-white stills... have a feel that contrasted very beautifully with the crisp hi-def HD that we shot.

5000|$|Empire {{gave the}} film four stars out of five, saying that [...] "the biggest twist is its {{consistently}} high quality... anything goes, {{and all of}} it works".

5000|$|In mid-August 2010, Sir Stephen Lander, Director-General of MI5 (1996-2002) voiced {{an opinion}} that the very {{existence}} of a ring of Russian [...] "illegals" [...] was no laughing matter: [...] "The fact that they're nondescript or don't look serious is part of the charm of the business. That's why the Russians are so successful at <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff.</b> They're able to put people in those positions over time to build up their cover to be useful. They are part of a machine. ... And the machine is a very professional and serious one." ...|$|E

It’s full of odd metered rhythms and breakdowns, unexpected twists and turns, and some of our most technical riffing to date. Each of us have parts that make our heads spin and we have had to practice like crazy to get <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> together.

5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} Turok games, where {{artists were}} limited to pre-designed levels, Shadow of Oblivion features maps that were entirely built to suit the designers' requirements. Levels also include events that unfold independently of the player's actions. As creative director David Dienstbier explained, players can [...] "see police choppers swooping throughout the world. Police drive up to certain buildings and charge into the building to go fight. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> is scripted specifically around the player's actions and movements, {{and some of it}} takes place completely independent of where the player is." [...] In {{the weeks leading up to}} the game's release, the development team was composed of 21 people and worked 24 hour shifts. A separate game, also titled Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion, was released for the Game Boy Color in 2000. Although set in the same fictional universe, it follows a different storyline.|$|E
50|$|It was {{directed}} by Brian Trenchard-Smith. This was the biggest budget he had ever enjoyed for a film: He says he got the job because of his wor on Britannic and Happy Face Murders.When I came on board for film... I thought, I’m {{going to have a}} bit of a sly smile at <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff,</b> not being a Pentecostal Christian myself. But if the Pentecostal Christians want to give me $20 million to make a film, I’m not going to say no. So I thought, what are my genre aspirations in this rather confused screenplay I‘ve been given? Let’s straighten it out along the following lines: let’s say it’s The Omen (1976) meets Air Force One (1997), with a bit of End of Days (1999)... And they fight the Battle of the Bulge, and are awarded with the Second Coming! I mean, those are some nice elements to put into your martini. And so I proceeded along those lines. It was a fun film to make, and primarily, the faithful have seen it. But I can tell you, it did have a slight sense of humor, even sub textually, it’s a fun film to see. It was interesting to see it with a mixed audience of Pentecostals and secular hedonists, and it was interesting to see where either side of the audience laughed, or they both laughed, or the Christians cheered. So it was interesting to see it, ultimately. It’s a fun romp laughs, not usually what happens with a religious film.|$|E
5000|$|My {{theory is}} that the more people have copies <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff,</b> the less likely it is to {{disappear}} forever. Digital archiving is about dissemination and propagating, not hoarding and hiding. Andrew Dubber, 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Substance monism ("stuff monism") {{asserts that}} {{a variety of}} {{existing}} things can be explained in terms of a single reality or substance.

5000|$|I {{was writing}} these lyrics, and they didn't feel good — {{some of it}} hurt, {{some of it was}} like, 'Am I being too honest even with myself?' I had doubts that it was the right record. —Hayley Williams on the [...] "doubts" [...] she had with the initial writing of the record. Williams was {{concerned}} about lyrics that involved current issues, as opposed to resolved issues that she had written about in the past. [...] "I was like, 'This isn't a feel-good song, because I'm writing about something I'm going through right now, and it's still painful,'" [...] she continued. [...] "And I confused that with actually not liking the songs, when actually I was prouder of them than I've ever been before. They're heavier emotions for me... I'm still going through <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff,</b> and these songs are really healing to me." [...] The band as a whole treated the writing as a therapeutic experience, which helped them hash out old differences. Now that [...] "all those words were out on the table", they were able to have their first real conversations in a long time, resolving the internal struggles they had been facing, by going back to the reasons why they started the band and had wanted to play music in the first place. Consequently, Paramore decided to name the record Brand New Eyes because of the allusion to seeing things from a whole new perspective, [...] "Just trying to let go of whatever we might have struggled with the past and just see each other in a new way," [...] explained Williams. The band soon felt that they were onto the right track, and, retrospectively looking back on Riot!, Paramore guitarist, Josh Farro, said [...] "Riot! was a kiddie album, but we had to do that to get to this point." ...|$|E
