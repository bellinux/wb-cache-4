The study found that in many cases the websites are not meeting the needs of their audience.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{implementation}} of an IST in a rural primary school of Northern KZN. The ISTs within an inclusive education context have not existed in the said area, due in part to the way the district support structure was implemented. Previously, the main focus had been on psycho-educational assessment, which was done in a more traditional way, with no specific interventions after assessment. This, however, was not in accordance with the ex-KwaZulu Department of Education modus operandi. Although the Education Support Services (ESS) of the past era provided some support for learners with barriers to learning in Northern KZN, it was not enough. The research site is nestled in a valley amidst rocky land in Northern Zululand, with sparsely populated communities around the school. Acculturation, that is the absorption of other cultures, prevails among the local people, with influences noticeable in some community houses being built in the semi-urban style of neighbouring Swaziland and Mozambique. However, the majority of the community continue to live in traditional houses and the area still operates as a subsistence economy. This is evident along the roadsides, where there are a number of informal <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>sites</b> from which the local community sell their wild fruits, arts, crafts and/or firewood to passers-by, including tourists. Many learners assist their parents with these sales after school, over weekends and on public holidays. Some have large fields for growing vegetables, mealies and other crops. It is significant that the majority of the community is illiterate, with this becoming a challenge to the school because the same parents are expected to support their children with their schoolwork, as well as participating in the school activities. The cooperation between the home and the school should be improved, as many learners are not staying with their natural parents but with members of the extended family, including their grandparents. For much of the time these guardians (grandparents and care-givers) have their own personal commitments. The School Governing Body (SGB), including parent representatives, is instrumental in improving educator-parent relationships. Mrs. O. R. Pettiphe...|$|R
40|$|Many Australian {{small and}} medium sized {{businesses}} have websites {{that offer a}} range of facilities for the consumer: information provision, online ordering, and community participation. In a {{study carried out on}} Australian winery web sites, it was observed that the smaller the winery, the less likely it was that it had a web site. However, those small wineries that do have web sites seem to be more innovative {{and are more likely to}} offer a wider range of Internet facilities than other <b>small</b> <b>business</b> web <b>sites.</b> This is almost the opposite of the general trend where the <b>smaller</b> the <b>business</b> the less innovative it is likely to be. An email interview conducted with owners of a sample of the wineries, indicated that the reason for this is the need for smaller wineries to attract a larger market, perhaps at a lower cost. This stage of the study indicated that there is also a lack of planning going into web site implementation and maintenance. Recommendations are made for governments and industry bodies to improve the level of understanding of the benefits of the Internet to small wineries in general, and to impress upon them the need for planning for their implementation and upkeep. These findings are important for the opportunities that they provide to the many small wineries that have not created a website and may provide the catalyst for some of them to do so...|$|R

The stance of the Japanese government vis-à-vis <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> in the prewar period was that it should strengthen product competitiveness and credit by organizing them. However, the connection between those policies and finance was weak. Nonetheless, many <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> made active use of informal transactions or private financial institutions that served <b>small</b> <b>businesses.</b> During wartime, the government forced <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> to join the munitions industry or face closure.
