40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the sources of}} the <b>sex</b> wage <b>gap</b> in a set of EU countries with the European Structure of Earnings Survey (ESES), a unique cross-national survey of matched employeremployee data. The paper moves beyond traditional analysis of <b>sex</b> wage <b>gap</b> by incorporating the workplace effect in the wage outcomes of men and women and by developing inter-country comparisons via the Juhn-Murphy-Pierce decomposition. The obtained evidence confirms that the <b>sex</b> wage <b>gap</b> is explained in all the countries by the segregation of females into low-paying establishments and that the extent of femaleness is one characteristic of firms that lowers wages. In line with these results, the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition results show that job and workplace characteristics are very relevant in explaining wage differences between males and females in all the countries. The use in the final part of the paper of the Juhn-Murphy-Pierce decomposition technique with a rich set of workplace characteristics provides interesting insights into the origin of the gender pay gap in the European countries. The results of the Juhn-Murphy-Pierce decomposition points that although gender-specific factors are important in explaining intercountry differences in the magnitude of the <b>sex</b> wage <b>gap,</b> differences in wage structure are in general a major source of inter-country differences in this gap...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} causes of the {{positive}} correlation between happiness and the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in happiness between women and men observed in Europe. Departing from a variety of hypotheses that are based on the sex differences at the individual level, this paper tests whether the positive correlation {{can be explained by the}} sex difference in life expectancy. The mechanisms working behind are as follows. First, national average happiness affects the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in life expectancy negatively because men are more fragile to stress (unhappiness). Second, the sex difference in life expectancy influences the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in happiness negatively because it affects the chance of being a widow for women. Using a 3 SLS approach, it found that both effects are significant and that the direct effects between happiness and the happiness gap are insignificant.

40|$|A {{number of}} industrialized nations have {{recently}} experienced some degrees of constriction in their long-standing sex differentials in life expectancy at birth. In {{this study we}} examine this phenomenon {{in the context of}} Canada’s regions between 1971 and 1991 : Atlantic (Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island); Quebec, Ontario, and the West (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon and Northwest Territories). Decomposition analysis based on multiple decrement life tables is applied to address three questions: (1) Are there regional differentials in the degree of narrowing in the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in life expectancy? (2) What is the relative contribution of major causes of death to observed sex differences in average length of life within and across regions? (3) How do the contributions of cause-of-death components vary across regions to either widen or narrow the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in survival? It is shown that the magnitude of the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> is not uniform across the regions, though the differences are not large. The most important contributors to a narrowing of the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in life expectancy are heart disease and external types of mortality (i. e., accidents, violence, and suicide), followed by lung cancer and other types of chronic conditions.

40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between gender and}} health is complex. Although women live longer than men in almost every country throughout the world, women {{also tend to be}} sicker than men. While biological sex differences likely contribute to sex gaps in health, cross-national, historical, and life course variation suggest that social factors also play a role. This dissertation is composed of three chapters which examine social explanations for gender gaps in mortality and morbidity. The first chapter looks at the {{relationship between}} gender equality in the public sphere, and sex gaps in life expectancy throughout the world. I find that influence of gender equality on the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in life expectancy depends on the level of economic development. The second chapter takes an historical perspective to examine the trend in the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in depression in the United States between 1971 and 2008. In examining this trend, I find that the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in depression has decreased over the past forty years, due to a decrease in depression among women that is primarily attributable to an increase in women 2 ̆ 7 s labor force participation and attachment. In the third chapter, I examine the relationship between gender, aging, and depression using longitudinal data for the population over age fifty in the United States. In doing so, I find that age does not increase depression until age 75, after which point depression increases for both sexes, but particularly for men, leading to a reversal in the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in depression {{at the end of the}} lifespan. Furthermore, while the majority of the age effect on depression is explained by social and health changes, I conclude that there is a net effect of age per se on depression after age 75. ...|$|E

We extend previous research by systematically testing a variety of factors, including health behaviors, social ties, socioeconomic status, and biological indicators of health. We employ the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey III Linked Mortality File and use Cox proportional hazards models to examine sex differences in adult mortality in the United States. Our findings document that social and behavioral characteristics are key factors related to the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in mortality.

Nevertheless, persistent sex differences in mortality remain: compared with women, men have 30 % to 83 % higher risks of death over the follow-up period, depending on the covariates included in the model.

30|$|More {{than two}} decades ago it was {{reported}} in ‘Nature’ that the slope of improvement in the men’s and women’s running records, extrapolated from mean running velocity plotted against historical time, would eventually result in a performance intersection of the sexes across a variety of running distances (Whipp and Ward 1992). It has been suggested that the sex difference in running should disappear with increasing distance, particularly in race distances longer than the marathon (Bam et al. 1997). This suggestion was primarily based on differences in fuel utilization, muscle damage following exercise, relative improvements in performance over the past decades, and on the analysis of marathon versus ultra-marathon performances of men and women (Bam et al. 1997). The remaining <b>sex</b> <b>gaps</b> in performance appear biological in origin (Cheuvront et al. 2005). Success in distance running is determined largely by aerobic capacity and muscular strength (Cheuvront et al. 2005). As man have a larger aerobic capacity and a greater muscular strength compared to women, the gap in running performances between men and woman seems unlikely to narrow naturally (Cheuvront et al. 2005). Moreover, running economy at absolute velocities is better in elite male than elite female runners (Daniels and Daniels 1992). However, a potential physiological advantage for women may be a greater fatigue resistance compared to equally trained men in ultra-marathons (Bam et al. 1997).|$|R

40|$|Occupational sex {{segregation}} is {{one explanation for}} the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in pay. Traditionally female occupations offered low wages, few benefits and lacked ladders of upward mobility. In the United States, education {{is viewed as a}} route to upward mobility. Prior to legislation enacted in the early 1970 's, however, men's and women's educational opportunities varied. Women's enrollments at medical, law and engineering schools were limited. After removal of such limitations, however, women's penetration of these fields over the past twenty years has varied. Women comprised one third of all new medical doctors and more than 40 % of all new lawyers, but only 14 % of all bachelors degrees in engineering were awarded to women in 1987. This dissertation answers two questions. First, what factors are instrumental in college students' decision to major in engineering? Second, given they major in engineering, what factors account for sex differences in the completion of a bachelors degree in engineering? Multinomial logit models of major choice are constructed with data from the 1980 senior cohort of the High School and Beyond longitudinal survey. The base year (1980), three follow-up waves (1982, 1984, and 1986) and the Post-Secondary Transcript data were used. Enrollment characteristics of engineering schools in the early 1980 's are compiled from several archival sources. The multinomial logit models are decomposed to determine the percent of the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in major choice explained by the models and the relative importance of high school preparation and skills, attitudes and structural constraints as explanations of the sex differences in engineering education. It is shown that, at most, 9. 2 % of the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in the choice of engineering is explained by the factors specified by the policy literature (i. e., sex differences in high school preparation and skills and occupational attitudes). As much as 77 % of the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> is attributable to sex differences in how fields of study are viewed. Finally, women who majored in engineering in 1982 were more likely than their male counterparts to complete a bachelors degree in engineering by 1986. Therefore, the primary issue regarding women and engineering education concerns the initial attraction of women to engineering programs...|$|E

40|$|This study {{argues that}} the {{development}} of individual choice in marriage markets has led to an increase in interracial marriage and an accompanying decline in racial boundaries. I first establish the importance of individual choice in interracial marriage. I do this by examining the persistent tendency for interracial marriage to be engaged in substantially more often by men in some racial-ethnic groups, and by women in others. I propose that a within-group mismatch of gender attitudes and an across-group matching of gender attitudes leads individuals to seek partners across racial lines. A national U. S. probability sample reveals that there are both significant differences in gender attitudes between each of the racial groups, as well as <b>sex</b> <b>gaps</b> in attitudes within each of the groups. Further, the cross-racial pairings for which the gender attitude gaps are smallest are also those for which interracial marriage is highest. Next, I examine the importance of women's employment for the weakening of racial boundaries. Previous research has established that increases in an ethnic group's occupational heterogeneity weaken ethnic solidarity for members of the group. Since occupations are highly sex segregated, increases in women's employment tend to increase an ethnic group's occupational heterogeneity, and hence weaken ethnic group solidarity. I confirm this hypothesis by finding that employed women are significantly more tolerant of interracial marriage than are married women. Last, I find that modernization is also associated with tolerance toward interracial marriage...|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 20 th {{century the}} <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in life {{expectancy}} in the industrialised countries widened in favour of women. By the early 1980 s a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential occurred in some countries, where it reached a maximum and thereafter has followed a declining trend. It is argued {{in this study that}} this development represents an emerging feature of the epidemiological profile of post-industrial societies. I look at Canada and Austria as two representative cases of this phenomenon over roughly three decades, between 1970 and 2001. Decomposition analysis shows that reduced sex differences in life expectancy in the 1980 s and 1990 s obtained mainly from the effects of reduced sex differences in mortality with respect to heart disease, and secondarily accidents and violence and lung cancer. Heart disease has played a larger role in Canada, whereas differential mortality from accidents and violence has been of greater importance in Austria. A further aspect of the investigation links sex differences in smoking prevalence to sex differences in life expectancy. A model is suggested that incorporates female labour force participation and a measure of gender role traditionalism in society as factors in female smoking prevalence. These variables are also postulated to correlate with change in the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in life expectancy by a time lag of twenty years. It is found that sex differences in smoking prevalence in the past are related to sex difference in life expectancy in the present, and that female labour force participation and gender role traditionalism are also associated with the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in expectation of life. The findings are interpreted in reference to epidemiological transition theory and the literature concerning change in the position of women and sex differences in mortality in high-income nations. ...|$|E

We describe the burden of CRC {{in the region and}} review the current status of disease control. MethodsWe obtained regional- and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries, as well as cancer deaths from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence (ASR) and mortality (ASMR) rates per 100, 000 person-years for 2003 – 2007 and the estimated annual percentage change for 1997 – 2008. ResultsThe CRC rate in males was 1 – 2 times higher than that in females. In 2003 – 2007, the highest ASRs were seen in Uruguayan, Brazilian and Argentinean males (25. 2 – 34. 2) and Uruguayan and Brazilian females (21. 5 – 24. 7), while El Salvador had the lowest ASR in both sexes (males: 1. 5, females: 1. 3). ASMRs were< 10 for both sexes, except in Uruguay, Cuba and Argentina (10. 0 – 17. 7 and 11. 3 – 12. 0). CRC incidence is increasing in Chilean males. Most countries have national screening guidelines. Uruguay and Argentina have implemented national screening programs.

40|$|Education {{contributes}} to gender stratification {{in the labor}} market through the types of education that men and women receive. This dissertation examines how college major affects gender differences in work outcomes, and how this relationship has changed over time. Recent analysis of the relationship between major, and occupation and earnings uses a college-educated sample from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY 79). To examine the change in major and its effects over time, I utilized the National Longitudinal Study-Original Cohorts, producing two independent cross-sections. I examined the effects of major using OLS regression and decomposition analyses. Men and women continue to be segregated into majors in the 1980 s/ 1990 s, particularly in Engineering and Computer Science (“male” fields) and Education and Nursing (“female” fields). Male majors tend to lead to male occupations (and female majors to female occupations). Sex differences in major explain one-quarter to one-third of the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in occupations. Major affects earnings, in that female majors have lower hourly wages (the exception is female Nursing majors). Occupation cannot fully explain the effects of major. Men seem to benefit more from male majors than women. Over time, men and especially women have left Education majors and increased among Business majors. This change in the sex distribution of majors, along with the change in slopes, contributed to about one-third of the narrowing of the <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in occupations over time. The change in the sex distribution of majors explained 25 % of the shrinking <b>sex</b> <b>gap</b> in pay. It was a larger explanatory factor than the change in returns, which generally benefited men (most notably the increase in returns to Science majors). Occupational aspirations and institutions were examined for their effects on major, occupation, and earnings. The findings demonstrate that college major {{contributes to}} gender stratification {{in the labor market}}. Major had direct effects on occupation, and in most cases on earnings. This may indicate differences in skills and productivity (human capital approach), and what majors signal to employers. Sex typing of field occurs prior to entry in the labor market and female fields (like female occupations) tend to be devalued. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between occupational segregation and the wage {{differences between men and}} women using the Flückiger & Silber (1999) decomposition. This methodology is an adaptation of the traditional Oaxaca (1973) -Blinder (1973) decomposition that allows separating the <b>sex</b> wage <b>gap</b> into three additive components: 1. The part of the gap explained by differences in productivity between sexes. 2. The fraction associated with differences in returns to productive characteristics and 3. A part related to differences in group size –segregation-. Despite the statistical difference in productive characteristics and returns across occupational groups, we find that the segregation component of the decomposition is extremely sensitive to the way groups are defined. Since occupational groups are defined ad hoc, further insight is needed in order to determine how important segregation really is to explain wage differences...|$|R

The one-off programme made headlines across the UK, mainly for her open attitude towards sensitive subjects. According to some the show pointed out that British teenagers suffer a serious deficiency in their <b>sex</b> education, a <b>gap</b> they fill by watching pornography, with a horde of misconceptions as a result. Liekens {{has argued that the}} General Certificate of Secondary Education must include a much broader and mandatory sexual education than at present.|$|R
5000|$|The three {{welfare state}} regimes {{highlight}} employment opportunity, wage gaps, and health status as differentiating factors {{when it comes}} to gender. In terms of employment opportunity, it is impacted by the feminization of poverty. This is when woman represent a disproportionate share of the poor population compared to men. [...] Varying beliefs between the three regimes on gender roles in the labor market effects the level of poverty pertaining toward <b>sex.</b> Wage <b>gaps</b> are affected by the differing beliefs on decommodification between the three welfare state regimes. The theory of decommodification looks to decommodify labor in order to substitute for wages, creating disparity between the pay of low-income earners (a category over-represented by women). [...] Lastly, health status is seen to be influenced by the promotion of gender equality. Those regimes, which believe in equality for all, were seen to have better overall health, compared to those regimes that do not promote gender equality.|$|R
