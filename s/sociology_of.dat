5|$|<b>Sociology</b> <b>of</b> leisure is {{a fairly}} recent {{subfield}} of sociology, compared to more traditional subfields such as <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> work, <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> the family, and <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> education: it saw most of its development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sociology</b> <b>of</b> leisure or leisure {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of how humans organize their free time. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as sport, tourism, and the playing of games. The <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> leisure is closely tied to the <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> work, as each explores a different side of the work-leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work-leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture.|$|E
5|$|A {{subfield}} of the <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> {{health and}} illness that overlaps with cultural sociology {{is the study}} of death, dying and bereavement, sometimes referred to broadly as the <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> death. This topic is exemplifed by the work of Douglas Davies and Michael C. Kearl.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> risk, rural sociology and the <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> disaster.|$|E

5|$|The Religion of India: The <b>Sociology</b> <b>of</b> Hinduism and Buddhism was Weber's {{third major}} {{work on the}} <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> religion. In this work he deals with the {{structure}} of Indian society, with the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally {{with the impact of}} religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society. In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The Indian caste system made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste. Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant {{in the context of the}} advancement of the soul.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sociology</b> <b>of</b> literature, film, and art is {{a subset}} of the <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> culture. This field studies the social {{production}} of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire, translated by Susan Emanuel as Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.|$|E
5|$|The Internet is of {{interest}} to sociologists in various ways; most practically {{as a tool for}} research and as a discussion platform. The <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> the Internet in the broad sense regards the analysis of online communities (e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites) and virtual worlds, thus there is often overlap with community sociology. Online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society. One notable text is Manuel Castells' The Internet Galaxy—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. Closely related to the <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> the Internet, is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> {{health and}} illness {{focuses on the}} social effects of, and public attitudes toward, illnesses, diseases, mental health and disabilities. This {{sub-field}} also overlaps with gerontology {{and the study of}} the ageing process. Medical sociology, by contrast, focuses on the inner-workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944).|$|E

5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E
5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> everyday life, social interaction, the social construction of self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Judaism, {{his fourth}} major {{work on the}} <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> religion, Weber {{attempted}} to explain the factors {{that resulted in the}} early differences between Oriental and Occidental religiosity. He contrasted the innerworldly asceticism developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India. Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections. This fundamental characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish prophecy.|$|E
