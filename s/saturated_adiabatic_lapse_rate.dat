Potential water vapor (POWV) or maximum precipitable water vapor can be an appropriate base for estimation of probable maximum precipitation (PMP) in an area, leading to probable maximum flood (PMF) and flash flood management systems. PWV and POWV have miscellaneously been estimated by means of either discrete solutions such as tables, diagrams or empirical methods; however, there is no analytical formula for POWV even in a particular atmospherical condition. In this article, fundamental governing equations required for analytical {{calculation of}} POWV are first introduced. Then, it will be shown that this POWV calculation relies on a Riemann integral solution over a range of altitude whose integrand is merely a function of altitude. The solution of the integral gives rise to a series function which is bypassed by approximation of saturation vapor pressure in the range of - 55 to 55 degrees Celsius, and an analytical formula for POWV in an atmosphere of constant lapse rate is proposed. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the suggested equation, exact calculations of <b>saturated</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> (SALR) at different surface temperatures were performed.

40|$|The Author(s) 2016. Glaciers and ice caps {{around the}} world are {{changing}} quickly, with surge-type behaviour superimposed upon climatic forcing. Here, we study Iceland's second largest ice cap, Langjökull, which has both surge- and non-surge-type outlets. By differencing elevation change with surface mass balance, we estimate the contribution of ice dynamics to elevation change. We use DEMs, in situ stake measurements, regional reanalyses and a mass-balance model to calculate the vertical ice velocity. Thus, we not only compare the geodetic, modelled and glaciological mass balances, but also map spatial variations in glacier dynamics. Maps of emergence and submergence velocity successfully highlight the 1998 surge and subsequent quiescence of one of Langjökull's outlets by visualizing both source and sink areas. In addition to observing the extent of traditional surge behaviour (i. e. mass transfer from the accumulation area to the ablation area followed by recharge of the source area), we see peripheral areas where the surge impinged upon an adjacent ridge and subsequently retreated. While mass balances are largely in good agreement, discrepancies between modelled and geodetic mass balance may be explained by inaccurate estimates of precipitation, <b>saturated</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> or degree-day factors. Nevertheless, the study was ultimately able to investigate dynamic surge behaviour in the absence of in situ measurements during the surge. This is the author accepted manuscript.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] near-surface air temperature lapse rate is an important tool for spatially distributing temperatures in snow- and ice-melt models, but is difficult to parameterize, as it is not simply correlated with boundary-layer meteorological variables, such as temperature itself. This contribution quantifies spring-autumn lapse rate variability over 5 years at Vestari-Hagafellsjökull, a southerly outlet of Langjökull in Iceland. It is observed that summer lapse rates (0. 57 °C 100 m) are significantly lower than non-summer rates, and are also lower than the <b>Saturated</b> <b>Adiabatic</b> <b>Lapse</b> <b>Rate</b> (SALR), which is often adopted in melt models. This is consistent with reduced near-surface temperature sensitivity to free-atmosphere temperature change during the occurrence of melting. A Variable Lapse Rate (VLR) regression model is calibrated with standardized, 750 hPa temperature anomalies derived from ERA-Interim climatology, which is shown to be highly significantly correlated with near-surface temperatures. The modelled VLR overestimates cumulative June-September Positive Degree Days (PDDs) by 3 % when used to extrapolate temperatures from 1100 to 500 m a. s. l. on the glacier, whereas the SALR overestimates cumulative PDDs by 14 %. ERA-Interim data therefore appear to offer a good representation of free-atmosphere temperature variability over Vestari-Hagafellsjökull, and the modelling approach offers a simple means of improving lapse rate parameterizations in melt models. © 2012 Royal Meteorological Society...|$|E
5000|$|The {{difference}} in moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> and the dry rate {{is the cause}} of foehn wind phenomenon (also known as [...] "Chinook winds" [...] in parts of North America). The phenomenon exists because warm moist air rises through orographic lifting up and over the top of a mountain range or large mountain. The temperature decreases with the dry <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> until it hits the dew point, where water vapor in the air begins to condense. Above that altitude, the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> decreases to the moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> as the air continues to rise. Condensation is also commonly followed by precipitation on the top and windward sides of the mountain. As the air descends on the leeward side, it is warmed by adiabatic compression at the dry <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate.</b> Thus, the foehn wind at a certain altitude is warmer than the corresponding altitude on the windward side of the mountain range. In addition, because the air has lost much of its original water vapor content, the descending air creates an arid region on the leeward side of the mountain.|$|R
