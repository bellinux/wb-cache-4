40|$|We analyse the {{conditions}} under which an (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> may be derived and compare these with alternative rules. We consider the case of labour demand with fixed adjustment costs. The (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> implies a specific ordering of choices: downward adjustment, non-adjustment and upward adjustment with the decision of inaction lying crucially in the middle. We may model firms' decisions as an (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> only if it is possible to characterise unobserved heterogeneity as an exact negative relation between the choice-specific error terms. Assuming that these are normally distributed, the particular ordering of choices implied by the (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> may be estimated by an ordered probit.

SBK and Geffen also enjoyed huge success with albums based on the film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The <b>Simpsons</b> <b>Sing</b> the Blues. The record soon became the fastest-selling album to emerge from a television show since the Miami Vice soundtrack in 1985.

RESULTS: The false-rejection rates for the repeat-sampling strategies were similarly low to those of the 1 : 3 <b>s</b> QC <b>rule.</b> The error detection rates for the repeat-sampling strategies approached those of the 1 : 2 <b>s</b> QC <b>rule</b> for moderate to large out-of-control error condi-tions.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that modern humans conform to Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule,</b> {{which holds that}} body size in endothermic species will increase as temperature decreases. However, {{there are reasons to}} question the reliability of the findings on which this consensus is based. One of these is that the main studies that have reported that modern humans conform to Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> have employed samples that contain a disproportionately large number of warm-climate and northern hemisphere groups. With this in mind, we used latitudinally-stratified and hemisphere-specific samples to re-assess the relationship between modern human body size and temperature. We found that when groups from north and south of the equator were analyzed together, Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> was supported. However, when groups were separated by hemisphere, Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> was only supported in the northern hemisphere. In the course of exploring these results further, we found that the difference between our northern and southern hemisphere subsamples is due to the limited latitudinal and temperature range in the latter subsample. Thus, our study suggests that modern humans do conform to Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> but only when there are major differences in latitude and temperature among groups. Specifically, groups must span more than 50 degrees of latitude and/or more than 30 °C for it to hold. This finding has important implications for work on regional variation in human body size and its relationship to temperature...|$|R
