5000|$|The Radium Girls {{were female}} factory workers who {{contracted}} radiation poisoning from painting watch dials with <b>self-luminous</b> <b>paint.</b> Painting {{was done by}} women at three different sites in the United States, and the term now applies to the women working at the facilities. The first, United States Radium factory in Orange, New Jersey, beginning around 1917, at Ottawa, Illinois, {{beginning in the early}} 1920s, and a third facility in Waterbury, Connecticut.|$|E

The tube is then sealed at the desired length using a carbon dioxide laser. Borosilicate is preferred for its strength and resistance to breakage. In the tube, the tritium gives off {{a steady stream of}} electrons due to beta decay. These particles excite the phosphor, causing it to emit a low, steady glow. Tritium is not the only material {{that can be used for}} self-powered lighting. Other beta particle-emitting radioisotopes can also serve. Radium was used to make <b>self-luminous</b> <b>paint</b> from the early years of the 20th century until approximately 1970, but it has been replaced by tritium, which is less hazardous.|$|E

2500|$|Radium was {{formerly}} used in <b>self-luminous</b> <b>paints</b> for watches, nuclear panels, aircraft switches, clocks, and instrument dials. A typical self-luminous watch that uses radium paint contains around 1 microgram of radium. In the mid-1920s, a lawsuit was {{filed against the}} United States Radium Corporation by five dying [...] "Radium Girl" [...] dial painters who had painted radium-based luminous paint on the dials of watches and clocks. The dial painters routinely licked their brushes {{to give them a}} fine point, thereby ingesting radium. Their exposure to radium caused serious health effects which included sores, anemia, and bone cancer. This is because radium is treated as calcium by the body, and deposited in the bones, where radioactivity degrades marrow and can mutate bone cells.|$|R
