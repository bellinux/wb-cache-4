50|$|Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), or pNIPAM, is a {{commonly}} used thermo-responsive material. A hydrogel of pNIPAM becomes hydrophilic and swollen {{in an aqueous}} solution of 32 °C, its low critical solution temperature. Temperatures above that start to dehydrate the hydrogel and cause it shrink, thus achieving shape transformation. Hydrogels composed of pNIPAM and some other polymer, such as 4-hydroxybutyl acrylate (4HBA,) exhibit strong reversibility, where even after 10 cycles of shape change there is no shape deformation. Shannon E. Bakarich et al. created {{a new type of}} 4D printing ink composed of ionic covalent entanglement hydrogels that have a similar structure to standard double network hydrogels. The first polymer network is cross-linked with metal cations while the second is cross-linked with covalent bonds. This hydrogel is then paired with a pNIPAM network for toughening and thermal actuation. In lab testing, this gel showed a shape recovery of 41% - 49% when the starting temperature of 20 °C increased to 60 °C, and then was restored to 20 °C. A fluid controlling smart valve printed from this material was designed to close when touching hot water and open when touching cold water. The valve successfully stayed open in cold water and reduced the flow rate of hot water by 99%. This new type of 4D printed hydrogel is more mechanically robust than other thermally actuating hydrogels and shows potential in applications such as <b>self</b> <b>assembling</b> <b>structures,</b> medical technology, soft robotics, and sensor technology.|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{synthesis}} and characterization of functionalized biosurfaces {{that can be}} used for bioseparations and bio-nanotechnology are reported. A novel protein purification technique that incorporates chelating ligands and polymers onto the same chromatographic matrix is explored. A polysaccharide based gel, agarose, was modified systematically with hybrid ligands of the chelator iminodiacetic acid (IDA) and the polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG). The PEG molecule acts as a blocking polymer that can allow only small proteins to permeate onto the matrix surfaces and form conventional immobilized metal ion affinity chromatographic (IMAC) interactions with the chelators. Kinetic studies of chelator and polymer attachment were performed in order to effectively control the chelator and polymer densities on the matrix. Studies with different PEG surface densities and their effects on the adsorption of several proteins (e. g. myoglobin, lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA)) were evaluated to characterize these new hybrid size exclusion IMAC (SEIMAC) matrices. An exclusion effect was observed while adsorption as observed in IMAC systems took place. Functionalization schemes and procedures were extended in the activation and incorporation of affinity ligands on inorganic surfaces such as gold surfaces. Functional gold platforms were explored for development of nano-interconnects via functionalized self assembled monolayers (FSAMs) on gold to attach specific affinity ligands as linkers to immobilize biomolecules, such as microtubules (MTs). MTs eventually could be utilized as <b>self</b> <b>assembling</b> <b>structures</b> and templates for fabrication of nano-scale bio-interconnect arrays and networks. In this work, different organothiols were used to form FSAMs and anti-glutathione S-transferase was attached as a linker to utilize the attachment of MT cap proteins, gamma-tubulin. The gamma-tubulin could recognize specifically a heterodimer of the MTs and can provide a nucleation center for MT growth. Several methodologies were employed including photolithographic methods and the use of photoreactive compounds for proper micro/nano scale dual protein functionalization of surfaces with homogeneous affinity ligands and with heterogeneous ligands as well...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} self-assembly {{and surface}} modification of gold nanoparticles and nanorods. It {{begins with an}} efficient surface functionalization of gold nanoparticles with a liquid crystalline ligand that structurally resembles liquid crystal 5 CB. Functionalized gold nanoparticles show increased solubility in liquid crystal compared to their alkanethiolated analogues. Surface modification technique was also applied to detoxify gold nanorods for biological applications. The process involves a ligand exchange step where cytotoxic CT AB bilayer of gold nanorods was replaced by thiolated CTAB. Covalent nature of gold-sulfur bond allows for the complete removal of CTAB via centrifugation. Functionalized gold nanorods are virtually non-toxic and they show efficient cellular uptake by cancer cells. This thesis also describes self-assembly of gold nanoparticles and nanorods into well organized colloidal crystals. Slow precipitation technique was implemented to prepare three dimensional colloidal crystals of alkanethiolated gold nanoparticles. Colloidal crystals of gold nanorods were prepared by evaporation induced self -assembly technique. Additionally, orientation of nanorods in a colloidal crystal can be altered from side-on to tip-on by controlling the hydrophobicity of the underlying substrate. Our investigation showed {{that the presence of}} excess surfactant (CTAB) strongly influences the crystallization process.

Several techniques are available for patterning; among these, <b>self</b> <b>assembled</b> <b>structures</b> raised great interest. Changing the environmental humidity during solvent evaporation from a cast polymer solution, the condensation of water droplets is promoted, which self-assembled in a regular array; these drops form a template for the formation of an array of pores on the film, called Breath Figures. A similar mechanism seems to happen not only during film casting, but also during the formation of fibers in the electrospinning process. This work is focused on the understanding of the mechanisms involved in pores formation due to the interaction of polymeric solution surface with humidity. The process parameters were controlled to tune the pores arrays features, according to the purpose they are used for. Moreover, the interface between the polymeric surface and the water droplets was exploited to promote the migration of hydrophilic chemical groups, obtaining the chemical functionalization of the inner surfaces of pores. In this way, a topographical and chemical pattern was obtained on the film surface. The formation of pores was studied on the surfaces of flat films and on electrospun fibers; both structures were developed for two main applications: drug release and interactions with cells. Porous films were demonstrated to release proteins in a controlled manner, depending on pores features and on chemical patterning. In particular, the release of protein with high molecular weight was developed. Films were demonstrated to influence cells adhesion depending on pores dimension and distribution. Pores on the surface of fibers where demonstrated to influence the release of drugs from mats produced by coaxial electrospinning. Similarly to films, electrospun fibers were studied to understand their ability to influence cells behavior.

Part III: Using organogels to synthetize nanoparticles and to orient them on a peptide fiber Organogels prepared from two chemically and structurally similar peptides can be mixed to prepare a homogenous 3 D network which will present on its surface complexing properties depending on the structure of the peptides chosen. This scaffold could be used to organize nanoparticles or to prepare silver-based nanostructures.

Polarizing microscopy revealed optical textures for P 65 only, allowing a detailed phase diagram to be determined with features similar to those determined for Pluronics in water and formamide. Small angle neutron scattering experiments were conducted at 1 and 10 wt Pluronic at 25 and 63 C to ascertain whether critical micelle temperatures existed in EAN. SANS experiments using 1 wt solutions at room temperature reveal that the three Pluronics adopt a random flight chain conformation. For 10 wt at room temperature, P 65 and L 81 are dissolved as random coils, but L 121 forms lamellar vesicles. When the temperature is increased, the solubility of the Pluronics in EAN decreases, mostly {{on account of the}} PPO block. At 63 C, P 65 forms micelles, 1 wt L 81 forms lamellar stacks, 10 wt L 81 forms unilamellar vesicles, and L 121 forms bilayer stacks at both concentrations. AFM images of the P 65 silica EAN at room temperature revealed an amorphous layer of surface aggregates for concentrations above 3 wt.

Simulations verified that this minimal model is adequate for homeostasis of preestablished compartments, even in response to small perturbations, and for de novo formation of stable compartments.

Compared to conventional techniques for the modification of wettabililty, lasers offer the advantage of being a relatively simple technique for the modification of surface structure, reducing the need for complex processes. It is hoped that investigations into the reduction of surface reflectivity will have applications in the conversion of solar energy into useable power in the form of solar thermal energy. The production of <b>self</b> <b>assembled</b> <b>structures</b> is demonstrated using diode pumped solid state (DPSS) Nd:YVO 4 lasers operating at wavelengths of 532 and 1064 nm. It is shown that the production of surface microstructures is highly dependant on the correct laser fluence and requires multiple pulses and processing passes. At 1064 nm wavelengths, it has been found highly reproducible surface structures can be formed by carefully controlling laser fluence and scanning speed while keeping the optical arrangement relatively simple. In addition to microstructure formation, the use of ultrafast femtosecond lasers, operating at 400 and 800 nm wavelengths has verified the production of laser induced periodic surface structures. Additionally, the stationary method used to produce these surfaces has been adapted to cover large surface areas with sub wavelength ripple structures with periods of ~ 295 nm and 600 nm. Applications of laser surface microstructures on metals have been studied in an effort to produce hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces on metals. It has been found that the roughness change produced by laser processing induces composite wetting when water droplets are introduced to the surface. Contact angle measurements and small angle XRD analysis of laser processed stainless steel (AISI 304) have shown that surface wettability decreased over a period of approximately one month, leading to steady contact angles of over 140 °. This is attributed to the formation of a magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) oxide layer in the period after laser processing. The effect of surface microstructure on surface reflectivity has also been studied. It was found that laser induced surface microstructures on copper can decrease surface reflectivity by almost 90 %. A comparative study of the effects of surface roughness and chemistry on the optical absorption of copper is given, finding that these surfaces are competitive with contemporary coatings.

40|$|As a new {{frontier}} of foldamer research {{based on the}} synthesis and characterization of oligomers programmed to fold and <b>self</b> <b>assemble</b> into secondary <b>structures</b> continues to open, new scaffolds {{with a variety of}} dimensions are required. Presented here is the synthesis and characterization of a new ortho -Phenylene Ethynylene (o-PE) backbone scaffold. This scaffold has been synthesized using Sonogashira methods with a variety of building blocks containing π-rich and π-poor elements substituted with non polar and polar substituents. Solvent induced folding of these short oligomers into well defined helices was confirmed via 1 D and 2 D NMR methods. Utilizing the electron rich and electron poor phenylene building blocks, variations of these o-PE oligomers have been synthesized to determine the folded stability of π-rich vs. π-poor vs. π-poor/rich systems. Variations in temperature offer a route, aside from solvent denaturation, to probe the stability of the folded structures. This is the first report of a highly detailed solution NMR characterization using 1 -D and 2 -D methods examining the folding of a PE backbone without hydrogen bonds, and the first for an oPE system in general. ...|$|R

We have conducted an exhaustive {{study on the}} interaction and self-assembly occurring between a-lactalbumin and lysozyme, two homologous oppositely charged globular proteins. Under controlled physico-chemical conditions, we showed that the self-assembly process between these two proteins can be oriented towards the formation of original spherical particles of about 2 - 3 μm. The mechanism behind such protein self-assembly and the properties of formed microspheres were further investigated. In this communication, we will address first the initial step of the interaction leading {{to the formation of}} heterodimers as assessed by fluorescence techniques [1]. The propensity of formed heterodimers to further <b>self</b> <b>assemble</b> into supramolecular <b>structures</b> is discussed on the light of subtle conformational change occurring on a-lactalbumin and consequently on formed heterodimers according to the temperature and the presence of calcium ions [2,]. Secondly, we will report on the main properties of formed microspheres as revealed by microscopic techniques in particular how both proteins are arranged into formed supra-molecular structures. Finally, based on kinetic studies, we will discuss a possible mechanism for the formation of α-Lactalbumin/Lysozyme microspheres [3]...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{computers}} promise vastly enhanced computational {{power and}} an {{uncanny ability to}} solve classically intractable problems. However, few proposals exist for robust, solid state implementation of such computers where the quantum gates are sufficiently miniaturized to have nanometer-scale dimensions. Here I present a new design for a nanoscale universal quantum gate. It consists of two adjacent quantum dots each containing a single electron. The spin of each electron encodes a qubit. Ferromagnetic contacts are used to coherently inject an electron into each dot with a definite spin orientation, thus defining the initial state of the qubit. To rotate the qubit, we exploit the fact that the ground state of the electron is spin-split because of the magnetic field caused by the ferromagnetic contacts, as well as the Rashba interaction arising from spin-orbit coupling. Arbitrary qubit rotations are effected by modulating the Rashba splitting with an external electrostatic potential and bringing the total spin splitting energy in a target quantum dot in resonance with a global ac magnetic field [...] The controlled dynamics of the universal 2 -qubit rotation operation can be realized by controlling the exchange coupling between the two dots with yet another gate potential which changes the overlap between the wavefunctions of the two electrons. The qubit (spin orientation) is read via the current induced between the ferromagnetic layers under an applied potential. The ferromagnetic layers act as “polarizers ” and “analyzers ” for spin injection and detection. A complete prescription for initialization of the computer and data input/output operations is presented. Finally, we define a clear pathway towards <b>self</b> <b>assembling</b> this <b>structure</b> using chemical synthesis and some lithography. Corresponding author...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis is to {{synthesis}} new for {{the delivery of}} platinum chemotherapeutics. Water soluble block copolymers were initially synthesised using oligo(ethylene glycol) methylether methacrylate (OEGMEMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) and upon the attachment of platinum (IV) complex (Oxoplatin) the polymer becomes amphiphilic and <b>self</b> <b>assembles</b> into micelle <b>structure</b> in aqueous environment. The surfaces of these macromolecular micelles are decorated with folic acid for enhanced tumour targeting ability and are internalised via specific cellular uptake pathway – receptor mediated endocytosis (RME). The attachment of folate is achieved via the R-group modification of the RAFT agent used in polymerisation resulting in polymers to terminate with a dopamine functionalised end group. The attachment between folate and the terminals of the polymer exist in a reversible boronate ester group and its binding conditions have been investigated in this thesis. The in vitro studies show a promising antitumor activity from the platinum (IV) incorporated micellar delivery system and that the cytotoxicity can be enhanced by stabilising the micelle structure via crosslinking and the attachment of folate on the surface for pathway specific endocytosis. The cytotoxic properties of platinum incorporated micelles can also be increased by utilising a dual drug system with curcumin which has also been explored in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} {{to the creation of}} macroscopic materials and objects comprising aligned nanotube segments. The invention entails aligning single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) segments that are suspended in a fluid medium and then removing the aligned segments from suspension in a way that macroscopic, ordered assemblies of SWNT are formed. The invention is further directed to controlling the natural proclivity of nanotube segments to <b>self</b> <b>assemble</b> into ordered <b>structures</b> by modifying the environment of the nanotubes and the history of that environment prior to and during the process. The materials and objects are “macroscopic” in that they are large enough to be seen without the aid of a microscope or of the dimensions of such objects. These macroscopic, ordered SWNT materials and objects have the remarkable physical, electrical, and chemical properties that SWNT exhibit on the microscopic scale because they are comprised nanotubes, each of which is aligned in the same direction and in contact with its nearest neighbors. An ordered assembly of closest SWNT also serves as a template for growth of more and larger ordered assemblies. An ordered assembly further serves as a foundation for post processing treatments that modify the assembly internally to specifically enhance selected material properties such as shear strength, tensile strength, compressive strength, toughness, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity...|$|R
