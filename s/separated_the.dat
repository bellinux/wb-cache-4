5|$|An {{alternative}} systematic scheme exists using gill morphology. This {{distinguishes between}} Protobranchia, Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia. The first corresponds to Newell's Palaeotaxodonta and Cryptodonta, {{the second to}} his Pteriomorphia, with the last corresponding to all other groups. In addition, Franc <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> Septibranchia from his eulamellibranchs because of the morphological differences between them. The septibranchs belong to the superfamily Poromyoidea and are carnivorous, having a muscular septum instead of filamentous gills.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1950s, HIAG {{established}} {{an image that}} <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes {{that could not be}} denied to the Allgemeine-SS (security and police), the SS-Totenkopfverbände and the Einsatzgruppen. The Waffen-SS was thus successfully integrated into the myth of the clean Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|In 1761 {{the wider}} estate and the castle were <b>separated,</b> <b>the</b> former being leased to the Duke of Bridgewater, {{while the latter}} {{remained}} in the direct control of the Duchy of Cornwall. In 1863, the surrounding estates and park were sold off altogether by the duchy to Earl Brownlow; Brownlow also agreed to rent the castle from the duchy for a nominal rent.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, the Air Ministry officially <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> {{two sites}} administratively, {{so that the}} depot site and {{accommodation}} site (RAF Blenheim Crescent) were considered two separate RAF stations.

5|$|In 1959, Hanoi {{established}} the 559th Transportation Group {{under the command}} of Colonel (later General) Võ Bẩm to improve and maintain a transportation system to supply the NLF uprising against the South Vietnamese government.

5|$|In {{some species}} of RNA virus, the genes {{are not on}} a {{continuous}} molecule of RNA, but are <b>separated.</b> <b>The</b> influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called reassortment.|$|E

40|$|Most {{single channel}} audio source {{separation}} (SCASS) approaches produce separated sources accompanied by interference {{from other sources}} and other distortions. To tackle this problem, we propose to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> sources in two stages. In the first stage, <b>the</b> sources are <b>separated</b> from <b>the</b> mixed signal. In the second stage, the interference between <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources and <b>the</b> distortions are reduced using deep neural networks (DNNs). We propose two methods that use DNNs {{to improve the quality}} of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources in <b>the</b> second stage. In the first method, each separated source is improved individually using its own trained DNN, while in the second method all <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources are improved together using a single DNN. To further improve the quality of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources, <b>the</b> DNNs in the second stage are trained discriminatively to further decrease the interference and the distortions of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources. Our experimental results show that using two stages of separation improves the quality of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> signals by decreasing the interference between <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources and distortions compared to <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> sources using a single stage of separation...|$|R
5|$|Moravian {{palaeontologist}} Ferdinand Stoliczka <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> Himalayan {{population as}} a third subspecies, P.g.forsythi, but {{this has not been}} widely accepted and is usually treated as synonymous with digitatus.

5|$|The Australian-designed and {{manufactured}} Type 3 Teleradio transmitter/receiver {{had been developed}} prior to the war by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) (AWA) to provide long-range wireless communications across Australia and in the surrounding islands of New Guinea, the Solomons, and Fiji where the plantations, airstrips, mines and settlements were widely <b>separated.</b> <b>The</b> isolated nature of civilian out-stations in these areas meant {{that there was no}} other means of communication available.|$|E
5|$|The first {{cladistic}} {{analysis to}} encompass the interrelationships of Hadrosauridae was conducted by Weishampel and Horner (1990). They found Saurolophinae synonymous with Hadrosaurinae, but only <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> subfamily into two groups. The first group included Gryposaurus, Aralosaurus, Maiasaura, and Brachylophosaurus. The other contained Edmontosaurus, Saurolophus, Prosaurolophus, Lophorhothon, and Shantungosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The prehistoric {{breakup of}} the supercontinent Gondwana <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> Madagascar–Antarctica–India landmass from the Africa–South America landmass around 135million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88million years ago, {{allowing}} plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation.

50|$|The right lobe is {{functionally}} <b>separated</b> from <b>the</b> left lobe by {{the middle}} hepatic vein.

5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian {{adopted a}} policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable. Hadrian's Wall, which <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> Roman world from {{what was perceived as}} an ever-present barbarian threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort.|$|E
5|$|A bailey, {{also called}} a ward, was a {{fortified}} enclosure. It {{was a common}} feature of castles, and most had at least one. The keep {{on top of the}} motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home {{of the rest of the}} lord's household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities were often found in the bailey. Water was supplied by a well or cistern. Over time the focus of high status accommodation shifted from the keep to the bailey; this resulted in the creation of another bailey that <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> high status buildings– such as the lord's chambers and the chapel– from the everyday structures such as the workshops and barracks.|$|E

The third class section was entered from the secondary entrance in Newnham Terrace, and was more sparsely furnished and not equipped with lifts. From the Newnham Terrace entrance a staircase led to a single communal waiting room on the first floor, and to the third class platform on the second floor, much shorter than the first class platform.|$|E

5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. <b>The</b> interatrial septum <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> atria and <b>the</b> interventricular septum <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|R
