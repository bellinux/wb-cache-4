50|$|Web <b>Services</b> <b>Addressing</b> (WS-Addressing) is a {{specification}} of transport-neutral mechanism that allows web <b>services</b> to communicate <b>addressing</b> <b>information.</b> It essentially {{consists of two}} parts: a structure for communicating {{a reference to a}} Web service endpoint, and a set of message addressing properties which associate <b>addressing</b> <b>information</b> with a particular message.|$|R
40|$|Background Families are {{the main}} caring {{resource}} for service users with severe mental health problems. There has been limited work examining the needs of carers of people using forensic mental health services. Aims This study aimed to {{gain an understanding of}} carers satisfaction with services in forensic mental health inpatient settings. Method A survey design was used with 63 carers interviewed by telephone using a structured interview schedule. The data was analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Results Most carers were pleased with the service provided although some negative views were expressed with specific types of contact. Giving appropriate information to carers was strongly associated with satisfaction with the service being provided. Conclusions Carer satisfaction with forensic mental health services is likely to be higher with <b>services</b> that <b>address</b> carers’ <b>information</b> needs. New ways of providing this information may offer greater opportunities for working with carers...|$|R

40|$|The {{users of}} mobile devices {{increasingly}} use networked <b>services</b> to <b>address</b> their <b>information</b> needs. Questions asked by mobile users are {{strongly influenced by}} context factors, such as location and user activity. However in research which has empirically documented the link between mobile information needs and context factors, information about expected answers is scant. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study is to explore the context factors which influence the mobile information needs and the answers expected by mobile users. The results, are obtained by analysing information from paper diaries and digital diaries. This project involved a user study, comprising two different types of studies concerning a paper diary and a digital diary. The analysis of both the paper diary and the digital diary was conducted through grounded theory and taxonomy of information needs. our results indicate a relationship between mobile information needs and context factors and expected answers. Our study explored this relationship between mobile information needs and context factors, and provides a better understanding of the expected answers related to mobile information needs...|$|R

40|$|The {{address signal}} lines are {{connected}} to a semiconductor memory device when they are implemented on the PCB (Printed Circuit Board). So they experience the wiring capacitance and due to this wiring capacitance on printed circuit board the rising and falling time of respective address signal disperse. If the address signal lines change in timing, the following problem occurs. When a microprocessor connected to a semiconductor memory device changes the <b>address</b> <b>information</b> from one <b>address</b> to another address, due to deviation of timing of the change of the signal, the wrong address is generated. In an Asynchronous semiconductor memory device, the change of address is immediately responded. So it also responds to such wrong <b>address</b> <b>information</b> and internal circuit selects the wrong <b>address</b> <b>information</b> and operates corresponds to that wrong address...|$|R
