Specifically, I find a multisite firm with a 10 -percentage-point increase in profit margins will subsequently pay 1. 5 percent more for health insurance, but only at sites served by 6 or fewer major carriers.

40|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Americans have private health insurance, researchers focus almost exclusively on public provision. Data on the private insurance sector is extremely difficult to obtain because health insurance contracts are complex, renegotiated annually, and not <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements.</b> This study makes use of a privately-gathered national database of insurance contracts agreed upon by a sample of large, multisite employers between 1998 and 2005. To gauge the competitiveness of the group health insurance industry, I investigate whether health insurers charge higher premiums, ceteris paribus, to more profitable firms. I find they do, and this result is not driven by cross-sectional differences across firms or plans: firms with positive profit shocks subsequently face higher premium growth, even for the same healthplans. Moreover, this relationship is strongest in geographic markets served by a small number of insurance carriers. Further analysis suggests profits act to increase employers' switching costs, and insurers exploit this inelasticity where they have sufficient bargaining power. Given the rapid industry consolidation during the study period, these findings suggest healthcare insurers possess and exercise market power in an increasing number of geographic markets. ...|$|E

40|$|The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs {{published}} the Heads of the Children First Bill on the 25 th of April 2012. The stated {{purpose of the}} proposed legislation (“the Children First Scheme”) is to place certain aspects of Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children on a statutory footing. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence also {{published the}} Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 on the same day. This legislation (“the Withholding Information Bill”) creates a criminal offence of withholding information in relation to serious specified offences committed against a child or vulnerable person. 1. 2. Section 7 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 provides that the Ombudsman for Children may give advice to Ministers of the Government on any matter relating to the rights and welfare of children, including the probable effect of proposals for legislation. In accordance with this statutory function, the Ombudsman for Children’s Office has set out below a number of observations and recommendations on the proposals put forward by the Government. This submission builds on previous advice provided by the Ombudsman for Children’s Office {{in relation to the}} Scheme of the Withholding Information Bill and the initial proposals to place aspects of Children First on a statutory footing. 1. 3. These initiatives represent a significant development in the legislative framework governing child protection in Ireland. This Office has decided to comment on the Children First Scheme and the Withholding Information Bill in the same submission because of the overlap between them with respect to the issue of reporting abuse. It is acknowledged that the Children First Scheme is broader in scope and addresses other issues such as the general safeguarding obligations on specified organisations, cooperation and information sharing, and the framework for the implementation of Children First. In addition, the threshold for reporting under the Withholding Information Bill differs from the Children First Scheme with respect {{to the nature of the}} offences to be reported and the quality of the information held by the person on whom there is an obligation to report. The Children First Scheme relates primarily to reporting obligations to the HSE, whereas the 4 Withholding Information Bill is concerned with reporting to An Garda Síochána. However, both deal with arrangements for reporting child abuse and, together with the National Vetting Bureau Bill, form a suite of child protection legislation being advanced by the government at present. Moreover, certain individuals will potentially find themselves <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> under both pieces of legislation with respect to the same child protection concerns. As a result, it is important that they be consistent with one another and provide clarity in relation to when and how members of the public, as well as particular organisations and professionals, are to report child protection concerns. 1. 4. This Office previously advised that consideration be given to merging the two Bills or that they be advanced through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the same time. This would assist the Oireachtas in ensuring that the two pieces of legislation cohere fully with each other. As the Oireachtas has already begun its consideration of the Withholding Information Bill 2012, it is recommended that the latter option be taken. It is recommended that the Withholding Information Bill 2012 and the forthcoming Children First Bill 2012 be advanced through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the same time in order to ensure that both pieces of legislation cohere fully with each other...|$|E
