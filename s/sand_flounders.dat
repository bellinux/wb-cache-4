50|$|After {{a period}} of time {{dependent}} on the temperature of the water (usually around a week), the larval sand flounder hatches. Larval <b>sand</b> <b>flounders</b> have a large yolk sac attached to their underside, providing nutrients to the fish until it is large enough to feed itself. At this stage, they are less than a half a centimetre in length. They have an eye on each side of their head and swim upright, as most fish do. As <b>sand</b> <b>flounders</b> grow they begin utilising external food sources such as seaweed spores and algae, and as they grow further, small shrimp and plankton.|$|E
50|$|Large-tooth flounders or <b>sand</b> <b>flounders</b> are a family, Paralichthyidae, of flounders. The family {{contains}} 14 genera with a {{total of}} about 110 species. They lie on the sea bed on their right side; both eyes are always {{on the left side of}} the head, while the Pleuronectidae usually (but not always) have their eyes on the right side of the head.|$|E
50|$|The {{geographic}} {{location of the}} New Zealand <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> determines its spawning period. In the north, it has a long spawning period from March to December. In the south, spawning largely occurs in the spring. A study in the Hauraki Gulf found <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> lay between 100,000 and 500,000 eggs when spawning. The variation {{in the number of}} eggs laid was attributed to the difference in size of the female laying the eggs.|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> is {{a popular}} fish caught by humans to eat. Recreational fishers catch the fish usually in beach seines, setnets or with spears. The Maori used wooden spears to catch what they called ‘Patiki’ at night on mud flats. They would attract the ‘Patiki’ by light from a torch made of pine, spearing them with ease. Commercially <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> are fished by trawl and setnet. <b>Sand</b> <b>flounder</b> {{is very easy to}} cook and {{there are many ways to}} cook and serve it {{depending}} on preferences. At its simplest, it can be served beautifully after washing, drenching in flour and frying each side in a medium hot pan with oil/butter until the skin is crisp. At the moment, <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> numbers are decreasing, but there is no evidence to show that the decline is rapid and they are still common in areas where they are found. So, because of this, they have been classed as Least Concern on the red list category and criteria. For these reasons, there is no current conservation effort to try save <b>sand</b> <b>flounder,</b> but as it is one of the most important commercial fishes in New Zealand ongoing research on the harvest levels and population numbers of this species is needed to make sure that they do not leave the Least Concern class and so that they know if they do, conservation efforts can be made.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>flounder</b> {{are native}} to New Zealand {{so they are}} not found {{anywhere}} else in the world but they are found all over New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Sand {{flounder}} are a {{very important}} commercial fish in New Zealand which means that humans are a predominant predator for them. Flat fishes including the sand flounder are good at camouflage which allows them to hide well from any predators. They are good at it because when they settle they wiggle their marginal fins throwing up a shower of sand or mud which lands on them and makes them almost undetectable. In saying this <b>sand</b> <b>flounders</b> still get preyed on, some predators include tope, spinned dogfish, Maori chief, ling and toadfish. In a study done in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary they found that sand flounder were hosts of many different parasites including Nerocila orbignyi and Heteracanthocephalus peltorhamphi which were both found in {{less than one percent}} of fish sampled. They found trematode’s in 24% of the sand flounder, Hedruris spinigera in 6%, and fungal patches on 13%.|$|E
50|$|The {{juvenile}} R. plebeia {{migrate to}} the shallow water of the estuaries and mudflats where they remain until they mature at two years old. Once R. plebeia reach a mature age and size, they migrate to deeper water of around 30 to 50 metres deep to spawn. After this first migration, they continue to migrate from shallow waters (0-50m) in spring and summer to deeper waters (50-100m) in autumn and winter. Male R. plebeia are smaller than female R. plebeia, maturing at a length of 10 cm, but can grow to 15-17 cm. The females grow faster, with mature size being 16-20 cm long, but they grow to 23-24 cm by age two. By age of three, female <b>sand</b> <b>flounders</b> grow to an average size of 30 cm. The average life span of flounder is three to four years. This equates {{to being able to}} have two years of spawning.|$|E
50|$|The extra {{nutrients}} {{they receive}} from these new food sources {{enables them to}} grow to around {{one and a half}} centimetres by the time they are three weeks old. Above each eye of the sand flounder is a bar of cartilage, and at this stage of its development the cartilage above the left eye is absorbed and the eye begins to move {{from the side of the}} head, until it is next to the right eye. The unusual, twisted shape of the mouth of the sand flounder is due to the movement of the skull and bones as the left eye migrates to the right side of the body. While this slow process is occurring, the sand flounder begins to grow out to the side and flatten, losing its rounded shape. This metamorphism makes swimming as the larval sand flounder was able to difficult and exhausting. The now juvenile <b>sand</b> <b>flounders</b> sink to the bottom and begin swimming as adult flatfish do, by undulating their side fins and for rapid acceleration, use their tail.|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand <b>sand</b> <b>{{flounder}},</b> Rhombosolea plebeia, is a righteye flounder of {{the genus}} Rhombosolea, found around New Zealand in shallow waters down to depths of 100 m.|$|R

50|$|New Zealand <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> {{is found}} in a {{majority}} of coastal waters around New Zealand. Its largest population is found at Tasman Bay and on the East Coast of the South Island. Around New Zealand they {{can be found in}} harbours, inlets, bays and open water.|$|R
40|$|The sand {{flounder}} Rhombosolea plebeian (Richardson) si {{found throughout the}} shallow coastal regions and inlets of New Zealand. The object {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship, if any, between the <b>sand</b> <b>flounders</b> inhabiting the bays and inlets of Banks Peninsula and those fish subject to exploitation by trawlers operating in the offshore deeper waters. The aspects studied were as follows. Age determination was based on the interpretation of otoliths. Serveral methods of treatment were tired, staining providing the most successful. Length frequency distributions were analysed for samples taken between January 1964 and February 1967. The apparent shrinkage of fish after death was investigated, and a correction factor calculated for growth rate studies from tag returns. A trial of four varieties of tags was run concurrently with a tagging programme designed to investigate movement, growth and population dynamics. Spaghetti tags were shown to be superior to Petersen discs. Growth data from tag returns was combined with that from otolith and length frequency interpretations, and seasonal and annual growth rates calculated. A close relationship between inshore and offshore fish was proved, and evidence presented which indicated that two separate populations may be present. Feeding habits were investigated, and the results related to age and locality. Population estimations, survival, recruitment and emigration rates were calculated, and the importance of certain inshore regions to the offshore grounds discussed...|$|E
40|$|Dorsal muscle {{phosphatidylcholine}} (PC) {{molecular species}} of sardine, mackerel, big-eyed tuna, brown sole, <b>sand</b> <b>flounder,</b> rock fish, Alaska pollack, chum salmon, blue shark, mackerel shark, carp and rainbow trout were analyzed on HPLC. Flat fish such as brown sole and <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> were extremely characteristic, since these fish contained (16 : 0) (20 : 5) {{as the most}} prominent molecular species {{unlike the rest of}} the fish that had (16 : 0) (22 : 6) as the most prominant molecular species. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the PC molecular species suggested that except for sardine dark muscle, chum salmon (feeding migration stage) and rainbow trout, a common correspondant movement against seasonal change in the content of (20 : 5) (20 : 5) was observed in the majority of these fishes...|$|R
40|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> Rhombosolea plebeia (Richardson) (Pleuronectidae) inhabits shallow coastal {{marine and}} {{brackish}} water regions throughout New Zealand, Auckland Islands and possibly Australia. Relatively {{little research has}} been carried out on this important commercial species. The principal investigation up to the present time is an unpublished Ph. D. thesis by Mundy (1968), who carried out a population study involving tagging of adult fish off the Canterbury coast. Some data were provided as part of a study on the fish population of the Avon-Heathcote Estuary by Webb (1966, 1972, 1973 a, 1973 b). A Ph. D. study on osmoregulation of <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> from Otago Harbour has been completed by Raj (1973), and a study of flounder spawning in the Hauraki Gulf has also been recently published by Colman (1973). The shallow water inlets and estuaries around the Canterbury coast act as a nursery for young stages of <b>sand</b> <b>flounder.</b> While some population and feeding studies have been carried out on the older age classes, little is known of its early development, natural history and physiology. The Avon-Heathcote Estuary (latitude 43 ° 32 'S., longitude 172 ° 43 'E.), the study area in the present investigation (Fig. 1), is one of these nursery areas for the young stages. It is probably the principal area for producing fish to restock the offshore grounds which provide the commercial catches on the east coast of the South Island (Mundy, 1968). <b>Sand</b> <b>flounder</b> is an important commercial species, both in terms of public demand and in the volume of landings. The annual landings of' flounder of all species in New Zealand from 1944 - 1970 was about 907, 730 kg, and of this total <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> formed about 50 percent (New Zealand Marine Department, Reports on Fisheries, 1944 - 1970). Hence the study of its biology in a major nursery area and of the effects of man-made environmental changes and pollution is important. The Christchurch Drainage Board proposes to control flooding in the City of Christchurch and have had several flood control schemes tested by the Hydraulics Research Station, Wallingford, England. They have also commissioned an intensive biological research programme on the Avon-Heathcote Estuary headed by Professor G. A. Knox, Department of Zoology, University of Canterbury to assess the effects of' these flood control schemes. The present study forms part of this biological research programme. The flood control schemes include proposals to erect a barrier near the Estuary mouth. If spring tides coincide with heavy rainfall, surface flooding in parts of Christchurch becomes a problem. When flooding is imminent it is proposed that the barrier gates will be closed at low water to prevent tidal penetration so that flood water can drain into the Estuary without being retarded by the incoming tide. Any such scheme affecting the biology of the Estuary must be carefully considered as undesirable effects may result. The first general study of the biology of the Estuary was made by Thompson (1930), whose work forms a useful basis with which to compare changes that have occurred since then. More specific studies have been made on polychaetes (Estcourt, 1962), fish populations (Webb, 1966), <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> (Mundy, 1968) and benthic macrofauna (Voller, 1973), and a number of surveys directed at the effect of pollution in the Estuary have been carried out by Bruce (1953), Williams (1959), Rosenburg (1963), Webb (1965) and Cameron (1969). Pollution studies of the Avon and Heathcote Rivers have been published by Hogan and Wilkinson (1959) and Cameron (1970). Other studies including Estuary populations as part of more extensive research have also been carried out (for a complete bibliography see Knox and Kilner, 1973). Research currently in progress, in addition to the O+ <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> study, include studies on the algal communities, a water chemical analysis programme and an investigation of the biology of the Christchurch Drainage Board’s Sewage Oxidation Ponds. A report on the general ecology of the Estuary has been prepared recently (Knox and Kilner, 1973), and this summarizes much of the above material and includes other relevant information...|$|R
40|$|An elucidation of the {{mechanisms}} of chromatophore control in tclcost fishes involves consideration of {{the participation of the}} nervous system (pigment concentrating and dis-persing fibers) and an evaluation of influences mediated by pituitary hormones. The <b>sand</b> <b>flounder,</b> Scopthalamus aquas-us Norman (Lophosetta muculatu Gill) was investigated by neurological and pharmacological methods. Nerve cutting, blocking and stimulation experiments revealed unequivocally functional pigment aggregating but not dispersing fibers. Acetyl choline and eserine when injected into the spinal cord bring about excitation of pigment concentrating nerve fibers but have no local effect on melanocytes. Drugs causing local pigment aggregation are aromatic ethyl amines or hydrazines. Epinephrine, norepine-phrine ‘and dopamine are extremely active. The most potent pigment dispersing drugs were certain phenothiazine tranquilizers. Pretreatment with pyrogallol markedly potentiated epinephrine and norepinephrine but raised the effective dose of five of the drugs having pigment dispersing properties. The pharmacological data suggest a catechol amine as the transmitter at concentrating nerve fiber endings, and that the enzyme catechol-o-methyl transferase is involved in the physiology of color change in the <b>sand</b> <b>flounder...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> feeds off a yolk-sac {{attached}} to its under surface {{until they are}} capable of fending for themselves. As an adult it is adapted to feed best at night on sand or mud. They are ambush predators, going unnoticed by camouflage and then attacking their prey when it comes near. They eat a variety of bottom-dwelling invertebrates such as crabs, brittlestars, shrimps, worms, whitebait, shellfish and tiny fishes located by touch and vision. They also ingest mud detritus and seaweed while feeding.|$|R
50|$|Like other flatfish, the larval <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> {{begins its}} life {{with an eye}} on each side of its head and a round body shape, {{swimming}} upright through the midwater. As it grows out of this larval stage entering the juvenile stage one eye moves to the right side leaving the other blind and it takes on a flat diamond shape swimming flat/parallel to the ground. On the right side, the fish is a greenish brown dark colour or grey with faint mottling and on the left side (the side it lies on without eyes) it is white. The average length of an adult <b>sand</b> <b>flounder</b> is 25-35 cm with the maximum being 45 cm. In the day time, they lie on the seabed camouflaged almost perfectly in sand or mud; they have special pigment cells on their skin that can change colour to match their background, their protruding blue-green eyes being their only giveaway. They swim in a flowing style with an undulating movement of the side fins and when threatened by predators their tail is used for propulsion. Technically the adult swims on its side with the continuous dorsal fin fringing one edge of its diamond shaped body and its extended anal fin on the other. It has no swim bladder and only leaves the seabed for courtship and spawning activities.|$|R

40|$|The New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries {{relies on}} fishery {{assessments}} to determine suitable catch quotas for exploited fisheries. Currently, 628 fish stocks are managed in New Zealand using the Quote Management System, {{which includes the}} 8 com- mercial flatfish species caught within the Exclusive Economic Zone. These eight species of flatfish, which includes four species of flounder, two species of sole, brill and turbot, are currently managed using a combined catch quota. Since these eight species are managed using a common catch quota, there is concern {{that some of the}} individual species may be under or over-fished. This thesis describes work involving the flatfish species caught in the FLA 3 man- agement area, around the south island of New Zealand. The FLA 3 management area contains three key species: New Zealand sole, lemon sole, and <b>sand</b> <b>flounder.</b> Due to the nature and limitations of the data available, simple biomass dynamic models were applied to these species. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian goodness of fit techniques were used to estimate the model parameters. Three models were used: the Fox model, the Schaefer model and the Pella-Tomlinson model with m = 3. As a mathematical/statistical exercise, these models were used to conduct a risk analysis to analyse {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} six management options for setting a TACC. However, because of issues over the way that the parameter K has been modelled (due to necessity caused by the lack of data), this should not be seen as an appropriate method for estimating the fish stock. Conclusions were drawn from the results regarding suitable future action for the assessment and management of flatfish stock in FLA 3...|$|R
5|$|Like all flounders, Peacock flounders, Bothus mancus, have {{excellent}} adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and hormones. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the <b>sand,</b> the <b>flounder</b> has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|R

40|$|New Zealand’s {{coastal waters}} are an {{integral}} part of the social, economic and environmental heritage of this Pacific archipelago. Evolving in isolation for 82 million years under volatile tectonic action and volcanism, the marine biogeography of New Zealand is complex and diverse. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the subdivisions of biogeographic areas based on species distributions, habitat and population genetics. In this study, I test whether there is differentiation in coastal population connectivity between northern and southern provinces, the location of the break and what environmental factors may explain the patterns observed. Sandy, soft bottom and estuarine ecosystems make up a large proportion of the coastline, but are not well-represented in population genetic studies in New Zealand and internationally. I chose Rhombosolea leporina (<b>sand</b> <b>flounder)</b> and Rhombosolea plebeia (yellowbelly flounder) as endemic, commercially and traditionally important inhabitants of the shallow coastal waters and estuaries to explore levels of gene flow among most of the marine biogeographic regions of the New Zealand mainland. The goal of this thesis research was to (1) develop polymorphic DNA microsatellite markers and (2) investigate the population genetic patterns at multiple spatial scales. Although these species have a relatively long pelagic larval duration (PLD) of ~ 70 days, I found a significant level of population structure for both species. There was a pattern of isolation by distance and a north to south break in connectivity on the east coast for R. plebeia, but an east to west disjunction in R. leporina. There was no evidence of a north to south genetic break in R. leporina, however populations on the south east coast of the South Island were significantly differentiated in both species. A test for temporal effects (3) of genetic variation was conducted to determine whether spatial patterns of differentiation were consistent across multiple sampling seasons and age classes. Aspects of the sweepstakes recruitment success (SRS) hypothesis were tested by examining differences in allele frequencies and levels of genetic diversity as a function of time. The analyses found evidence of temporal stability between years and between juveniles and adults. Lastly, (4) the coastal and estuarine environmental variables were modelled using information from two public GIS datasets and several measures of genetic differentiation. The aim of this chapter was to determine which environmental and geospatial factors showed a significant level of correlation with the spatial genetic patterns reported in the earlier studies. For R. leporina, latitude, sediment and current speeds were significantly correlated with the genetic estimates of FST, F’ST and Jost’s D. In R. plebeia, a correlation was found between latitude, longitude, sediment, current speeds, sea surface temperature and width of the estuary mouth. The results of the modelling study suggest avenues for further research using candidate genes, such as heat shock proteins and rhodopsin. This was the first study of New Zealand pleuronectids using a multidisciplinary approach with microsatellite DNA markers, GIS, and an array of bioinformatics software to study coastal connectivity on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Significant genetic structuring was found among populations of animals that are potentially well connected through continuous sandy, soft bottom environments and a long PLD. Despite similar life histories and ecologies, the two species were quite divergent in that there was little cross amplification of markers, different patterns of genetic structure and separate outcomes from environmental modelling. These results suggest that managing several species under one management plan may be an oversimplification of the complexities of the population dynamics and evolutionary histories of these species. Conservation and management options for coastal fisheries and possible avenues for future research are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Several {{species of}} {{flatfish}} in the Southern New England (SNE) area have been assessed as overfished {{and in need}} of rebuilding. These species have some common characteristics in terms of life history patterns, use of habitat, and distribution. Many are targeted species in directed fisheries; others are bycatch/discard species, especially in the small mesh fishery in SNE for squid, (Loligo pealeii), butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) and scup (Stenotomus chrysops); these species include summer (Paralichthys dentatus), winter (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), yellowtail (Limanda ferruginea) and windowpane (Scophthalmus aquosus) flounders. As a result, {{there is a need to}} find gear solutions to prevent capture. A modified fishing net (MFN) was designed using a standard bottom trawl squid net with the addition of 30. 5 cm (12 inch) extensions to the headrope and a 30. 5 cm (12 inch) drop chain between the sweep and the footrope. It was tested on its ability to reduce the capture of flatfish by creating a space between the sweep and the footrope. Initial testing to make adjustments to the sweep design of the modified fishing net was conducted at the flume tank facility at the Centre for Sustainable Aquatic Resources located at the Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland. ^ A catch characterization study was conducted aboard two commercial fishing vessels targeting squid using the 2 ̆ 2 side-by-side 2 ̆ 2 towing method comparing the standard fishing net (SFN) with the MFN. The nets were switched every two days and used an equal number of times on each vessel. Work was done over 12 months around Block Island Sound and Rhode Island Sound and consisted of 8 fishing days. Each fishing day consisted of six 40 minute tows. For each tow all flatfish were sampled or if necessary a sub-sample was taken following Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) protocols (NEFSC 2010). Catch included target species, (i. e. squid, butterfish, scup), <b>flounder</b> species (fluke, <b>sand</b> dabs, fourspot <b>flounder</b> (Paralichthys oblongus), winter flounder, yellowtail flounder) and skate (Leucoraja erinacea) which were weighed. Other appropriate bycatch was also sampled and weighed. When appropriate, flatfish species were measured and sorted into sublegal and legal sizes prior to weighing. ^ After checking for vessel effects, a paired t-test was used to test for differences between the combined mean weight (catch by species) per tow (in kilograms) of the SFN and MFN. Results show a significant difference between mean weights per tow for summer, winter, yellowtail, fourspot and windowpane flounders. There was no significant difference between mean weights captured by the SFN and MFN for all three target species. ^ The findings of this research indicate the 30. 5 cm (12 in.) drop chain trawl net design has the ability to reduce the capture of flatfish while retaining target species in the small mesh fishery of Southern New England. ...|$|R
