5|$|Since the {{hourglass}} {{was one of}} the few reliable {{methods of}} measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting Allegory of Good Government, by Ambrogio Lorenzetti, from 1338. From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices. The hourglass also took on <b>symbolic</b> <b>meanings,</b> such as that of death, temperance, opportunity, and Father Time, usually represented as a bearded, old man. Though also used in China, the hourglass's history there is unknown. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1522.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have <b>symbolic</b> <b>meanings.</b> Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we can see that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Beyond their {{functional}} utility {{products have}} a <b>symbolic</b> <b>meaning.</b> Parts of this <b>symbolic</b> <b>meaning</b> are {{accounted for by}} concepts like brand personality and product-user image, which describe the <b>symbolic</b> <b>meaning</b> associated with the brand or product class. However, the physical product also carries <b>symbolic</b> <b>meaning.</b> That part of the <b>symbolic</b> <b>meaning</b> that refers to the physical product itself, and is described with human personality characteristics, is called product personality. The {{purpose of this article}} is to show that product personality positively influences consumer preference through a congruence effect. Design/methodology/approach: A two-phase study was conducted. In the first phase, product-personality congruence was measured. The second phase was used to establish user-image congruence. Findings: The results indicate that people prefer products with a product personality that matches their self-image. Moreover, this positive effect of product-personality congruence is found to be independent of the user-image congruence effect. Originality/value: Previous research has shown that product variants can be designed to have a specific personality. This study has shown that product-personality congruence has a positive effect on consumer preference...|$|R

500|$|The lily {{appears in}} ancient {{literature}} associated with both sovereignty and virginal innocence, and is mentioned {{on a number}} of occasions in the Bible, such as the description in Solomon's Song of Songs (2, 1–2) [...] "I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the young women" [...] or the Gospel of Mathew (6, 28) [...] "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin" [...] to represent beauty. Artistic representations can be found as far back as frescos from the second century BC, at Amnisos and Knossos. Early Christian churches, such as that of the Basilica of Sant' Apollinare in Classe were sometimes decorated with lilies. While predominantly depicted as white, those seen at Akrotiri are red lilies. The white lily has long been seen as a symbol of purity, coming to be associated with the Virgin Mary in the Middle Ages, from which came the name ‘Madonna lily’ (Lilium candidum). A well-known example is Leonardo da Vinci's Annunciation (1472–1475) in which the archangel Gabriel bears a Madonna lily. Other <b>symbolic</b> <b>meanings</b> include glory, love and birth.|$|E
