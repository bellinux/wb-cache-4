The Serghaya fault branches off the Hula Eastern Border Fault, continuing northeastwards {{to the south}} of Mount Hermon into the Anti-Lebanon range where it becomes SSW-NNE trending. The fault has a <b>slip</b> <b>rate</b> of about 1.4mm per year. Movement on this fault is thought to be responsible for the November 1759 earthquake. The Rachaya fault also branches off the Hula Eastern Border Fault, trending SSW-NNE, passing to the north of Mount Hermon. No <b>slip</b> <b>rate</b> has yet been estimated for this fault. The Rachaya fault is the interpreted location of the October 1759 earthquake.|$|E

25|$|This fault segment, {{also known}} as the Ghab fault, runs for about 70km from the {{northern}} end of the Yammouneh fault into the Ghab basin. The estimated <b>slip</b> <b>rate</b> for this segment is 6.9mm per year. Major historical earthquakes interpreted to have occurred along this structure include the Mw>7 events in AD 115 and 1170. No major earthquakes have been recorded since 1170, suggesting that such an event is overdue.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{hysteresis}} synchronous motors {{typically are}} (essentially) two-phase motors with a phase-shifting capacitor for one phase. They start like induction motors, but when <b>slip</b> <b>rate</b> decreases sufficiently, the rotor (a smooth cylinder) becomes temporarily magnetized. Its distributed poles make it {{act like a}} PMSM. The rotor material, {{like that of a}} common nail, will stay magnetized, but can also be demagnetized with little difficulty. Once running, the rotor poles stay in place; they do not drift.|$|E
25|$|The Yammouneh {{fault is}} the main fault strand within the Lebanon {{restraining}} bend, carrying most of the plate boundary displacement. It is SSW-NNE trending and runs for about 170km from the northwestern end of the Hula Basin to its junction with the Missyaf Fault. It has been the location of several major historical earthquakes, such as the 1202 Syria event. The estimated average <b>slip</b> <b>rate</b> along the Yammouneh fault is 4.0 to 5.5mm per year, with a major earthquake recurrence interval of 1020 to 1175 years.

One researcher stated that the recurrence interval for such an event would be greater than 5,000 years. Another proposal was for one of the seven individual segments to rupture in a M6.4–6.6 event, comparable with the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. The recurrence interval for this type of event was placed at 200 years.|$|E

500|$|The M7.3 {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} the strike-slip White Wolf Fault in the southern San Joaqin Valley. Historically, the left-lateral fault has had a component of reverse slip, {{and at the time}} of the July mainshock the ratio of reverse/left-lateral slip was about 1.2:1. The epicenter of the shock was at the [...] fault's southwestern end, at a point where it may end, or merge with the east–west trending Pleito thrust fault. The White Wolf Fault (as illuminated by the aftershocks) was found to be curved, with less dip on the northeast end, though that zone also had a higher strike-slip component. Other distinct characteristics on that end of the fault were the shallower shocks and the less overall slip. If the total fault displacement came about as a result of the same type of large-displacement shocks like the one in 1952, the recurrence interval was proposed to be 170–450 years. The 1995 Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities gave a (high uncertainty) <b>slip</b> <b>rate</b> estimate of 2mm per year.|$|E

2500|$|The {{obliquity}} of convergence between PA and the IBM arc system change markedly {{along the}} IBM arc system. Plate convergence inferred from earthquake slip vectors is nearly strike-slip in the northernmost Marianas, adjacent to {{and south of}} the northern terminus of the Mariana Trough, where the arc has been ‘bowed-out’ by back-arc basin opening, resulting in a trench which strikes approximately parallel to the convergence vectors. [...] Convergence is strongly oblique for most of the Mariana Arc system but is more nearly orthogonal for the southernmost Marianas and most of the Izu-Bonin segments. [...] noted that the arc-parallel <b>slip</b> <b>rate</b> in the forearc [...] reaches a maximum of 30mm/yr in the northern Marianas.

40|$|We present marine {{high-resolution}} seismic reflection {{data from}} Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, {{to discern the}} underlying structure and estimate Quaternary <b>slip</b> <b>rates</b> in this actively extending Basin and Range system. The sediment patterns and structures imaged on our seismic profiles reveal a complex geologic system that reflects a changing climate record, shallow water conditions, growth faulting, contrasting sediment sources, and high <b>slip</b> <b>rates.</b> We observe that Upper Klamath Lake is a sediment-saturated environment, and sediment accumulation rates are therefore controlled by basin subsidence rather than sediment supply. Published <b>slip</b> <b>rates</b> for Holocene extension are greater than our determined late Quaternary <b>slip</b> <b>rates,</b> assuming reasonable rates of deposition. The apparent increased Holocene fault-slip rates may be in part an artifact of long recurrence intervals between major earthquakes, with recent seismicity accommodating long-term strain.

50|$|The 1988 Working Group {{defined the}} segment as two {{parallel}} strands, the Superstition Hills and Superstition Mountain faults, though no <b>slip</b> <b>rate</b> or recurrence interval was known.

On November 24, 1987 the fault ruptured, along with an unknown fault (later named the Elmore Ranch fault). Kenneth W. Hudnut and Kerry Sieh examined the surface rupture (along with a trench investigation) in 1989 and estimated the <b>slip</b> <b>rate</b> for the prior 330 years to be 2 - 6 mm/yr (±1 mm).

50|$|The second {{engagement}} mode uses {{wheel slippage}} control logic.

40|$|Shoreline {{features}} {{formed by}} the late Pleistocene pluvial Lake Dixie in Dixie Valley, central Nevada, record crustal deformation resulting from isostatic rebound of the Lake Lahontan basin, and from Holocene and historic surface faulting. Constructional beach bars {{on the east side}} of Dixie Valley show eastward tilt of 0. 16 m/km, indicating that lithospheric flexure due to isostatic rebound is symmetrical with the west side of the Lahontan basin. The tilt signal is potentially complicated by post-Lake Dixie fault displacements on the west side of the valley. However, elevation changes recorded geodetically across the analogous 1983 Borah Peak, Idaho earthquake ruptures suggest that coseismic deformation is probably not significant {{on the east side of}} the valley relative to the shoreline elevation uncertainties and the overall tilt signal. A survey of faulted shorelines on the west side of the valley suggest that previous fault <b>slip</b> <b>rates</b> estimated from an earlier survey of these same shorelines are in error by nearly a factor of two. Better constrained <b>slip</b> <b>rates</b> from elsewhere along the fault indicate Holocene vertical <b>slip</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 3 – 0. 5 mm/a, consistent with estimates of long term <b>slip</b> <b>rates</b> on the Dixie Valley fault. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Crustal {{deformation}} {{across the}} Marlborough fault {{zone in the}} South Island of New Zealand has been investigated by resurveying with the Global Positioning System (GPS) a triangulation and trilateration network across part of the zone. The principal strain rates, which mostly have errors between 5 % and 10 %, vary systematically across the region. The principal axis of horizontal contraction gradually swings from SE-NW southeast of the Hope fault to almost east-west in the west. The component of velocity parallel to the strike of the faults can account for 95 % of the relative motion between the Australian and Pacific plates. This component exhibits little variation west of the Alpine (Wairau) fault, and shows an almost linear variation from the Wairau fault to the east coast. The horizontal strain rate northwest of the Wairau fault is a small east-west uniaxial contraction (∼ 0. 1 ppm yr- 1). If {{it is assumed that}} the crustal blocks bounded by the major faults are primarily driven by basal shear tractions, with stresses on the faults being relatively insignificant, then the <b>slip</b> <b>rates</b> expected on the faults may be derived from the observed velocity variations across the fault zone. These predicted <b>slip</b> <b>rates</b> are in good agreement with geologically observed <b>slip</b> <b>rates.</b> The larger <b>slip</b> <b>rates</b> on the Hope fault are related to the observation that the strain field extends southeast of the fault over a distance large compared with the spacing between the faults. The agreement between predicted and geological <b>slip</b> <b>rates</b> lends support to the idea that the observed pattern of deformation reflects that in the lower lithosphere.
