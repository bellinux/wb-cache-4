25|$|Results of the zircon {{ages and}} {{possible}} protolith lithologies and their corresponding first-order {{similarities between the}} rock units from Myrow et al. have generally discredited this model. To begin with, the Greater Himalaya yields younger detrital zircon ages than that of Lesser and Tethyan Himalaya, which makes it very unlikely for Greater Himalaya to be a topographic high that separates two depositional basins. All the evidence that supports the passive margin model is also problematic for this model, since the strong paleontological, lithological, and sedimentological relationships between Lesser and Tethyan Himalaya basically rejects the connotation that they were once separated. Missing <b>suture</b> <b>zone</b> rocks in the Main Central Thrust also {{makes it difficult to}} explain this model.|$|E
25|$|This {{reconstruction}} {{predicts that}} the Greater Himalaya thrust over Lesser Himalayan rocks during early Paleozoic. As such. {{it is able to}} more successfully explain the age relationship between the strata across the main central thrust. Other models would require greater slip along the main central thrust during the Cenozoic orogeny to achieve the present stratigraphical arrangement. Deformation produced by Paleozoic tectonics may have been overprinted by the Cenozoic reactivation of the main central thrust, which result in the lack of old <b>suture</b> <b>zone</b> rocks. Moreover, aligned with this model, sediments in northern India have experienced a transition from turbidites to syn-collision sediments in Cambrian to Ordovician. Additional evidence with regard to isotopic signatures and detrital zircon ages may also increase the credibility of this model. Further investigation is required to support more predictions of this model, since metamorphism of the Greater Himalayan strata in early Paleozoic, and Cambrian to Ordovician syn-tectonic sediments in Tethyan Himalaya, are lacking.|$|E
500|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by a rupture along the Abiz Fault, part of the Sistan <b>suture</b> <b>zone</b> of eastern Iran. Located northeast of the main collision zone between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates, the Sistan zone marks the eastern boundary of the Iranian microplate where it intersects with the Afghan crustal block. Most of Iran is contained on one microplate, causing seismic activity mainly along its borders. Both the 1968 Dasht-e-Bayez earthquake (magnitude 7.3, resulting in 12,000–20,000deaths) and the Qayen earthquake were the results of strike-slip faults, meaning that the crustal blocks {{on either side of the}} faults shifted against each other horizontally. The Qayen earthquake {{was caused by}} right lateral movement along the Abiz Fault. In addition to the dominant strike-slip displacement, there was also local evidence of reverse faulting. The average displacement of about 2 m indicates a low static stress drop, more consistent with an interplate earthquake than an intraplate event. The maximum horizontal acceleration during the quake was approximately 6.9 meters per second—nearly three-quarters of the acceleration an object would have in free fall—and occurred near the earthquake's epicenter. The crustal layer involved in the rupture was [...] thick. The surface fault that caused the earthquake extended for , which was longer than would be expected given the earthquake's magnitude.

40|$|The Kumta and Mercara <b>suture</b> <b>zones</b> welding {{together}} Archean crustal {{blocks in}} western peninsular India offer critical insights into Precambrian continental juxtapositions and the crustal evolution of eastern Gondwana. Here we {{present the results}} from an integrated study of the structure, geology, petrology, mineral chemistry, metamorphic P-T conditions, zircon U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotopes of metasedimentary rocks from the two sutures. The dominant rocks in the Kumta suture are greenschist- to amphibolite-facies quartz-phengite schist, garnet-biotite schist, chlorite schist, fuchsite schist and marble. The textural relations, mineral chemistry and thermodynamic modelling of garnet-biotite schist from the Kumta suture indicate peak metamorphic P-T conditions of ca. 11 lobar at 790 degrees C, with detrital SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages ranging from 3420 to 2547 Ma, sHf (t) values from - 9. 2 to 5. 6, and T-DM(c) model ages from 3747 to 2792 Ma. The K-Ar age of phengite from quartz-phengite schist is ca. 1326 Ma and that of biotite from garnet-biotite schist is ca. 1385 Ma, which are interpreted to broadly constrain the timing of metamorphism related to the suturing event. The Mercara suture contains amphibolite- to granulite-facies mylonitic quartzo-feldspathic gneiss, garnet-kyanite-sillimanite gneiss, garnet-biotite-kyanite-gedrite-cordierite gneiss, garnet-biotite-hornblende gneiss, calc-silicate granulite and metagabbro. The textural relations, mineral chemistry and thermodynamic modelling of garnet-biotite-kyanite-gedrite-cordierite gneiss from the Mercara suture indicate peak metamorphic P-T conditions of ca. 13 kbar at 825 degrees C, followed by isothermal decompression and cooling. For pelitic gneisses from the Mercara suture, LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon ages vary from 3249 to 3045 Ma, sHf (t) values range from - 18. 9 to 4. 2, and T-DM(c) model ages vary from 4094 to 3314 Ma. The lower intercept age of detrital zircons in the pelitic gneisses from the Mercara suture ranges from 1464 to 1106 Ma, indicating the approximate timing of a major lead-loss event, possibly corresponding to metamorphism, and is broadly coeval with events in the Kumta suture. Synthesis of the above results indicates that the Kumta and Mercara <b>suture</b> <b>zones</b> incorporated sediments from Palaeoarchean to Mesoproterozoic sources and underwent high-pressure metamorphism in the late Mesoproterozoic. The protolith sediments were derived from regions containing juvenile Palaeoarchean crust, together with detritus from the recycling of older continental crust. Integration of the above results with published data,suggests that the Mesoproterozoic (1460 - 1100 Ma) Kumta and Mercara <b>suture</b> <b>zones</b> separate the Archean (3400 - 2500 Ma) Karwar-Coorg block and Dharwar Craton in western peninsular India. Based on regional structural and other geological data we interpret the Kumta and Mercara <b>suture</b> <b>zones</b> as extensions of the Betsimisaraka suture of eastern Madagascar into western India.

40|$|International audienceA {{polyphase}} {{history of}} oceanic construction and consumption is documented by {{the distribution of}} the Tethyan ophiolitic <b>suture</b> <b>zones</b> in Iran. Despite the geodynamic significance of these <b>suture</b> <b>zones,</b> few modern petrological and geochronological data are available from these ophiolitic domains, hampering a full assessment of the timing, thermobaric regimes and palaeotectonic scenarios leading to oceanic suturing and continental assembly in Iran and, more in general, along the southern margin of Eurasia. In this paper, we describe a newly discovered HP ophiolite mélange within the Rasht ophiolites, at the NW termination of the Palaeo-Tethyan suture in Iran. Petrological investigations on the metamorphic units embedded within the ophiolite mélange are integrated with whole-rock geochemistry and Ar–Ar phengite geochronology to constrain the geotectonic setting of formation and to define the associated P–T–t paths. We provide evidence that the Rasht ophiolite domain corresponds to an exhumed subduction complex formed during Early Carboniferous (c. 350  Ma) subduction of a branch of the Palaeo-Tethyan oceanic realm, with peak metamorphism equilibrated under blueschist- to eclogite-facies metamorphic conditions. Implications of these data for the palaeotectonic reconstruction during closure of the Palaeo-Tethyan ocean and the terminal collisional assembly along the southern margin of the Eurasia plate are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn many Precambrian provinces the {{understanding}} of the tectonic history is constrained by limited exposure and aeromagnetic data provide information below the surface cover of sediments, water, etc. and help build a tectonic model of the region. The advantage of using the aeromagnetic data is that the data set has uniform coverage and is independent of the accessibility of the region. In the present study, available reconnaissance scale aeromagnetic data over Peninsular India are analyzed to understand the magnetic signatures of the Precambrian shield and <b>suture</b> <b>zones</b> thereby throwing light on the tectonics of the region. Utilizing a combination of differential reduction to pole map, analytic signal, vertical and tilt derivative and upward continuation maps we are able to identify magnetic source distribution, tectonic elements, terrane boundaries, <b>suture</b> <b>zones</b> and metamorphic history of the region. The magnetic sources in the region are mainly related to charnockites, iron ore and alkaline intrusives. Our analysis suggests that the Chitradurga boundary shear and Sileru shear are terrane boundaries while we interpret the signatures of Palghat Cauvery and Achankovil shears to represent <b>suture</b> <b>zones.</b> Processes like metamorphism leave their signatures on the magnetic data: prograde granulites (charnockites) and retrograde eclogites are known to have high susceptibility. We find that charnockites intruded by alkali plutons have higher magnetization compared to the retrogressed charnockites. We interpret that the Dharwar craton to the north of isograd representing greenschist to amphibolite facies transition, has been subjected to metamorphism under low geothermal conditions. Some recent studies suggest a plate tectonic model of subduction–collision–accretion tectonics around the Palghat Cauvery shear zone (PCSZ). Our analysis is able to identify several west to east trending high amplitude magnetic anomalies with deep sources in the region from Palghat Cauvery shear to Achankovil shear. The magnetic high associated with PCSZ may represent the extruded high pressure–ultra high temperature metamorphic belt (granulites at shallow levels and retrogressed eclogites at deeper levels) formed as a result of subduction process. The EW highs within the Madurai block can be related to the metamorphosed clastic sediments, BIF and mafic/ultramafic bodies resulting from the process of accretion...|$|R
