Using input-output data pairs during the forward pass of the training process, the interval type- 2 TSK FLS output is calculated and the consequent parameters are estimated by recursive least-squares (RLS) method. In the backward pass, the error propagates backward, and the antecedent parameters are estimated by back-propagation (BP) method. The proposed hybrid methodology was used to construct an interval type- 2 TSK fuzzy model capable of approximating the behaviour of the steel strip temperature as it is being rolled in an industrial Hot Strip Mill (HSM) and used to predict the transfer bar surface temperature at the finishing <b>Scale</b> <b>Breaker</b> (SB) entry zone.

40|$|Abstract: A new {{learning}} methodology {{based on}} a hybrid algorithm for interval type- 2 fuzzy logic systems (FLS) parameter estimation is presented. The new proposal consists of Back-Propagation with Recursive Least-Squares (BP-RLS) and Back-Propagation with square-root filter (BP-REFIL). A system with the proposed methodology was simulated to test its capability for output surface temperature prediction of a transfer bar at Hot Strip Mill (HSM) <b>Scale</b> <b>Breaker</b> (SB) entry zone for three different types of coils. The inputs of the system are the surface temperature of the transfer bar and the travelling time required to reach the SB entry zone. The inputs are modelled as singleton, type- 1 or type- 2 fuzzy sets {{depending on whether the}} noise was taken into account or not. The following combinations were simulated: a) interval singleton type- 2 FLS (type- 2 SFLS), b) interval type- 1 nonsingleton type- 2 FLS (type- 2 NSFLS- 1) and c) interval type- 2 non-singleton type- 2 FLS (type- 2 NSFLS- 2), where the bold face terms indicate the kind of input. Modelling results show the feasibility of the proposed methodology to be implemented into an intelligent process controller for the HSM industry. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{practicality}} {{of common}} wave breaking criteria is reviewed. Video {{recordings of the}} sea surface taken from aboard R/P FLIP are used to extract breaking wave properties. The key quantity is Λ(c) dc, the length of breaking crests per unit area propagating with speeds in the range (c, c+ dc). Independent of wave field development, Λ(c) is found to peak at intermediate wave scales and to drop off sharply at larger and smaller scales. For young waves, breakers occur at {{a wide range of}} scales corresponding to phase speeds of about 0. 1 - 1. 0 cp, but in developed seas breaking is hardly observed at scales corresponding to phase speeds> 0. 5 cp. The phase speed of the most frequent breakers shifts from 0. 4 cp to 0. 2 cp as the wave field develops. The relative distribution of <b>breaker</b> <b>scale</b> increases the likelihood of rogue waves in developed seas compared to young seas. The overall breaking rate correlates well with the fraction of steep waves...|$|R
40|$|First, the {{kinematics}} {{and dynamics}} of deep-water plunging breakers of 0. 2 m wave height were investigated. Flow properties were measured using modified particle image velocimetry (PIV) and bubble image velocimetry (BIV); void fraction {{was measured using}} the fiber optic reflectometer (FOR) in the aerated crest region. A similarity profile of void fraction {{was found in the}} successive impinging and splash-up rollers. In the highly foamy splashing roller, the increase of turbulent level and vorticity level were strongly correlated with the increase of void fraction when the range of void fraction was between 0 and 0. 4. When including the density variation due to the air bubbles, the wave energy dissipated exponentially a short distance after breaking about 54 % and 85 % of the total energy dissipated within one and two wavelengths beyond the breaking wave impingement point, respectively. Then, turbulent flow field and bubble size distributions were discussed {{as an extension of the}} first part. The most excited mode of the local intermittency measure of the turbulent flow and its corresponding length scale were obtained using a wavelet-based method and found to correlate with the swirling strength and vorticity. The number of bubbles with a chord length less than 2 mm demonstrated good correlation with the swirling strength. The power law scaling and the Hinze scale of the bubbles determined from the bubble chord length distribution compared favorably with existing measurements. The turbulent dissipation rate, accounting for void fraction, was estimated using mixture theory. A significant discrepancy of approximately 67 % between the total energy dissipation rate and the turbulence dissipation rate was found. Of this uncounted dissipation, 23 % was caused by bubble-induced dissipation. Finally, the kinematics and the bubble entrainment in a 1 -m height of plunging breaking wave in a very large wave tank of 5 m in width and depth and 300 m in length were discussed. To investigate the scale effects, velocity fields, turbulence, and void fraction were compared with the study of small <b>scale</b> plunging <b>breakers</b> (of 0. 2 -m wave height) discussed in the first two chapters. The temporal evolutions of the maximum surface horizontal velocity in the two scales are comparable, with a maximum difference only about 0. 2 CwhereC is the phase velocity. The measured vertical profile of the wave-averaged turbulent kinetic energy can be fitted to an exponential curve, consistent with the previous studies in surf zone breaking waves. The temporal contours of void fraction are similar between the two scales...|$|R
40|$|DP 600 HR {{is one of}} Tata Steels {{hot rolled}} products. It is a dual phase steel unique to Tata Steel for its two step cooling process and low coiling temperature. The {{finished}} product has encountered several surface defects, one of which are imprints. In order to find the root cause for the imprints a literature study, a factory inspection {{and a number of}} experiments have been conducted. To find the origin of the imprint two coils have been produced with the intention to create imprints on the surface. With these trials and the observations in the factories within Tata Steel it is found that a loose oxide layer of 4 - 10 µm thick is formed {{at the end of the}} hot strip mill process. Due to the low coiling temperature a fair amount of water remains on the strip until further processing. At both the recoiler and the pickling line a build-up of loose oxide is seen. From both former trials and the trials done during this project it is seen that a build-up of oxide leaves imprints with a depth of 20 to 150 µm. In order to confirm that the imprints can indeed be produced by loose oxides, two experiments were conducted. Loose oxide particles and bearing balls have been pressed into the steel surface with the result in both cases of imprints that can be compared to the ones obtained in the factory. In this work a new procedure has been developed to test the growth of the oxide layer as well as its adhesion to the steel surface. 1. To grow an oxide layer the Thermo Mechanical Testing Simulator is used. This device is normally used to test hot deformability of metals but its heating chamber can also simulating the run out table two step cooling cycle. Both cooling rates are varied between 30, 60 and 90 K=s keeping initial, intermediate and final temperatures equal to the factory values. 2. To test the adhesion of the oxide to the steel a tensile test is performed with the aid of the ARAMIS optical strain measuring system. Since the ARAMIS system follows optically the changes in the steel surface during straining the oxide layer is usually previously removed, because it will break first and interfere with the measurement. However this fact is used here to our advantage since the strain that is necessary to remove the layer can now be quantified. This loss in measurement data corresponds well to the initial loss of oxide from the sample. From the ARAMIS data it is seen that increasing the cooling rate of the first cooling step decreases the amount of strain required to break the oxide from the steel. The second cooling step does not have a pronounced effect on the adhesiveness. The microscopy analysis showed an unknown oxide layer at the steel/oxide interface. This layer is mainly iron oxide but contains an unusual amount of chromium. It is presently not known how the chromium is distributed in the oxide nor what its effects on the properties of the scale are. It is concluded that the imprints are caused by a build-up of loose oxide on the work rolls. The imprints can be prevented by not using the levelling and <b>scale</b> <b>breaker</b> work rolls. The adhesiveness of the oxide to the steel under deformation can be improved by reducing the cooling rate on the first cooling step. Using the Thermo Mechanical Test Simulator a controlled layer of oxide can be grown on steel samples. The adhesiveness of the oxide layer can then be tested by means of a tensile test while being recorded by ARAMIS. This set-up can be further improved to obtain a standardised oxide adherence testing method. Aerospace EngineeringAerospace Structures and Material...|$|E
40|$|In {{the scope}} of NOURTEC, an EEC project, efforts are made to {{simulate}} the behaviour of executed foreshore supplies {{with the aid of}} mathematical computer models. One of the models used are line models. On behalf of the DUT two studies contribute to NOURTEC line modelling. One concentrates on the longshore transport, and the present study focuses on cross-shore sediment transport. Both studies try to improve the applicability of line models in evaluating and forecasting the behaviour of the coast, specially after a nourishment. The cross-shore profiles supplied and evaluated in {{the scope of}} NOURTEC, and many other cross-shore profiles as well, are characterised by one or more breaker bars. Foreshore supplies very often have the same length <b>scales</b> as these <b>breaker</b> bars. At the Terschelling coast, for instance, a nourishment was executed by filling the trough between the outer two bars. This illustrates that, studying cross-shore morphology after a supply, one should include the phenomenon of breaker bars in the study as well. This report contains a study about both breaker bars and supplies. Concentrating on the cross-shore profile, in this study breaker bars and supplies are interpreted as harmonic or instantaneous disturbances of an equilibrium profile respectively. An equilibrium profile is a profile shape {{for which there is no}} sediment transport. The essence of line modelling is that a cross-shore profile, for given wave and sediment parameters, tends towards an equilibrium shape. Using this concept, breaker bars can be schematised by a harmonic boundary condition and supplies by an initial surplus of sediment in the equilibrium profile. In this study, the equilibrium profile shape and the consequences of a disturbance are described by two expressions. One is the well known continuity equation, and the other is a sediment transport equation. The latter describes the magnitude and the direction of sediment transports as a function of the profile height and the profile slope. Transports due to wave asymmetry, undertow and the gravity force are included in this expression. In case the profile height and the profile slope meet the equilibrium profile shape for a certain location in the profile, the sediment transport equals zero. Thus it follows that, in case of a disturbance of the equilibrium profile slope, these two expressions describe a diffusion process. In this report, the diffusion process is analyzed both analytically and numerically. The analytical part merely concentrates on the derivation of scale rules, not on the accuracy of the outcome. A scale parameter was defined for the diffusion process due to the gravity force. A more extended analysis including wave asymmetry and undertow as well did not lead to significant different results. The analytical part is concluded with a proposal for further study. In the numerical part a computer program is developed based on the sediment transport equation and the continuity equation. As could be expected from the analytical results, no spontaneous increase of any disturbance was found. It appears that breaker bars can only be generated at the upper boundary of the profile. In that case propagation in seawards direction is found, together with a strong dissipation in the upper part of the profile. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
