5000|$|A <b>sun</b> <b>valve</b> (Swedish: solventil, [...] "solar valve") {{is a form}} of {{flow control}} valve, notable because it earned its {{inventor}} Gustaf Dalén the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The AGA {{lighthouse}} [...] "Blockhusudden" [...] {{close to}} Stockholm, initially {{set up in}} 1912. When the lighthouse was electrified in 1980 {{it was discovered that}} the <b>sun</b> <b>valve</b> had been working continuously since 1912 without the need for an overhaul.|$|E
50|$|In 1913 an {{incandescent}} gas mantle {{operated by}} vaporised kerosene was installed, raising the power to 64,000 cd. In 1920 a fixed automatic acetylene gas lamp (carbide lamp) with a <b>sun</b> <b>valve</b> was installed. As a result, the lighthouse was demanned and all other buildings were demolished.|$|E
50|$|Thereafter, the fourth-order lens {{was removed}} from the lantern and {{replaced}} by a 300 mm lens equipped with a 300 candlepower acetylene flasher Dalén light and <b>sun</b> <b>valve.</b> Upon this installation, the light's characteristic was changed to repeated 1-second flash followed by a nine-second eclipse, exhibited initially on the evening of May 20, 1922.|$|E
50|$|Dalen's {{system of}} {{acetylene}} lighting for marine navigation proved very reliable, {{as exemplified by}} the lighthouse at Chumbe Island off Zanzibar. This lighthouse was constructed in 1904 and converted to un-manned automatic acetylene gas operation in 1926. The acetylene lighting installation, controlled by a <b>sun</b> <b>valve,</b> remained in use until the lighthouse was converted to a solar-powered (photovoltaic) system in 2013.|$|E
50|$|In 1936, a 25 meter tall {{steel tower}} was {{installed}} with a gas light. In 1966, a mechanism called <b>sun</b> <b>valve</b> was introduced. Plans {{to construct a}} taller and brighter light and a radio beacon were drawn up. Since there was a paucity of land, the new light was transferred to Puthuvype in the Vypin island and the radio beacon was shifted to Azhikode.|$|E

50|$|All Trinity House lighthouses {{have been}} {{automated}} since November 1998, when the UK's last manned lighthouse, North Foreland in Kent, was converted to automatic operation. Lighthouse automation began {{as long ago}} as 1910, thanks to an invention of Gustaf Dalén. His <b>sun</b> <b>valve</b> was fitted in a number of lighthouses powered by acetylene gas. The vital component was a black metal rod, which was suspended vertically and connected to the gas supply. As it absorbed the sun's heat, the rod expanded downwards, cutting off the gas during the day.|$|E
50|$|In 1932, the Barrenjoey Lighthouse was {{converted}} to automatic operation with {{the installation of}} an acetylene Dalén light of 6,000 candlepower. It was turned off and on by a <b>Sun</b> <b>valve.</b> Although the acetylene gas apparatus was efficient, access to the tower for re-supply presented problems, so in 1972 the lighthouse {{was converted}} to electric operation, with a new lamp capable of 75,000 candlepower. Since the 1980s it has been featured heavily in the soap opera Home and Away, both during the credits and during the show itself.|$|E
50|$|In 1928, {{the tower}} was {{extended}} and the lighthouse reached its current height of 75 ft {{to increase its}} range. In 1928-1930, the keepers' cottages were replaced with timber framed fibro clad structures. In 1930, the lantern underwent major modification. The lantern house was replaced with 7 ft diameter Chance Brothers lantern room. The optical apparatus was replaced with either a third order Chance Bros dioptric lens or a four panel 375 mm AGA catadioptric lens on an AGA pedestal. The light source was replaced by an AGA incandescent gas mantle operated by acetylene gas, and a <b>sun</b> <b>valve</b> was also installed.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} was the predominant form of light source in lighthouses from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant. The system {{was invented by}} Gustaf Dalén and marketed by his company AGA. Dalén later invented the AGA cooker in 1922. The Dalén light is notable because of its <b>sun</b> <b>valve</b> (a.k.a. solar valve), which earned its inventor the Nobel prize in physics. The Carbide lamp {{was developed in the}} early 1900s. While the lamps proved useful in many applications, the problem of safely storing acetylene meant they needed regular refilling which constrained their use in applications such as lighthouses.|$|E
50|$|The second {{lighthouse}} {{was constructed}} in 1895 {{and for a while}} served as the rear light in the range. It had a 7.87 m, timber framed corrugated galvanized iron clad tower, with a lantern and a balcony. The original optical apparatus was a 4th order fixed lens with kerosene wick burner. In 1930 the light was converted to acetylene lighting, with <b>sun</b> <b>valve</b> and flasher. By 1977 the original lens had been removed and a solar powered Tideland ML-300 electric beacon installed. A pilot station was established on the foreshore nearby in 1919, and closed in 1963.|$|E
5000|$|The first carbide mining lamp {{developed}} in the United States was patented in New York on August 28, 1900 by Frederick Baldwin. [...] Another early lamp design is shown in a patent from Duluth, Minnesota on October 21, 1902. In the early 1900s, Gustaf Dalén invented the Dalén light. This combined two of Dalén's previous inventions: the substrate Agamassan and the <b>Sun</b> <b>valve.</b> Inventions and improvements to carbide lamps continued for decades. On March 10, 1925 Andrew Prader of Spokane, Washington was granted a United States Patent, number 1,528,848 for certain new and useful improvements for Acetylene Lamps.|$|E
50|$|In 1739, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was founded, {{with people}} such as Carl Linnaeus and Anders Celsius as early members. Many of the {{companies}} founded by early pioneers still remain major international brands. Gustaf Dalén founded AGA, and received the Nobel Prize for his <b>sun</b> <b>valve.</b> Alfred Nobel invented dynamite and instituted the Nobel Prizes. Lars Magnus Ericsson started the company bearing his name, Ericsson, {{still one of the}} largest telecom companies in the world. Jonas Wenström was an early pioneer in alternating current and is along with Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla credited as one of the inventors of the three-phase electrical system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is situated}} on a hillock. There are 70 masonry steps {{to reach the}} tower. The Lighthouse is an unattended station. A rain water tank and a rest room have been provided for the maintenance staff.A third order revolving optic, on a mercury trough with DA (dissolved acetylene) gas burner and gas motor to revolve the optic, all supplied by M/s BBT, Paris were installed inside the lantern house over the CI tower [...] The light was commissioned on 14 April 1969. Due to frequent failures of the rotation system, the revolving optic assembly was removed and a 500 mm cut-and-polished drum optic was placed in position in 1978. The DA gas burner {{was replaced by a}} DA gas flasher with <b>sun</b> <b>valve.</b> This reduced the consumption of DA gas but the intensity of the light went down.|$|E
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was opened}} in 1865, {{making it one}} of the oldest in the Canaries. Built in a similar style to other Canarian 19th century lights, it consists of a painted single storey house, with dark volcanic rock used for the masonry detailing. A six metre high, masonry tower is attached to the seaward side of the house.The sixth order light was originally powered by olive oil, and gave a steady red light that had a range of 9 miles. In 1883, the oil powered lamp was replaced by one that ran on paraffin, and then in 1923 this was superseded by an acetylene lamp, that provided a longer range, and flashed twice every five seconds. An automatic <b>sun</b> <b>valve</b> was also added, to save the keeper having to light and extinguish the lamp, each day at dusk and dawn. A system of solar panels and batteries now provide the power for a 150 Watt electric halogen lamp, which has a reach of 14 nautical miles. When the lighthouse was automated in the 1960s the keeper and his family were the last to leave the island, which now has no permanent residents.|$|E
