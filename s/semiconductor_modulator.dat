40|$|Semiconductor-based bulk optical {{modulators}} {{and switches}} demand material homogeneity {{and lack of}} residual birefringence, to guarantee low attenuation and noise performances. The fulfillment of such requirements strongly depends on crystal growth technique and machinery process. We have developed a polarimetric two-dimensional mapping technique at λ= 1. 5 μm, that comparatively characterizes the residual stress-induced birefringence of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>modulator</b> rods from a functional point of view, by evaluating the distribution of effective birefringence and estimating the overall noise figure of merit (cross-talk) for optical switching applications. We have examined high-resistivity CdTe rods grown by the horizontal Bridgman technique, and compared results to data from GaAs single crystals grown by horizontal Bridgman, liquid encapsulated Czochralski and vapor pressure controlled Czochralski. The birefringence has been measured with a resolution in the Δn≈ 10 − 7 range; spatial resolution can be adjusted, reaching 10 μm. The performance of CdTe samples is strongly affected {{by the presence of}} dislocations and related localized stress fields, and acceptable performance is reached only for large diameter optical beams, which average birefringent effects on the cross-sectional area of the rod. High volume density of dislocations is intrinsic to single crystals grown by the Bridgman method. Growing techniques from the vapor phase usually result in more homogeneous samples. Therefore, we think that the development of a suitable vapor phase growth method is the key to obtain semi-insulating CdTe bulk crystals to be used for high-performance optical modulation and switching...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{performance}} of some novel devices for an imaging receiver, operating in the frequency band centered at 100 GHz, {{to be used in}} radio astronomy research. The emphasis is given on simple, small and reliable devices {{in order to reduce the}} complexity of an already complex receiver. An imaging receiver at millimeter wavelengths consist basically of several detectors (mixers) looking at different places of the sky, been the image a superposition of all the signals with certain spatial distribution. The coherent receivers used for millimeter wave radio astronomy are today of the heterodyne type, this means that they need an external local oscillator signal (LO) in order to obtain a intermediate frequency (IF) that is processed with conventional mic rowave techniques. This LO signal is, almost all the time, injected by quasi-optical means. Quasi-optical injection of the LO signal to an array of mixers poses the problem of individual power control to each mixer element. Some of the papers here presented introduce a novel approach where, by locally modulating the conductivity of a semicondu ctor, it is possible to achieve spatial modulation of a Gaussian beam. The underlying physics of this method is that the conductivity of a semiconductor can be changed by the generation of free carriers under photonic excitation, thus changing the refractive index of the material. In order to have an efficient splitting of the signal into an array of beams, from a single millimeter wave source, a phase interference device better known as kinoform was designed and tested at the operating frequency giving the expected results. The kinoform and <b>semiconductor</b> <b>modulator</b> were put together in a working device and the results are presented. In order to combine the observed signal, from the sky, and the LO signal we have to use a diplexer that also acts as a frequency selective device, used to reject the image sideband. The relatively long wavelength at 100 GHz makes the traditional design of diplexers quite complicated because of the large physical size needed and the fact that this diplexer must sit inside a dewar at cryogenic temperatures. We explored the design of a new type of diplexer, modeled its response and evaluated its performance. The practical results agree very well with theory. The design of optical elements in this imaging receiver was also something that was faced during this work and thanks to this, some novel results around the performance of lenses and its aberration properties were obtained. In particular we show that, using Teflon manufactured plano-convex lenses, there is no need for special shaping of the lenses to avoid coma effects due to the non-paraxiality of the mixers composing the array...|$|E

The design of the probe allows transmission of increased electric power to the semiconductor component...|$|R
