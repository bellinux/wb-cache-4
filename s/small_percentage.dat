5|$|A <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> {{of golden}} {{tilefish}} {{is known to}} be intersexual, having opposite nonfunctional sex tissues. Male tilefish specimens also inhibited a cavity that came from ovarian tissue and sperm sinuses. Tilefish of both genders in the Gulf of Mexico exhibited a higher rate of intersex characteristics than other populations.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, Unicamp {{is almost entirely}} funded by the government, {{in this particular case}} of the State of São Paulo. Funding is provided mainly from sales taxes, but a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of total budget is obtained from donations, paid extension programs and corporate sponsors.|$|E
50|$|Among Indonesian provinces in 2010, South Sumatra {{reported}} the eleventh smallest number of Christians (114,671) or 0.49% of Christians within Indonesia. South Sumatra had the third <b>smallest</b> <b>percentage</b> (among religions {{reported in the}} province) of Christians (1.54%), including the second <b>smallest</b> <b>percentage</b> of Protestants (0.97%) and eighth <b>smallest</b> <b>percentage</b> of Catholics (0.57%).|$|R
50|$|Among Indonesian provinces in 2010, Aceh {{reported}} the fifth smallest number of Christians (53,624) or 0.23% of Christians within Indonesia.

50|$|Gorontalo {{province}} is a {{stark contrast}} to its eastern neighbor, North Sulawesi. Among Indonesian provinces in 2010, Gorontalo reported the smallest number of Christians (17,320) or 0.07% of Christians within Indonesia. Gorontalo had the fourth <b>smallest</b> <b>percentage</b> (among religions reported in the province) of Christians (1.67%), including the <b>smallest</b> <b>percentage</b> of Catholics (0.07%) and seventh <b>smallest</b> <b>percentage</b> of Protestants (1.59%).|$|R
5|$|Most zircon is used {{directly}} in commercial applications, but a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> {{is converted to}} the metal. Most Zr metal is produced by {{the reduction of the}} zirconium(IV) chloride with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The resulting metal is sintered until sufficiently ductile for metalworking.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{includes}} a healthy diet, salt restriction, and exercise. Bariatric surgery {{may also be}} used to help with weight loss. The medication acetazolamide may also be used along with the above measures. A <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of people may require surgery to relieve the pressure.|$|E
5|$|With {{no serious}} {{challenge}} from Republican opponents, Nixon won an overwhelming {{victory in the}} Republican primary, with his cross-filing rivals, Boddy, Douglas, and Desmond, dividing a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of the vote but running well ahead of the two fringe candidates.|$|E
50|$|Among Indonesian provinces in 2010, West Nusa Tenggara had the <b>smallest</b> <b>percentage</b> (among {{religions}} {{reported in}} the province) of Christians (0.51%), including the <b>smallest</b> <b>percentage</b> of Protestants (0.31%) and third <b>smallest</b> <b>percentage</b> of Catholics (0.20%). West Nusa Tenggara reported the second smallest number of Christians (22,756) or 0.1% of Christians within Indonesia. Slightly larger concentrations are found in Mataram, and Bima cites, both with just 2% Christians.|$|R

5|$|After the {{completion}} of the coupling reaction, a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of the solid support-bound 5'-OH groups (0.1 to 1%) remains unreacted and needs to be permanently blocked from further chain elongation to prevent the formation of oligonucleotides with an internal base deletion commonly referred to as (n-1) shortmers. The unreacted 5'-hydroxy groups are, to a large extent, acetylated by the capping mixture.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only a snapshot of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which never demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly divergent forms.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars {{are also}} {{affected}} by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis {{has been used in}} sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has proved effective for the same purpose.|$|E

30|$|The {{composition}} of employment improved. Compared to 2000, a <b>smaller</b> <b>percentage</b> of Mexicans {{were working in}} the low-paying primary sector (agriculture and related activities) in 2006 and more in the higher-paying trade and services sectors. A larger percentage of workers had completed high school or above and a <b>smaller</b> <b>percentage</b> were illiterate. However, there was hardly {{any change in the}} sources of workers’ earnings (wage and salaried employment, business, and other).|$|R
5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately on a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of pivotal swing states, while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote {{reported that the}} 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV advertising. This means that swing state issues receive more attention, while issues important to other states are largely ignored.|$|E
5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E
5|$|Holland {{suggests}} {{that under the}} reign of Arab Emperor Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, even though only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of {{the inhabitants of the}} Empire was Muslim, Mecca was intentionally yet erroneously portrayed as Muhammad's home and the birthplace of Islam in order to provide the religion with Arabian origins. Holland argues that in doing so, the faith was dissociated from the Jewish or Christian heritage that would have been self evident at a location in the Negev.|$|E

5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, {{they would be}} able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of operational costs, as it did at the time.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts {{have adopted}} a range of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most use external fertilisation: the female lays a batch of eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this process. A <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male fish guarding a nest and fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated.|$|E
5|$|The sexes are similar, but {{the female}} {{tends to be}} duller than the male, with a brown tint to the head, brown upperparts and less bright underparts. However, some birds cannot be safely sexed on plumage alone. The {{juvenile}} is paler in color than the adult male and has dark spots on its breast, and whitish wing coverts. First-year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults, {{but they tend to}} be duller, and a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> retains a few juvenile wing coverts or other feathers.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} but <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> {{of people}} have employment {{in the oil industry}} owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, which is why only 14% of households in the zone own no car. 10.4% {{of the population of the}} zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{returned}} to Brunswick {{after the war}} and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of augers, which still made up a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of production even after closing Millville Manufacturing. Allen put himself in charge of manufacturing and sales and he again secured a solid market share in the South. A prosperous trade resumed and was still strong at least until the 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E

50|$|As of 591 CY, the {{population}} of Blackmoor totaled 110,000 persons. Almost 40% of these inhabitants are humans of predominantly Flan and Oeridian stock, although some Suel and Baklunish can be found as well. Another 20% comprise orcish tribes that roam the region (some {{under the control of}} the Egg of Coot, some not). A slightly <b>smaller</b> <b>percentage</b> of halflings is also present, while elves, gnomes, half-orcs, half-elves, and other races make up the remainder of {{the population}} in increasingly <b>smaller</b> <b>percentages.</b>|$|R
