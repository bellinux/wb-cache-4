5|$|Hester {{finished}} {{the season with}} six kicks returned for touchdowns, which set a league record. He {{finished the}} season ranking fourth on the League’s all-time combined kick return list, behind Brian Mitchell (13), Eric Metcalf (12), and Dante Hall (12). Additionally, he amassed 299 yards on twenty receptions as a receiver, though he was often used as a decoy. His play on offense received mixed commentary. While the Bears’ coaching staff believed Hester showed enough progress {{to become one of}} the team's top receivers in 2008, Hester was prone to making <b>small</b> <b>errors,</b> including running routes incorrectly or dropping catches. He drew a fifteen-yard facemask penalty while attempting to fend off a would-be tackler in a game against the Saints, and received a $5,000 fine. Nevertheless, Hester concluded the season with four Player of the Week Awards, giving him a franchise-high total of seven in his career, and an invitation to the 2008 Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the time step chosen within the model {{is related to the}} {{distance}} between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The Met Office's Unified Model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10days into the future, while the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or prog. The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast. This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model, or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts. MOS or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance. This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. In numerical models, extremely <b>small</b> <b>errors</b> in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.|$|E

He divided the manuscripts based on the writing used (uncial, minuscule) or format (lectionaries) and based on content (Gospels, Pauline letters, Acts + General epistles, and Revelation). He assigned the uncials letters and minuscules and lectionaries numbers for each grouping of content, which resulted in manuscripts being assigned the same letter or number.|$|E

25|$|The free-swimming diver {{may need}} to trim erect or {{inverted}} at times, but in general, a horizontal trim has advantages both for reduction of drag when swimming horizontally, and for observing the bottom. A horizontal trim allows the diver to direct propulsive thrust from the fins directly to the rear, which minimises disturbance of sediments on the bottom, and {{reduces the risk of}} striking delicate benthic organisms with the fins. A stable horizontal trim requires that diver's centre of gravity is directly below the centre of buoyancy (the centroid). <b>Small</b> <b>errors</b> can be compensated fairly easily, but large offsets may make it necessary for the diver to constantly exert significant effort towards maintaining the desired attitude, if it is actually possible.|$|E
25|$|However, the JRASC {{article has}} been criticized as lacking any error analysis. Since the {{triangulation}} base used by the astronomers in their calculations was very narrow, even very <b>small</b> <b>errors</b> in determination of directions {{could result in a}} very different triangulated trajectory. Measurement errors of slightly more than one-half degree would make possible a straight-line trajectory towards the Kecksburg area and a much shallower angle of descent than reported in the JRASC article. It was also pointed out that the photos used actually show the fireball trail becoming progressively thinner, suggesting motion away from the cameras, or in the direction of Pennsylvania. Had the trajectory been sideways to the cameras, as contended in the JRASC article, the trail would likely have remained roughly constant in thickness.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} application, {{consider}} {{the problem of}} determining the precise location of a truck. The truck can be equipped with a GPS unit that provides {{an estimate of the}} position within a few metres. The GPS estimate is likely to be noisy; readings 'jump around' rapidly, though remaining within a few metres of the real position. In addition, since the truck is expected to follow the laws of physics, its position can also be estimated by integrating its velocity over time, determined by keeping track of wheel revolutions and the angle of the steering wheel. This is a technique known as dead reckoning. Typically, the dead reckoning will provide a very smooth estimate of the truck's position, but it will drift over time as <b>small</b> <b>errors</b> accumulate.|$|E

25|$|All Canadian {{nurses and}} {{prospective}} nurses are heavily {{encouraged by the}} Canadian Nurses Association {{to continue their education}} to receive a baccalaureate degree. They believe that this is the best degree to work towards because it results in better patient outcomes. In addition to helping patients, nurses that have a baccalaureate degree will be less likely to make <b>small</b> <b>errors</b> because they have a higher level of education. A baccalaureate degree also gives a nurse a more critical opinion, which gives him or her more of an edge in the field. This ultimately saves the hospital money because they deal with less problematic incidents. All Canadian provinces and territories except for the Yukon and Quebec require that all nurses must have a baccalaureate degree. The basic length of time that it takes to obtain a baccalaureate degree is four years. However, Canada does have a condensed program that is two years long.|$|E
25|$|Gutiérrez was {{the first}} driver to attempt his lap in super pole and {{recorded}} fast times before locking his brakes and ran deep into the turn eight escape road, restricting him to qualifying fifth. López, seeking his first pole position in Formula E, was the next competitor to drive onto the track and took third, but was investigated for inadvertently using an excessive amount of electrical energy on his out-lap after mistakenly switching his car's settings. Although no penalty was applied, the switching of settings damaged his car's battery, leading to it being changed before the race. Turvey went fastest in the first sector before making a small error {{in the following section}} and took fourth. Vergne went faster than López to move into provisional pole position. Buemi was the final driver to set his lap time, and despite making <b>small</b> <b>errors</b> in the final sector, he clinched pole position with a time of one minute and 2.319 seconds. The margin of gap to Vergne was 0.006 seconds, the closest in Formula E history. It was Buemi's second consecutive pole position, and the eighth of his career. After qualifying ended, Turvey was demoted ten places on the grid because his team changed an powertrain component.|$|E
25|$|Underwater trim is the diver's {{attitude}} in the water, in terms of balance and alignment with the direction of motion. The free-swimming diver may need to trim erect or inverted at times, but in general, a horizontal trim has advantages both for reduction of drag when swimming horizontally, and for observing the bottom. A slightly head down horizontal trim allows the diver to direct propulsive thrust from the fins directly to the rear, which minimizes disturbance of sediments on the bottom, and {{reduces the risk of}} striking delicate benthic organisms with the fins. A stable horizontal trim requires that diver's centre of gravity is directly below the centre of buoyancy (the centroid). <b>Small</b> <b>errors</b> can be compensated fairly easily, but large offsets may make it necessary for the diver to constantly exert significant effort towards maintaining the desired attitude, if it is actually possible. The position of the centre of buoyancy is largely beyond the control of the diver, though the cylinder(s) may be shifted in the harness by a small amount, and the volume distribution of the buoyancy compensator has a large influence when inflated. Most of the control of trim available to the diver is in the positioning of ballast weights. Fine tuning of trim can be done by placing smaller weights {{along the length of the}} diver to bring the centre of gravity to the desired position.|$|E

500|$|In 1963, Edward Lorenz {{discovered}} the chaotic {{nature of the}} fluid dynamics equations involved in weather forecasting. [...] Extremely <b>small</b> <b>errors</b> in temperature, winds, or other initial inputs given to numerical models will amplify and double every five days, {{making it impossible for}} long-range forecasts—those made more than two weeks in advance—to predict the state of the atmosphere with any degree of forecast skill. [...] Furthermore, existing observation networks have poor coverage in some regions (for example, over large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean), which introduces uncertainty into the true initial state of the atmosphere. [...] While a set of equations, known as the Liouville equations, exists to determine the initial uncertainty in the model initialization, the equations are too complex to run in real-time, even with the use of supercomputers. [...] These uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about five or six days into the future.|$|E
500|$|Caxias {{arrived in}} Paraguay on 18 November, and assumed the supreme command {{of land and}} naval forces in the war. His first measure was to arrange the {{dismissal}} of Vice-Admiral Joaquim Marques Lisboa (later the Marquis of Tamandaré and {{also a member of}} the Progressive League) by the government, and appoint fellow Conservative Vice-Admiral Joaquim José Inácio (later the Viscount of Inhaúma) to lead the navy. From October 1866 until July 1867, all offensive operations were suspended. During this period, Caxias trained his soldiers, re-equipped the army with newer guns, improved the quality of the officer corps, and upgraded the health corps and overall hygiene of the troops, putting an end to epidemics. Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay (later the Viscount of Taunay), who fought in the war, remembered that Caxias was a [...] "generous military chief, who forgave <b>small</b> <b>errors,</b> but was implacable with those who committed grave misdeeds, or, then, who betrayed his confidence." ...|$|E
500|$|A more {{fundamental}} {{problem lies in}} the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations that govern the atmosphere. It is impossible to solve these equations exactly, and <b>small</b> <b>errors</b> grow with time (doubling about every five days). Present understanding is that this chaotic behavior limits accurate forecasts to about 14 days even with perfectly accurate input data and a flawless model. [...] In addition, the partial differential equations used in the model need to be supplemented with parameterizations for solar radiation, moist processes (clouds and precipitation), heat exchange, soil, vegetation, surface water, {{and the effects of}} terrain. [...] In an effort to quantify the large amount of inherent uncertainty remaining in numerical predictions, ensemble forecasts have been used since the 1990s to help gauge the confidence in the forecast, and to obtain useful results farther into the future than otherwise possible. This approach analyzes multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model or multiple models.|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of quantum systems strongly {{depends on the}} local structure of the Hamiltonian.
