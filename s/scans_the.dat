5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in {{people who have never}} smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) <b>scans.</b> <b>The</b> diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.|$|E

In Engineering, the two locate and deactivate a gas-machine that the Starfleet crew brought up from the surface of a nearby moon. Unknown to the intruders, Commander Tucker is still conscious and makes his way to Engineering and uses the ship's sensors to monitor the aliens as they plunder the ship.|$|E

5|$|Henry's 2006–07 {{season was}} marred by injuries. Although he scored 10 goals in 17 {{domestic}} appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season was cut short in February. Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League match, but began limping shortly after coming on. <b>Scans</b> <b>the</b> next day revealed that he would need at least three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries, missing {{the rest of the}} 2006–07 season. Wenger attributed Henry's injuries to a protracted 2005–06 campaign, and reiterated that Henry was keen on staying with the Gunners to rebuild for the 2007–08 season.|$|E

After Doctor McCoy conducts a series of mental <b>scans,</b> <b>the</b> crew of the ShiKahr realise that history has been altered.

5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using {{a beam of}} light or particles, a very small sharpened tip <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential to}} image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E

5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} {{to obtain}} an accurate representation of the far-field emissions starting from a finite planar <b>scan</b> of <b>the</b> magnetic near-field is proposed. The algorithm introduces so-called auxiliary sources that compensate for the finite size of <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> area. While previous works typically introduce equivalent sources to represent the fields inside <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area, <b>the</b> auxiliary sources introduced in this paper approximate the fields outside of <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area. <b>The</b> auxiliary sources are located within the pcb under <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area at <b>the</b> locations where <b>the</b> <b>scanned</b> field strengths are above a pre-chosen threshold. Their complex values are chosen such that they accurately represent the fields {{at the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area. Several numerical examples show that the application of these auxiliary sources considerably improves the accuracy of the obtained far-field. status: publishe...|$|R
