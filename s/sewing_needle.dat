25|$|A long-standing home method {{involves}} using ice {{as a local}} anesthetic, a <b>sewing</b> <b>needle</b> as a puncture instrument, {{a burning}} match and rubbing alcohol for disinfection, and a semi-soft object, such as a potato, cork, bar of soap or rubber eraser, as a push point. Sewing thread may be drawn through the piercing and tied, as a device for keeping the piercing open during the healing process. Alternatively, a gold stud or wire earring may be directly inserted into the fresh piercing as the initial retaining device. Home methods are often unsafe and risky due to issues of improper sterilization or placement.|$|E

2500|$|Blampied’s {{earliest}} etchings are dated December 1909, {{suggesting that}} he did not begin to learn this technique until the academic year 1909–1910; his teacher at Bolt Court was Walter Seymour. Blampied’s prints were first shown at an exhibition of students’ work in March 1914, where his etching of an ox cart was noted by the correspondent of The Times. [...] The first print believed to have been published was an etching entitled At the wings (illustration removed) which was reproduced in the Annual Report of Bolt Court in 1914. Blampied later recorded his method of working on zinc for etching and copper for drypoint in Ernest Stephen Lumsden's treatise The Art of Etching. Blampied wrote: [...] "I generally chose from amongst my various drawings one which would tend to produce a successful plate. I do not trace on to the copper, but copy a few important lines on to the bare metal with litho-chalk. I then sketch over this with an ordinary <b>sewing</b> <b>needle</b> and rub in a little black oil-colour[...] [...] From the first my efforts are to improve on the sketch until I consider the plate finished[...] [...] In very few cases do I touch a plate after the first proof, so the majority have but one state. If I am dissatisfied with either the composition or details, I prefer to start afresh upon another plate rather than make radical alterations." ...|$|E

Case presentation Here we report {{the case of an}} 18 -year-old Turkish woman with schizophrenia who was admitted to the emergency department with signs of an acute abdomen as a result of ingestion of multiple needles. This is the third case in the literature for which mini C-arm fluoroscopy has been used to localize metallic <b>sewing</b> <b>needles.</b> Conclusion When intentional ingestion occurs, surgery is rarely required. It is hard to localize ingested <b>sewing</b> <b>needles</b> and mini C-arm fluoroscopy is a good alternative when metal detectors are not available for localization of metal <b>sewing</b> <b>needles.</b> We recommend this approach because it helps to avoid unnecessary exploration, shortens the duration of surgery and provides outstanding results. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of simple sewing machines {{can be increased}} through the planning of predictive maintenance activities. The monitoring of the technical condition of the <b>sewing</b> <b>needles</b> of simple <b>sewing</b> machines {{was based on the}} measurement of their noise level. For this purpose a Center 322 sonometer was used, while the data obtained during the monitoring process was analyzed through the E 322 software. The working speed of the simple sewing machine that was used for obtaining the experimental results varied from 200 stitches/minute to 4000 stitches/minute. The noise levels of a new needle at the working speed of 200 stitches/minute and 4000 stitches/minute were measured. The noise levels for a fault needle at the same working speed of 200 stitches/minute, respectively 4000 stitches/minute were also measured. Using Fuzzy Logic Toolbox ™ module of Matlab®, a decision-making system for determining when replacement of the <b>sewing</b> <b>needles</b> of simple <b>sewing</b> machines should be performed was developed. A case study illustrates the employment of the decision-making system based on fuzzy logic for a simple sewing machine.
