5|$|Albert Edward and Alexandra visited Ireland in April 1868. After {{her illness}} the {{previous}} year, {{she had only}} just begun to walk again {{without the aid of}} two walking sticks, and was already pregnant with her fourth child. The royal couple undertook a six-month tour taking in Austria, Egypt and Greece over 1868 and 1869, which included visits to her brother King George I of Greece, to the Crimean battlefields and (for her only) to the harem of the Khedive Ismail.

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} motivate and inspire {{everyone}} by taking {{them on a}} field trip to Gettysburg. At Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy with the lack of morale and belief in his leadership and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a haphazard tour, and eventually most of the office members <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> rest. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) follow Andy after he presses on, and eventually tell him to stop trying to impress the office. They reinforce the fact that his co-workers like him the way he is.|$|E

5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not {{to know what they}} are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880s, chairs {{became more}} common in American {{households}} and usually there was a chair provided for every family member to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> dinner. By the 1830s, factory-manufactured “fancy chairs” like those by Sears. Roebuck, and Co. allowed families to purchase machined sets. With the Industrial Revolution, chairs became much more available.|$|E
25|$|Population of {{the country}} {{did not have a}} bed or chair to sit, and to eat they do not use a spoon or chopsticks.

When {{receiving}} guests, they will offer the guests, not the tea, but with betel nut.|$|E
25|$|The London University {{of which}} De Morgan was a {{professor}} was a different institution from the University of London. The University of London was founded about ten years later by the Government {{for the purpose of}} granting degrees after examination, without any qualification as to residence. The London University was affiliated as a teaching college with the University of London, and its name was changed to University College. The University of London was not a success as an examining body; a teaching University was demanded. De Morgan was a highly successful teacher of mathematics. It was his plan to lecture for an hour, and at the close of each lecture to give out a number of problems and examples illustrative of the subject lectured on; his students were required to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> them and bring him the results, which he looked over and returned revised before the next lecture. In De Morgan's opinion, a thorough comprehension and mental assimilation of great principles far outweighed in importance any merely analytical dexterity in the application of half-understood principles to particular cases.|$|E

500|$|Jacques René Zammit of The Malta Independent {{reviewed}} {{one episode}} in which Fry {{talked about the}} problems within journalism. Zammit wrote positively on Fry's comments saying, [...] "I share Stephen's worries completely. Every time I <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> type my excessively long column, I am burdened {{by the thought that}} after all this is just a collection of thoughts by someone who may very well be perceived as a pompous ass – and if Stephen Fry has these disquisitions, then I definitely should be doing some worrying myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Colin Salmon plays James Middleton, a {{civil servant}} who sits between the British {{government}} and the Ministry of Defence. Salmon previously worked with Sky1 on Hex. He was attracted to the role in Strike Back due to the script being [...] "a page-turner, and they're rare. It's really lovely to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> start reading something and then {{not be able to}} stop because you have to know what's going to happen next," [...] as well as hearing of who was involved in the project. A member of The Prince's Trust charity, Salmon took the opportunity to visit some of their projects in Soweto while the series was filmed.|$|E

[...] When Dyer heard of these arrests, she once again left her home in Newport, and {{returned}} to Boston to support her Quaker brethren, ignoring her order of banishment, and once again being incarcerated. [...] Her husband had already come to Boston two years earlier to retrieve her from the authorities, signing an oath that she wouldn't return. [...] He wouldn't come back to Boston again, but on 30 August 1659 he did <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> write a long and impassioned letter to the magistrates, questioning the legality of the actions taken by the Massachusetts authorities.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he [...] "never <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it {{has more to do}} with the fact that just what’s been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|E
500|$|In chapter 40, Gangleri {{says that}} Valhalla {{must be an}} immense building, yet it must often be crowded around the doorways. High {{responds}} that {{there are plenty of}} doors, and that crowding doesn't occur around them. In support, High again quotes a stanza from Grímnismál. In chapter 41, Gangleri notes that there are very many people in Valhalla, and that Odin is a [...] "very great lord when he commands such a troop". Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar get dressed and [...] "put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport." [...] High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar ride back to Valhalla and <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from Grímnismál.|$|E
500|$|... "The Ladies of Grace Adieu" [...] was Clarke's first {{published}} story. While working on Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, she {{enrolled in a}} writing course co-taught by Colin Greenland and Geoff Ryman, which required each student to submit a completed short story before the course began. [...] Clarke culled [...] "The Ladies of Grace Adieu" [...] from her incipient novel. [...] Greenland {{was so impressed with}} the story that, without Clarke's knowledge, he sent an excerpt to his friend, the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. Gaiman later said, [...] "It was terrifying {{from my point of view}} to read this first short story that had so much assurance...It was like watching someone <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> play the piano for the first time and she plays a sonata." [...] Gaiman showed the story to his friend, science-fiction writer and editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden. Clarke learned of these events when Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology Starlight 1 (1996), which featured pieces by well-regarded science-fiction and fantasy writers. She accepted and the book won the World Fantasy Award for best anthology in 1997.|$|E
