50|$|Scheduler suspends {{a program}} if a page fault occurs, letting other threads proceed while the system fetches the page. As the {{occurrence}} of page faults depends upon what other processes are running, the timing of a context <b>switch</b> <b>becomes</b> indeterminate.|$|R

50|$|The {{next major}} {{conflict}} in the Republican Party occurred in 1896 when Republican supporters of free silver left the party to form the Silver Republicans, though again most of these politicians later rejoined the Republican Party. By the late 19th century, as the Democratic and Republican parties became more established, however, party <b>switching</b> <b>became</b> less frequent.|$|R

He has since performed the piece in Venezuela with the Simon Boliviar Youth Orchestra.|$|R

30|$|After GSSMS {{decides to}} {{activate}} a Spine switch, {{there is an}} expected delay (1 – 3  min as noted for EnergyWise in [16]) before the Spine switch can accept new flows. During this time duration, GSSMS distributes new flows on the Backup Spine Switch. After the newly activated Spine <b>switch</b> <b>becomes</b> active, GSSMS distributes new flows on the Spine switch. GSSMS never move existing flows from one Spine switch to another.|$|R
40|$|Fiber-optic <b>switches</b> <b>become</b> {{more and}} more {{appealing}} components {{not only in the}} field of optical communication, but also in measurement systems, sensors and data storage. We have developed a number of concepts for fiber optic switches, all based on different types of special microoptical components, actuated by miniaturized mechanical systems, primarily piezoelectric actuators. We present microoptical configurations and discuss their potential for the creation of different types of miniaturized switches...|$|R
50|$|Modern wired {{networks}} use {{a network}} switch {{to reduce or}} eliminate collisions. By connecting each device directly to a port on the switch, either each port on a <b>switch</b> <b>becomes</b> its own collision domain ({{in the case of}} half duplex links) or the possibility of collisions is eliminated entirely in the case of full-duplex links. For Gigabit Ethernet and faster, no hubs or repeaters exist and all devices require full-duplex links.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} various questions {{pertaining to}} bootstrap percolation on the $d$-dimensional Hamming torus where each node is open with probability $p$ and the percolation threshold is 2. For each $d'<d$ {{we find the}} critical exponent for the event that a $d'$-dimensional subtorus <b>becomes</b> <b>open</b> and compute the limiting value of its probability under the critical scaling. For even $d'$, we use the Chen-Stein method {{to show that the}} number of $d'$-dimensional subtori that <b>become</b> <b>open</b> can be approximated by a Poisson random variable.
