50|$|Clamp probes {{are used}} with some meters to measure {{electrical}} power and energy. The clamp measures {{the current and}} other circuitry the voltage; the true power {{is the product of}} the instantaneous voltage and current integrated over a cycle. Comprehensive meters designed to measure many parameters of electrical energy (power factor, distortion, instantaneous power as a function of time, phase relationships, etc.), energy analyzers, use this principle. A <b>single</b> <b>clamp</b> is used for single-phase measurements; with an appropriate instrument with three clamps, measurements may be made on three-phase power systems.|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: Stroke and {{cognitive}} impairment after {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) are associated with cerebral embolization. An important cause of embolism is manipulation of the ascending aorta. There are two distal and proximal anastomosis in CABG {{that can be done}} by single cross-clamp or by on cross-clamp and one side-biting clamp on ascending aorta. The later is done for reducing cardiac ischemia. <b>Single</b> <b>clamp</b> technique may be associated with lesser cerebral injury. The Aim of study is survey of surgical Complications of CABG. Subjects and Methods: This study was carried out over 26 months (from oct 2006 until Jan 2009). Patients referred for CABG to a private hospital (n= 187) <b>single</b> <b>clamp</b> was used (group I), while patients referred to university hospital (n= 187) were operated upon by conventional method of multiple clamps (group II). The incidence of cerebral injury that was clinically patients referred diagnosed in both groups were analyzed. Results: There were one left side hemiplegia and one mortality in group I and one left side hemiplegia and two cases of encephalopathy without any mortality in group II. Conclusion: The {{results of this study suggest}} that there is no benefit of <b>single</b> <b>clamp</b> over multiple clamp technique in terms of reduction in the incidence of stroke although there are some advantages of <b>single</b> <b>clamp</b> in causing less cognitive disorders.

40|$|SummaryThe {{structure}} of the E. coli β clamp polymerase processivity factor has been solved in complex with primed DNA. Interestingly, the clamp directly binds the DNA duplex and also forms a crystal contact with the ssDNA template strand, which binds into the protein-binding pocket of the clamp. We demonstrate that these clamp-DNA interactions function in clamp loading, perhaps by inducing the ring to close around DNA. Clamp binding to template ssDNA may also serve to hold the clamp at a primed site after loading or during switching of multiple factors on the clamp. Remarkably, the DNA is highly tilted as it passes through the β ring. The pronounced 22 ° angle of DNA through β may enable DNA to switch between multiple factors bound to a <b>single</b> <b>clamp</b> simply by alternating from one protomer of the ring to the other...|$|E

In group 1, after opening the cross clamp, proximal anastomosis was completed using side clamps and, in group 2, distal and proximal anastomosis was completed with a <b>single</b> <b>clamp.</b> Cross clamping time in the single-clamp patients (group 2; 77. 1 min) {{was significantly higher than}} in the double-clamp patients (group 1; 62. 9 min). Troponin T was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 h and 24 h after surgery. Post-operative left ventricular ejection fraction decreased in both groups, but this was not statistically significant. Post-operative wall motion score index and myocardial performance index increased significantly in both groups compared with the pre-operative level. Overall, the double-clamp technique provided better myocardial protection than the single-clamp technique and neither technique seemed to {{have a negative impact on}} the early post-operative global functioning of the left ventricle, however the effect of these techniques on the global functioning of the left ventricle in the late post-operative period needs to be evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Heavily calcified {{ascending}} aorta significantly increased morbidity and lethality during open-heart surgery. Cannulation and clamping (partial or total) of severely atherosclerotic {{ascending aorta}} can easily cause damage and rupture of aortic wall, with consequential distal (often fatal) embolization with atheromatous debris (brain, myocardium). From June 1998. until June 2000, 11 of 2 136 (0. 5 %) patients who underwent {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting were with the severe atheromatous ascending aorta. The site of cannulation was in the aortic arch in three patients (aorta was occluded with Foley catheter in one case, and <b>single</b> <b>clamp</b> technique {{was used in the}} other two cases). The femoral artery was the cannulation site in other five cases. Profound hypothermia, ventricular fibrillation, and circulatory arrest, with no cross-clamping or cardioplegia, were used in three patients. Two patients were operated on with extracorporeal circulation, one in normothermia, on the beating heart, the other in moderate hypothermia, on fibrillating heart. In three patients myocardial revascularization was performed on the beating heart, in normothermia, without extracorporeal circulation. Postoperative course was uneventful in all 11 patients. Neither atheroembolism in the peripheral organs, nor atheroembolism of the extramities occurred. The proposed surgical approaches have the potential to reduce the prevalence of stroke and systemic embolization associated with coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with heavily calcified ascending aorta. This result was achieved due to the applied modifications of standard cardiosurgical technique...|$|E

Finally, we successfully cloak an arbitrarily shaped scatterer in a thin plate by deriving a semi-analytical, asymptotic algorithm. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{elicitation}} of dopamine {{release from}} rat striatal synaptosomes by KCl stimulation and nicotinic agonists {{has been well}} characterised experimentally. Based on these data we have produced a mathematical model {{of the population of}} striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals.

Analysis of these modes of inducing transmitter release allows us to estimate the existence of three major sub-populations of dopamine terminal. 1 Introduction Neurotransmitter release is not only inuenced by the arrival of an action potential at the nerve terminal, i [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Natriuretic {{peptides}} (NPs) administered {{during early}} reperfusion are protective in models of myocardial infarction.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{hypothesized}} that {{a strategy that}} reduced aortic manipulation would {{reduce the incidence of}} cognitive deficits in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting compared with the “traditional” approach and that neurobehavioral outcomes with the reduced aortic manipulation strategy would approach those obtained with off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. MethodsConsenting high-risk patients (those with older age, diabetes, or hypertension) scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting and cardiopulmonary bypass were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 aortic management protocols: (1) a traditional approach in which distal anastomoses were accomplished while the aorta was crossclamped but in which proximal anastomoses were sewn while a partial occlusion clamp was applied to the aorta (multiple aortic clamping group) or (2) a reduced aortic manipulation approach in which the aorta was <b>clamped</b> a <b>single</b> time with a reduced-pressure <b>clamp</b> (<b>single</b> aortic <b>clamping</b> group) and the partial occlusion clamp was not used. A contemporaneous group of patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass was also enrolled. Subjects in all 3 groups underwent neurologic and neuropsychological testing before and after surgery. After randomization, patients assigned to either approach could be changed to another strategy if the attending surgeon determined that patient safety demanded this change. The study design anticipated that surgical techniques would evolve over the course of patient enrollment and anticipated that some patients would have intraoperative echocardiographic findings that would demand that the traditional approach (eg, severe aortic atherosclerosis) or the reduced manipulation protocol (eg, severe ischemia or poor left ventricular function) be abandoned. Thus, an unequal distribution of patients was expected. By surgeon decision, 20 of 84 multiple aortic clamping patients crossed over to <b>single</b> aortic <b>clamping,</b> and 3 of 85 <b>single</b> aortic <b>clamping</b> patients switched to multiple aortic clamping. Eligible patients had a battery of neuropsychological tests before surgery and at 6 months after surgery. A 20 % decrement in 2 or more tests was defined as a neuropsychological deficit.
