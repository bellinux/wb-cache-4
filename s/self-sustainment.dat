40|$|Corresponding to life’s two {{distinct}} aspects: Darwinian evolution and <b>self-sustainment,</b> {{the origin of}} life should also split into two issues: the origin of Darwinian evolution and the arising of <b>self-sustainment.</b> Because the “self-sustainment” we concern about life should be the <b>self-sustainment</b> of a relevant system that is “defined” by its genetic information, the <b>self-sustainment</b> could not have arisen before the origin of Darwinian evolution, which was just marked by the emergence of genetic information. The logic behind the idea of the RNA world is not as tenable as it has been believed. That is, genetic molecules and functional molecules, even though not being the same material, could have emerged together in the beginning and launched the evolution—provided that the genetic molecules can “simply” code the functional molecules.

Therewith, we acquire a concrete scenario for our attempts to appreciate those fundamental issues that are involved in {{the origin of life}}. In the light of those possible scenes included in this scenario, Darwinian evolution may have originated at the molecular level, realized upon a functional RNA. When two or more functional RNAs emerged, for their efficient cooperation, there should have been a selective pressure for the emergence of protocells.

Four configurations, which are characterized {{in terms of the}} vorticity field geometry and their contribution to the turbulent shear stress and skin friction, are recovered. The vortex modes associated with streamwise and wall-normal aligned shear layers resemble symmetric and one-legged hairpin vortices, and suggest that inner-outer layers interactions may be important in stimulating the eruption of near-wall shear layers. The modes associated with quasi-longitudinal shear layers closely recall the staggered vortices arrangement proposed in models of wall turbulence <b>self-sustainment</b> (J. Jeong, F. Hussain, W. Schoppa, and J. Kim, Coherent structures near the wall in a turbulent channel flow, J. Fluid Mech. 332 (1997), p. 185), and also highlight a mechanism of generation of secondary vorticity through a rubbing effect (P. Orlandi, Vortex dipole rebound from a wall, Phys. Fluids A 2 (1990), p. 1429) ...|$|E
40|$|To {{apprehend}} {{the mythic}} origins {{we have to}} try to sink into what it feels like to be such a consciousness. Of course it is impossible, in one sense, as we always keep our present rationality with us. Yet the method remains correct. You cannot remain aloof from the subjective and know what it is. We take our rationality into the mythic mind for dreams should be judged by waking consciousness and not by another dream. What Nixon has opened out for me at this moment remains to great for me too to comprehend and comment further. Doubtless there will be many corrections and enhancements but everything turns upon grasping the principle of original self-creation, self-organisation, <b>self-sustainment,</b> self-unfolding or self-enclosure and it is to the grasping of this autopoesy that I would like to add a few words. Key Words: autopoesy, mythic origin, self-creation, consciousness. Reading Nixon's writings over the last decade or more I've often felt we were going to the same sort of place along different routes. There has been a felt kinship but I have never really got a grip on where he was. I kept losing my bearings. These three essays begin to open my eyes to his path(Nixon, 2010 a, 2010 b, 2010 c). Unfamiliar with many of his sources, there were times when I literally gaspe...|$|E
