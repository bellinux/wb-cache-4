I {{happened}} to see him take his pocketbook back from the purser, and I guess he'd got a <b>sight</b> more <b>money</b> there than was found upon him.

Forsdyke breaks in intending to steal the money, and then panicking at his relapse, calls Crooks Anonymous for help. They send their two top men, including Brother Widdowes, who also cave at the <b>sight</b> of the <b>money.</b> They in turn call for the Chairman who arrives with his Secretary.|$|R
60|$|Perplexed and outworn, at last Hugh {{produced}} {{a piece of}} gold and held it before a number of men who were watching them idly, again explaining in French that he wished to be led {{to the house of}} the English ambassador.

40|$|Advertising and {{bulk buying}} is often {{suggested}} as prime contributers to why consumers buy grocery items they never use. In contrast, {{a study of}} 423 homemakers indicates the most unused products are ones that were bought for specific recipes or specific occasions that never arose. Because most of these products {{tend to be more}} specialized and less versatile, they are generally moved {{to the back of the}} cupboard and forgotten. Based on detailed interviews, we then outline specific strategies to help consumers shop, use, and dispose of products more carefully and less wastefully. Cabinet Castaways: Why We Buy Products We Never Use Nearly everyone buys products they never actually use. These cabinet castaways and abandoned products are ones that gradually move steadily further back in the cupboard until they are lost, out of <b>sight.</b> The <b>money</b> and effort invested in these products is not trivial. It has been indicated that as many as 15 % of non-perishable products are never used and eventually discarded (Wansink and Deshpande 1994). This is not only an issue of tightening consume...|$|R
50|$|In De Plaaggeest (The Poltergeist) Bassie & Adriaan find {{themselves}} abandoned {{by their own}} circus because they overslept, and with no tour-schedule in <b>sight</b> or any <b>money</b> they're forced to take other jobs but lose each. Partly responsible is The Poltergeist, who's more a prankster than a poltergeist wearing a black cape, comedy cheeks and a fool's hat. Bassie & Adriaan are saved by a self-proclaimed free spirit called Douwe whom they met on the work-floor. Adriaan suspects that Douwe is the Poltergeist, but this has never been proved. In fact, the Poltergeist disappears from the scene, regretting his actions in an open letter. In the final episode Bassie & Adriaan return to the circus.|$|R
60|$|Now the {{way that}} the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six {{thousand}} dollars apiece--all gold. It was an awful <b>sight</b> of <b>money</b> when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round --more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and {{said he was going to}} start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.|$|R
5000|$|... "Alfred Bello was a {{key witness}} for the State. He and Arthur Dexter Bradley were in the area on a {{criminal}} mission of their own. Bradley was attempting to break into a building about two blocks away while Bello was at the intervening intersection looking out for the police. Bello ran out of cigarettes and was walking to the tavern to buy some {{when he heard the}} shots. As he neared the tavern, two men, Negroes, came toward him, one with a shotgun and the other with a pistol. They were talking loudly and laughing. When Bello realized they were not detectives, he took off and ducked into an alleyway. Presently a white car passed by. Bello recognized it as a 1966 Dodge and noted it had New York license plates. Bello entered the tavern, and seeing the dead and the dying, he went to the cash register to obtain a dime to call the police. The <b>sight</b> of <b>money</b> was too much for Bello who, explaining he was a thief, admitted he scooped some bills from the register." [...] Id. at 439 -440.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was partly}} to this vague fear that Marner was indebted for {{protecting}} {{him from the}} persecution that his singularities might have drawn upon him, but still more to the fact that, the old linen-weaver in the neighbouring parish of Tarley being dead, his handicraft made him a highly welcome settler to the richer housewives of the district, and even to the more provident cottagers, who had their little stock of yarn at the year's end. Their sense of his usefulness would have counteracted any repugnance or suspicion which was not confirmed by a deficiency in the quality or {{the tale of the}} cloth he wove for them. And the years had rolled on without producing any change in the impressions of the neighbours concerning Marner, except the change from novelty to habit. At the end of fifteen years the Raveloe men said just the same things about Silas Marner as at the beginning: they did not say them quite so often, but they believed them much more strongly when they did say them. There was only one important addition which the years had brought: it was, that Master Marner had laid by a fine <b>sight</b> of <b>money</b> somewhere, and that he could buy up [...] "bigger men" [...] than himself.|$|R
60|$|Shirley {{placed at}} her {{disposal}} £300, and at <b>sight</b> of the <b>money</b> Miss Ainley's {{eyes filled with}} joyful tears; for she already saw the hungry fed, the naked clothed, the sick comforted thereby. She quickly drew up a simple, sensible plan for its expenditure; and she assured them brighter times would now come round, for she doubted not the lady of Fieldhead's example would be followed by others. She should try to get additional subscriptions, and to form a fund; but first she must consult the clergy. Yes, on that point she was peremptory. Mr. Helstone, Dr. Boultby, Mr. Hall, must be consulted (for not only must Briarfield be relieved, but Whinbury and Nunnely). It would, she averred, be presumption in her to take a single step unauthorized by them.|$|R
60|$|I doan't think Deuceace ever {{suspected}} any game on {{the part}} of her ladyship, for she carried it on so admirally, that the quarls which daily took place betwigst him and the Frenchman never seemed to come from her; on the contry, she acted as the reglar pease-maker between them, as I've just shown in the tiff which took place {{at the door of the}} Sally Mangy. Besides, the 2 young men, though reddy enough to snarl, were natrally unwilling to come to bloes. I'll tell you why: being friends, and idle, they spent their mornins as young fashnabbles genrally do, at billiads, fensing, riding, pistle-shooting, or some such improoving study. In billiads, master beat the Frenchman hollow (and had won a pretious <b>sight</b> of <b>money</b> from him: but that's neither here nor there, or, as the French say, ontry noo); at pistle-shooting, master could knock down eight immidges out of ten, and De l'Orge seven; and in fensing, the Frenchman could pink the Honorable Algernon down evry one of his weskit buttns. They'd each of them been out more than onst, for every Frenchman will fight, and master had been obleag'd to do so in the cors of his bisniss; and knowing each other's curridg, as well as the fact that either could put a hundrid bolls running into a hat at 30 yards, they wairnt very willing to try such exparrymence upon their own hats with their own heads in them. So you see they kep quiet, and only grould at each other.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘A {{pleasant}} state, sir,’ piped the old man, nodding, ‘a {{very pleasant}} state, {{and a fine}} race, both pines and people. We reckon ourselves part Grünewalders here, lying so near the borders; and the river there is all good Grünewald water, every drop of it. Yes, sir, a fine state. A man of Grünewald now will swing me an axe over his head that many a man of Gerolstein could hardly lift; and the pines, why, deary me, there must be more pines in that little state, sir, than people in this whole big world. ’Tis twenty years now since I crossed the marshes, for we grow home-keepers in old age; but I mind {{it as if it}} was yesterday. Up and down, the road keeps right on from here to Mittwalden; and nothing all the way but the good green pine-trees, big and little, and water-power! water-power at every step, sir. We once sold a bit of forest, up there beside the high-road; and the <b>sight</b> of minted <b>money</b> that we got for it has set me ciphering ever since what all the pines in Grünewald would amount to.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{smiled to}} {{myself at the}} <b>sight</b> of this <b>money.</b> [...] "O drug!" [...] said I, aloud, [...] "what art thou good for? thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off of the ground; one of those knives is worth all this heap; I have no manner of use for thee; even remain where thou art, {{and go to the}} bottom as a {{creature}} whose life is not worth saving." [...] However, upon second thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in a piece of canvass, I began to think of making another raft; but while I was preparing this, I found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in {{a quarter of an hour}} it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind off shore, and that it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all; accordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam cross the channel which lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly with the weight of things I had about me, and partly the roughness of the water, for the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water it blew a storm.|$|R
6000|$|Poor Alvina, {{this was}} the only day in all her life when she was the centre of public attention. For once, every eye was upon her, every mind was {{thinking}} about her. Poor Alvina! said every member of the Woodhouse [...] "middle class": Poor Alvina Houghton, said every collier's wife. Poor thing, left alone--and hardly a penny to bless herself with. Lucky if she's not left with a pile of debts. James Houghton ran through some money in his day. Ay, if she had her rights she'd be a rich woman. Why, her mother brought three or four thousands with her. Ay, but James sank it all in Throttle-Ha'penny and Klondyke and the Endeavour. Well, he was his own worst enemy. He paid his way. I'm not so sure about that. Look how he served his wife, and now Alvina. I'm not so sure he was his own worst enemy. He was bad enough enemy to his own flesh and blood. Ah well, he'll spend no more money, anyhow. No, he went sudden, didn't he? But he was getting very frail, if you noticed. Oh yes, why he fair seemed to totter down to Lumley. Do you reckon as that place pays its way? What, the Endeavour?--they say it does. They say it makes a nice bit. Well, it's mostly pretty full. Ay, it is. Perhaps it won't be now Mr. Houghton's gone. Perhaps not. I wonder if he will leave much. I'm sure he won't. Everything he's got's mortgaged up to the hilt. He'll leave debts, you see if he doesn't. What is she going to do then? She'll have to go out of Manchester House--her and Miss Pinnegar. Wonder what she'll do. Perhaps she'll take up that nursing. She never made much of that, did she--and spent a <b>sight</b> of <b>money</b> on her training, they say. She's a bit like her father in the business line--all flukes. Pity some nice young man doesn't turn up and marry her. I don't know, she doesn't seem to hook on, does she? Why she's never had a proper boy. They make out she was engaged once. Ay, but nobody ever saw him, and it was off {{as soon as it was}} on. Can you remember she went with Albert Witham for a bit. Did she? No, I never knew. When was that? Why, when he was at Oxford, you know, learning for his head master's place. Why didn't she marry him then? Perhaps he never asked her. Ay, there's that to it. She'd have looked down her nose at him, times gone by. Ay, but that's all over, my boy. She'd snap at anybody now. Look how she carries on with that manager. Why, that's something awful. Haven't you ever watched her in the Cinema? She never lets him alone. And it's anybody alike. Oh, she doesn't respect herself. I don't consider. No girl who respected herself would go on as she does, throwing herself at every feller's head. Does she, though? Ay, any performer or anybody. She's a tidy age, though. She's not much chance of getting off. How old do you reckon she is? Must be well over thirty. You never say. Well, she looks it. She does beguy--a dragged old maid. Oh but she sprightles up a bit sometimes. Ay, when she thinks she's hooked on to somebody. I wonder why she never did take? It's funny. Oh, she was too high and mighty before, and now it's too late. Nobody wants her. And she's got no relations to go to either, has she? No, that's her father's cousin who she's walking with. Look, they're coming. He's a fine-looking man, isn't he? You'd have thought they'd have buried Miss Frost beside Mrs. Houghton. You would, wouldn't you? I should think Alvina will lie by Miss Frost. They say the grave was made for both of them. Ay, she was a lot more of a mother to her than her own mother. She was good to them, Miss Frost was. Alvina thought the world of her. That's her stone--look, down there. Not a very grand one, considering. No, it isn't. Look, there's room for Alvina's name underneath. Sh!-- ...|$|R
