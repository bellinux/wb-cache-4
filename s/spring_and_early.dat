5|$|Approximately 40,000 {{medium to}} large icebergs {{annually}} calve from Greenland glaciers, {{and depending on}} wind, and air and water temperature, between 400 and 800 of these go {{as far south as}} 48° north latitude (St. John's). Icebergs are most commonly seen in the waters off Newfoundland in the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer.|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland is {{also known}} for its fog which occurs most often in the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer because of the {{contrast}} between sea and air temperatures. Argentia has 206 days of fog per year. Fog in Newfoundland is frequently accompanied by strong onshore winds; while usually winds disperse fog, here the fog is too widespread for this to occur.|$|E

5|$|The time of {{breeding}} {{depends on the}} elevation and latitude of the salamander's habitat. Generally, the lower-elevation salamanders breed in the fall, winter, and early spring. Higher-elevation salamanders breed in <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer. In the higher climates especially, salamanders will enter ponds and lakes that still have ice floating.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers, which bloom {{mainly in}} the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer, include pincushions, golden bee plant, dwarf purple monkey flower, and {{sagebrush}} mariposa lily at the Painted Hills Unit. Munro's globemallow, lupines, yellow fritillary, hedgehog cactus, and Applegate's Indian paintbrush are commonly seen at the Clarno and Sheep Rock units.|$|E

50|$|In {{temperate}} and boreal climates, clearcutting {{can have}} an effect on the depth of snow, which is usually greater in a clearcut area than in the forest, due to a lack of interception and evapotranspiration. This results in less soil frost, which in combination with higher levels of direct sunlight results in snowmelt occurring <b>earlier</b> in the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>earlier</b> peak runoff.|$|R

5|$|Many {{animals have}} a {{specific}} temperature range where they are active, meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons. Snakes and lizards hibernate during the winter months, are diurnal during the late <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of estivation, a summer hibernation {{that allows them to}} avoid the hottest and driest periods.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} by decomposing and digesting organic matter—and grows in clusters or in groups on decaying leaf litter or well-decayed wood. It typically fruits {{in a narrow}} window from June to July; this <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer fruiting distinguishes it from the more common Coprinus comatus and Coprinopsis atramentaria, which produce fruit bodies in late autumn. It {{is found in the}} United States, in areas east of the Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|Between the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> {{summer of}} 1921, the rebels {{experienced}} {{a series of}} defeats. In July 1921, Hananu's stronghold in Jabal Zawiya was captured by French forces. By this time, French forces proceeded to burn down villages where support for the rebels was high. A number of these villages' inhabitants were arrested or executed, prompting some rebels to ultimately surrender. On 11 or 12 July, Hananu fled to British-held Transjordan, seeking refuge with nationalists from Syria, to avoid arrest by the French authorities. British intelligence officers arrested Hananu while he was visiting Jerusalem and extradited him to Syria in August.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer. The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In the Soviet Union, {{both the}} Germans and the Soviets spent the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer of 1943 {{preparing}} for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted {{themselves against the}} Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences and, {{for the first time}} in the war, Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month. Also, in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over 40,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the copper shark is viviparous, in which the yolk sac of the {{developing}} embryo, once depleted, is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have one functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites the female {{as a prelude to}} mating. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place from October to December (<b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer), when both sexes have migrated into offshore waters at higher latitudes. Birthing seems to occur from June to January, peaking in October and November.|$|E

5|$|Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, {{where an}} alpine climate prevails. The Sierra {{receives}} heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts in the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level has dropped considerably, and some smaller tributaries dry up altogether. Up to 85% {{of the flow}} above Happy Isles comes from melting snow. In the dry season, groundwater provides the only base flow to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin Valley floor is dry enough to be considered semi-desert.|$|E
5|$|The SNRA is {{the primary}} {{destination}} for mountain climbers and rock climbers within the forest. Thompson Peak and Hyndman Peak are two popular peaks to hike to, and Mount Heyburn is a popular rock climbing destination. Opportunities for rafting and kayaking on the upper Salmon River with conditions range from flatwater to class IV whitewater. Water levels are highest during snowmelt in <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer. The large lakes in the Sawtooth Valley, including Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes, have developed boat accesses. Redfish Lake has a lodge with a marina, restaurant, and various activities. There are numerous hot springs distributed across the forest and open to public use. A few have developed tubs, including those in the Baumgartner Campground.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{populated}} with white-tailed deer, grouse and raccoon. The deer population, which was extirpated by 1895, has rebounded since re-introduction by park ranger Arthur Woody during the 1930s. Over 100 {{species of birds}} inhabit or migrate through the area, including native songbirds such as the Canada warbler, Blackburnian, black-throated blue, black-throated green and chestnut-sided warblers. Also found are hawks, owls, woodpeckers, kinglets, thrushes, vireos, cuckoos, phoebes, chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, brown creepers, wrens, tanagers, grosbeaks, indigo buntings and red crossbills. Migratory species are present during the late <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> fall, making the area popular among birdwatchers The creeks surrounding the lake are rich with species of salamanders.|$|E

5|$|When {{the pass}} is open in warmer weather, it {{is a popular}} destination. A scenic {{overlook}} near the pass allows visitors {{to take in the}} alpine tundra environment above treeline, and offers excellent views to the east of Mount Elbert, Colorado's highest peak and the second-highest mountain in the contiguous United States. Rock climbers are drawn to nearby bouldering opportunities, and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation. Backcountry skiers make use of the slopes during the late <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer. Since 2011 the pass has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge.|$|E
5|$|At Governor William Dennison's request, Garfield {{deferred}} {{his military}} ambitions {{to remain in}} the legislature, where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio's volunteer regiments. Afterward, the legislature adjourned and Garfield spent the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer on a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio, encouraging enlistment in the new regiments. Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets, Garfield returned to Ohio and, in August 1861, received a commission as a colonel in the 42nd Ohio Infantry regiment. The 42nd Ohio existed only on paper, so Garfield's first task was to fill its ranks. He did so quickly, recruiting many of his neighbors and former students. The regiment traveled to Camp Chase, outside Columbus, Ohio, to complete training. In December, Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky, where they joined the Army of the Ohio under Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{dendrochronology}} of wood {{samples from}} Chetro Ketl provided information on species selected, season of cutting, wood modification and use, {{as well as}} an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house. Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually, which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites in the canyon. Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> summer. This may indicate that enough in-house labor was available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation and planting. One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season.|$|E
