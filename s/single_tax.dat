During his term as representative, he worked to upgrade Edmonton's school system, along with upgrading the town's trade industry. He served in this capacity until 1902, when he was defeated. During his time, McCauley kept his focus on his development of the school system, introducing a <b>single</b> <b>tax</b> bill intended to give schools boards power to adopt the tax.|$|E

40|$|Discrete choice {{models of}} {{household}} location assume local public finance variables {{remain the same}} within a given taxing jurisdiction. Thus far, no such model has tested the validity of this assumption. This study employs McFadden’s (1978, 2001) discrete choice model to test for the significance of dwelling specific local taxes and public services on household location decisions within a <b>single</b> <b>taxing</b> jurisdiction. The findings indicate that such variables are significant determinants of location decisions even within a <b>single</b> <b>taxing</b> jurisdiction, {{and should not be}} assumed away. Failure to include such variables in a model may, therefore, result in biased statistical results. ...|$|R

25|$|The blowing house {{method of}} {{smelting}} tin was probably introduced {{early in the}} 14th century to replace the earliest method of smelting {{which had to be}} done in two stages – a first smelting probably took place near to the tinworks and the roughly smelted metal was taken to a stannary town to be smelted again to produce the final refined product. Each of these smeltings was taxed separately until 1303 when they were replaced by a <b>single</b> <b>tax</b> on the finished product. It is likely that this tax change was due to the improved smelting process provided by the blowing houses.|$|E

25|$|Stiglitz made early {{contributions}} to {{a theory of}} public finance stating that an optimal supply of local public goods can be funded entirely through capture of the land rents generated by those goods (when population distributions are optimal). Stiglitz dubbed this the 'Henry George theorem' {{in reference to the}} radical classical economist Henry George who famously advocated for land value tax. The explanation behind Stiglitz's finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by {{at least as much as}} its outlay cost. Furthermore, Stiglitz shows that a <b>single</b> <b>tax</b> on rents is necessary to provide the optimal supply of local public investment.

The initiator is responsible for mobilizing equity – usually, 20 - 25 % of investment cost. Examples of how much the initiator can be motivated in his decisions on choosing an agricultural project and in the production of specific agricultural products in the last decade are as follows: Reduced <b>single</b> <b>taxes</b> for agricultural producers to 6 % in Russia and 1 % in Belarus.
