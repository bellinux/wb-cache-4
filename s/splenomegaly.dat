5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (<b>splenomegaly)</b> and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{normal human}} spleen {{measures}} about 125 millimeters in length, and <b>splenomegaly</b> {{is an important}} clinical sign. There are 2 possibilities to evaluate <b>splenomegaly</b> in the clinical examination: percussion and palpation. Percussion {{can be done in}} this space.|$|E
25|$|Leukopenia and {{neutropenia}} – due to <b>splenomegaly</b> with splenic margination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Splenomegaly</b> (increase in {{size of the}} spleen) {{is found}} in 35% to 50% of patients.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin S/thalassemia: {{common in}} African and Mediterranean populations, is {{clinically}} similar to sickle-cell anemia, {{with the additional}} feature of <b>splenomegaly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Disorders include <b>splenomegaly,</b> {{where the}} spleen is {{enlarged}} for various reasons, such as cancer, specifically blood-based leukemias, and asplenia, where the spleen {{is not present}} or functions abnormally.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common signs of CMML is <b>splenomegaly,</b> found in {{approximately}} half of cases. Other less frequent signs and symptoms consist of anaemia, fever, weight loss, night sweats, infection, bleeding, synovitis, lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and peritoneal effusion.|$|E
25|$|A 1993 {{systematic}} review by The Rational Clinical Examination found that, {{as a test}} for <b>splenomegaly,</b> percussion over Traube's space yields a sensitivity and specificity of 62% and 72%, respectively. Specificity may be higher if the patient has not eaten {{in the last two}} hours.|$|E
25|$|Beneath Traube's space {{lies the}} stomach, which {{produces}} a tympanic sound on percussion. Dullness to percussion over Traube's space may indicate <b>splenomegaly,</b> although this {{can also be}} a normal finding after a meal or indicates left pleural effusion. Assessing dullness to percussion may be more difficult in obese patients.|$|E
25|$|Painless {{hepatomegaly}} and splenomegaly: {{the size}} of the spleen can be 1500-3000 ml, as opposed to the normal size of 50-200 ml. <b>Splenomegaly</b> may decrease the affected individual's capacity for eating by exerting pressure on the stomach. While painless, enlargement of spleen increases the risk of splenic rupture.|$|E
25|$|Enlarged spleen: The spleen aids in {{fighting}} infection and filters unwanted material, such as old or damaged blood cells. Thalassemia is {{often accompanied by}} {{the destruction of a}} large number of red blood cells and the task of removing these cells causes the spleen to enlarge. <b>Splenomegaly</b> can make anemia worse, and it can reduce the life of transfused red blood cells. Severe enlargement of the spleen may necessitate its removal.|$|E
25|$|Plasmodium vivax is a protozoal {{parasite}} and a human pathogen. The {{most frequent}} and widely distributed cause of recurring (Benign tertian) malaria, P. vivax {{is one of}} the five species of malaria parasites that commonly infect humans. It is less virulent than Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of the five, but vivax malaria can lead to severe disease and death due to <b>splenomegaly</b> (a pathologically enlarged spleen). P. vivax is carried by the female Anopheles mosquito, since it is only the female of the species that bites.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound is {{routinely}} {{used in the}} evaluation of cirrhosis. It may show a small and nodular liver in advanced cirrhosis along with increased echogenicity with irregular appearing areas. Other liver findings suggestive of cirrhosis in imaging are an enlarged caudate lobe, widening of the fissures and enlargement of the spleen. An enlarged spleen (<b>splenomegaly),</b> which normally measures less than 11–12cm in adults, is suggestive of cirrhosis with portal hypertension, in the right clinical context. Ultrasound may also screen for hepatocellular carcinoma, portal hypertension, and Budd-Chiari syndrome (by assessing flow in the hepatic vein).|$|E
25|$|Physical {{symptoms}} generally include coarse or rough {{facial features}} (including a flat nasal bridge, thick lips, and enlarged mouth and tongue), short stature with disproportionately short trunk (dwarfism), dysplasia (abnormal bone size and/or shape) and other skeletal irregularities, thickened skin, enlarged organs such as liver (hepatomegaly) or spleen (<b>splenomegaly),</b> hernias, and excessive body hair growth. Short and often claw-like hands, progressive joint stiffness, and {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} can restrict hand mobility and function. Recurring respiratory infections are common, as are obstructive airway disease and obstructive sleep apnea. Many affected individuals also have heart disease, often involving enlarged or diseased heart valves.|$|E
25|$|Abdominal pain due to hypersplenism and splenic {{infarction}} and right-upper quadrant pain {{caused by}} gallstones are major clinical manifestations. However, diagnosing thalassemiæ from symptoms alone is inadequate. Physicians note these signs as associative {{due to this}} disease's complexity. The following associative signs can attest to {{the severity of the}} phenotype: pallor, poor growth, inadequate food intake, <b>splenomegaly,</b> jaundice, maxillary hyperplasia, dental malocclusion, cholelithiasis, systolic ejection murmur in the presence of severe anemia and pathologic fractures. Based on symptoms, tests are ordered for a differential diagnosis. These tests include complete blood count; hemoglobin electrophoresis; serum transferrin, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity; urine urobilin and urobilogen; peripheral blood smear, which may show codocytes, or target cells; hematocrit; and serum bilirubin.|$|E

He is Board {{certified}} in both Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, and has expertise in global infectious diseases and tropical medicine, including clinical parasitology, virology, bacteriology and mycology. Ryan is the Director of Global Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, and in 2006 isolated a new bacterial species (Bartonella rochalimae) {{in the blood of}} a woman with fever and <b>splenomegaly</b> who had recently been in Peru. The bacterium was characterized with colleagues at the University of California at San Francisco and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ryan served with the Massachusetts General Hospital field deployment team aboard the USNS Mercy hospital ship in Banda Aceh, Indonesia following the December 26, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.|$|E

2500|$|Pancytopenia in HCL {{is caused}} {{primarily}} by marrow failure and <b>splenomegaly.</b> [...] Bone marrow failure {{is caused by}} the accumulation of hairy cells and reticulin fibrosis in the bone marrow, {{as well as by the}} detrimental effects of dysregulated cytokine production. [...] <b>Splenomegaly</b> reduces blood counts through sequestration, marginalization, and destruction of healthy blood cells inside the spleen.|$|E
2500|$|Less common manifestations include <b>splenomegaly,</b> {{hematuria}} and glomerulonephritis. [...] Headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia may occur. There {{have been}} three case reports suggesting meningitis or encephalitis.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study shows}} this disease is also {{associated}} with hepato <b>splenomegaly</b> [...] with renal anomalies including malrotation and solitary kidney. A rare incidence of choledochal cyst is also reported as well.|$|E
2500|$|In young ferrets, {{the disease}} {{progresses}} rapidly. [...] The most common symptom is difficulty breathing caused by {{enlargement of the}} thymus. [...] Other symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, depression, and coughing. [...] It can also masquerade as a chronic disease such as an upper respiratory infection or gastrointestinal disease. [...] In older ferrets, lymphoma is usually chronic and can exhibit no symptoms for years. [...] Symptoms seen {{are the same as}} in young ferrets, plus <b>splenomegaly,</b> abdominal masses, and peripheral lymph node enlargement.|$|E
2500|$|Niemann–Pick type C {{has a wide}} {{clinical}} spectrum. Affected {{individuals may}} have {{enlargement of the spleen}} (<b>splenomegaly)</b> and liver (hepatomegaly), or enlarged spleen or liver combined (hepatosplenomegaly), but this finding may be absent in later onset cases. [...] Prolonged jaundice or elevated bilirubin can present at birth. [...] In some cases, however, enlargement of the spleen or liver does not occur for months or years – or not at all. [...] Enlargement of the spleen or liver frequently becomes less apparent with time, in contrast to the progression of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann–Pick disease, Types A and B or Gaucher disease. Organ enlargement does not usually cause major complications.|$|E
2500|$|Middleton {{was invited}} to join the faculty at the University of Wisconsin (UW; in Madison, WI) - then a 2-year medical school - {{immediately}} after his internship. He moved to Madison in 1912 as a Clinical Instructor in Medicine, principally serving students at the fledgling UW student health center, along with its director, Dr. Joseph Spragg Evans. Middleton had broad interests regarding areas of clinical investigation, but they especially centered on sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, hematological disorders, infectious diseases and medical history. He steadily rose through the academic ranks, and when the medical school became a four-year degree-granting entity in 1924 and built a university hospital, Middleton emerged as a central figure in the education of third- and fourth-year clinical clerks as well as house officers in internal medicine. He was known for his mastery of the physical examination [...] and for his consummate professionalism. Middleton sign {{is still one of the}} best methods for identifying <b>splenomegaly.</b> A novel and innovative program of [...] "preceptorships" [...] was initiated in 1926, wherein senior medical students were assigned to work with community practitioners throughout Wisconsin as a prelude to internship. That system of mentoring continues to this day. After the death of UW medical school Dean Charles Russell Bardeen in 1935, Middleton was named as his successor. The deanship was a difficult position at that time, because of growing factionalism among academic departments and their faculty members. In spite of that problem, the school flourished under Dean Middleton's guidance over 20 years. He continued to teach actively and to pursue his own research interests despite the administrative demands on his time, ultimately producing more than 300 contributions to the peer-reviewed medical literature. In 1939, the American Board of Internal Medicine was constituted under the aegis of the American Board of Medical Specialties. Middleton was asked to serve as one of the eight initial Board members, and was named Secretary-Treasurer of the organization. He was instrumental in formulating a national curriculum for residency training in internal medicine and a structured system of examination to achieve board-certification in that medical specialty.|$|E

50|$|Tropical <b>splenomegaly</b> syndrome, {{also known}} as hyperreactive malarial <b>splenomegaly,</b> occurs due {{immunological}} over-stimulation to repeated attacks of malarial infection {{over a long period}} of time. Condition is usually seen in malaria-endemic areas like Africa and Indian subcontinent. Tropical <b>Splenomegaly</b> Syndrome is characterized by massive <b>splenomegaly,</b> hepatomegaly, marked elevations in levels of serum IgM and anti-malarial antibodies. The spleen is massively enlarged. It shows dilated sinusoids lined with reticulum cells. There is a marked erythrophagocytosis and lymphocytic infiltration of the pulp. Peripheral smear for malarial parasite is usually negative.|$|E
50|$|In {{asymptomatic}} patients {{where there}} is a very low clinical suspicion for <b>splenomegaly,</b> physical examination alone is unlikely to rule-in <b>splenomegaly</b> due to the inadequate sensitivity of the examination. Similar to many other findings in medicine, Castell's sign must be combined with clinical findings to rule in <b>splenomegaly.</b> To achieve a positive predictive value over 90%, the pretest probability must be 70%. Grover et al., recommends a greater than 10% preexamination clinical suspicion of splenic enlargement to effectively rule in the diagnosis of <b>splenomegaly</b> with physical exam. However, a 10% pretest probability only yields a positive predictive value of 35%.|$|E
50|$|Splenic {{infarction}} is {{also more}} common in hematological disorders with associated <b>splenomegaly,</b> such as the myeloproliferative disorders. Other causes of <b>splenomegaly</b> (for example, Gaucher disease or hemoglobinopathies) can also predispose to infarction. Splenic infarction can also result from a sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell anemia. Both <b>splenomegaly</b> and a tendency towards clot formation feature in this condition. In sickle cell disease, repeated splenic infarctions lead to a non-functional spleen (autosplenectomy).|$|E

50|$|<b>Splenomegaly,</b> {{although}} {{associated with}} numerous diseases, {{remains one of}} the more elusive physical exam findings in the abdomen. Conditions such as infectious mononucleosis, thalassemia, and cirrhotic liver disease may all involve <b>splenomegaly</b> and as a result, the search for a reliable sign associated with this condition has been sought for generations. Currently, several such signs of <b>splenomegaly</b> exist, all of whose utility has been debated in medical literature. The presence or absence of <b>splenomegaly,</b> however, can be reliably appreciated on physical exam using Castell's sign in conjunction with other clinical information, increasing the positive predictive value of the test. When used in a decision-making rubric, Castell's sign becomes a valuable part of deciding whether to pursue further imaging.|$|E
