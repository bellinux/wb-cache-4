40|$|The {{integration}} of Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>models</b> of practice learning has been utilised within one Scottish university's undergraduate nursing programmes since 2011. Early {{findings suggest that}} generally, students exhibit a greater depth of understanding when the Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>model</b> is incorporated into practice learning (Roxburgh, Conlon and Banks, 2012). Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>models</b> of practice learning can present {{in a variety of}} forms but overall the approach has become generally accepted in nurse education as a 'value added' model to learning as they provide the opportunity for deeper student learning experiences that also enhance a person centred approach to nursing care. However, the quality of the Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>models</b> can become easily distilled. Reasons can include organisational and capacity issues of the institution and the placement provider. In addition, restrictions of placement areas, regulatory requirements and curriculum demands can all result in a very much reduced version of the Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>model.</b> If this occurs, the practice learning experience can then become easily compressed into short, disjointed and disconnected learning experiences that prioritise the administrative and curricular demands of the programme over the quality of the student learning. Thus, the Hub and Spoke approach requires further exploration to supply robust evidence which ensures only quality interpretations of the model are available. This mixed method case study approach aims to explore the student experience of Hub and Spoke learning by deconstructing the model to identify which characteristics best benefit the student's learning. This means specifically studying the component parts of the Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>model</b> that impacted on three distinct areas: 1. The students ability to connect with the person rather than the patient 2. Connection with the family of that person and in turn the wider community 3. Security in the students' own learning process The aim of this research is to identify and uncover the core characteristics of the Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>model</b> that best enhances, supports and develops student learning in practice.

In March 2015, during a drunken binge, Neil causes a car accident that leads to district attorney Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell) and police chief Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) losing their unborn child and to keep Neil out of prison, Devon immediately contacts Leslie to represent him. Devon is shocked when Hilary blackmails ADA Winston Mobley (Ryan Caltagirone) into giving Neil a suspended sentence. Hilary finally comes clean about her schemes and tells Devon she is still in love with him and she only left him so he could salvage a relationship with Neil. Devon and Hilary reunite and announce their engagement shortly after Hilary and Neil's divorce is finalized. Devon and Hilary support Lily when her marriage falls apart after her own affair Joe Clark (Scott Elrod) and she assist them with wedding planning.

Maya is shocked to learn the child has died and Dayzee encourages Maya to leave town fearing Maya will upset her happy life with Marcus Forrester (Texas Battle) -- the adopted son of the Forrester family fashion dynasty. While volunteering at Dayzee's coffee shop in exchange for staying in the apartment upstairs, Maya falls for Rick Forrester (Jacob Young) -- believing he is a waiter. Maya notices Rick is unhappy with girlfriend Caroline Spencer (Linsey Godfrey) and tries to distract him. The two go window shopping on Rodeo Drive where they share their first kiss and when Maya is trying on gowns at the Forrester Creations boutique, she learns Rick's true identity and it scares her away. Maya finds comfort with Carter Walton (Lawrence Saint-Victor) which makes for an awkward first date at the Forrester mansion where Caroline makes sure to stake her claim on Rick. Maya turns down a second date with Carter and he assist her getting Rick back. Rick and Maya's early romance is plagued by Caroline's interference and insults in which Caroline constantly refers to Maya by the wrong names. Maya is ecstatic when she gets cast in a movie role only to learn {{that it is an}} adult film. She turns the job down and Rick instead hires her as a <b>spokes</b> <b>model</b> for the company. Caroline taunts Maya about her inexperience leading to Rick hiring professionals to help train Maya. While he wants to be Maya, Rick struggles with trying to let Caroline down easy and Maya pressures him to choose. Caroline refuses to accept that Rick is choosing Maya and her publishing mogul uncle, Bill Spencer (Don Diamont) threatens to send Maya back to prison if she doesn't stay away from Rick. Despite the threats, Maya continues seeing Rick and soon runs into her ex-boyfriend Jesse (Ricky Paull Goldin) thanks to Bill who knows that Maya being seen with Jesse could land her back in jail. Maya turns down a reunion with Jesse and is forced to tell him that their baby died. Bill threatens Maya with photographs of her encounter with Jesse and she confides in Carter and Rick about Bill's blackmail leading to Rick officially dumping Caroline for Maya. Maya is later hired by producer Rafael (Andy Zuno) to star opposite Carter as in his web series, Room 8. However, the steamy romantic scenes lead the two developing chemistry. Despite the obvious attraction, Maya remains faithful to Rick. During one particular scene, Maya hesitates and then discovers Rafael is in cahoots with Caroline to get Rick jealous enough to dump Maya. Rafael makes it up to Carter and Maya by having them shoot the series in its original incarnation. When Rick misses the Room 8 premiere in favor of work, Maya and Carter share a drink and kiss but she stops it from going any further. Having learned that Carter and Maya spent the together, Rick questions her loyalty despite Maya's assurances that nothing happened. Maya tries to reconcile with Rick only to find him with Caroline; Maya then ends the relationship and resigns from her modeling position at Forrester. Maya is shocked when Carter suddenly proposes and she accepts believing she and Carter are a better fit for one another, like Caroline and Rick. While Carter discusses wedding plans, Maya pines for Rick and she is ready to confess until Rick and Caroline announce their engagement.

40|$|The hub and <b>spoke</b> <b>model</b> is one {{approach}} to nursing students’ practice learning, which involves a base practice placement (hub), {{from which the}} student’s learning is complemented by additional activities (<b>spokes).</b> This <b>model</b> has been integrated into Edinburgh Napier University’s undergraduate nursing programmes since 2011, and it is considered to enhance practice learning.   Aim To explore {{the characteristics of the}} hub and <b>spoke</b> <b>model</b> that support nursing students’ learning and enable them to improve their understanding of a person-centred approach to care.   Method The study involved nursing students from two fields of practice – child health and mental health. A mixed methods approach was used, using a questionnaire and three focus groups.   Findings A total of 24 students completed the questionnaire, while 27 students participated in the focus groups. The questionnaire results indicated that participants were able to undertake spoke activities in their practice, which enabled them to understand communities’ issues and to better understand their learning competencies. Three themes emerged from the focus groups that encapsulated participants’ experience of hub and spoke learning in practice: value for learning, making connections, and organisations and systems.   Conclusion There were several positive effects on nursing students’ practice learning {{as a result of the}} hub and <b>spoke</b> <b>model</b> approach to practice learning.

Objectives: To evaluate the impact of Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>model(s)</b> of clinical practice placement across geographically diverse locations, with a particular focus on enhancing the student practice learning experience. Design: Multiple case study design. Setting & Participants: Comprised undergraduate student nurses from Adult, Learning Disability and Mental Health programmes from 3 Scottish Schools of Nursing. Methods: A mixed methods approach which included quantitative and qualitative date tools. Results: All three Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>models</b> shared two broad findings: 1) which supports the process with opportunities for individual students to be positively innovative and creative in their learning approaches. Depth of learning was achieved in two ways; a) the method in which Hub placements are organised, managed and structured and, b) the depth of empathy and sensitivity to the individual at the centre of the care. In the three Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>models</b> detailed in this paper, there is a continuum of student led learning 2) Engagement of mentors/enhanced student/mentor relationship.
