5|$|Natural predators of the California <b>spiny</b> lobster include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant {{sea bass}} and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, <b>spiny</b> lobsters including the California <b>spiny</b> lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, <b>spiny</b> lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E
5|$|California <b>spiny</b> {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, {{hiding in}} crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the <b>spiny</b> lobsters form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E
5|$|Female California <b>spiny</b> {{lobsters}} reach {{sexual maturity}} at {{a length of}} , which is typically at an age of 5–9 years; males are sexually mature after 3–6 years. Because all the hard parts are lost at each molt, {{the life span of}} mature <b>spiny</b> lobsters is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, <b>spiny</b> {{lobsters}} are {{an important}} commercial resource, representing the fifth most valuable fishery, worth US$18 million. Three species are exploited along the Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula, but the catch of 744t of the California <b>spiny</b> lobster makes up 95%–97% of the total, with only small quantities of Panulirus inflatus and Panulirus gracilis. The fishing rights are held by 26 local co-operatives.|$|E
5|$|Species that {{do need to}} swim {{continuously}} {{to breathe}} go through {{a process known as}} sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the <b>spiny</b> dogfish that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so <b>spiny</b> dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping, and this also may be the case in larger shark species.|$|E
5|$|The California <b>spiny</b> lobster {{is one of}} 19 {{species in}} the genus Panulirus, {{which is one of}} several genera of <b>spiny</b> {{lobsters}} whose names are anagrams of the original <b>spiny</b> lobster genus, Palinurus. Its closest relatives are not the other species that occur in the East Pacific, but rather Panulirus argus from the Caribbean Sea and West Pacific species such as Panulirus japonicus, Panulirus marginatus, Panulirus pascuensis, Panulirus cygnus and Panulirus longipes; this relationship has been recovered from comparative studies of adult and larval morphology, as well as from molecular phylogenetics, using the sequences from cytochrome c oxidase and 16S ribosomal RNA genes.|$|E
5|$|The main legal {{restrictions}} on fishing for California <b>spiny</b> lobster in Mexico are a minimum landing size of , {{the prohibition of}} catching berried females, and a closed season: from February 16 to November 15, fishing for <b>spiny</b> lobsters is prohibited in a region which moves south along Mexico's Pacific coast during the season.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spiny</b> scallop can be {{distinguished}} from its close relative the Pacific pink scallop (Chlamys rubida) by the valves being less rounded and by the small curved spines on the ribs which give it a rough texture whereas the Pacific pink feels smooth. The glossy white interior of the <b>spiny</b> scallop's shell often has a purplish blotch near the umbone, not present in the Pacific pink.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{a federally}} {{designated}} park, fishing within Biscayne {{is governed by}} the state of Florida. Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational saltwater fishing license. Fishing is limited to designated sport fish, <b>spiny</b> lobster, stone crab, blue crab and shrimp. Tropical reef fish may not be collected, nor may sharks, conch, sea urchins and other marine life. Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors. Additionally, lobstering is prohibited in the Biscayne Bay-Card Sound Lobster Sanctuary, administered {{by the state of}} Florida to protect <b>spiny</b> lobster breeding areas, which overlaps much of Biscayne Bay.|$|E
5|$|Boidinia: corticioid; loose texture; surface smooth, with pores, or flaky; spores spherical with <b>spiny</b> to warty ornamentation. Note {{that the}} genus is polyphyletic {{and needs to}} be redefined.|$|E
5|$|Females {{can carry}} up to 680,000 eggs, which hatch after 10 weeks into flat phyllosoma larvae. These feed on {{plankton}} before the metamorphosis into the juvenile state. Adults are nocturnal and migratory, living among rocks at depths {{of up to}} , and feeding on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. The <b>spiny</b> lobster is eaten by various fish, octopuses and sea otters, but can defend itself with a loud noise produced by its antennae. The California <b>spiny</b> lobster {{is the subject of}} both commercial and recreational fishery in both Mexico and the United States, with sport fishermen using hoop nets and commercial fishermen using lobster traps.|$|E
5|$|Lobster fishers may not land {{more than}} seven California <b>spiny</b> {{lobsters}} on any given day, and may not have {{more than seven}} in their possession at any time.|$|E
5|$|Mycenastrum corium subsp. ferrugineum {{has a deep}} rusty red to {{reddish orange}} gleba, clearly {{distinguishing}} it from the glebal coloring of the main subspecies. M.corium var. diabolicum has an extremely <b>spiny</b> capillitium.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 80 {{species of}} fish and {{shellfish}} are commercially harvested from seamounts, including <b>spiny</b> lobster (Palinuridae), mackerel (Scombridae and others), red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus), red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), tuna (Scombridae), Orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), and perch (Percidae).|$|E
5|$|Open {{season for}} California <b>spiny</b> lobster {{runs from the}} Saturday before the first Wednesday in October until the first Wednesday after March 15.|$|E
5|$|The California <b>spiny</b> lobster can be {{differentiated}} {{from the}} other species in the genus by the interrupted grooves across the abdomen; other species either lack grooves, or have grooves which span the entire body segment.|$|E
5|$|The California <b>spiny</b> lobster {{is found}} {{in parts of the}} Gulf of California, and along the Pacific coast of the length of the Baja California peninsula, {{extending}} as far north as San Luis Obispo Bay, California. There are occasional records from Monterey Bay, but the water there is too cold for the California <b>spiny</b> lobster to breed, and it is thought that any adult found in Central California arrived as a larva during El Niño years.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican fishery for the California <b>spiny</b> lobster was {{the first}} Latin American fishery to be awarded the Marine Stewardship Council's {{sustainable}} fishery ecolabel, and the species is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The name Irruputuncu {{derives from}} Aymara iru <b>spiny</b> Peruvian feather grass and phutunqu a small vessel or a hole, pit, crater. Alternative names are Irruputunco and Iruputuncu.|$|E
5|$|There is {{an annual}} migration, in which <b>spiny</b> {{lobsters}} enter shallower water {{in spring and}} summer, and head out to deeper water in fall and winter, reaching depths as great as , perhaps to avoid the effects of winter storms.|$|E
5|$|To {{fish for}} <b>spiny</b> lobster south of Point Arguello, a sport fishing license with ocean {{enhancement}} stamp must be displayed or kept nearby.|$|E
5|$|Admitting {{that plants}} {{generally}} have less obvious evidence of 'a designed and studied mechanism' than animals, still Paley adds some examples, {{as of the}} parts of the seed, the delicate germ being protected by a tough or <b>spiny</b> husk, and dispersed by wings or other appendages.|$|E
5|$|All Russulaceae, {{including}} the corticioid species, are characterised by spherical to elliptic basidiospores {{with a faint}} to very distinct (e.g. warty, <b>spiny,</b> or crested) ornamentation that stains bluish-black with Melzer's reagent (an amyloid stain reaction). Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually club-shaped and four-spored. Russulaceae species do not have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|Chlamys hastata, {{the spear}} scallop, <b>spiny</b> scallop or {{swimming}} scallop, is {{a species of}} bivalve mollusc in the family Pectinidae found {{on the west coast}} of North America from the Gulf of Alaska to San Diego, California. A limited number of these scallops are harvested by divers or by narrow trawls off the west coast of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Desmoncus is a genus of <b>spiny,</b> scrambling, pinnate-leaved palms {{which range}} from Mexico in the north to Bolivia and Brazil in the south. Ten of the twelve species in have solely {{continental}} distributions. Two species are found on both the mainland and in the insular Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|For {{those using}} lobster traps, the fishing effort is {{greatest}} {{at the beginning}} of the permitted season in California, and peters out towards the end of the season, 24 weeks later. Although the fishing effort becomes better concentrated on areas with more <b>spiny</b> lobsters during the season, the fishing efficiency (catch per unit effort) nonetheless decreases throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|HD {{affects the}} whole brain, but certain areas are more {{vulnerable}} than others. The most prominent early effects are {{in a part of}} the basal ganglia called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen. Other areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal <b>spiny</b> neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and <b>spiny</b> cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Greenpeace International {{added the}} school shark, shortfin mako shark, {{mackerel}} shark, tiger shark and <b>spiny</b> dogfish to its seafood red list, {{a list of}} common supermarket fish that are often sourced from unsustainable fisheries. Advocacy group Shark Trust campaigns to limit shark fishing. Advocacy group Seafood Watch directs American consumers to not eat sharks.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of teleost species {{belong to the}} clade Euteleostei, which consists of 17,419 species classified in 2,935 genera and 346 families. Shared traits of the euteleosts include similarities in the embryonic development of the bony or cartilaginous structures located between the head and dorsal fin (supraneural bones), an outgrowth on the stegural bone (a bone located near the neural arches of the tail) and caudal median cartilages located between hypurals of the caudal base. The {{majority of}} euteleosts are in the clade Neoteleosti. A derived trait of neoteleosts is a muscle that controls the pharyngeal jaws, giving them a role in grinding food. Within neoteleosts, the Acanthopterygii have a <b>spiny</b> dorsal fin which {{is in front of}} the soft-rayed dorsal fin. This fin helps provide thrust in locomotion and may also play a role in defense. Acanthomorphs have developed <b>spiny</b> ctenoid scales (as opposed to the cycloid scales of other groups), tooth-bearing premaxilla and greater adaptations to high speed swimming.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spiny</b> {{plates on}} the back and tail of the tuatara {{resemble}} those of a crocodile more than a lizard, but the tuatara shares with lizards the ability to break off its tail when caught by a predator, and then regenerate it.|$|E
5|$|This bird is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN and is threatened by habitat destruction. Since the arid, <b>spiny</b> forests in which it lives are not protected by the Malagasy government, it is losing habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and logging. It is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|This {{order of}} starfish {{consists}} mostly of deep-sea and other cold-water starfish {{often with a}} global distribution. The shape is pentagonal or star-shaped with five to fifteen arms. They mostly have poorly developed skeletons with papulae widely distributed on the aboral surface and often <b>spiny</b> pedicellariae. This group includes the slime star.|$|E
5|$|Vertebrates {{including}} {{several species of}} frog put on warning displays; some of these species have poison glands. Among the mammals, deimatic displays are found in species with strong defences, such as in foul-smelling skunks and <b>spiny</b> porcupines. Such displays are often combined with warning coloration. Thus these displays in both frogs and mammals are {{at least in part}} aposematic.|$|E
5|$|A small, fast-swimming predator, the blacknose shark feeds {{primarily}} on small, bony fishes, including pinfish, croakers, porgies, anchovies, <b>spiny</b> boxfish, and porcupinefish, {{as well as}} on octopus and other cephalopods. When competing for bait, their speed allows them to snatch food from larger sharks such as the Caribbean reef shark (C. perezi). This species may form large schools that are sometimes associated with anchovies and mullet. Blacknose sharks demonstrate a high degree of philopatry: both juveniles and adults have been documented returning to the same local area year after year.|$|E
5|$|As {{with nearly}} all primates, strepsirrhines {{typically}} reside in tropical rainforests. These habitats allow strepsirrhines and other primates to evolve diverse communities of sympatric species. In the eastern rainforests of Madagascar, {{as many as}} 11 or 12species share the same forests, and prior to human arrival, some forests had nearly double that diversity. Several species of lemur are found in drier, seasonal forests, including the <b>spiny</b> forest on {{the southern tip of}} the island, although the lemur communities in these regions are not as rich.|$|E
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and <b>spiny</b> dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E
