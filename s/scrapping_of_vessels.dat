40|$|The {{scrapping}} of ocean-going vessels {{is currently}} done mainly {{in a few}} states in Asia. Because of the hazardous materials contained in the ships, the scrapping poses a significant danger to both the workers in the shipbreaking yards {{as well as to}} the environment. The international community has been aware of the problems related with shipbreaking for over a decade, and has in different ways tried to improve the practices. Moreover, attention has turned to the regime governing the movement of waste, as it has been argued that a vessel destined for scrapping should be defined as waste under the regime. The waste movement regime contains provisions that control and restrict the transboundary movement of waste. Applying the regime could thus hinder vessels containing hazardous materials from being scrapped in Asia. This thesis examines how the shipbreaking industry functions, what considerations are made before selling a ship for scrapping, and where and how the scrapping is done. Furthermore, the study provides and overview of actions taken so far by different stakeholders that are trying to solve the problems connected with shipbreaking. The main attention is, however, paid to the regulations governing the movement of waste and how the regulations can be applied to vessels destined for scrapping. It is argued that although the waste movement regime can be applied to vessels, the enforcement of the regulation contains some major weaknesses. These weaknesses result in the regime not being effective at solving the problems related with the <b>scrapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels.</b> Finally, the thesis examines the IMO Draft Convention on ship recycling. The Convention is currently being negotiated with the intention to adopt it in May 2009. The procedures laid down by the regulation are explained and some issues that remain unsolved are presented. This is accompanied by some critique of the Convention that has been put forward by environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In the light of the critique from the NGOs and the earlier discussed weaknesses of the waste movement regime, the draft Convention is assessed. The conclusion is that although the draft Convention contains clear improvements of the present situation concerning the <b>scrapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels,</b> the enforcement of the Convention still leaves room for some questions. Moreover, the draft Convention does not fully succeed to allocate the costs caused by shipbreaking in a manner that is in accordance with principles of international environmental law...|$|E

50|$|The {{streetcar}} boats {{proved to}} be very successful and profitable for many years. A seventh vessel, the Excelsior, {{was added to the}} fleet in 1915 because of high ridership. However, ridership plummeted when roads were improved around Lake Minnetonka in the early 1920s. By the middle of the decade, TCRT could only afford to operate two steamboat lines, but even then could only break-even. Eventually TCRT could no longer afford to operate any steamboat lines, and in 1926 all steamboat service was discontinued. Three of the streetcar boats were scuttled that summer, including the Minnehaha. Three others were <b>scrapped.</b> One <b>of</b> the <b>vessels,</b> the Hopkins, was sold to a private entity and used as an excursion boat until it, too, was scuttled in 1949.|$|R

Their time with the fleet was spent conducting training exercises, along with occasional travels to foreign countries. In late 1900s, Partenope and Minerva were converted into minelayers and Euridice and Calatafimi were sold for <b>scrap.</b> Several <b>of</b> the <b>vessels</b> saw action during the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, primarily conducting shore bombardments in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Three more vesselsUrania, Aretusa, and Caprerawere sold in the later stages of the war or shortly thereafter. Partenope laid minefields in the Adriatic Sea after Italy entered World War I in 1915, and was later sunk by a German U-boat in March 1918. Minerva and Iride survived the war and were sold for scrap in 1921 and 1920, respectively.|$|R
