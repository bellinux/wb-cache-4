5|$|The Mew Mews {{are young}} {{girls who have}} been {{injected}} with the genes of endangered species, giving them the ability to transform into Mew Mews. The project chose endangered species because they felt that these species would have the strongest desire to preserve their kind. These superheroes are biological weapons tasked with fighting the chimera anima, the monsters created when alien parasites infect a living host. They are later called on to fight the aliens that were {{the source of the}} Chimera Anima invasion. The creation of the first five Mew Mews occurred accidentally. The head of the project, Ryô Shirogane, originally intended to inject a Chimera Anima with the endangered animal genes directly to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> would reverse the effects of the infection. Instead, it was accidentally injected into five different girls when the earthquake happened.|$|E
500|$|Akagis {{modernization}} involved {{far less}} work {{than that of}} Kaga, but took three times as long due to financial difficulties related to the Great Depression. The ship's three flight decks were judged too small to handle the larger and heavier aircraft then coming into service. As a result, the middle and lower flight decks were eliminated in favor of two enclosed hangar decks that extended almost {{the full length of}} the ship. The upper and middle hangar areas' total space increased to about the lower hangar remained the same size. The upper flight deck was extended to the bow, increasing its length to [...] and raising aircraft capacity to 86 (61 operational and 25 in storage). A third elevator midships, [...] in size, was added. Her arrester gear was replaced by a Japanese-designed, hydraulic, Type 1 system with 9 wires. The modernization added an island superstructure on the port side of the ship, which was an unusual arrangement; the only other carrier to share this feature was a contemporary, the [...] The port side was chosen as an experiment to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> side was better for flight operations by moving the island away from the ship's exhaust outlets. The new flight deck inclined slightly fore and aft from a point about three-eighths of the way aft.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} a new character {{created by the}} winner of the [...] "Best. Character. Ever." [...] contest, in which fans could submit their own ideas for a new, and possibly recurring, Simpsons character. Over 25,000 entries were sent in. The winner of the contest was Peggy Black from Orange, Connecticut, who created the character Ricardo Bomba. She described Ricardo as [...] "someone that all the women love and all the men want to be". Black's inspiration for the character came from {{the fact that there were}} no characters like him on The Simpsons, and she thought Springfield needed [...] "something like a Casanova". As part of the winning prize, Black was sent to work with the show's producers in Los Angeles. She worked with the animators to bring the character to life. In an interview with the Associated Press, Black stated she [...] "described the character and they drew him so I could <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> was my vision of him". She continued, [...] "It's amazing to see how they captured what I imagined. He's over the top." [...] Executive producer Al Jean was one of the judges of the contest, which he described as [...] "a thank you to loyal fans". Jean also noted that there is a possibility the Ricardo character might appear on the show again although this seems unlikely since the character appears to have been killed in a fiery car crash.|$|E

500|$|Upon the {{announcement}} of the first four male finalists, there were viewers of the show who had negative reactions regarding its format. They were shocked, disappointed, and were left complaining as two of the contestants that were favored by the judges based on their performances failed to make the cut. Instead, two others who had rather bad reviews from the jurors took the spots. Viewers critical to the program concluded that it was just another [...] "popularity contest" [...] rather than a singing competition. [...] Cayabyab mentioned that people should not be complacent regarding the contestants' status on the show, and advised them to keep on voting for their favorites because of the show's uncertainty. This criticism was also reflected during the Women's Semi-finals, as talent critics believed two contenders that failed to make the cut should have become finalists. Critics also noted that viewers did not take heed to the judges' remarks about performance. [...] Torre stated in his article that the results of Philippine Idol Semi-finals revealed that viewers were not yet knowledgeable or objective enough to pick the first Idol, and pointed to the compromised voting based on [...] "subjective campaigns" [...] from some of the semi-finalists' backers. He later commented that the show did not affirm a contestant's popularity but [...] "the determination and deep pockets of his supporters." [...] This was supported on a report published by the Manila Bulletin about contestants who [...] "buy their way to the top". Cayabyab divulged that he did not expect the way people voted and would <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> trend would continue in the coming weeks. However, he admitted that such campaigns were part of the game.|$|E

Settling in Melbourne, he {{was active in}} Australian trade unions and became an organiser for the Australian Labor Party. However, he grew disillusioned with the party, believing it was being corrupted {{by the nature of}} government and concerned only with winning elections. He felt that the federal Labour MPs were unable and unwilling to change society, and their prominence within the movement was stifling and over-shadowing organised labour. He resigned from the ALP and founded the Victorian Socialist Party.|$|E

Rogen pointed to Heigl's work in the film The Ugly Truth to illustrate his point. Rogen said: [...] "I hear there's a scene where she's wearing underwear with a vibrator in it, so I'd have to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> is uplifting for women." [...] Apatow attempted to discredit Heigl's criticisms, chalking up her harsh words to exhaustion {{at the end of}} a long day of interviews and stating that he had expected an apology from Heigl.

On the day of Redbird Smith's funeral, a {{large white}} crane flew from the east at sun rise and lit in a tree next to the stomp ground. According to John Smith, the most {{influential}} Nighthawk leader among Redbird Smith's sons, [...] "We were up in the stomp ground fixing to have services for my father when this crane was sitting in the tree near the stomp ground. C.P. Cornelius said, 'You watch and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> crane isn't down by the graveyard when we bury your father.' [...] Pretty soon the crane flew off and lit in a tree just west of the graveyard. When we carried my father's coffin down to the graveyard, the crane sat there in that tree and hollered. After we buried my father, the crane sat there until sundown and then flew off to the west." [...] This event was reported by the Cherokee as an omen, for a crane is very wild and hardly ever can one approach within fifty yards of it without flying away.|$|E

He had a tour of the T-Mobile Arena. Although Nigeria, Dubai and China were discussed, Hearn warmed up to the idea of the fight taking place in Las Vegas. Hearn told Sky Sports, [...] "We met with Richard Sturm and the team at MGM in Las Vegas yesterday and had a full tour of the T-Mobile Arena which is very impressive. There is a huge appetite from both sides to hold the rematch there and we will be talking further over the next week or so to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> can become a reality." [...] Showtime's Stephen Espinoza said a deal could be reached quickly, as he was also eager to get Joshua, who has a contract with Showtime, to fight in USA, [...] "It's no secret we've been salivating about getting him over here and certainly that would be a phenomenal fight. It would be the biggest heavyweight Vegas fight in probably a couple of decades, so we would love to host it." [...] On 25 July, Hearn pencilled in 11 November 2017 for the rematch to take place at the T-Mobile Arena. It was reported the fight could be pay-per-view in USA.|$|E
