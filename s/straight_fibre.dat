40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} how variable fibre geometry influences the excitation and blocking threshold of an undulating peripheral nerve fibre. The sensitivity of the excitation and blocking thresholds of the nerve fibres to various geometric and stimulation parameters was examined. The nerve fibres had a spiral shape (defined by the undulation wavelength, undulation amplitude and phase), and the internodal length varied. Diameter-selective stimulation of nerve fibres was obtained using anodal block. Simulation was performed using a two-part simulation model: a volume conductor model to calculate the electrical potential distribution inside a tripolar cuff electrode and a model of a peripheral undulating human nerve fibre to simulate the fibre response to stimulation. The excitation threshold of the undulating fibres was up to 100 % higher than the excitation threshold of the straight fibres. When a nerve was stimulated with long pulses, which are typically applied for anodal block (> 400 μs), the blocking threshold of the undulating fibres was up to four times higher than the blocking threshold of the straight fibres. Dependencies of the excitation threshold on geometric and stimulation parameters were the same as for a <b>straight</b> <b>fibre.</b> Dependencies of the blocking threshold on geometric and stimulation parameters were different compared with a <b>straight</b> <b>fibre.</b> Owing to the fibre undulation and variable internodal length, the blocking threshold and the minimum pulse duration to obtain anodal block were generally different in the proximal and distal directions. Owing to variable fibre geometry, the excitation threshold varied by up to ± 40 % of the mean value, and the blocking threshold varied by up to ± 60 % of the mean value. Owing to undulation, the blocking threshold of large fibres could be higher than the blocking threshold of small-diameter fibres, even if they had the same geometry. The results indicate that, during skeletal muscle stretching and contracting or during variation in joint angle, the excitation and blocking thresholds of the nerve fibres change owing to variations in fibre geometry. A <b>straight</b> <b>fibre</b> model could be too simple for modelling the response of peripheral nerve fibres to electrical stimulation...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to seek a way to improve the {{transfer}} of post crack forces in concrete using <b>fibre</b> technology. When <b>straight</b> <b>fibres</b> are added to a concrete mix, the direction of the fibres can be influenced by the mould, balling together and random orientation. This may result in a smaller percentage of fibres being effective when compared to that which it was originally designed for, when coping with post crack forces in concrete. The closed loop fibre technology is designed to place the fibres in an orientation and position where they will be of most benefit, thus reducing the likelihood of having fibres in concrete where they will not be of structural benefit and as a result of this, they will maximise the engineering qualities of the fibre addition. Beams were manufactured with a fixed addition of fibres by weight, and then they were tested for toughness (energy absorption) using a three point test, recording load and deflection. As an additional measure of the beams ability to absorb energy, a drop hammer test was used to analyse the energy absorbed and the total impact energy dissipated. The findings showed a significant improvement in performance when closed loop fibres were used, when compared to an equal dose of <b>straight</b> steel <b>fibres.</b> This work is significant in that the closed loop fibres are not commercially available at this present time and this research assists in a new product development. Closed loop fibres use lower amounts of steel than <b>straight</b> <b>fibres</b> for an equivalent performance to be achieved.

This paper presents an optimization strategy {{for the design of}} postbuckling behaviour of VAT composite laminates under axial compression. The postbuckling performance of composite laminated plates for a given compression loading is assessed by studying both the maximum transverse displacement and the end-shortening strain. For the postbuckling analysis of VAT composite plates, an efficient tool based on the variational principle and the Rayleigh-Ritz method is developed. In the optimization study, a mathematical definition based on Lagrangian polynomials, which requires few design parameters, is used to define a general fibre angle distribution of the VAT plate. A generic algorithm is subsequently used to determine the optimal VAT configuration for maximum postbuckling performance.

For the experimental characterisation of the influence of 3 D-loop threads as well as adjacent plies on the fatigue performance, the degradation behaviour of unidirectional and textile glass fibre reinforced polypropylene in tension-tension fatigue loading has been analysed. The material configurations have selectively been chosen to achieve identical fibre volume fraction of the reinforcement fibres in loading direction and therefore gain a high comparability in fatigue loading. The driving damage mechanisms are observed using imaging methods, such as light microscopy and computer tomography. The achieved experimental results will be incorporated into the failure mode dependent fatigue analysis models already been published by the authors...|$|E

In this study, Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used to analyse the vertical peel-off force of polyporpylene (PP) nanofibres having different fibre dimensions, inclining angels and contact areas on a flat glass substrate. It has been found that the main parameters affecting the frictional adhesion are fibre diameter and fibre aspect ratio, the inclining angle between the fibre and the substrate surface, and the intimate contact areas. Our analysis has shown that PP nanofibres with a diameter of less than 200 nm can generate less peel-off force than fibres of larger diameters, indicating more stable adhesion with the glass substrate for thinner fibres.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} flexural properties of metallic-hybrid-fibre-reinforced concrete. Two types of fibres were used: amorphous metallic <b>straight</b> <b>fibre</b> characterised as non-slipping fibre {{due to its}} rough surface and large specific surface area, and carbon steel hook-ended fibre characterised as slipping fibre. Three types of concrete: control, single-fibre-reinforced and hybrid-fibre-reinforced were prepared. The fibre was incorporated at 20 and 40 kg/m 3 for single-fibre-reinforced concrete, and at 20, 40 and 80 kg/m 3 for hybrid-fibre-reinforced concrete. The flexural properties were studied using three-point bending tests. From the experimental results obtained with fibre-reinforced concrete containing single fibre, addition of high-bonding amorphous metallic fibre delays the formation of micro-cracks and results in high peak load whereas carbon steel hook-ended fibre contributes towards the flexural toughness (energy absorption capacity) by bridging macro-cracks in the post peak region. The test results on hybrid-fibre-reinforced concrete show that the two metallic fibres when used in hybrid form result in superior performance compared to their single-fibre- reinforced counterparts. Superior performance {{as a result of}} fibre hybridisation is interpreted as a positive synergetic effect between the fibres. The procedure of assessing the positive synergetic effect is also discussed...|$|E

The prebuckling and buckling analysis, performed on a representative section of a blade stiffened VAT panel, {{are based on a}} generalised Rayleigh–Ritz procedure. The buckling analysis includes a first order shear deformation theory by introducing additional shape functions for transverse shear and is therefore applicable to structures with thick skins relative to characteristic length. Modelling of the stiffener is achieved with two approaches; idealisation as a beam attached to the skin’s midplane and as a rigidly attached plate. Comparing results with finite element analysis (Abaqus) for selected case studies, local buckling errors for the beam model and plate model were found to be less than 3 % and 2 % respectively, whilst the beam model error for global buckling was between 3 % and 10 %. The analytical model provides an accurate alternative to the computationally expensive finite element analysis and is therefore suitable for future work on the design and optimisation of stiffened VAT panels...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} whether 3 D fibre reinforcement {{can improve}} the toughness and flexural strength of concrete, when compared to equal dosage of <b>straight</b> steel <b>fibres.</b> This work was carried out to determine structural qualities {{that may lead to}} potential enhanced performance when concrete is subjected to a bomb blast and in addition the same structural qualities may act as a safety measure in earthquake situations. The majority of injuries caused from bomb attacks are a result of fragmented building components energised by the blast wave, therefore it is vital to reduce fragmentation of concrete. It is known that fibre reinforcement can reduce fragmentation of concrete by increasing energy absorption. A three point beam test was conducted on two batches of beams reinforced with straight steel and 3 D fibres respectively, so that flexural strength and post crack toughness could be calculated and compared. A paired comparison test was carried out between the <b>straight</b> steel <b>fibres</b> and the 3 D fibres. 3 D and <b>straight</b> steel <b>fibres</b> were also embedded in cubes, so that pull out testing could be conducted and compared for the two fibre types. 3 D fibre reinforced samples proved to have a higher flexural strength and post crack toughness than straight steel samples. 3 D fibres also had a much higher pull out value. After testing, 3 D fibres continued to span the rupture plane after initial crack formation during 3 point bend testing, which held together the concrete matrix. These findings suggest 3 D fibre reinforced concrete would perform better as a blast protection material when compared to <b>straight</b> steel <b>fibre</b> reinforced concrete, as the results show 3 D fibres produce tougher concrete that hold together fragments after loading...|$|R

40|$|Automated fibre {{placement}} {{technology has}} made possible to place bands of composite fibre tows along curvilinear path to create laminates with spatially varying stiffness properties called variable stiffness panels. These panels have shown improvement in stiffness properties, buckling load and post buckling failure load, over conventional <b>straight</b> <b>fibre</b> laminates. However, automated fibre placement machines can allow a minimum {{radius of curvature}} for fibre steering. Due to this, bands of fibre tows with same orientations are placed {{next to each other}} to produce a panel. This placement strategy gives rise to mismatch between the two bands and leads to fibre angular distortion. It can also lead to thickness build up but, to maintain the constant thickness of the panel, fibre tows are cut perpendicular to the placement direction which give rise to the defects called tow drop defects. Tow drop defects are the resin rich areas. In recent years, optimization of the variable stiffness panels for different load cases have been studied. These studies do not account for tow drop defects during optimization. To take account of these defects on the properties of the variable stiffness panels certain finite element approaches were proposed. For applying these approaches, location and geometry of the tow drop defects need to be identified in the variable stiffness panels. Based on it, property assignment to the mesh elements were done. However, the location and geometry of tow drops are dependent on fibre angle, width of the fibre tows and number of fibre tows in a band and can vary for different configuration of variable stiffness panel. It involves excessive computational effort to determine the location and geometry of the tow drop defects in the panels and analyze it. This makes it difficult to integrate the finite element approaches to optimization study. Thus, {{there is a need to}} develop a methodology which could make this integration possible.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to understand better the rheological behaviour of part processed leather in order to improve area yield. Rheological behaviour was characterised in uniaxial tests by measuring the stress-strain relationship, the immediate and recovered set and stress relaxation. The influence of moisture content, time under strain and applied strain were determined. The effect of drying under strain was also explored. Results were interpreted using rheological and structural models. It was found that for wet leather the relationship between applied strain and long term set is nonlinear. Moreover, below a critical strain no set is imparted. At this critical strain there is a change from a bending to a tensile mode of fibre deformation. Long term set only occurs in wet leather when collagen fibres are subject to tension. In wet leather, recovery occurs because collagen fibres return to their initial bent configuration. The long term set of partially processed leather at low strains increases with decreasing moisture content because collagen fibres permanently deform due to the rupture of intra-fibre adhesions. Inter-fibre adhesions formed on drying result in a yield point on the stress-strain curve. At the yield point the adhesions rupture and the mode of fibre deformation changes from stretching between adhesions to bending. A model, which views the structure of leather as adhesion nodes, joined by segments of fibres, has been used to predict increases in the initial modulus caused by drying under strain, in terms of the recruitment of <b>straight</b> <b>fibre</b> segments between nodes. When material is held under strain, there is a proportionate decrease in stress and increase in the immediate set, which is shown to be consistent with the Maxwell model. The two stage recovery of set is fitted to a multiple Voigt model. A novel way of achieving area yield without loss of tensile strength or softness is suggested in which the leather’s structure is relaxed whilst remaining wet and is then fixed by drying rapidly under strain...|$|E
40|$|Crimp, a {{distinguishing}} feature of sheep fibres, significantly affects wool value, processing and final fabric attributes. Several explanations for fibre bending have been proposed. Most concentrate on relative {{differences in the}} physicochemical properties of the cortical cells, which comprise {{the bulk of the}} fibre. However, the associations between cortical properties and fibre crimp are not consistent and may not reflect the underlying causation of fibre curvature (FC). We have formulated a mechanistic model in which fibre shape is dictated primarily by the degree of asymmetry in cell supply from the follicle bulb, and the point at which keratinisation is completed within the follicle. If this hypothesis is correct, one would anticipate that most variations in fibre crimp would be accounted for by quantitative differences in both the degree of mitotic asymmetry in follicle bulbs and the distance from the bulb to the point at which keratinisation is completed. To test this hypothesis, we took skin biopsies from Merino sheep from sites producing wool differing widely in fibre crimp frequency and FC. Mitotic asymmetry in follicle bulbs was measured using a DNA-labelling technique and the site of final keratinisation was defined by picric acid staining of the fibre. The proportion of para- to ortho-cortical cell area was determined in the cross-sections of fibres within biopsy samples. Mitotic asymmetry in the follicle bulb accounted for 0. 64 (P < 0. 0001) of the total variance in objectively measured FC, while the point of final keratinisation of the fibre accounted for an additional 0. 05 (P < 0. 05) of the variance. There was no association between ortho- to para-cortical cell ratio and FC. FC was positively associated with a subjective follicle curvature score (P < 0. 01). We conclude that fibre crimp is caused predominantly by asymmetric cell division in follicles that are highly curved. Differential pressures exerted by the subsequent asymmetric cell supply and cell hardening in the lower follicle cause fibre bending. The extent of bending is then modulated by the point at which keratinisation is completed; later hardening means the fibre remains pliable for longer, thereby reducing the pressure differential and reducing fibre bending. This means that even highly asymmetric follicles may produce a <b>straight</b> <b>fibre</b> if keratinisation is sufficiently delayed, {{as is the case in}} deficiencies of zinc and copper, or when keratinisation is perturbed by transgenesis. The model presented here can account for the many variations in fibre shape found in mammals. P. I. Hynd, N. M. Edwards, M. Hebart, M. McDowall and S. Clar...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the direct shear behaviour of steel fibre reinforced composites utilising discrete fibres at pre-defined angles and fibres randomly distributed is described. The direct shear tests encompassed the complete range of loading from its initial application to failure of the double L-shaped push-off specimens. Hooked-ended and <b>straight</b> steel <b>fibres</b> {{were used in the}} tests with the fibres oriented at angles of ± 75 °, ± 60 °, ± 45 °, ± 30 °, ± 15 ° and 0 ° with respect to a plane normal to the loading direction. The embedment lengths of the fibres, related to the total fibre length lf, each side of the shear plane were 0. 5 lf : 0. 5 lf and 0. 25 lf : 0. 75 lf. In addition to the single fibre tests, tests were conducted on randomly oriented steel fibre reinforced composites with fibre volumes of 0. 005, 0. 010, 0. 015, and 0. 020 with hooked-ended and <b>straight</b> steel <b>fibres.</b> In addition to the tests outlined above, a series of non-destructive tests employing radiographic techniques was carried out to produce photographic images of events taking place of fibres pulling out from a cementitious element. The tests consisted of hooked-ended steel fibres oriented at angles of - 60 °, - 30 °, 0 °, + 30 ° and + 60 ° to the cracking plane and <b>straight</b> <b>fibres</b> oriented at angles of - 60 °, 0 ° and + 60 °. The non destructive technique allowed the internal behaviour occurring within the specimen along the shear plane to be investigated without impacting on the direct shear tests. The angle of the fibre to the interface plane is an important parameter in determining the behaviour of the fibres under load and for the mode of failure; viz fibre pullout or fibre fracture. The effect of the end hook on behavioural aspects becomes increasingly less significant for more acute fibre angles where bending and snubbing effects become increasingly influential on the load versus displacement behaviour and mode of failure. Contrary to expectations, the fibre embedment length had little influence over the peak loads attained for the discrete fibre tests and, in a number of specimens, fibres pulled out from the longer embedded side. This observation is contrary to the generally accepted assumption that a fibre remains rigidly embedded on the long side and pulls out from short side. The traditional role that uniform bond stresses along a fibre length and friction have played in the description of fibre behaviour is not as significant as previously reported, other effects such as snubbing are more important in anchoring a fibre. Various models need to be revised with this observation in mind. The experimental results and observations from the discrete hooked-ended and <b>straight</b> steel <b>fibres</b> investigation are incorporated {{in the development of a}} behavioural model, the Variable Engagement Model II (VEMII). The VEMII describes the behaviour of randomly oriented discontinuous steel fibre reinforced composites loaded in shear. The model is verified against a series of randomly distributed fibre reinforced mortar specimens carried out in this study. Two forms of models are analysed: 1) a model based on the observation of lumped shear stresses at the fibre hook and in the snubbing zone; and 2) a uniform fibre bond stress applied along the embedded part of the fibre. The lumped bond stress approach and the uniform approach were found to give reasonable comparisons with the test data for the hooked-ended fibres but were conservative for the <b>straight</b> <b>fibres.</b> The VEMII confirms the applicability of the uniform bond approach adopted by previous researchers even though it does not correspond to the observations of fibre pullout behaviour of single fibres. The VEMII model provides a versatile approach that can also be applied to hybrid fibre combinations...|$|R

Finally, a simplified two-dimensional model is proposed that yield fast results which are similar to the ones obtained by its three-dimensional counterpart. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of semi-flexible fibres in shear flow {{and the effect}} of flexibility on the swimming speed of helical flagella are investigated. High aspect ratio particles such as carbon and glass fibres are often added as fillers to processed polymers. Although these materials have high rigidity, the large aspect ratiomakes the fibres liable to bending during flow. Other high aspect ratio fibres that behave as semi-flexible fibres include carbon nano-tubes, paper fibres and semi-flexible polymers such as the muscle protein f-actin. Most theoretical studies assume that fibres are either rigid or completely flexible, but in this thesis fibres with a finite bending modulus are considered. A semi-flexible fibre is modelled as a chain of shorter rods linked together. A bending torque is included at the joints between the rods to account for the rigidity. In shear flow the simulation reproduces the C and S turns observed in experiments on semi-flexible fibres. The results for finite aspect ratio fibres predict changes to the period of rotation and drift between Jeffery orbits. The direction of drift for a flexible fibre depends on both the intial orientation and the fibre’s flexiblity. We also present a linear analysis of how small distortions to a straight semi-flexible fibre grow when the flow places the fibre under compression. These results are in agreement with our full simulations and the growth rates of the distortions to a <b>straight</b> <b>fibre</b> allow us to predict the most unstable mode at a particular flow rate. To allow for intrinsically bent or helical equilibrium shapes a second simulation method is developed that includes a twisting torque at the joints between the rods as well as a bending torque. Using this simulation we measure the period of rotation and orbit drift of permanently deformed fibres in shear flow and show that due to the asymmetry of a helix, shear induced rotation results in translation and orbit drift for both rigid and semi-flexible fibres. Bacteria such as Vibrio alginolyticus and Escherichia coli swim by rotating one or more helical flagella. Vibrio alginolyticus has only one flagella and changes direction by altering its sense of rotation. Experimental observations of Vibrio alginolyticus have found that backwards swimming is 50 % faster than forwards swimming speed however, previous numerical simulation results have shown only a 4 % difference for flagella of the same dimensions. We use our simulation to consider how flexiblity affects the swimming speed of helical flagella and show that for a constant angular velocity, difference between forwards and backwards swimming speed ranges between 0 - 23 %depending on the exact stiffness chosen. We explain the differences in swimming speeds of semi-flexible fibres by investigating the shape changes which occur and comparing them to the results for swimming speeds of rigid flagella of varying dimensions.

40|$|Automated fibre {{placement}} (AFP) {{machines are}} able to place simultaneously several bundles of fibres, called tows, on a surface. Using AFP machines, {{it is also possible}} to manufacture composite laminates with fibres placed in curvilinear paths. The fibre orientations and stiffness properties of these laminates are spatially varied and hence they are called variable stiffness (VS) laminates in contrast to the traditional laminates with <b>straight</b> <b>fibres</b> which are called constant stiffness (CS) laminates. Past research has shown that the structural performance of laminated composite structures can be improved by spatial tailoring of laminate stiffness. One of the widely used structural components in aerospace industry are cylindrical shells. In this thesis, a computationally efficient framework was developed for circumferential laminate stiffness tailoring of unstiffened and longitudinally stiffened cylindrical shells with arbitrary cross sections to maximise the buckling capacity with consideration of strength constraints. In addition, the AFP manufacturing constraint on the maximum curvature of curvilinear fibre paths was considered. This constraint was applied to avoid wrinkling of the fibres placed inside the turn of a curved tow. The aforementioned framework utilised computationally efficient analysis and optimisation tools.

40|$|The {{synergistic}} action of a cementitious matrix and fibres {{can result in}} strain hardening in tension. The accompanied tensile strain capacity {{can be an important}} design parameter for strain-hardening cementitious composites in order to prevent the localization in a single crack and to assure that the stress is at least the tensile strength o f the unreinforced matrix. Such a behaviour is desired for example for bridge decks or joints where the strain-hardening material has to follow the deformations of either the substructure or that of the total structure. An experimental study was executed {{in order to determine the}} tensile strain capacity of cementitious composites. As a start of the study, a reference mixture developed at the University of Michigan was chosen. Adjusted mixtures in three different compressive strength classes and <b>straight</b> <b>fibres</b> of two different lengths were applied. The six mixtures were tested on characteristics in the fresh and in the hardened state. This paper discusses experimental results and observed failure pattems. The tensile strain capacity was the highest for the lowest compressive strength and with longer PV A-fibres applied. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The {{orientation}} distribution (morphological texture) of fibres in {{a composite}} {{is very important}} in determining the properties of the material. Therefore, methods which can provide quantitative descriptions of the morphological texture are essential. One approach to determining the morphological texture function (MTF) is to measure the orientation distribution of the crystals in the fibres. Since many types of fibres used for reinforcements are crystalline and textured (i. e. carbon fibres, steel fibres, etc.) this approach may be interesting for commercial/industrial applications. For this technique to be applied, the crystallographic texture intrinsic to the fibres must be determined and subsequently, measurements of the 'global' crystallographic texture should be made in the composite. The morphological texture can then be calculated by a deconvolution of the composite texture with the fibre's crystallographic texture. The deconvolution is most easily performed using the series expansion representation of texture functions. In this paper, the morphological texture was determined in a woven fabric made from bundle drawn AISI 316 L stainless steel fibres embedded in an Al- 13 wt% Si alloy matrix. <b>Straight</b> <b>fibres</b> removed from the fabric serve as the reference material for the deconvolution.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a given fibre as a medium of stress transfer is often assessed using a single fibre pullout test, where fibre slip is monitored {{as a function of}} the applied load to the fibre. Over the past 30 years, so-called improved shaped fibres have been brought onto the market by different producers with claimed better performances than <b>straight</b> <b>fibres.</b> Nowadays, the most commonly used fibres have anchorage mechanisms. Generally, these fibres are produced by mechanically deforming the fibre with a hook, cone or paddle adjacent to each of its ends. Nevertheless, due to different materials and manufacturing processes, the mechanical properties such as, tensile strength and grade of mechanical anchorage differ amongst different producers, even for the same fibre type. These differences have an effect on the fibre pullout behaviour and, consequently, in the overall behaviour of FRC under loading. In the present work, a comparative study of three hook-ends fibres from different producers is carried out. The statistical variation of the fibre geometry dimensions is assessed, and its influence on the fibre mechanical properties is ascertained. Experimental tensile and pullout tests results of each fibre brand are presented and discussed...|$|R
