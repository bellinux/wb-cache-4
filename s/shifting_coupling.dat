40|$|Let Π be an ergodic {{simple point}} process on R d and let Π ∗ be its Palm version. Thorisson [Ann. Probab. 24 (1996) 2057 – 2064] proved that {{there exists a}} <b>shift</b> <b>coupling</b> of Π and Π ∗; that is, one can select a (random) point Y of Π such that {{translating}} Π by −Y yields a configuration whose law is that of Π ∗. We construct shift couplings in which Y and Π ∗ are functions of Π, and prove {{that there is no}} <b>shift</b> <b>coupling</b> in which Π is a function of Π ∗. The key ingredient is a deterministic translation-invariant rule to allocate sets of equal volume (forming a partition of R d) to the points of Π. The construction is based on the Gale–Shapley stable marriage algorithm [Amer. Math. Monthly 69 (1962) 9 – 15]. Next, let Γ be an ergodic random element of { 0, 1 } Zd and let Γ ∗ be Γ conditioned on Γ(0) = 1. A <b>shift</b> <b>coupling</b> X of Γ and Γ ∗ is called an extra head scheme. We show that there exists an extra head scheme which is a function of Γ if and only if the marginal E[Γ(0) ] is the reciprocal of an integer. When the law of Γ is product measure and d ≥ 3, we prove that there exists an extra head scheme X satisfying Eexpc‖X ‖ d < ∞; this answers a question of Holroyd and Liggett [Ann.

For covalent species, a good agreement between experimental and calculated results is achieved without scalar relativistic effects, but their inclusion (with a triple-zeta, doublepolarization basis set) leads to some improvement {{in the quality of}} the correlation. The spin-orbit coupling term has a significant effect on the shielding constant, but makes a small contribution to the chemical <b>shift.</b> <b>Coupling</b> constants contain substantial contributions from the Fermi contact and paramagnetic spin-orbit terms; unlike light nuclei the spin-dipole term is also large, whereas the diamagnetic spin-orbit term is negligible.

Small (< 1 Hz) but non-negligible throughspace coupling constants between Xe- 129 and C- 13 or H- 1 are predicted.

40|$|INDOR (Internuclear Double Resonance) {{spectroscopy}} {{is shown}} to be superior to conventional (spectra obtained not by sweeping, but by maintaining constant the decoupling frequency) nuclear single- or double-resonance techniques for conformational studies of amino acids and amino acid residues in the following ways: (a) INDOR spectra of amino acids are inherently simpler than conventional proton magnetic resonance spectra of amino acids, and INDOR spectra of individual amino acid residues are slightly, if at all, complicated by overlap with either solvent peaks or the transitions of nuclei in other residues. (b) For each amino acid, the side-chain and Cα proton belong to a particular class of spin system characterized by unique INDOR spectra, the pattern of which aids in the proper assignment of spectral lines. (c) For an amino acid with a first-order spin system, INDOR spectra directly reveal hidden chemical <b>shifts</b> and <b>coupling</b> constants. For an amino acid with a spin system other than first-order, INDOR spectra indirectly reveal values for chemical <b>shifts</b> and <b>coupling</b> constants as follows: INDOR spectra permit construction of a topological spin energy level diagram which, in turn, allows division of the PMR spectrum of the spin system into subspectra that easily yield values for chemical <b>shifts</b> and <b>coupling</b> constants...|$|R
