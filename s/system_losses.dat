25|$|Service {{quality in}} the Dominican Republic has {{suffered}} a steady deterioration since the 1980s. Frequent and prolonged blackouts result mainly from financial causes (i.e. high <b>system</b> <b>losses</b> and low bill collection) that are further aggravated by technical factors (i.e. unadequate investments in transmission and distribution). Poor service quality is also characterized by large voltage and frequency fluctuations.|$|E
25|$|The most {{fundamental}} difference {{lies in the}} choice of AC or DC. The earliest systems used DC, as AC was not well understood and insulation material for high voltage lines was not available. DC locomotives typically run at relatively low voltage (600 to 3,000 volts); the equipment is therefore relatively massive because the currents involved are large in order to transmit sufficient power. Power must be supplied at frequent intervals as the high currents result in large transmission <b>system</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|E
25|$|Only about 40% of Nepal's {{population}} {{has access to}} electricity. There is a great disparity between urban and rural areas. The electrification rate in urban areas is 90%, whereas the rate for rural areas is only 5%. Power cuts of up to 22 hours a day take place in peak demand periods of winter and the peak electricity demand is almost the double the capability or dependable capacity. The position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs, high <b>system</b> <b>losses,</b> high generation costs, high overheads, over staffing, and lower domestic demand.|$|E
40|$|Assembly line {{balancing}} problem is an approach of assigning {{a set of}} tasks to an ordered sequence of workstations. This assignment {{needs to be made}} {{in such a way that}} the underlying precedence constraints are not violated and efficiency measures are optimized subject to the restriction of the cycle time constraint. Research works, reported so far, mainly deal with the minimization of balancing loss, subject to precedence constraints. Lack of uniqueness in those optimum solutions and pressing demand to include <b>system</b> <b>loss</b> in the objective function have led to the present work of minimization of both balancing and <b>system</b> <b>loss.</b> As there is no standard measure for <b>system</b> <b>loss,</b> the current work proposes a measure for <b>system</b> <b>loss</b> and offers solution to this bi-objective problem...|$|R
50|$|DESA, the {{ancestor}} of DPDC was established {{as part of}} a reform process to ensure better services to the electricity consumers, develop the power distribution system and reduce <b>system</b> <b>loss.</b> Before the setting up of DESA, the power development board suffered a <b>system</b> <b>loss</b> of 45%. DESA managed to cut it down to around 26%. But as it also became a losing concern due to various reasons, DPDC was introduced as part of the reform process to replace DESA. DPDC has managed to cut down the <b>system</b> <b>loss</b> to single digit in recent years.|$|R

25|$|The {{air pump}} used {{must be able}} to deliver the volume {{required}} at the pressure required. Most flow testing is done at 10 and 28inches of water pressure (2.5 to 7 kilopascals). Although other test pressures will work, the results would have to be converted for comparison to the work of others. The pressure developed must account for the test pressure plus the loss across the metering element plus all other <b>system</b> <b>losses.</b> The greater the accuracy of the metering element the greater is the loss. Flow volume of between 100 and 600 cubic feet per minute (0.05 to 0.28 m³/s) would serve almost all applications {{depending on the size of}} the engine under test.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} select the correct power it is {{necessary}} to first calculate the thermal energy required to raise the material to the required temperature in the time allotted. This can be done using the heat content of the material which is normal expressed in KW hours per tonne the weight of metal to be processed and the time cycle. Once this has been established other factors such as radiated losses from the component, coil losses and other <b>system</b> <b>losses</b> need to be factored in. Traditionally this process involved lengthy and complex calculations in conjunction with a mixture of practical experience and empirical formula. Modern techniques utilise finite element analysis and other computer aided modeling techniques, however as with all such methods a thorough working knowledge of the induction heating process is still required.|$|E

2500|$|Long {{distance}} {{electric power}} transmission results in energy loss, through electrical resistance, heat generation, electromagnetic induction and less-than-perfect electrical insulation. [...] In 1995, these losses were estimated at 7.2%. Energy generation and distribution can be more efficient the closer {{it is to the}} point of use, if conducted in a high-efficiency generator, such as a CHP. In the generation and delivery of electrical power, <b>system</b> <b>losses</b> along the delivery chain are pronounced. Of five units of energy going into most large power plants, only about one unit of energy is delivered to the consumer in a usable form.|$|E
50|$|Some {{claims have}} been made that ground <b>system</b> <b>losses</b> are reduced for the folded unipole antenna. However the {{experimental}} work of Ronald Rackley, et al., have shown this to be incorrect. Such claims do not consider that for the same conditions, the total displacement current in the ground system is nearly the same for a folded unipole as for a conventional series-fed unipole. Therefore ground <b>system</b> <b>losses</b> for these two radiator configurations are very similar.|$|E

These efficiency and effectiveness can be maximized by minimizing balancing <b>loss</b> and <b>system</b> <b>loss.</b> The current work offers a range based measure for <b>System</b> <b>loss</b> and describes a technique for jointly minimizing balancing <b>loss</b> and <b>system</b> <b>loss.</b> To arrive at the optimum solution of the joint minimization problem, the same has been reduced to sequential marginal minimization problems and simulation technique has been installed for obtaining the optimal solution.

40|$|The {{concept of}} power system {{vulnerability}} assessment combines {{information on the}} level of system security as well as information {{on a wide range of}} situations, events and contingencies with regards to which a system is vulnerable.
