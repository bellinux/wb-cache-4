5000|$|After India's decisive {{victory in}} the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Pakistan {{retracted}} its non-weapon policy and {{the research and development}} of nuclear weapons began in 1972. PAEC's senior nuclear engineer Munir Ahmad Khan, who threw himself with full rigor for this task, was named as PAEC's third chair by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Work began on ingenious development of the nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure and nuclear weapons research in the 1970s. Key research took place at PINSTECH, where scientists worked on weapon designs and eventual nuclear weapons testing. [...] The PAEC expanded the crash program with various laboratories, facilities, and directorates researching on developing and testing materials and components for bomb designs, whilst it engineered plants and funded facilities for production of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium. [...] In 1976, the possible test sites were decided by the PAEC and construction on test sites were completed in 1979. In 1983, PAEC's efforts reached to a milestone when it had conducted a first <b>subcritical</b> <b>test</b> on a weapon design; such testing continued until the early 1990s under codename: Kirana-I.|$|E

These were: 1) impulsive loading and the resulting transient free vibration response, 2) random forced response, in which the 'mechanical' forcing function could be directly measured, 3) sine sweep forced response, in which the 'mechanical' forcing function could be directly measured, and 4) forced response from unsteady aerodynamic excitation or turbulence, in which the excitation could only be indirectly inferred from other measurements...|$|E

Experimental results obtained from wind-tunnel tests are presented which provide a more {{detailed description of the}} flow in these regions than was previously available.

The data set also includes measurements of the turbulence intensity and turbulent Reynolds-stress distributions as obtained by the laser-velocimeter technique. To assess the effects of the shock wave, a less extensive set of measurements was realized at a <b>subcritical</b> <b>test</b> condition.

The PFL switch breakdown time determines the peak PFL charging voltage, which ultimately affects the source X-ray spectrum and dose. Therefore, PFL switch jitter may contribute to shot-to-shot variation in these parameters, which are crucial to radiographic quality. In this paper we will present PFL switch jitter analysis for both Cygnus machines and present the correlation with dose.

The piping downstream of the gas-sampling apparatus was routed belowground to a location where it was allowed to vent into an existing radioactively contaminated borehole. The length of the pipe above the ground surface is approximately 200 meters. This pipe remained in place until remediation efforts began in 2007, at which time internal plutonium contamination was discovered. Following this discovery, an assessment was conducted to determine the quantity of plutonium present in the pipe. This site has been identified as Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 547, Miscellaneous Contaminated Waste Sites. The quantity of plutonium identified at CAU 547 exceeded the Hazard Category 3 threshold but was below the Hazard Category 2 threshold specified in DOE Standard DOE-STD- 1027 - 92. This CAU, therefore, was initially categorized as a Hazard Category 3 environmental restoration site. A contaminated facility or site that is initially categorized as Hazard Category 3, however, may be downgraded to below Hazard Category 3 if it can be demonstrated through further analysis that the form of the material and the energy available for release support reducing the hazard category. This is an important consideration when performing hazard categorization of environmental restoration sites because energy sources available for release of material are generally fewer at an environmental restoration site than at an operating facility and environmental restoration activities may result in the complete removal of source material...|$|R
