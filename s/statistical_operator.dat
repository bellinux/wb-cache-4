40|$|General {{statistical}} ensembles in the Hamiltonian {{formulation of}} hybrid quantum-classical systems are analyzed. It {{is argued that}} arbitrary probability densities on the hybrid phase space must be considered as the class of possible physically distinguishable statistical ensembles of hybrid systems. Nevertheless, <b>statistical</b> <b>operators</b> associated with the hybrid system and with the quantum subsystem can be consistently defined. Dynamical equations for the <b>statistical</b> <b>operators</b> representing the mixed states of the hybrid system and its quantum subsystem are derived and analyzed.

5000|$|The nonequilibrium <b>statistical</b> <b>operator</b> method permits one {{to generalize}} the Gibbs {{ensemble}} method to the nonequilibrium case and {{to construct a}} nonequilibrium <b>statistical</b> <b>operator</b> which enables one to obtain the transport equations and calculate the transport coefficients in terms of correlation functions, and which, in the case ofequilibrium, {{goes over to the}} Gibbs distribution. In the framework of the latter approach the derivationof kinetic equations for a system in a thermal bath was carried out. The problem about the appearance of a stochastic process in a dynamical system which is submitted to the influence of a [...] "large" [...] system was considered in notable paper, in the approach of the nonequilibrium <b>statistical</b> <b>operator.</b> The derivation of the equation which describes approximately the evolution {{of the state of the}} dynamic system interacting with the thermal bath was given. The Equation derived can be called a Schroedinger-type equation with damping for a dynamical system in a thermal bath. The results of investigation of the dynamic behavior of a particle in an environment, taking into account dissipative effects, were considered and applied to a variety of concrete problems.|$|E

40|$|In quantum mechanics, the selfadjoint Hilbert space {{operators}} play {{a triple}} role as observables, generators of the dynamical groups and <b>statistical</b> <b>operators</b> defining the mixed states. One {{might expect that}} this is typical of Hilbert space quantum mechanics, but it is not. The same triple role occurs for {{the elements of a}} certain ordered Banach space in a much more general theory based upon quantum logics and a conditional probability calculus (which is a quantum logical model of the Luders-von Neumann measurement process). It is shown how positive groups, automorphism groups, Lie algebras and <b>statistical</b> <b>operators</b> emerge from one major postulate-the non-existence of third-order interference [third-order interference and its impossibility in quantum mechanics were discovered by Sorkin (Mod Phys Lett A 9 : 3119 - 3127, 1994) ]. This again underlines the power of the combination of the conditional probability calculus with the postulate that there is no third-order interference. In two earlier papers, its impact on contextuality and nonlocality had already been revealed...|$|R
40|$|We generalize the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger nonlocality without inequalities {{argument}} {{to cover the}} case of arbitrary mixed <b>statistical</b> <b>operators</b> associated to three-qubits quantum systems. More precisely, we determine the radius of a ball (in the trace distance topology) surrounding the pure GHZ state and containing arbitrary mixed <b>statistical</b> <b>operators</b> which cannot be described by any local and realistic hidden variable model and which are, as a consequence, noncompletely separable. As a practical application, we focus on certain one-parameter classes of mixed states which are commonly considered in the experimental realization of the original GHZ argument and which result from imperfect preparations of the pure GHZ state. In these cases we determine for which values of the parameter controlling the noise a nonlocality argument can still be exhibited, despite the mixedness of the considered states. Moreover, {{the effect of the}} imperfect nature of measurement processes is discussed. Comment: 8 pages, RevTex; added references, corrected typo...|$|R
50|$|The {{members of}} the {{ensemble}} {{are said to be}} in the same state, and this defines the term 'state'. The state is mathematically denoted by a mathematical object called a <b>statistical</b> <b>operator.</b> Such an operator is a map from a certain corresponding Hilbert space to itself, and may be written as a density matrix. It is characteristic of the ensemble interpretation to define the state by the <b>statistical</b> <b>operator.</b> Other interpretations may instead define the state by the corresponding Hilbert space. Such a difference between the modes of definition of state seems to make no difference to the physical meaning. Indeed, according to Ballentine, one can define the state by an ensemble of identically prepared systems, denoted by a point in the Hilbert space, as is perhaps more customary. The link is established by making the observing procedure a copy of the preparative procedure; mathematically the corresponding Hilbert spaces are mutually dual. Since Bohr's concern was that the specimen phenomena are joint preparation-observation occasions, it is not evident that the Copenhagen and ensemble interpretations differ substantially in this respect.|$|E
50|$|In {{the period}} 1961—1965, he {{developed}} a method of non-equilibrium <b>statistical</b> <b>operator</b> (NSO), which is now a classical tool in the statistical theory of non-equilibrium processes. This method allowed him to include non-equilibrium phenomena {{in the framework of}} statistical mechanics in a natural way following the ideas of Josiah Willard Gibbs. Using the NSO method, he constructed relativistic thermodynamics and relativistic hydrodynamics, the statistical transport theory for systems of particles with internal degrees of freedom, and the statistical thermodynamics for turbulent transport processes.|$|E

A mathematical framework was described where the expectation value of quantum operators, as described by matrices, is obtained by taking the trace of {{the product of the}} density operator [...] and an operator [...] (Hilbert scalar product between operators). The matrix formalism here is in the statistical mechanics framework, although it applies as well for finite quantum systems, which is usually the case, where the state of the system cannot be described by a pure state, but as a <b>statistical</b> <b>operator</b> [...] {{of the above}} form.

In one view, the ensemble interpretation may be defined as that advocated by Leslie E. Ballentine, Professor at Simon Fraser University His interpretation does not attempt to justify, or otherwise derive, or explain quantum mechanics from any deterministic process, or make any other statement about the real nature of quantum phenomena; it intends simply to interpret the wave function. It does not propose to lead to actual results that differ from orthodox interpretations. It makes the <b>statistical</b> <b>operator</b> primary in reading the wave function, deriving the notion of a pure state from that.

The study was carried out using a multitemporal analysis (before and after the fire) in some areas located in the Tuparro National Park in the department of Vichada, in the northeastern part of the Orinoco region in Colombia, which were affected by the presence of this phenomenon. To perform the analysis used tools provided by the software R version 2. 11. 1, packages spdep and rgdal for handling raster data and calculation of spatial autocorrelation tests. The use of <b>statistical</b> <b>operators</b> provide better results with the band of near infrared (NIR) and allow better identification of burned areas, which facilitates the detection of spatial and spectral changes.
