5|$|The {{possibility}} that the Hawaiian islands became older as one moved to the northwest was suspected by ancient Hawaiians long before Europeans arrived. During their voyages, seafaring Hawaiians noticed differences in erosion, <b>soil</b> <b>formation,</b> and vegetation, allowing them to deduce that the islands to the northwest (Niihau and Kauai) were older than those to the southeast (Maui and Hawaii). The idea was handed down the generations through the legend of Pele, the fiery Hawaiian Goddess of Volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|Lakes also formed (or expanded) in the Atacama at that time; highstands in Lejía Lake began rising after 11,480 ± 70 BP, and in Salar Aguas Calientes high-water levels {{lasted until}} 8,430 ± 75 BP.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that local geological conditions {{have a large}} impact on ground motion at a given site. The geometry of the subsoil structure, the variation of soil types and its properties with depth, the lateral discontinuities and the surface topography are at the origin of large amplification of ground motion and have been correlated to damage distribution during destructive earthquakes (Aki, 1993; Bard, 1994; Faccioli, 1991; 1996; Chavez-Garcia et al., 1996; Pitilakis et al., 1999, 2001 a, 2001 b). Site effects estimation requires an adequate knowledge of the geometry and the dynamic properties of <b>soil</b> <b>formations.</b> Among the dynamic properties of soil deposits, the shear waves velocity (Vs) that defines the shear modulus (Go), {{is one of the}} most important parameter that controls the amplification of seismic motion. The knowledge of the dynamic properties, especially Vs velocity, and geometrical characteristics of <b>soil</b> <b>formations</b> allow the study of ground response and hence the assessment of the basic parameters for the aseismic designs of structures. Different aspects of site amplification from experimental and theoretical point of view were extensively discussed during all recent conferences such as 11 th WCEE - Acapulco (1996), 11 th ECEE - Paris (1998), ESG 98 - Yokohama (1998) and 12 th WCEE - New Zealand (2000). Issues like effects of irregular geological configurations, near field phenomena, basin edge and 2 D effects are better understood and quantified as well. However, this kind of studies requires the ‘design’ of 2 D sections that describe the geometrical and dynamic characteristics of <b>soil</b> <b>formations</b> independently of the depth of the rock basement. These aspects constitute the basic motives of the present thesis. The aim is to determine the geometrical and dynamic characteristics of <b>soil</b> <b>formations,</b> down to the rock basement, at Thessaloniki city, a densely populated and urbanized area. ...|$|R
5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, <b>soil</b> <b>formation</b> and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E
5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate <b>soil</b> <b>formation.</b> Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E

500|$|Lichens are a {{symbiotic}} relationship between fungi and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria. The photosynthetic partner in the relationship is referred to in lichen terminology as a [...] "photobiont". The fungal part of the relationship is composed mostly of various species of ascomycetes and a few basidiomycetes. Lichens occur in every ecosystem on all continents, {{play a key role}} in <b>soil</b> <b>formation</b> and the initiation of biological succession, and are prominent in some extreme environments, including polar, alpine, and semiarid desert regions. They are able to grow on inhospitable surfaces, including bare soil, rocks, tree bark, wood, shells, barnacles and leaves. As in mycorrhizas, the photobiont provides sugars and other carbohydrates via photosynthesis to the fungus, while the fungus provides minerals and water to the photobiont. The functions of both symbiotic organisms are so closely intertwined that they function almost as a single organism; in most cases the resulting organism differs greatly from the individual components. Lichenization is a common mode of nutrition for fungi; around 20% of fungi—between 17,500 and 20,000 described species—are lichenized. Characteristics common to most lichens include obtaining organic carbon by photosynthesis, slow growth, small size, long life, long-lasting (seasonal) vegetative reproductive structures, mineral nutrition obtained largely from airborne sources, and greater tolerance of desiccation than most other photosynthetic organisms in the same habitat.|$|E

2500|$|Soil forms from parent rocks through {{physical}} {{disintegration of}} rocks and by chemical alteration of the rock fragments. The types of soil minerals can tell us if the environment was cool or warm, wet or dry, or whether the water was fresh or salty. Because CRISM is able to detect many minerals that form in soil, a goal was to use the instrument to help decipher ancient Martian environments. CRISM has found a characteristic layering pattern of aluminum-rich clays overlying iron- and magnesium-rich clays in many areas scattered through Mars' highlands. Surrounding Mawrth Vallis, these [...] "layered clays" [...] cover {{hundreds of thousands of}} square kilometers. Similar layering occurs near the Isidis basin, in the Noachian plains surrounding Valles Marineris, and in Noachian plains surrounding the Tharsis plateau. The global distribution of layered clays suggests a global process. Layered clays are late Noachian in age, dating from the same time as water-carved valley networks. The layered clay composition is similar to what is expected for <b>soil</b> <b>formation</b> on Earth - a weathered upper layer leached of soluble iron and magnesium, leaving an insoluble aluminum-rich residue, with a lower layer that still retains its iron and magnesium. Some researchers have suggested that the Martian clay [...] "layer cake" [...] was created by soil-forming processes, including rainfall, at the time that valley networks formed.|$|E
