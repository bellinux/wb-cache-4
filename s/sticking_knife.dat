5000|$|Few {{companies}} {{continue to}} produce sticking knives. Firearms have generally replaced the <b>sticking</b> <b>knife</b> in home livestock processing. Most slaughterhouses use humane killers, which project a steel rod through {{the skull of}} the animal. Because sticking knives are so infrequently used, a home butcher may choose another type of knife that would serve other purposes as well. A boning knife or narrow hunting knife is commonly used {{in place of the}} more specialized <b>sticking</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>sticking</b> <b>knife</b> usually {{consists}} of a double edge pointed blade approximately six inches long. Blades are traditionally made of high carbon steel (such as 1095). Handles are simple, consisting usually of two hardwood scales riveted through the full, flat blade tang. Sticking knives generally lack any kind of guard.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>sticking</b> <b>knife</b> is {{primarily}} an agricultural tool. Sticking knives resemble daggers {{in shape and}} function, but are made for the utilitarian purpose of [...] "sticking" [...] or bleeding out livestock in home butchering. In some cases the animal would die directly from blood loss, where in others the animal would be killed beforehand and hung by the hind legs to bleed out.|$|E

50|$|The {{competition}} itself consists, in {{the most}} common form, {{of a series of}} straight throws aimed at a set of standard wooden targets or in some cases foam. Similar to an archery target, competition knife throwing targets have a bulls-eye surrounded by one or more rings. A <b>sticking</b> <b>knife</b> scores points. The thrower must be standing at least a set distance away from the target, with higher distances for more challenging events. KHOIKHOI keeps a ranking of its members based on their performance during these sponsored competitions. The scores achieved at Euro-throwers events can be examined at the meetings' reports.|$|E
5000|$|The Ontario cutlery company {{continues}} to produce traditional sticking knives in their [...] "old hickory" [...] knife line. Some people may still want a <b>sticking</b> <b>knife</b> for chores other than slaughtering livestock. Although double edged blades are usually considered {{by law enforcement}} as weapons, in situations where they are acceptable they have a few advantages. Having twice the edge length of a single edge knife {{they can be used}} longer between sharpenings. This advantage may be offset however because the thumb of the cutting hand can't press against the spine of the blade. With a single edged blade thumb pressure is often exerted for heavy cutting chores.|$|E

5000|$|He was, for many, {{at least}} as well known for his {{eccentric}} lifestyle as for his art.

5000|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, the Afro-Colombian {{communities}} of the Gran Cauca and Tolima were epicenters of esgrima or grima, a martial art utilizing <b>sticks,</b> <b>knives,</b> lances, and particularly the machete.

Grima experts passed on this art through formal master and disciple relationships, and often helped to spread important counter-memories of popular participation in the nation‟s conflicts.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} {{of the basic}} game. One relatively safe version {{is very similar to}} H-O-R-S-E basketball. Here, the first player attempts to <b>stick</b> his <b>knife</b> in the ground using some unusual technique, such as behind the back or off his knee. If successful, the second player must duplicate the feat. In some cases, just getting the <b>knife</b> to <b>stick</b> at all can be the objective but in others, the players attempt to <b>stick</b> their <b>knives</b> into the peg or as close to it as possible.|$|R

50|$|Arnis {{students}} {{start their}} instruction by learning {{to fight with}} weapons, and only advance to empty-hand training once the <b>stick</b> and <b>knife</b> techniques have been sufficiently mastered. This {{is in contrast to}} most other well-known Asian martial arts but it is justified by the principle that bare-handed moves are acquired naturally through the same exercises as the weapon techniques, making muscle memory an important aspect of the teaching. It is also based on the obvious fact that an armed person who is trained has the advantage over a trained unarmed person, and serves to condition students to fight against armed assailants. Most systems of Arnis apply a single set of techniques for the <b>stick,</b> <b>knife,</b> and empty hands, a concept sometimes referred to as motion grouping. Since the weapon is seen as simply an extension of the body, the same angles and footwork are used either with or without a weapon. The reason for this is probably historical, because tribal warriors went into battle armed and only resorted to bare-handed fighting after losing their weapons.|$|R
25|$|Dr. Evelyn Fisher {{wrote of}} how {{women living in}} a mining town in Wales during the 1920s used candles {{intended}} for Roman Catholic ceremonies to dilate the cervix {{in an effort to}} self-induce abortion. Similarly, the use of candles and other objects, such as glass rods, penholders, curling irons, spoons, <b>sticks,</b> <b>knives,</b> and catheters was reported during the 19th century in the United States. Women of Jewish descent in Lower East Side, Manhattan are said to have carried the ancient Indian practice of sitting over a pot of steam into the early 20th century. Abortion remained a dangerous procedure into the early 20th century, more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930.|$|R

The Northern Alliance, Shi’ite Hazara factions, and {{a small group of}} U.S. Special Forces then entered the city. Herati residents also took part in the uprising with <b>sticks,</b> <b>knives,</b> and guns hidden throughout the populace. The city fell as the Taliban fled towards the mountains along the Iranian border, leaving behind several abandoned tanks. Prisoners, including Chechen and Arab volunteers, were taken to undisclosed locations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{literary}} magazine San Francisco Book Review praised the graphic novel version, stating: The problem with gang violence {{is that it}} is rarely explored in a personal fashion, and {{from the perspective of the}} black male as a victim of his society. Fist <b>Stick</b> <b>Knife</b> Gun is... an excellent personal story and has a nice flowing narrative; it is nice to see an autobiography that also works as an actual story. More to the point, it also works as a warning, as he explores his feelings toward the various escalations and why he feels that is necessary to use the particular weapon at that time, and his final rejection of that lifestyle, as it leads ultimately to death.|$|R
