25|$|The diving reflex {{is used in}} {{clinical}} practice {{as a means to}} treat <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> This {{is an example of a}} vagal maneuver, whereby the vagus nerve is stimulated in order to block the atrioventricular node, which interrupts the abnormal electrical circuit taking place in a <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> This is especially useful in infants in whom the diving reflex is well-preserved, allowing the valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage to be more appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Amiodarone is an {{antiarrhythmic}} medication used {{to treat}} and prevent a number of types of irregular heartbeats. This includes ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and wide complex tachycardia, as well as atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously. When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin.|$|E
25|$|High-risk {{features}} {{that may be}} present during PES include an effective refractory period of the accessory pathway less than 250 ms, multiple pathways, septal location of pathway, and inducibility of <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> (AVRT, atrial fibrillation).

50|$|Flecainide {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of many types of <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardias,</b> including AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). This is because of the action of flecainide on the His-Purkinje system.|$|R
25|$|Wolff–Parkinson–White {{syndrome}} (WPW) is {{a disorder}} {{due to a}} specific type of problem with the electrical system of the heart which has resulted in symptoms. About 40% of people with the electrical problem never develop symptoms. Symptoms can include an abnormally fast heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or syncope. Rarely cardiac arrest may occur. The most common type of irregular heartbeat that occurs is known as paroxysmal <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF or A-fib) is {{an abnormal}} heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atria. Often it starts as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time. Often episodes have no symptoms. Occasionally {{there may be}} heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. The disease is {{associated with an increased}} risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke. It is a type of <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia.</b>|$|E
25|$|An esophogeal lead can be {{inserted}} to {{a part of}} the esophagus where the distance to the posterior wall of the left atrium is only approximately 5–6mm (remaining constant in people of different age and weight). An esophageal lead avails for a more accurate differentiation between certain cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial flutter, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. It can also evaluate the risk in people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, as well as terminate <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> caused by re-entry.|$|E
50|$|Cardioversion {{is either}} {{achieved}} pharmacologically or via {{the application of}} a shock synchronised to the underlying heartbeat.

500|$|Destiny Hope Cyrus {{was born}} November 23, 1992, in Franklin, Tennessee, to Leticia Jean [...] "Tish" [...] Cyrus (née Finley) and singer Billy Ray Cyrus. Cyrus {{was born with}} <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia,</b> a {{condition}} which causes an abnormal resting heart rate. Her birth name, Destiny Hope, reflects her parents' belief that she would accomplish great things, and she was given the nickname [...] "Smiley", later shortened to [...] "Miley", because she often smiled as an infant. She changed her name to Miley Ray Cyrus; her middle name honors her grandfather, Democratic politician Ronald Ray Cyrus.|$|E
500|$|Consuming Coprinopsis atramentaria {{within a}} few hours of alcohol results in a [...] "disulfiram syndrome". This {{interaction}} has only been known since {{the early part of the}} twentieth century. Symptoms include facial reddening, nausea, vomiting, malaise, agitation, palpitations and tingling in limbs, and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol. If no more alcohol is consumed, they will generally subside over two or three hours. Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed, becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5mg/dL, and prominent at concentrations of 50–100mg/dL. [...] Disulfiram has, however, been known to cause myocardial infarction (heart attack). The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms, although they are milder as more time passes. Rarely, a cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation on top of <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia,</b> may develop.|$|E
500|$|Upon consumption, both {{in humans}} and other species, the {{symptoms}} of poisoning are mainly characterized by generalized seizures. The onset of symptoms following ingestion may be as soon as 15 minutes post ingestion. Initial symptoms reported may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tremors, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and drowsiness; although the rapid onset of seizure activity {{may be the first}} sign presented following poisoning. Seizures are usually described as clonic or tonic–clonic. Complications of ongoing seizure activity include increased body temperature, decreases in the pH of the blood (metabolic acidosis), swelling in the brain, blood coagulation disorders, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), and kidney failure. Additional neurological symptoms may include hallucinations, delirium, tingling, pricking, or numbness of a person's skin, dilated pupils, [...] and coma. Cardiovascular symptoms include alternating slow or fast heart rate and alternating low and high blood pressure. Other cardiac effects may include ECG abnormalities such as widening of the PR interval, <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia,</b> and ventricular fibrillation. Symptoms of excess salivation, wheezing, respiratory distress, and absence of breathing have also been reported.|$|E
30|$|Accessory {{atrioventricular}} pathways (AP) and dual AV nodal physiology {{are common}} substrates for paroxysmal <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardias</b> (SVT) {{in children and}} adolescents.

Aim {{of this study was to}} assess effectiveness and safety of RF- and cryoenergy ablation in a paediatric population.|$|R
50|$|Tachycardias may be {{classified}} as either narrow complex <b>tachycardias</b> (<b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardias)</b> or wide complex tachycardias. Narrow and wide refer to {{the width of the}} QRS complex on the ECG. Narrow complex tachycardias tend to originate in the atria, while wide complex tachycardias tend to originate in the ventricles. Tachycardias can be further classified as either regular or irregular.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{physical}} acts can increase parasympathetic nervous {{supply to the}} heart, resulting in blocking of electrical conduction through the AV node. This can slow down or stop a number of arrhythmias that originate above or at the AV node (see main article: <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardias).</b> Parasympathetic nervous supply to the heart is via the vagus nerve, and these maneuvers are collectively known as vagal maneuvers.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{possible}} complication is [...] "pacemaker-tracked tachycardia," [...] where a <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> is {{tracked by}} the pacemaker and produces beats from a ventricular lead. This is becoming exceedingly rare as newer devices are often programmed to recognize supraventricular tachycardias and switch to non-tracking modes.|$|E
2500|$|People with WPW {{are usually}} {{asymptomatic}} when {{not having a}} fast heart rate. [...] However, individuals may experience palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, or infrequently syncope (fainting or near fainting) during episodes of <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> The telltale [...] "delta wave" [...] may sometimes be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG).|$|E
2500|$|Flecainide acetate ( [...] ) is a class Ic {{antiarrhythmic}} agent {{used to prevent}} and treat tachyarrhythmias (abnormal fast rhythms of the heart).

50|$|Catheter {{ablation}} is an minimally-invasive procedure used {{to remove}} or terminate a faulty electrical pathway from {{sections of the}} hearts {{of those who are}} prone to developing cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, <b>supraventricular</b> <b>tachycardias</b> (SVT) and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. If not controlled, arrhythmias increase the risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest. The procedure can be classified by energy source: radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation.|$|R
2500|$|Atrial flutter (AFL) is {{a common}} {{abnormal}} heart rhythm that starts in the atrial chambers of the heart.
