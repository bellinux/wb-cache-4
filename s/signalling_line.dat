40|$|A <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> {{driving circuit}} with power control for {{selectively}} reducing internal power dissipation when driving an external load. While driving the external load with a constant current the output voltage generated across such load is monitored. If the load impedance decreases sufficiently {{to cause the}} output voltage to fall below a predetermined threshold value and, therefore, cause the voltage across the <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> driving circuit to increase, {{the magnitude of the}} power supply voltage is automatically reduced, thereby reducing the voltage across the <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> driving circuit. Such a <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> driving circuit is particularly advantageous as a subscriber line interface circuit (SLIC). As the subscriber goes from an on-hook condition to an off-hook condition and if the subscriber loop is sufficiently short (or low in impedance), a lower power supply voltage is used to minimize the power dissipation of the SLIC while still maintaining the required subscriber loop current...|$|R
40|$|Placing a guard trace {{next to a}} <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> is the {{conventional}} technique for reducing the common-mode radiation from a printed circuit board. In this paper, the suppression of common-mode radiation from printed circuit boards having guard traces is estimated and evaluated using the imbalance difference model, which was proposed by the authors. To reduce common-mode radiation further, a procedure for designing a transmission line with guard traces is proposed. Guard traces connected to a return plane through vias are placed near a <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> and they decrease a current division factor (CDF). The CDF represents the degree of imbalance of a transmission line, and a common-mode electromotive force depends on the CDF. Thus, by calculating the CDF, we can estimate the reduction in common-mode radiation. It is reduced not only by placing guard traces, but also by narrowing the <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> {{to compensate for the}} variation in characteristic impedance due to the guard traces. Experimental results showed that the maximum reduction in common-mode radiation was about 14 dB achieved by placing guard traces {{on both sides of the}} <b>signal</b> <b>line,</b> and the calculated reduction agreed with the measured one within 1 dB. According to the CDF and characteristic impedance calculations, common-mode radiation can be reduced by about 25 dB while keeping the characteristic impedance constant by changing the gap between the <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> and the guard trace and by narrowing the width of the <b>signal</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{measured}} the discriminability of the linear motion trajectory {{of a line}} embedded in a random-line kinematogram. The <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> orientation was either parallel (iso-) or orthogonal (ortho-) to its motion direction and it was identical in all respects to the noise (orientation, length, baseline step size, frame rate) except for motion direction, rendering the <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> indistinguishable from the noise lines on a frame-to-frame basis. Our results show better discrimination of ortho-trajectories in most conditions, which (i) improved with duration up to 150 - 450 ms, (ii) was relatively independent of the speed, and (iii) whether the trajectory was straight or jittered each frame. However, discrimination of ortho-trajectory dropped when step size was high and lines were longer than 30 min of arc. Discrimination of iso-trajectory improved with increasing <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> speed and length, but was not affected by duration and was severely impaired by jitter. These results strongly suggest that discrimination of the <b>signal</b> <b>line's</b> trajectory is modulated by its orientation, and that iso- and ortho-trajectory discrimination relies upon at least two distinct mechanisms: an orientation-selective static detector that responds to iso-trajectories and a network of primary motion units that integrate local motion <b>signals</b> orthogonal to <b>line</b> orientation...|$|R

40|$|Multiple-detect {{test sets}} {{have been shown}} to be {{effective}} in lowering defect level. Other researchers have noted that observing the effects of a defect can be controlled by sensitizing affected sites to circuit outputs but defect excitation is inherently probabilistic given a defect’s inherent, unknown nature. As a result, test sets that sensitize every <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> multiple times with varying circuit state has a greater probability of detecting a defect. In past work, the entire circuit is considered when varying circuit state from one vector to another for a given <b>signal</b> <b>line.</b> However, it may be possible to improve defect excitation by exploiting the localized nature of many defect types. Specifically, by varying circuit state in the physical region or neighborhood surrounding a line affected by a defect, the defect excitation and therefore detection can be improved.
