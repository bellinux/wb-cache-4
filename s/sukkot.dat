5|$|In 1869 reformers again left Baith Israel, and, joining with dissenters from Kahal Kodesh Beth Elohim of Williamsburg, founded Temple Israel. Though many reformers {{had left}} the congregation, several reforms in the service were {{nonetheless}} introduced: the congregation abolished most piyyutim and the Priestly Blessing, and, in 1873, introduced a confirmation ceremony for girls, led by the Reverend Dr. Tinter. The confirmation ceremonies, which had initially been held during the holiday of <b>Sukkot,</b> were eventually moved to the holiday of Shavuot (the holiday during which the Reform movement held these ceremonies), and continued for {{both boys and girls}} (in place of Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations) until the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The New Haifa Symphony Orchestra, {{established}} in 1950, {{has more than}} 5,000subscribers. In 2004, 49,000 people attended its concerts. The Haifa Cinematheque, founded in 1975, hosts the annual Haifa International Film Festival during the intermediate days of the <b>Sukkot</b> holiday. Haifa has 29 movie theaters. The city publishes a local newspaper, Yediot Haifa, and has its own radio station, Radio Haifa. The Israeli Arabic-language newspapers Al-Ittihad and Al-Madina are also based in Haifa. During the 1990s, Haifa hosted the Haifa Rock & Blues Festival featuring Bob Dylan, Nick Cave, Blur and PJ Harvey. The last festival was held in 1995 with Sheryl Crow, Suede and Faith No More as headliners.|$|E
5|$|During Fineshriber's {{early years}} the {{congregation}} continued to modify its religious practices. At funerals, it encouraged mourners {{to leave the}} graveside, rather than having them wait until the coffin was lowered and cover it with earth themselves (as was the traditional practice). By this time, few members had bar mitzvah ceremonies for their 13-year-old boys; instead, boys and girls participated in the Reform Confirmation ceremony (though the synagogue still allowed those who wanted bar mitzvah ceremonies to have them). In 1916, the congregation eliminated the observance of the eighth days of Passover and <b>Sukkot,</b> required all worshipers to stand when mourners stood to recite the kaddish, and restored the Orthodox practice of blessing and naming babies in the synagogue {{as part of the}} services.|$|E
25|$|The term Three Pilgrimage Festivals (שלוש רגלים, shalosh regalim) {{refers to}} Passover, Shavuot and <b>Sukkot.</b> Within this {{grouping}} <b>Sukkot</b> normally includes Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah.|$|E
25|$|In Judaism, Ecclesiastes is read {{either on}} Shemini Atzeret (by Yemenites, Italians, some Sepharadim, and the mediaeval French Jewish rite) {{or on the}} Shabbat of the Intermediate Days of <b>Sukkot</b> (by Ashkenazim). If there is no Intermediate Sabbath of <b>Sukkot,</b> even the Ashkenazim read it on Shemini Atzeret (or, for Ashkenazim in the Land of Israel, on the first Shabbat of <b>Sukkot).</b> It is read on <b>Sukkot</b> as a {{reminder}} to not get too {{caught up in the}} festivities of the holiday, as well as to carry over the happiness of <b>Sukkot</b> {{to the rest of the}} year by telling the listeners that, without God, life is meaningless. When the listeners take this to heart, then true happiness can be achieved throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|Thus the {{continuum}} of these days can be depicted as follows: <b>Sukkot</b> > Chol HaMoed <b>Sukkot</b> > Hoshana Rabbah > Shemini Atzeret > Simchat Torah, as practiced in classical Rabbinical Judaism.|$|E
25|$|Moed (מועד) ("festive season"), plural moadim (מועדים), {{refers to}} any of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals of Passover, Shavuot and <b>Sukkot.</b> When used in {{comparison}} to Yom Tov, it refers to Chol HaMoed, the intermediate days of Passover and <b>Sukkot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chol HaMoed, the {{intermediate}} days during Passover and <b>Sukkot.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{seriousness}} of the spring equinox drift is widely discounted {{on the grounds that}} Passover will remain in the spring season for many millennia, and the text of the Torah is generally not interpreted as having specified tight calendrical limits. Of course, the Hebrew calendar also drifts with respect to the autumn equinox, and {{at least part of the}} harvest festival of <b>Sukkot</b> is already more than a month after the equinox in years 1, 9, and 12 of each 19-year cycle; beginning in AM 5818 (2057 CE), this will also be the case in year 4. (These are the same year numbers as were mentioned for the spring season in the previous paragraph, except that they get incremented at Rosh Hashanah.) This progressively increases the probability that <b>Sukkot</b> will be cold and wet, making it uncomfortable or impractical to dwell in the traditional succah during <b>Sukkot.</b> The first winter seasonal prayer for rain is not recited until Shemini Atzeret, after the end of <b>Sukkot,</b> yet it is becoming increasingly likely that the rainy season in Israel will start before the end of <b>Sukkot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Behab (בה"ב). The fasts of bet-hey-betMonday-Thursday-Mondaywere {{established}} {{as a vehicle for}} atonement from possible excesses during the extended holiday periods of Passover and <b>Sukkot.</b> They are proclaimed on the first Shabbat of the month of Iyar following Passover, and Marcheshvan following <b>Sukkot.</b> Based on the model of Mishnah Ta'anit, they are then observed on the Monday, Thursday and Monday following that Shabbat.|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} of the Temple in Jerusalem, the waving {{ceremony}} (called na'anu'im – נענועים) was performed in the Holy Temple on all seven days of <b>Sukkot,</b> and elsewhere only on the first day. Following the destruction of the Temple, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai ordered that the four species be waved everywhere on every day of <b>Sukkot</b> (except on Shabbat), as a memorial to the Temple.|$|E
25|$|According to the Apocryphal Second Book of Maccabees, {{the first}} celebration of Hanukkah mimicked that of <b>Sukkot,</b> which the Maccabees and their {{followers}} {{had been unable}} to celebrate earlier that year. However, the only allusion to Shemini Atzeret in that narrative is that the Hanukkah celebration was fixed for eight days—in remembrance of both the seven days of <b>Sukkot</b> and the additional day of Shemini Atzeret.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{some have}} claimed that both Hanukkah and Thanksgiving have roots in the Jewish harvest festival of <b>Sukkot.</b>|$|E
25|$|And {{they found}} {{written in the}} Torah, how YHWH had {{commanded}} by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in <b>Sukkot</b> in {{the feast of the}} seventh month; and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying: 'Go forth into the mountains, and fetch olive branches, and oil tree branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thickly leaved trees, to make <b>Sukkot,</b> as it is written.|$|E
25|$|A {{discussion}} {{of the meaning of}} Shavuot (the Feast of Weeks) and of <b>Sukkot,</b> the Feast of Tabernacles, is found in the entries on those subjects.|$|E
25|$|The Dancing Camel Brewery in Tel Aviv, Israel, {{uses the}} rinds of etrogim in its annual 'Trog Wit Beer, usually {{available}} around the Holiday of <b>Sukkot.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Zechariah, in the messianic era, <b>Sukkot</b> {{will become}} a {{universal}} festival, and all nations will make pilgrimages annually to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast there.|$|E
25|$|Tishrei: ba'āl Matqe (blowing holiday – Zikhron Trua) on 1, astasreyo (Day of Atonement – Yom Kippur) on 10 and ba'āla maṣallat (Tabernacles holiday – <b>Sukkot)</b> between 15 – 21.|$|E
25|$|Ecclesiastes (Hebrew: Kohelet; קהלת) is read {{publicly}} in some communities, {{especially by}} Ashkenazim, on the Sabbath of <b>Sukkot</b> (us. Sept/Oct). In other communities {{it is not}} read at all.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the prophet}} Zechariah, in the messianic era, <b>Sukkot</b> {{will become a}} {{universal}} festival, and all nations will make pilgrimages annually to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast there.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>Sukkot</b> {{festival in}} 2006 Uri Ariel, a National Union {{member of the}} Knesset, ascended the Mount {{and said that he}} is making plans for a synagogue on the Mount.|$|E
25|$|The Torah delineates three pilgrimage festivals, Passover, Shavuot (The Feasts of Weeks) and <b>Sukkot</b> (Tabernacles). Each {{of these}} was tied to the {{agricultural}} cycle of the Israelites, and was also given a theological symbolism.|$|E
25|$|On <b>Sukkot</b> {{meals are}} eaten {{outside in the}} sukkah, a {{thatched}} hut built specially for the holiday. Often fresh fruits are eaten also, which are woven into {{the roof of the}} thatched hut.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} again become an {{important}} port of call and has a considerable trade in olive oil. In earlier times {{there was a great}} export of citron, which was cultivated here, including for ritual use in the Jewish community during the <b>Sukkot</b> holiday.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} kiddush is {{said on the}} festival nights of Passover, Shavuot, <b>Sukkot,</b> and Shemini Atzeret/Simchat Torah. When the holiday coincides with Shabbat (Friday night), the verses from Genesis (Evening became... had performed) precede this kiddush, and the {{sections}} in brackets are added.|$|E
25|$|The Hebrew word shemini means eighth. This {{refers to}} the date of Shemini Atzeret {{relative}} to Sukkot; it falls on the eighth day. It is therefore often assumed that Shemini Atzeret is simply the eighth day of <b>Sukkot.</b> That characterization, however, is only partly accurate.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most other}} Jewish communities, Yemenite Jews chant {{different}} melodies for Torah, Prophets (Haftara), Megillat Aicha (Book of Lamentations), Kohelet (Ecclesiastes, read during <b>Sukkot),</b> and Megillat Esther (the Scroll of Esther read on Purim). Unlike Ashkenazic communities, there are melodies for Mishle (Proverbs) and Psalms.|$|E
25|$|The closing {{feast of}} <b>Sukkot</b> (i.e., Shemini Atzeret) ought rightly to have been, {{like that of}} Passover (i.e., Shavuot) on the fiftieth day; but, {{in order not to}} force the people to make another journey to Jerusalem in the rainy season, God fixed it as early as the eighth day.|$|E
25|$|Tachanun is {{omitted from}} the prayers on Shabbat, all the major {{holidays}} and festivals (including Chol HaMoed, the intermediate days of Pesach and <b>Sukkot),</b> Rosh Chodesh (new moon), Hanukkah and Purim, as these days are of a festive nature and reciting Tachanun, which is mildly mournful, would not be appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{together}} with Shavuot ("Pentecost") and <b>Sukkot</b> ("Tabernacles"), Passover {{is one of}} the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (Shalosh Regalim) during which the entire population of the kingdom of Judah made a pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem. Samaritans still make this pilgrimage to Mount Gerizim, but only men participate in public worship.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the holiday}} of <b>Sukkot,</b> the {{intermediary}} days of Passover {{are known as}} Chol HaMoed (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It {{is a time for}} family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as macaroons and homemade candies.|$|E
25|$|Outside the Land of Israel, this {{is further}} {{complicated}} by the additional day added to all Biblical holidays except Yom Kippur. The first day of Shemini Atzeret therefore coincides with the eighth day of <b>Sukkot</b> outside the Land of Israel, leading to sometimes involved analysis as to which practices of each holiday are to apply.|$|E
25|$|The {{modern day}} {{observance}} of {{the rituals of}} Hoshana Rabbah are reminiscent of the practices {{that existed in the}} times of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. During <b>Sukkot,</b> the four species are taken in a circuit around (inscribing the perimeter, not circumscribing the actual building) the synagogue once daily. On Hoshana Rabbah, there are seven circuits.|$|E
25|$|The {{period from}} 1 Adar (or Adar II, in leap years) to 29 Marcheshvan {{contains}} {{all of the}} festivals specified in the Bible – Purim (14 Adar), Pesach (15 Nisan), Shavuot (6 Sivan), Rosh Hashanah (1 Tishrei), Yom Kippur (10 Tishrei), <b>Sukkot</b> (15 Tishrei), and Shemini Atzeret (22 Tishrei). This period is fixed, during which no adjustments are made.|$|E
25|$|The Acco Festival of Alternative Israeli Theatre is {{an annual}} event {{that takes place in}} October, coinciding with the holiday of <b>Sukkot.</b> The festival, inaugurated in 1979, {{provides}} a forum for non-conventional theatre, attracting local and overseas theatre companies. Theatre performances by Jewish and Arab producers are staged at indoor and outdoor venues around the city.|$|E
25|$|The Israelites {{cultivated}} both {{wheat and}} barley. These two grains are mentioned {{first in the}} biblical list of the Seven Species {{of the land of}} Israel and their importance as food is also seen in the celebration of the barley harvest at the festival of Shavuot and of the wheat harvest at the festival of <b>Sukkot.</b>|$|E
