40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to observe the connecting rigidity of various precision attachments and to compare their connecting rigidities with the conical crown retained telescope (CCT). The connecting rigidity of a retainer was assessed using the flexibility test to measure the mesial and distal end displacements. Four precision attachments were analyzed: the dovetail <b>slide</b> <b>attachment</b> beyeler, cylindrical <b>slide</b> <b>attachment,</b> Spang Stabilex and Mini SG. The CCT was used as the control. Although there were many statistically significant differences between the displacements with the various attachments, displacements when vertically loaded were very small: all mesial end displacements were within 3 μm and distal end displacements were 21. 4 μm. The largest of the mesial end displacements when horizontally loaded was as large as 44. 5 μm (dovetail slide beyeler), while the others were all below 16. 5 μm. The same phenomena occurred with the distal end displacements when horizontally loaded: the largest was seen with the dovetail slide beyeler, followed sequentially by the Spang Stabilex, CCT, cylindrical slide, and the Mini SG. The distal displacement with the dovetail slide beyeler was as large as 75. 2 μm; those with the others were all below 31. 2 μm, with numerous statistically significant differences between the displacements with the various attachments. Thus, connecting rigidities of rigid precision attachments are very similar to CCT, and only the dovetail <b>slide</b> beyeler <b>attachment</b> is too weak to resist horizontal displacement force...|$|R
40|$|Collective {{behavior}} of active matter is observed for self-propelled particles, such as vibrated disks and active Brownian particles, {{as well as}} for cytoskeletal filaments in motile cells. Here, a system of quasi two-dimensional penetrable self-propelled rods inside rigid rings is used to construct a complex self-propelled particle. The rods interact sterically {{with each other and with}} a stationary or mobile ring via a separation-shifted Lennard-Jones potential. They either have a <b>sliding</b> <b>attachment</b> to the inside of the ring at one of their ends, or can move freely within the ring confinement. We study the inner structure and dynamics of the mobile self-propelled rings. We find that these complex particles cannot only be characterized as active Brownian particles, but can also exhibit cell-like motility: random walks, persistent motion, circling, and run-and-circle motion...|$|E

40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{the structure}} of sliding grafted polymer layers or SGP layers. These interfacial structures are built by attaching each polymer to the substrate with a ring-like molecule such as cyclodextrins. Such a topological grafting mode allows the chains to freely <b>slide</b> along the <b>attachment</b> point. Escape from the sliding link is prevented by bulky capping groups. We show that grafts in the mushroom regime adopt mainly symmetric configurations (with comparable branch sizes) while grafts in dense layers are highly dissymmetric so that only one branch per graft participates in the layer. Sliding layers on small colloids or star-like sliding micelles exhibit an intermediate behavior where the number of longer branches participating in the corona is independent {{of the total number}} of branches. This regime also exists for sliding surface-micelles comprising less chains but it is narrower. Comment: "For more information, see [URL]...|$|R

J.) to a standard BACTEC system (Johnston Laboratories, Inc., Towson, Md.) blood culture. The yield of bacteremic patients, the clinical significance of organisms detected, {{and the cost of}} the combination system were compared with those of the standard BACTEC system alone. Each culture included 20 ml of blood divided among a BACTEC 6 B aerobic bottle (5 ml), a BACTEC 7 D anaerobic bottle (5 ml), and a Septi-Chek bottle equipped with a <b>slide</b> subculture <b>attachment</b> (10 ml). Significant isolates grew in 9. 6 % of the 2, 269 cultures evaluated. The combination BACTEC plus Septi-Chek system detected 25 % more bacteremic patients than the BACTEC system alone, 129 patients versus 103. The 26 bacteremic patients detected by only the added Septi-Chek bottle included 7 whose organism was isolated from blood alone and 19 whose organism was in mixed or pure culture from a second source. Detection of the organism resulted in alteration of antimicrobial therapy in 17 of these 26 patients. The combination system, which cultured a 20 -ml blood volume, cost $ 11, 000 more during the study period than the BACTEC system alone, which cultured a 10 -ml volume. Reimbursement under the diagnosis-related group system was increased by $ 23, 000 as a result of documentation of sepsis in these 26 patients.

The effect of a pretreatment chemical (chlorine), and certain alterations of chemical dosing on membrane biofouling was investigated. The paper also reports on the biofouling potential of the source water, {{and the effect of}} chlorination on this biofouling potential. Experiments were carried out to study biofouling in a SWRO Plant, on the Red Sea coast, under a set of four pretreatment modes. These included the normal operation mode, where coagulant is dosed immediately before the media filter and where sodium metabisulfite (SBS) is dosed after the media filter. Secondly, the operation with the coagulant dosing point shifted back to the pressure side of the seawater intake pump. Thirdly, with the SBS dosing point shifted to after the micron cartridge filter, and fourthly while the plant was operating without chlorination/dechlorination.

40|$|CSIRO has {{developed}} a model of flotation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software that incorporates fluid motion in realistic vessel geometries. The model also predicts particle capture by bubbles in the system using equations based on the induction time concept. This work looks to experimental studies at the microscale to provide an improved basis for the attachment predictions in the overall model of flotation. A model cell {{has been set up}} to study the behaviour of 150 micron glass particles in the vicinity of a captive 1. 3 mm air bubble. The interaction is recorded on high-speed video, permitting direct estimation of relevant parameters such as the approach velocity, and the duration of particle sliding over the bubble surface. A new experimental configuration has allowed the particle path toward, around, and away from the bubble to be totally unimpeded. Particle trajectories show a significant deviation at surprisingly large separations, due to the hydrodynamics. However, surface properties are more important in determining eventual <b>attachment.</b> <b>Sliding</b> durations have been measured, and these can be related back to a threshold duration to achieve attachment, known as the 'induction time'. Events where a sliding particle 'jumps in' toward the bubble may indicate the precise moment of attachment, providing a more accurate estimate of induction time. Flotation modellers must consider processes ranging from bulk hydrodynamics to molecular chemistry. However, the micromechanics that forms a bridge between those two processes turns out to be critical. Direct observation of particle-bubble interaction through high-speed videography provides insight into flotation modelling, to allow prediction of attachment based on a realistic combination of hydrodynamic and chemical factors. 11 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The modern bass {{trombone}} is {{pitched in}} B. Its tubing length of 9 ft {{is identical to}} that of the tenor trombone, but it has a wider bore, a larger bell, and a larger mouthpiece. These features generate an overall darker, weightier tone that speaks with a more assured authority in lower registers when compared to the tenor trombone. Modern bass trombones also have one or two valves (the latter being by far the more common) which, when engaged, change the key of the instrument. This allows the player {{to bridge the gap between}} the first part with the slide in the first position and the second partial with the slide fully extended in the seventh position. These valves may be configured in a dependent or independent system. In a dependent system, the first valve lowers the key of the trombone to F. The second valve can only be engaged in conjunction with the first valve, and commonly lowers the key of the trombone to E. With an independent system, the first valve still lowers the key to F, but the second valve commonly lowers the key to G when engaged alone or D when engaged with the first valve. 19th and early 20th century examples of the modern bass trombone were sometimes made with a valve attachment in E rather than F, or with an alternative tuning <b>slide</b> for the <b>attachment</b> tubing enabling the pitch to be lowered to E. Bore sizes of the bass trombone are generally larger than those of large bore tenor trombones. Typical specifications include a bore size of 0.562 in in the slide and 0.580 in through the valve attachment tubing, with a bell from 9 to 10+1/2 in in diameter.Bass trombones with just one valve often have a long tuning slide which allows the valve to change the key to E rather than the usual F.|$|R
40|$|Small interfering RNA (siRNA) {{screening}} approaches have provided useful tools for the validation of genetic functions; however, image-based siRNA screening using multiwell plates requires {{large numbers of}} cells and time, which could be the barrier in application for gene mechanisms study using human adult cells. Therefore, we developed the advanced method with the cell-defined siRNA microarray (CDSM), for functional analysis of genes in small scale within slide glass using human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs). We designed cell spot system with biomaterials (sucrose, gelatin, poly-l-lysine and matrigel) to control the attachment of hBMSCs inside spot area on three-dimensional (3 D) hydrogel-coated slides. The p 65 expression {{was used as a}} validation standard which described our previous report. For the optimization of siRNA mixture, first, we detected five kinds of commercialized reagent (Lipofectamine 2000, RNAi-Max, Metafectine, Metafectine Pro, TurboFectin 8. 0) via validation. Then, according to quantification of p 65 expression, we selected 2  μl of RNAi-Max as the most effective reagent condition on our system. Using same validation standard, we optimized sucrose and gelatin concentration (80  mM and 0. 13 %), respectively. Next, we performed titration of siRNA quantity (2. 66 – 5. 55  μM) by reverse transfection time (24  h, 48  h, 72  h) and confirmed 3. 75  μM siRNA concentration and 48  h as the best condition. To sum up the process for optimized CDSM, 3  μl of 20  μM siRNA (3. 75  μM) was transferred to the 384 -well V-bottom plate containing 2  μl of dH 2 O and 2  μl of 0. 6  M sucrose (80  mM). Then, 2  μl of RNAi-Max was added and incubated for 20  min at room temperature after mixing gently and centrifugation shortly. Five microliters of gelatin (0. 26 %) and 2  μl of growth factor reduced phenol red-free matrigel (12. 5 %) were added and mixed by pipetting gently. Finally, optimized siRNA mixture was printed on 3 D hydrogel-coated <b>slides</b> and cell-defined <b>attachment</b> and siRNA reverse transfection were induced. The efficiency of this CDSM was verified using three siRNAs (targeting p 65, Slug, and N-cadherin), with persistent gene silencing for 5  days.
