40|$|GPR {{is widely}} used for ballast fouling identification, however, there are no robust {{guidelines}} to find the degree and type of fouling quantitatively. In this study, GPR {{studies were carried out}} on model and actual railway tracks using three ground coupled antennas and considering three fouling materials. Three ground coupled antennas viz., 100 MHz, 500 MHz and 800 MHz antennas were used for the initial survey and {{it was found that the}} 800 MHz ground coupled antenna is an optimum one to get quality results. Three major fouling materials viz., screened/broken ballast, coal and iron ore were used to construct prototype model sections, which were 1 / 2 of the actual Indian broad-gauge railway track. A separate model section has been created for each degree and type of fouling and GPR surveys were carried out. GPR study shows that increasing the fouling content results in a decrease in the Electromagnetic Wave (EMW) velocity and an increase in the dielectric constant. EMW velocity of ballast fouled with <b>screened</b> <b>ballast</b> was found to be more than coal fouled ballast and iron ore fouled ballast at any degree of fouling and EMW velocity of iron ore fouled ballast was found to be less than coal and screen ballast fouled ballast. Dielectric constant of iron ore fouled ballast was found to be higher than coal and screen ballast fouled ballast for all degrees of fouling. Average slope of the trend line of screen ballast fouled section is low (25. 6 degrees), coal fouled ballast is medium (27. 8 degrees) and iron ore fouled ballast is high (47. 6 degrees).

5000|$|Ballast {{cleaning}} removes this worn <b>ballast,</b> <b>screens</b> it {{and replaces}} the [...] "dirty" [...] worn ballast with fresh ballast. The advantage of ballast cleaning {{is that it}} can be done by an on-track machine without removing the rail and sleepers, and it is therefore cheaper than a total excavation.|$|R
40|$|There are {{currently}} four invasive tunicate species which are causing significant {{challenges to the}} aquaculture industry in Atlantic Canada: Ciona intestinalis, Styela clava, Botryllus schlosseri and Botrylloides violaceus. These tunicates foul mussel socks, aquaculture gear, boat hulls and wharves. As with many aquatic invasive species, detection of these tunicates mostly occurs once adult populations have reached significant population sizes. However, once populations have reached these levels, there is often little {{that can be done}} to stop or slow the invasion. Having efficient and sensitive assays that could detect invasive tunicates at microscopic stages would be advantageous as management strategies could be implemented before populations spike to invasive levels. Such an assay would also be useful in monitoring mussel processing plant effluent so that invasive tunicate eggs and larvae are not spread through effluent water discharge to adjacent bays. Molecular assays have been developed in this study that can detect the four invasive tunicate species in both mussel processing effluent water and in bay water surrounding mussel leases. These assays are highly specific and have a sensitivity of detection of 1 - 5 eggs and/or larvae per water sample. In addition qRT-PCR assays have been developed that can detect and distinguish between different life stages of Ciona intestinalis (egg and larvae) in water samples. This qRT-PCR assay also has the capacity to evaluate viability of free swimming larvae so that nonviable larvae do not cause false positives during mussel processing plant effluent monitoring. The high throughput capacity, high specificity and sensitivity of these assays shows excellent potential for use as a monitoring tool for aquatic invasive species in <b>screening</b> <b>ballast</b> water, effluent waste from shellfish processing plants, as well in local bays and rivers. This study also used phylogenetic analyses of the cytochrome oxidase 1 gene to determine that populations of Botryllus schlosseri in Prince Edward Island have low genetic diversity. Only two haplotypes of B. schlosseri were found in this study in PEI, one which was found in all aquaculture bays tested and the other found only on native substrate in one bay. It is likely that local activity spread this species to other areas of Prince Edward Island after the initial invasion. Phylogeographic analysis suggests that this species was likely transported from Massachusetts to Nova Scotia and then was transported to Prince Edward Island via local boating activity or through the movement of aquaculture species. Through the development of these efficient detection methods and by determining source populations and possible vectors responsible for transporting invasive species to this region, it is hoped that new invasions of aquatic invasive species can be prevented and/or managed before they pose a risk to the aquaculture industry in Prince Edward Island...|$|R
