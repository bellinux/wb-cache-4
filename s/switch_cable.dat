50|$|The {{initial setup}} is four 3-car trains (113 {{passengers}} each train), {{but the system}} can accommodate an expansion to four 4-car trains (148 passengers each train). The system has four cable loops and one train per cable. The system uses a pinched-loop configuration, with two lines that merge into a single track just before each terminus. Cars <b>switch</b> <b>cables</b> during dwell time at the station. The trains automatically <b>switch</b> <b>cables</b> four times: once at each end, and halfway between the two stops at the wheelhouse, near the intersection of Hegenberger Road and Airport Access Road. The wheelhouse has four 12 ft drive wheels that move the cables.|$|R
