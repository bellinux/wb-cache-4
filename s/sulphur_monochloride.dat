S2Cl2 has the structure {{implied by the}} formula Cl-S-S-Cl, wherein the angle between the Cla-S-S and S-S-Clb planes is 90°. This structure {{is referred to as}} gauche, and is akin to that for H2O2. A different isomer of S2Cl2 is S=SCl2; this isomer forms transiently when S2Cl2 is exposed to UV-radiation (see thiosulfoxides).|$|E

The synthesized cations were readily reduced to the corresponding stable neutral radicals with spin densities delocalized over both 1, 4 -thiazinyl and 1, 2, 3 -dithiazolyl moieties...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} papers 1 ' 2 it {{has been}} shown that sulphur mono-iodide can be prepared by the action of dry potassium iodide on a dilute solution of <b>sulphur</b> <b>monochloride</b> in carbon tetrachloride. It is further shown that the velocity of decomposition of the iodide is considerably diminished by a lowering in temperature. In the present paper, an attempt is made to show that sulphur diiodide (SI 2) can also be prepared by employing a similar experimental technique. Spong, 3 while estimating the chlorine content of sulphur dichloridc, shook up aqueous potassium iodide with a solution of sulphur dichloride in carbon tetrachloride. He noticed that the carbon tetrachloride layer turned reddish-orange in colour; he concludcd however that the colour was due to the formation of ‘a complex containing sulphur chloride and iodine As will be shown later, this reddish-orange colour is really due to sulphur diiodide and not due to any complex as postulated by Spong 3. ...|$|E
