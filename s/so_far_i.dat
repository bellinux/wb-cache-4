25|$|As President Bush's AIDS Coordinator, Tobias was {{responsible}} for setting policy detailing which countries would receive monies from various US agencies, how much, and what the rules governing assignment of those funds would be. As AIDS Coordinator, he discussed the rules {{in an interview with}} PBS' Frontline where he detailed a legal requirement that recipients of U.S. aid denounce prostitution:The Congress I think very appropriately has put into the legislation that created this program that organizations, in order to receive money, need to have a policy opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. I don't think it's too difficult for people to be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking, which are in fact two contributing causes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. I think when organizations initially became aware of that requirement, some organizations were concerned about what the implications of that might be, but we implemented that in the first year with non-U.S. organizations. We're now implementing that requirement with U.S. organizations. And <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> <b>I</b> really know of no problems that we've had on the ground.|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Shadows" [...] was rated a C+, with the episode being called [...] "exceedingly awkward", while the political context {{was seen as a}} weak point. Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, had mixed feeling about the episode, rating it a C+. He felt that the episode's plot worked well, though the supernatural elements seemed [...] "a little corny". Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, was more positive about the episode, calling it [...] "fun viewing" [...] and feeling that [...] "with characters we could care about and a far more rounded plot, this proved one of the better episodes <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> <b>I</b> still wouldn’t call it a particularly brilliant one, though, either".|$|E
500|$|Bergkamp's {{nickname}} is the [...] "Non-Flying Dutchman" [...] due to {{his fear}} of flying. This stemmed from an incident with the Netherlands national team at the 1994 World Cup where the engine of the plane cut out during a flight, prompting a journalist to joke about having a bomb in his bag. Following this incident, Bergkamp decided he would never fly again but did consider seeking psychiatric help:I've got this problem and I {{have to live with}} it. I can't do anything about it, it is a psychological thing and I can't explain it. I have not flown on a plane for two years. The Dutch FA has been sympathetic, so have Arsenal, <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> <b>I</b> am considering psychiatric help. I can't fly. I just freeze. I get panicky.

In an interview with Rekhs, a celebrity columnist for Behindwoods, Gopu said, [...] "This film {{even if it is}} remade today, will not hold a candle to its original". Crazy Mohan said, [...] "Kadhalikka Naeramillai is Tamil Cinema’s Mount Everest of comedy. There’s no other Tenzing [...] in sight <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> <b>I</b> was aghast that some people even considered re-making Kadhalikka Naeramillai. None should attempt it. It is blasphemy". Sharadha Narayanan of The New Indian Express stated in February 2009, [...] "Recently when the news of Kadhalikka Neramillai remake was announced, every lip had one question that went unanswered: Who can actually do Nagesh’s role at least the way he did, if not better?" [...] An anonymous source close to the production team of Kavalai Vendam (2016) described it as a [...] "modern day version" [...] of Kadhalikka Neramillai to The Times of India.|$|E
500|$|He wrote [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] {{after the}} death of his uncle. The two were not on {{speaking}} terms after his uncle forced him out of his home before Cudi could find another living situation. A [...] bitter Cudi never apologized to him before his death, which he now regrets. Other songs on the album expand upon themes discussed in that single. Back in 2007, Drake, who was one of Cudi's first supporters, had shown interest in doing an official remix of [...] the song with him. However, Cudi chose against it since he was not interested in working with people who are in the [...] "same creative realm" [...] as him and because he was in the midst of creating his own works. Beginning in the fourth grade, and getting more tense after his father's death when he was 11, Cudi began dreaming of his own death (which usually was an automobile accident). He channeled these things into his material. Speaking to BlackBook in May 2009, Cudi said of the album and its content, [...] "Each song is a message. All the hooks are stadium-worthy, crowd sing-along, powerful joints that I can't wait for people to hear in stadium magnitude. My album definitely needs to be heard loudly, but it's also a great album if you're smoking and you need to go to sleep. <b>So</b> <b>far</b> <b>I</b> have the lineup of how I want the first seven tracks on my album and if I play the first seven from the beginning to the end, I'm zoned out and it's the best trip ever.

2500|$|Burnt Letters is the {{follow-up}} to Henderson's self-titled debut album, which featured re-recorded covers {{of the selected}} songs he performed as a finalist on The X Factor Australia. During an interview with Renowned for Sound in March 2014, Henderson confirmed that he had already begun work on Burnt Letters, stating: [...] "I'm really proud of everything I've written for it <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> <b>I</b> think I've taken some risks {{with some of the}} songs, but everything has a lot of soul and depth." [...] He later told Girl.com.au that the songs he wrote years ago were also being recorded for the album. Henderson worked on Burnt Letters for eight months with several record producers and songwriters, including Louis Schoorl, Jon Hume, Alex Hope and Lindsay Rimes, among others. After writing new songs for the album, Henderson presented them to Sony Music Australia and received good feedback from the label. He said [...] "they were really impressed with the way I could carry a song and tell a story." [...] Despite his music not being typical pop, Henderson revealed that Sony did not interfere with his [...] "songwriting processes or tone" [...] for Burnt Letters, admitting that the album is exactly the way he wanted it.|$|E
2500|$|Similar acclaim {{was given}} to the five date Seaside Tour of coastal resorts in the south of England which Ant {{undertook}} on 17–22 June 2011. Local Cornish radio station The Source FM cheered 18 June 2011 Falmouth concert on its website: [...] "The audience goes wild. Adam stalks the stage, in control, he already knows he's got us ... he plays songs that a man in his mid fifties shouldn’t really get away with, but he does, with dignity. Here's a man who still has something to say and manages to say it with 30 year old songs...Someone boos, Adam retaliates and we're with him. There’s nothing to boo here... Did that really just happen? Did Adam Ant really just blow us all away with the best gig of the year <b>so</b> <b>far?</b> <b>I</b> think he did." [...] The Seaside Tour served both as a follow-up to the main UK tour and a warm-up to Ant's appearance at Hard Rock Calling 2011 in Hyde Park on 26 June 2011, third on the bill to Rod Stewart and Stevie Nicks before an audience of 45,000.

2500|$|During {{his second}} term as {{chairman}} of the Commission on Fine Arts, Walton oversaw the approval of I. M. Pei's design for the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art and the restoration of the Renwick Gallery. He dissented from the commission's approval of Pei's building, but Pei also implemented many of Walton's critiques. Although Walton voted to approve both buildings, he strongly disliked the design of the J. Edgar Hoover Building and had serious concerns about the initial designs for Gyo Obata's National Air and Space Museum. He also played a critical if minor role {{in the design of the}} Washington Metro. The CFA repeatedly criticized the designs of architect Harry Weese, who had been hired to design the city's new subway stations. Numerous meetings were held in which Weese's designs were found to fall short. In January 1968, Walton presided at yet another meeting between the CFA and Weese. At this meeting, Weese appeared unable to respond to or understand any of the commission's comments or suggestions. An exasperated Gordon Bunshaft rose, and—in front of a shocked Weese—began sketching out on a large easel what came to be the Brutalist design for Washington's Metro stations. As the meeting broke up, with the design appearing to have won over the CFA, Walton quipped, [...] "Well Gordon, since you've designed the subway <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> <b>I</b> think you might as well continue with the project!" [...] Although Weese is credited with the design of the Washington Metro stations, it was Walton's support that led the CFA to approve the design outlined by Bunshaft.|$|E

My individual pursuit was good, but I was fifth and just missed the finals. I was very disappointed because I also missed the Olympic Games, because I only started riding [...] on the track four months ago. I didn't have enough points to ride in the individual pursuit in the Olympics." [...] About the scratch race she continued: [...] "My plan was to attack about 10 laps from the finish, I wanted to go when the speed was a bit lower. I did it about eight laps before the finish. I was surprised, but every country has just one rider so they don't work together. That was better for me to ride away. I didn't look behind, just once," [...] she added. [...] "I knew I had to give it everything and if there was no gap, then there was no gap. But it worked out well." [...] Despite having quite a considerable gap coming into the final lap, Van Dijk refused to believe that the race was won until the very end. She detailed the point at which she realised that she was definitely going to triumph. [...] "Just 100 metres before the finish," [...] she said. [...] "I didn't know how big the gap was , I didn't look back, I was just focused on riding hard and getting everything out." [...] A few days on from the frustration of non-qualification, her new rainbow jersey and gold medal provide her {{with a great deal of}} compensation. [...] "I was really, really disappointed with that," [...] she confirmed. [...] "But this makes up for it." ...|$|E
