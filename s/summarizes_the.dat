5|$|The {{balance of}} {{payments}} accounts summarize payments made to or received from foreign countries. Receipts are considered credit transactions while payments are considered debit transactions. The {{balance of payments}} {{is a function of}} three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current account, transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial account, and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital account. The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account <b>summarizes</b> <b>the</b> value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account <b>summarizes</b> <b>the</b> value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} table <b>summarizes</b> <b>the</b> key {{properties of}} the six quarks. Flavor quantum numbers (isospin (I3), charm (C), strangeness (S, {{not to be confused}} with spin), topness (T), and bottomness (B′)) are assigned to certain quark flavors, and denote qualities of quark-based systems and hadrons. The baryon number (B) is + for all quarks, as baryons are made of three quarks. For antiquarks, the electric charge (Q) and all flavor quantum numbers (B, I3, C, S, T, and B′) are of opposite sign. Mass and total angular momentum (J; equal to spin for point particles) do not change sign for the antiquarks.|$|E
