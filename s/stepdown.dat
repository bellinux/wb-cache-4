50|$|The {{day after}} the {{occupation}} started in Mong Kok, the occupation area expanded from Nathan Road and Argyle Street to Mong Kok Road, Sai Yeung Choi Street and so on. Vehicles were trapped because of the full-occupation of all six roadways in Nathan Road while many bus routes had to be rerouted. Meanwhile, those trapped buses and discontinued bus stops became the place where protestors and citizens stuck their opinions of requesting the <b>stepdown</b> of CY Leung and the slogans to call for universal suffrage,which were written mainly on cardboard and papers instead of post tips, which became the prototype for the Lennon Wall in Admiralty.|$|E
50|$|Big {{downward}} steps {{through the}} process in Figure 2 represent how many units of energy are left after each stage, and illustrates that the way we put fuels to work is exceptionally wasteful. After the first stage—making electricity through an average U.S. natural gas-fired power plant—only 40 units of the original 100 are left. The next <b>stepdown</b> in Figure 2 reflects power line transmission losses, which eats about five of those 40 units, leaving only 35 {{for use in the}} home. While we value light bulbs for their illuminating properties, they perhaps should be more appropriately appreciated as heaters. Ninety percent of the electrical energy a light bulb uses goes to making heat.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{high-power}} semiconductors such as the {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT), it is now possible to build a switched-mode power supply capable of coping with the high loads of arc welding. These designs are known as inverter welding units. They generally first rectify the utility AC power to DC; then they switch (invert) the DC power into a <b>stepdown</b> transformer to produce the desired welding voltage or current. The switching frequency is typically 10 kHz or higher. Although the high switching frequency requires sophisticated components and circuits, it drastically reduces the bulk of the step down transformer, as the mass of magnetic components (transformers and inductors) that is required for achieving a given power level goes down rapidly as the operating (switching) frequency is increased. The inverter circuitry can also provide features such as power control and overload protection. The high frequency inverter-based welding machines are typically more efficient and provide better control of variable functional parameters than non-inverter welding machines.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the pieces}} {{performed}} by the Theatre of Eternal Music have long titles, such as [...] "The Tortoise Recalling the Drone of the Holy Numbers as they were Revealed in the Dreams of the Whirlwind and the Obsidian Gong, Illuminated by the Sawmill, the Green Sawtooth Ocelot and the High-Tension Line <b>Stepdown</b> Transformer." [...] Likewise, the works are often of extreme length, many pieces having no beginning and no end, existing before and after a particular performance. The Theatre of Eternal Music ensemble’s masterwork, begun in 1964, is titled The Tortoise His Dreams and Journeys and is divided into several sections, of which [...] "Map of 49’s Dream: The Two Systems of Eleven Sets of Galactic Intervals Ornamental Light-Years Tracery," [...] {{is the only one}} of which a fragment can be found on disc (forty minutes, with Jon Hassell on trumpet, Garrett List on trombone, Zazeela on voice and Young on electronics).

5000|$|Originally {{shot with}} 8 IMAX cameras {{outfitted}} {{with the first}} long load film magazines, for 5 concerts in 3 cities. The magazines were so huge and the ballistics of the loading so unpredictable, there was no guarantee of complete coverage of any song in any single concert. Eventually trying to cut this on a flatbed proved impossible. Recently re-released EditDroids were in Toronto on various projects and one was custom configured {{with the help of}} the folks at Lucas in Los Angeles. All 35mm [...] "twist reduction" [...] work print was reassembled in original rolls, transferred to video and recorded on one-off laser videodiscs. The 8-headed Droid could load all data bases and imaging for a single song in all concert locations. The editors could jump to any point in a song, see what was available (or not) then jump to the same spot in all subsequent concerts. The trick was tracing back from the Droid data through LaserDisc data through video data back to 35mm <b>stepdown</b> print edge code and ultimately to the original IMAX neg - frame accurately to produce the neg cut list that needed to sync with the original 64 track digital recordings.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962 Young wrote The Second Dream of the High-Tension Line <b>Stepdown</b> Transformer. One of The Four Dreams of China, {{the piece}} is based on four pitches, which he later gave as the {{frequency}} ratios: 36-35-32-24 (G, C, +C#, D), and limits as to which may be combined with any other. Most of his pieces after this point are based on select pitches, played continuously, {{and a group of}} long held pitches to be improvised upon. For The Four Dreams of China Young began to plan Dream House, a light and sound installation conceived as a [...] "work that would be played continuously and ultimately exist as a 'living organism with a life and tradition of its own,'" [...] where musicians would live and create music twenty-four hours a day. He formed the music collective Theatre of Eternal Music to realize Dream House and other pieces. The group initially included calligrapher and light artist Marian Zazeela (who married Young in 1963), Angus MacLise, and Billy Name. In 1964 the ensemble comprised Young and Zazeela, John Cale and Tony Conrad (a former Harvard mathematics major), and sometimes Terry Riley (voices). Since 1966 the group has seen many permutations and has included Garrett List, Jon Hassell, Alex Dea, and many others, including members of the 60s groups.|$|E
50|$|This is one {{in which}} a controller, in ASR, {{provides}} navigational guidance in azimuth only.The pilot is furnished headings to fly to align the aircraft with the extended centerline of the landing runway.Since the radar information used for a surveillance approach is considerably less precise than that used for aprecision approach, the accuracy of the approach will not be as great and higher minimums will apply.Guidance in elevation is not possible but the pilot will be advised when to commence descent to the minimum descent altitude (MDA) or, if appropriate, to an intermediate <b>stepdown</b> fix Minimum Crossing Altitude (MCA) and subsequently to the prescribed MDA. In addition, the pilot will be advised of the location of the MAPt prescribed for the procedureand the aircraft position each mile on final from the runway, airport, heliport, or MAPt, as appropriate. Ifrequested by the pilot, recommended altitudes will be issued at each mile, based on the descent gradientestablished for the procedure, down to the last mile that is at or above the MDA.

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of testing k {{hypotheses}} simultaneously. In this paper, we discuss finite and large sample theory of <b>stepdown</b> methods that provide control of the familywise error rate (FWE). In order to improve upon the Bonferroni method or Holm's (1979) <b>stepdown</b> method, Westfall and Young (1993) make eective use of resampling to construct <b>stepdown</b> methods that implicitly estimate the dependence structure of the test statistics. However, their methods depend on an assumption called subset pivotality. The goal {{of this paper is}} to construct general <b>stepdown</b> methods that do not require such an assumption. In order to accomplish this, we take a close look at what makes <b>stepdown</b> procedures work, and a key component is a monotonicity requirement of critical values. By imposing such monotonicity on estimated critical values (which is not an assumption on the model but an assumption on the method), it is demonstrated that {{the problem of}} constructing a valid multiple test procedure which controls the FWE can be reduced to the problem of contructing a single test which controls the usual probability of a Type 1 error. This reduction allows us to draw upon an enormous resampling literature as a general means of test contruction.
