50|$|Zvezda is also Russia's primary {{manufacturer}} of ejector <b>seats</b> <b>for</b> Russian fighter <b>aircraft.</b> The K-36 ejector seat was studied at length by the US Navy and Air Force; IBP Aircraft (currently UTC Aerospace Systems) {{opened up a}} factory in the US to manufacture it for the F-22 Raptor and the Joint Strike Fighter.

40|$|Two {{types of}} energy {{absorbing}} passenger <b>seat</b> concepts suitable <b>for</b> installation in light twin-engine {{fixed wing aircraft}} were developed. An existing passenger <b>seat</b> <b>for</b> such an <b>aircraft</b> was used to obtain the envelope constraints. Ceiling suspended and floor supported seat concept designs were developed. A restraint system suitable for both concepts was designed. Energy absorbing hardware for both concepts was fabricated and tension and compression tests were conducted to demonstrate the stroking capability and the force deflection characteristics. Crash impact analysis was made and seat loads developed. The basic seat structures were analyzed to determine the adequacy of their strength under impact loading...|$|R
50|$|The two <b>seating</b> {{configurations}} <b>for</b> trainer <b>aircraft</b> are: {{pilot and}} instructor side by side, or in tandem, usually with the pilot {{in front and}} the instructor behind. The side-by-side seating configuration has the advantage that pilot and instructor can see each other's actions, allowing the pilot {{to learn from the}} instructor and the instructor to correct the student pilot. The tandem configuration has the advantage of being closer to the normal working environment that a fast jet pilot is likely to encounter.|$|R
50|$|Some {{airlines}} {{omit the}} row number 13. For example, Lufthansa, (as shown e.g. on the Lufthansa A321/100 seating plan) reputedly {{because of a}} widespread superstition that the number 13 is unlucky. Emirates {{used to have a}} row 13, but on their latest A380 aircraft have removed it (as shown on Emirates A380-800 seating plan). British Airways are less superstitious, and their <b>seat</b> maps <b>for</b> A320 <b>aircraft</b> shows a row 13. Delta Air Lines also includes row 13 in many of their seat maps.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the methodology and {{results of a}} program conducted to develop two underseat energy absorber (E/A) concepts for application to nonadjustable crashworthy passenger <b>seats</b> <b>for</b> general aviation <b>aircraft.</b> One concept utilizes an inflated air bag, and the other, a convoluted sheet metal bellows. Prototypes of both were designed, built, and tested. Both concepts demonstrated the necessary features of an energy absorber (load-limiter); however, the air bag concept is particularly encouraging because of its light weight. Several seat frame concepts also were investigated {{as a means of}} resisting longitudinal and lateral loads and of guiding the primary vertical stroke of the underseat energy absorber. Further development of a seat system design using the underseat energy absorbers is recommended because they provide greatly enhanced crash survivability as compared with existing general aviation aircraft seats...|$|R

2500|$|The USAF and the Navy {{could only}} agree on swing-wing, two seat, twin engine design features. The USAF wanted a tandem <b>seat</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>for</b> low level penetration, while the Navy wanted a shorter, high {{altitude}} interceptor with {{side by side}} seating. Also, the USAF wanted the <b>aircraft</b> designed <b>for</b> 7.33g with Mach2.5 speed at altitude and Mach1.2 speed at low level with a length of approximately 70ft (21.3 m). The Navy had less strenuous requirements of 6g with Mach2 speed at altitude and high subsonic speed (approx. Mach 0.9) at low level with a length of [...] The Navy also wanted a 48-inch (122cm) radar dish for long range and a maximum takeoff weight of 50,000lb (22,700kg). So McNamara developed a basic set of requirements for TFX based largely on the Air Force's requirements. He changed to a 36-inch (91.4cm) dish for compatibility and increased the maximum weight to approximately [...] for the Air Force version and [...] for the Navy version.
