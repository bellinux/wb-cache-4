5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a <b>subgiant</b> <b>star.</b> As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest <b>subgiant</b> <b>star</b> to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a yellow}} dwarf or yellow <b>subgiant</b> <b>star</b> in the {{constellation}} Phoenix. The star is not {{visible to the naked}} eye, and lies approximately 330 light years away from the Sun. HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet at least three times the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star in a close binary system can {{accumulate}} material from its companion until it ignites and blows off in a thermonuclear explosion, known as a nova. These stars generally brighten by 7 to 16 magnitudes. Nova Circini 1926, also known as X Circini, was observed at magnitude 6.5 on 3 September 1926, before fading and fluctuating between magnitudes 11.7 and 12.5, during 1928, and magnitude 13, in 1929. Nova Circini 1995 (BY Circini) reached an maximum apparent magnitude of 7.2 in January 1995. BW Circini is a low mass X-ray binary system, comprising a black hole of around 8 solar masses and a yellow G0III-G5III <b>subgiant</b> <b>star.</b> X-ray outbursts were recorded in 1987 and 1997, and possibly 1971–72.|$|E

It is a Hot Jupiter that orbits a <b>subgiant</b> <b>star</b> that is more massive, larger, and more diffuse than the Sun is. Kepler-5 was first flagged as the location of a possibly transiting planet, and was reclassified as a Kepler Object of Interest until follow-up observations confirmed the planet's existence and many of its characteristics. The planet's discovery was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010. The planet has approximately twice the mass of Jupiter, and is about 1.5 times larger. It is also fifteen times hotter than Jupiter. Kepler-5b orbits Kepler-5 every 3.5 days at a distance of approximately 0.051 AU (7.6 Gm).|$|E
5|$|The second-brightest star, the yellow-white <b>subgiant</b> <b>star</b> Alpha Trianguli (3.41m) with a close dimmer companion, is {{also known}} as Caput Trianguli or Ras al Muthallath, and is at the apex of the {{triangle}}. It lies around 7 degrees north-northwest of Alpha Arietis. Making up the triangle is Gamma Trianguli, a white main sequence star of spectral type A1Vnn of apparent magnitude 4.00 about 112 light-years from Earth. It is around double the size of and around 33 times as luminous as the sun and rotates rapidly. Like Beta, it is surrounded by a dusty debris disk, which has a radius 80 times the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Lying near Gamma and forming an optical triple system with it are Delta and 7 Trianguli. Delta is a spectroscopic binary system composed of two yellow main sequence stars of similar dimensions to the Sun that lies 35 light-years from Earth. The two stars orbit each other every ten days and are a mere 0.1 AU apart. This system is the closest in the constellation to the Earth. Only of magnitude 5.25, 7 Trianguli is much further away at around 280 light-years distant from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{star system}} is the {{prototype}} {{of a group of}} eclipsing binary stars named Algol variables, though it has a third member to make up what is actually a triple star system. The brightest component is a blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B8V, which is 3.5 times as massive and 180 times as luminous as the Sun. The secondary component is an orange <b>subgiant</b> <b>star</b> of type K0IV that has begun cooling and expanding to 3.5 times the radius of the Sun, and has 4.5 times the luminosity and 80% of its mass. These two are separated by only 0.05 astronomical units (AU)—five percent of the distance between the Earth and Sun; the main dip in brightness arises when the larger fainter companion passes in front of the hotter brighter primary. The tertiary component is a main sequence star of type A7, which is located on average 2.69 AU from the other two stars. AG Persei is another Algol variable in Perseus, whose primary component is a B-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.69. Phi Persei is a double star, although the two components do not eclipse each other. The primary star is a Be star of spectral type B0.5, possibly a giant star, and the secondary companion is likely a stellar remnant. The secondary has a similar spectral type to O-type subdwarfs.|$|E

Kappa Andromedae is a blue white star of spectral type 4.14, that was found to have a substellar companion by direct imaging in 2012. Initially thought to be a planet, it is now thought to be a brown dwarf around 22 times as massive as Jupiter.|$|E
40|$|We present {{rotation}} period measurements for subgiants observed by CoRoT. Interpreting the modulation of stellar light that {{is caused by}} star-spots on the time scale of the rotational period depends on knowing the fundamental stellar parameters. Constraints on the angular momentum distribution can be extracted from the true stellar rotational period. By using models with an internal angular momentum distribution and comparing these with measurements of {{rotation period}}s of <b>subgiant</b> <b>stars</b> we investigate the agreement between theoretical predictions and observational results. With this comparison we can also reduce the global stellar parameter space compatible with the rotational period measurements from subgiant light curves. We can prove that an evolution assuming solid body rotation is incompatible with the direct measurement of the rotational periods of <b>subgiant</b> <b>stars.</b> Measuring the rotation periods relies on two different periodogram procedures, the Lomb-Scargle algorithm and the Plavchan periodogram. Angular momentum evolution models were computed {{to give us the}} expected rotation periods for subgiants, which we compared with measured rotational periods. We find evidence of a sinusoidal signal that is compatible in terms of both phase and amplitude with rotational modulation. Rotation periods were directly measured from light curves for 30 <b>subgiant</b> <b>stars</b> and indicate a range of 30 to 100 d for their rotational periods.

40|$|The seismic data {{provided}} by the satellites CoRoT and Kepler enabled us to probe the internal rotation of thousands of evolved low-mass stars. Subsequently, several studies showed that current stellar evolution codes are unable to reproduce the low core rotation rates observed in these stars. These results indicate that an additional angular momentum transport process is necessary to counteract the spin up due to the core contraction during the post-main sequence evolution. For several candidates, the transport induced by internal gravity waves (IGW) could play a non-negligible role. In this work, we investigate the effect of IGW generated by penetrative convection on the internal rotation of low-mass <b>stars</b> from the <b>subgiant</b> branch {{to the beginning of}} the red giant branch. We show that IGW can efficiently counteract the contraction-driven spin up of the core of <b>subgiant</b> <b>stars</b> if the amplitude of the radial-differential rotation (between the center of the star and the top of the radiative zone) is higher than a threshold value. This threshold depends on the evolutionary stage and is comparable to the differential rotation rates inferred for a sample of <b>subgiant</b> <b>stars</b> observed by the satellite Kepler. Such an agreement can therefore be interpreted as the consequence of a regulation mechanism driven by IGW. This result is obtained under the assumption of a smooth rotation profile and holds true even if a wide range of values is considered for the parameters of the generation model. In contrast, on the red giant branch, we find that IGW remain insufficient, on their own, to explain the observations. We conclude that plume-induced IGW are able to efficiently extract angular momentum from the core of <b>subgiant</b> <b>stars</b> and accordingly have to be taken into account. On the red giant branch, another transport mechanism must likely be invoked. Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A, 22 page...|$|R

40|$|Context: The {{prediction}} of stellar angular diameters from broadband photometry {{plays an important}} role for different applications. In particular, long-baseline interferometry, gravitational microlensing, extrasolar planet transits, and many other observing techniques require accurate predictions of the angular size of stars. These predictions are based on the surface brightness-colour (SBC) relations. Aims: Our goal is to calibrate general-purpose SBC relations using visible colours, the most commonly available data for most stars. Methods: We compiled the existing long-baseline interferometric observations of nearby dwarf and <b>subgiant</b> <b>stars</b> and the corresponding broadband photometry in the Johnson B V and Cousins Rc Ic bands. We then adjusted polynomial SBC models to these data. Results: Due to the presence of spectral features that depend on the effective temperature, the SBC relations are usually not linear for visible colours. We present polynomial fits that can be employed with BVRcIc based colours to predict the limb-darkened angular diameters (i. e. photospheric) of dwarf and <b>subgiant</b> <b>stars</b> with a typical accuracy of 5 %. Conclusions: The derived polynomial relations provide a satisfactory approximation to the observed surface brightness of nearby dwarfs and <b>subgiants.</b> For distant <b>stars,</b> the interstellar reddening should be taken into account, and will usually introduce an additional uncertainty to the predicted angular diameters.

40|$|Tidal {{transfer}} of angular momentum {{is expected to}} cause hot Jupiters to spiral into their host stars. Although the timescale for orbital decay is very uncertain, it should be faster for systems with larger and more evolved stars. Indeed, it is well established that hot Jupiters are found less frequently around <b>subgiant</b> <b>stars</b> than around main-sequence stars. However, the interpretation of this finding has been ambiguous, because the subgiants are also thought to be more massive than the F- and G-type stars that dominate the main-sequence sample. Consequently it has been unclear whether the absence of hot Jupiters is due to tidal destruction, or inhibited formation of those planets around massive stars. Here we show that the Galactic space motions of the planet-hosting <b>subgiant</b> <b>stars</b> demand that on average they be similar in mass to the planet-hosting main-sequence F- and G-type stars. Therefore the two samples are likely to differ only in age, and provide {{a glimpse of the}} same exoplanet population both before and after tidal evolution. As a result, the lack of hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants is clear evidence for their tidal destruction. Questions remain, though, about the interpretation of other reported differences between the planet populations around <b>subgiants</b> and main-sequence <b>stars,</b> such as their period and eccentricity distributions and overall occurrence rates.

The wings of strong, pressure-broadened metal lines were used for determination of stellar surface gravities, which have been compared with gravities derived from Hipparcos parallaxes and isochronic masses. Stellar space velocities have been derived from Hipparcos and Simbad data, and ages and masses were derived with recent isochrones. Only 12 of the stars turned out to be subgiants, i. e. on the "horizontal" part of the evolutionary track between the dwarf- and the giant stages. The abundances derived for the subgiants correspond closely to those of dwarf stars.
