5|$|Thurso's history {{stretches}} back to {{at least}} the era of Norse Orcadian rule in Caithness, which ended conclusively in 1266. Neolithic horned cairns found on nearby Shebster Hill, which were used for burials and rituals, date back about 5000 years. The town was an important Norse port, and has a later history of trade with ports throughout northern Europe until the 19th century. In 1330 Scotland's <b>standard</b> <b>unit</b> of weight was brought in line with that of Thurso at the decree of King David II of Scotland, {{a measure of the}} town's economic importance. Old St Peter's Kirk is said to date from circa 1220 and the time of Caithness Bishop Gilbert Murray, who died in 1245.|$|E

25|$|Of note is that Cavalieri only {{compared}} {{areas to}} areas and volumes to volumes – these always having dimensions, while {{the notion of}} considering an area as consisting of units of area (relative to a <b>standard</b> <b>unit),</b> hence being unitless, appears to have originated with Wallis; Wallis studied fractional and negative powers, and the alternative to treating the computed values as unitless numbers was to interpret fractional and negative dimensions.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{with the}} general {{run-down}} of slam door trains, {{it was decided to}} reform some of the 4Vop units by swapping one driving trailer with that from a <b>standard</b> <b>unit.</b> The new hybrid units were reclassified as Class 423/8 (or 4Vip) and renumbered in the range 3813-3844. This was to give all units some 1st-class seating, thus making diagramming of units easier. But in the event only eight units were reformed, namely nos. 3813/14/21/22/41-44.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the United States Dollar refers to more than 240 years since the Continental Congress of the United States {{authorized}} the issuance of Continental Currency in 1775. On April 2, 1792, the United States Congress created the United States dollar as the country's <b>standard</b> <b>unit</b> of money.

25|$|It was the <b>standard</b> <b>unit</b> {{of silver}} coinage at most ancient Greek mints, {{and the name}} obol was used to {{describe}} a coin that was one-sixth of a drachma. The notion that drachma derived from the word for fistful was recorded by Herakleides of Pontos (387–312BC) who was informed by the priests of Heraion that Pheidon, king of Argos, dedicated rod-shaped obeloi to Heraion. Similar information about Pheidon's obeloi was also recorded at the Parian Chronicle.|$|E
25|$|Although {{not defined}} by the pendulum, the final length chosen for the metre, 10−7 of the pole-to-equator {{meridian}} arc, {{was very close to}} the length of the seconds pendulum (0.9937 m), within 0.63%. Although no reason for this particular choice was given at the time, it was probably to facilitate the use of the seconds pendulum as a secondary standard, as was proposed in the official document. So the modern world's <b>standard</b> <b>unit</b> of length is certainly closely linked historically with the seconds pendulum.|$|E

25|$|Thomson {{did more}} than any other {{electrician}} up to his time in introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of William Snow Harris were in accordance with the laws of Coulomb. In the Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences for 1857 he published a description of his new divided ring electrometer, based on the old electroscope of Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger and he introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the current balance, also known as the Kelvin balance or Ampere balance (SiC), for the precise specification of the ampere, the <b>standard</b> <b>unit</b> of electric current. From around 1880 he was aided by the electrical engineer Magnus Maclean FRSE in his electrical experiments.|$|E

500|$|Communication of {{metrological}} {{information was}} one of the issues facing mid-seventeenth century savants; many discussed the possibility of scholarly communication using a so-called [...] "universal measure" [...] that was not tied to a particular national system of measurement. Mouton's ideas attracted interest at the time; Picard in his work Mesure de la Terre (1671) and Huygens in his work Horologium Oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum (1673) both proposing that a <b>standard</b> <b>unit</b> of length be tied to the beat frequency of a pendulum.|$|E
