500|$|On April 15, 1923, at New York City's Rivoli Theater, {{came the}} first {{commercial}} screening of motion pictures with sound-on-film, the future standard: a set of shorts {{under the banner of}} De Forest Phonofilms, accompanying a silent feature. That June, De Forest entered into an extended legal battle with an employee, Freeman Harrison Owens, for title to one of the crucial Phonofilm patents. Although De Forest ultimately won the case in the courts, Owens is today recognized as a central innovator in the field. The following year, De Forest's studio released {{the first commercial}} dramatic film shot as a talking picture—the two-reeler Love's Old Sweet Song, directed by J. Searle Dawley and featuring Una Merkel. However, phonofilm's stock in trade was not original dramas but celebrity documentaries, popular music acts, and comedy performances. President Calvin Coolidge, opera singer Abbie Mitchell, and vaudeville stars such as Phil Baker, Ben Bernie, Eddie Cantor and Oscar Levant appeared in the firm's pictures. Hollywood remained suspicious, even fearful, of the new technology. As Photoplay editor James Quirk put it in March 1924, [...] "Talking pictures are perfected, <b>says</b> <b>Dr.</b> Lee De Forest. So is castor oil." [...] De Forest's process continued to be used through 1927 in the United States for dozens of short Phonofilms; in the UK it was employed a few years longer for both shorts and features by British Sound Film Productions, a subsidiary of British Talking Pictures, which purchased the primary Phonofilm assets. By the end of 1930, the Phonofilm business would be liquidated.|$|E

It is a charming scene, and we may {{reasonably}} assume that there was reality in the salutations. Such civilities of intercourse between proprietors and their laborers are still, <b>says</b> <b>Dr.</b> W. M. Thomson, common in the East. [...] "The Lord be with you is merely the [...] "Allah makum!" [...] of ordinary parlance; and so too the response, The Lord bless thee" [...] ('The Land and the Book,' p.648). Modern Moslems are particular {{in the matter of}} salutations. [...] "Abuhurairah reports that he heard Mohammed say, You will not enter into paradise until you have faith, and you will not complete your faith until you love one another, and that is shown by. making salaam to friends and strangers" [...] (Kitto's 'Bible Illustrations,' in loc.).|$|E

[...] "The harvest upon the mountains," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Dr.</b> Robinson, [...] "ripens of course later than in the plains of the Jordan and the sea-coast. The barley-harvest precedes the wheat-harvest by a week or fortnight. On the 4th and 5th of June the people of Hebron were just beginning to gather their wheat; on the 11th and 12th the threshing-floors on the Mount of Olives were in full operation. We had already seen the harvest in the same stage of progress on the plains of Gaza on the 19th of May; while at Jericho, on the 12th of May, the threshing-floors had nearly completed their work" [...] ('Biblical Researches,' vol. 2. p.99). According to the Midrash, {{from the beginning of the}} one, to {{the end of the}} other, were three months; though it may be, they were gathered in sooner: indeed from the passover to Pentecost were seven weeks, which was the difference between the beginning of one harvest, and the beginning of the other.|$|E
2500|$|Many policy analysts {{consider}} literacy {{rates as}} a crucial measure to enhance a region's human capital. This claim is made {{on the grounds that}} literate people can be trained less expensively than illiterate people, generally have a higher socio-economic status and enjoy better health and employment prospects. If women are these illiterate people, that makes them even more disposable to their economy. Policy makers also argue that literacy for women increases job opportunities and access to higher education. Although it is often viewed that a woman working in the home benefits her family, it puts a strain on the whole community as education is {{one of the keys to}} success and being able to prosper. According to Ojo, women in Nigeria are harder-hit than men by poverty due to the lack of emphasis placed on female education, and the prevalence of early marriage which tend to further impoverish women, and subject them to statutory discrimination. The most important ingredient of employment opportunity is education, especially higher education. If employment opportunities are different, standards of living, life expectancies and other parameters of existence and of well-being, will be different. [...] "For Nigeria to achieve the goal of being among the largest 20 economies in the world, she must rapidly educate the children, most of all, the girls. Educating girls is known to be the basis for sound economic and social development. Educating girls produces mothers who are educated and who will in turn educate their children, care for their families and provide their children with adequate nutrition," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Dr.</b> Robert Limlim, UNICEF’s Deputy Representative. [...] "Therefore educating girls translates to better health for the children, reduction in child morbidity and mortality, thus triggering off a snowball effect of achieving all the other MDGs in a sustainable manner." ...|$|E
