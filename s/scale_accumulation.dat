40|$|Water in {{one form}} or another is present within countless {{manufacturing}} processes. In an oil extraction process, the volume of water is typically equal to the produced hydrocarbons and can even exceed the amount of extracted oil significantly. The large volumes of water, known as produced water, inflict problems. These problems are mainly related to dissolved ions that produced water is carrying. In oil production and several other industries, where pipelines are used to transport water, in suitable conditions, ions within the water will precipitate and form scale. Within a pipeline, scale may accumulate and disturb the liquid flow through the pipeline. In order to assess the scale potential, this thesis develops a fluorescence based analytical method for identifying components that can induce scale within produced water. In this thesis, the studied water samples are called produced water, which is an oil extraction by-product. This thesis examines the technique of time-resolved photoluminescence to develop a non-specific assay method for identifying several ions that may cause <b>scale</b> <b>accumulation</b> in production pipelines. The developed method was used to analyse both synthetic and field produced water samples. The results of this thesis indicate that thorough study of suitable assay components enables the possibility to create a measurement protocol to evaluate ion concentrations in a produced water sample. The quantification of ion concentrations allows the evaluation of scale potential in a production pipeline. This evaluation can be used to assess the need for treating chemical to prevent <b>scale</b> <b>accumulation</b> within the pipelines...|$|E

The result is a non-uniform layer, and hence a varying thermal resistance over the area covered with scale. Consequently, a non-uniform heat flux distribution results over the heat transfer surface.

The calculated heat flux is used to calculate fouling resistances from measured temperatures.

Scaling {{is thought to be}} a compensatory response that homeostatically controls spiking activity levels in the cell or network. Previously, we observed GABAergic synaptic scaling in embryonic spinal motoneurons following in vivo blockade of either spiking activity or GABAA receptors (GABAARs). We had determined that activity blockade triggered upward GABAergic <b>scaling</b> through chloride <b>accumulation,</b> thus increasing the driving force for these currents. To determine whether chloride accumulation also underlies GABAergic scaling following GABAAR blockade we have developed a new technique. We expressed a genetically encoded chloride-indicator, Clomeleon, in the embryonic chick spinal cord, which provides a non-invasive fast measure of intracellular chloride. Using this technique we now show that chloride <b>accumulation</b> underlies GABAergic <b>scaling</b> following blockade of either spiking activity or the GABAAR. The finding that GABAAR blockade and activity blockade trigger scaling via a common mechanism supports our hypothesis that activity blockade reduces GABAAR activation, which triggers synaptic scaling. In addition, Clomeleon imaging demonstrated the time course and widespread nature of GABAergic <b>scaling</b> through chloride <b>accumulation,</b> as it was also observed in spinal interneurons. This suggests that homeostatic <b>scaling</b> via chloride <b>accumulation</b> is a common feature in many neuronal classes within the embryonic spinal cord and opens the possibility that this process may occur throughout the nervou...|$|R

Concentration of these heavy metal(loid) s in soil has increased drastically {{over the last}} three decades, thus posing risk to the environment and human health. Some technologies have long been in use to remediate the hazardous heavy metal(loid) s. Conventional remediation methods for heavy metal(loid) s are generally based on physical, chemical and biological approaches, which may be used in combination with one another to clean-up heavy metal(loid) contaminated soils to an acceptable and safe level.

40|$|This paper reviews past {{work and}} {{presents}} new data to evaluate how changes in similarity parameters affect ice shapes and how closely scale {{values of the}} parameters should match reference values. Experimental ice shapes presented are from tests by various researchers in the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel. The parameters reviewed are the modified inertia parameter (which determines the stagnation collection efficiency), accumulation parameter, freezing fraction, Reynolds number, and Weber number. It was demonstrated that a good match of scale and reference ice shapes could sometimes be achieved even when values of the modified inertia parameter did not match precisely. Consequently, there can be some flexibility in setting scale droplet size, which is the test condition determined from the modified inertia parameter. A recommended guideline is that the modified inertia parameter be chosen so that the scale stagnation collection efficiency is within 10 percent of the reference value. The <b>scale</b> <b>accumulation</b> parameter and freezing fraction should also be within 10 percent of their reference values.

In this study, we attempt to reconstruct and connect the processes that lead to long-term C accumulation in boreal lakes. These include the rate of POC sedimentation {{in the water column}} and sediment metabolism operating at a temporal scale of weeks to months, organic C accumulation in the top sediment layers integrated over scales of tens of years, and long-term organic C burial in lake sediment integrated over hundreds to thousands of years. The sinking POC flux was tenfold higher than the short-term sediment C accumulation rates in all systems, and we found no direct relationship between this downward C flux and either the short-term or longterm C accumulation rates. However, the resulting C burial efficiency (which ranged from 5 to 62 %) was strongly related to lake shape, which ultimately constrains the time freshly deposited material is exposed to oxygen and thereby regulates the fraction of the carbon sinking flux that is mineralized back to the atmosphere or permanently buried in the sediments. Small and deep lakes act as more efficient C sinks than large and flat lakes.

40|$|The world {{distribution}} of current account balances {{has been steadily}} drifting away from “normality” since 1997. This puzzling development has occurred in parallel with large <b>scale</b> <b>accumulation</b> of official foreign reserve assets in emerging Asia and commodity exporting countries, and a growing role of portfolio flows in financing the US external deficit. The theoretical toolbox {{that was used to}} understand “old puzzles” of international macroeconomics may still be relevant to address these new puzzles, {{to the extent that it}} focuses more specifically on liquidity aspects: uneven supply of liquid assets, borrowing constraints, and externalities related to financial infrastructures that foster market liquidity. The paper discusses how these various features have been introduced in the most recent literature on global imbalances. One aspect that may require further examination is the role of fi nancial market liquidity as a “public good externality”: in the absence of appropriate provision of such a public good in emerging economies, reserve accumulation may be seen as an attempt to import the “public services” benefi ts of holding liquid “risk-free” assets. This may in turn possibly result in a form of “congestion” if US dollar reserve accumulation outpaces the issuance of US Treasuries or equivalent securities. Large reserve holders have thus turned to a wider range of asset classes, including asset-backed securities whose liquidity has all but vanished in the course of recent fi nancial market turbulences. These developments could therefore affect the fi nancing conditions of the US current account deficit, and undermine some of its structural determinants. ...|$|E

To promote bulk phase struvite precipitation and minimize cathode scaling, a two-chamber MEC was designed with a fluidized bed to produce suspended particles and inhibit scale formation on the cathode surface. MEC operation elevated the cathode pH to between 8. 3 and 8. 7 under continuous flow conditions. Soluble phosphorus removal using digester effluent ranged from 70 to 85 % with current generation, compared to 10 - 20 % for the control (open circuit conditions). At low current densities (≤ 2 mA/m 2), scouring of the cathode by fluidized particles prevented <b>scale</b> <b>accumulation</b> over a period of 8 days. There was nearly identical removal of soluble phosphorus and magnesium from solution, and an equimolar composition in the collected solids, supporting phosphorus removal by struvite formation. At an applied voltage of 1. 0 V, energy consumption from the power supply and pumping (0. 2 Wh/L, 7. 5 Wh/g-P) was significantly less than that needed by other struvite formation methods based on pH adjustment such as aeration and NaOH addition. In the anode chamber, current generation led to COD oxidation (1. 1 - 2. 1 g-COD/L-d) and ammonium removal (7 - 12 mM) from digestate amended with 1 g/L of sodium acetate.

This paper gives a survey of density based clustering algorithms. DBSCAN [15] is a base algorithm for density based clustering techniques.

Based on the previous geological research results, outcrop section of the Datangpo Fm, Nanhua System, at the southeastern margin of the Sichuan Basin was observed and the samples taken from the source rocks were tested and analyzed in terms of their organic geochemistry and organic petrology. It is shown that high-quality black shale source rocks of the Datangpo Fm are developed in the tensional background at the southeastern margin of the Sichuan Basin between two glacial ages, i. e., Gucheng and Nantuo ages in the Nanhua Period. Their thickness is 16 – 180  m and mineral compositions are mainly clay minerals and clastic quartz. Besides, shale in the Datangpo Fm is of high-quality sapropel type source rock with high abundance at an over-mature stage, and it is characterized by low pristane/phytane ratios (0. 32 – 0. 83), low gammacerane abundance, high-abundance tricyclic terpane and higher-content C 27 and C 29 gonane, indicating that biogenetic compositions are mainly algae and microbes in a strong reducing environment with low salinity.
