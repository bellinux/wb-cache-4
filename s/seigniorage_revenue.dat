50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{currency}} substitution {{leads to the}} loss of <b>seigniorage</b> <b>revenue,</b> the loss of monetary policy autonomy, and the loss of the exchange rate instruments. Seigniorage revenues are the profits generated when monetary authorities issue currency. When adopting a foreign currency as legal tender, a monetary authority needs to withdraw the domestic currency and give up future <b>seigniorage</b> <b>revenue.</b> The country loses the rights to its autonomous monetary and exchange rate policies, even in times of financial emergency. For example, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan has stated that the central bank considers the effects of its decisions only on the US economy. In a full currency substituted economy, exchange rates are indeterminate and monetary authorities cannot devalue the currency. In an economy with high currency substitution, devaluation policy is less effective in changing the real exchange rate because of significant pass-through effects to domestic prices. However, the cost of losing an independent monetary policy exists when domestic monetary authorities can commit an effective counter-cyclical monetary policy, stabilizing the business cycle. This cost depends adversely on the correlation between the business cycle of the client country (the economy with currency substitution) and the business cycle of the anchor country. In addition, monetary authorities in economies with currency substitution diminish the liquidity assurance to their banking system.|$|E
50|$|The Friedman {{rule has}} been shown to be the welfare maximizing {{monetary}} policy in many economic models of money. It {{has been shown}} to be optimal in monetary economies with monopolistic competition (Ireland, 1996) and, under certain circumstances, in a variety of monetary economies where the government levies other distorting taxes. However, there do exist several notable cases where deviation from the Friedman Rule becomes optimal. These include economies with decreasing returns to scale; economies with imperfect competition where the government does not either fully tax monopoly profits or set the tax equal to the labor income tax; economies with tax evasion; economies with sticky prices; and economies with downward nominal wage rigidity. While normally deviations from the Friedman Rule are typically small, if there is a significant foreign demand for a nation's currency, such as in the United States, the optimal rate of inflation is found to deviate significantly from what is called for by Friedman Rule in order to extract <b>seigniorage</b> <b>revenue</b> from foreign residents. In the case of the United States, where over half of all U.S. dollars are held overseas, the optimal rate of inflation is found to be anywhere from 2 to 10%, whereas the Friedman Rule would call for deflation of almost 4%.|$|E
5000|$|Banking {{has been}} more {{regulated}} in some times and places than others, and some times and places it has hardly been regulated at all, giving some experiences of more or less free banking. Free banking systems have existed in more than 60 countries. The first system of competitive issue of notes began more than 1,000 years ago in China (see below). Free banking was widespread in the 19th century and the early 20th century. [...] lists most currently known episodes of free banking and discusses in some depth a number of them, including Canada, Colombia, Foochow, France, and Ireland. Monetary arrangements with monopoly issue of notes, including government treasury issue, currency boards, and central banking, replaced all episodes of free banking by the mid 20th century. There were several reasons for the demise of free banking: (1) Economic theories claiming the superiority of central banking. (2) Desire to imitate the institutions of more advanced economies, especially Great Britain. The Bank of England was the model for many later central banks, even outside the British Empire. (3) Desire of national governments to collect <b>seigniorage</b> (<b>revenue</b> from issue) from note issue. (4) Financial crises in some free banking systems that created demands to replace free banking with another system that advocates hoped would have fewer problems.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates an {{incomplete}} markets economy {{in which the}} saving behavior of a continuum of infinitely lived agents is influenced by precautionary saving motives and borrowing constraints. Two types of assets (interest bearing IOUs and money) enhance the liquidity of agents by providing an additional means of smoothing consumption and by effectively loosening borrowing constraints. Money is valued because of a timing friction in the bond market. In particular, the bond market closes before agents observe their idiosyncratic productivity shock. High inflation rates will transfer resources from agents with high endowments to those holding bonds which can increase welfare. However, in an inflationary environment, agents economize on money holdings, causing a reduction in welfare. Furthermore, different monetary growth rates will imply different <b>seigniorage</b> <b>revenues</b> for government. The level of <b>seigniorage</b> <b>revenues</b> will determine the interest rate on government bonds, and the effective borrowing constraint. This study quantitatively examines the welfare implications of different monetary growth rates. Initial results indicate that higher inflation rates increase welfare. ...|$|R

The other major contribution to government revenues comes from printing money, namely the seigniorage.

Consequently, there exists a substitution effect between deforestation rates and seigniorage. Empirical evidence for a panel of countries seems to support our theoretical conclusion.
