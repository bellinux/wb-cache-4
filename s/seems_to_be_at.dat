This flat belongs to a Joanna Rupelford, who never <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> home (to the point where the labels are still on the pans). In the conversation, it is disclosed that Rosie is an actress with little success behind her (her only role so far being a rabbit in a miserable touring children's production), and no boyfriend, and that she is openly desperate for both. Her one hope is that she is down to the last two for a big role as Jane Eyre, but just after Annette leaves, Rosie receives a call from her agent tell her the part went to the other girl.|$|E

Handlen {{felt that the}} episode was not entirely cohesive and that its ending was somewhat disappointing, but felt that overall the episode's imagery made up for this—summing up this idea by saying [...] "Millennium often <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> its best when sense is a secondary consideration". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, noting that its [...] "atmospheric elements do not quite {{add up to a}} cohesive whole". Gibron felt that this resulted in [...] "an episode that feels like the first half of a bad b-movie". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, awarded [...] "Beware of the Dog" [...] one-and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman felt the episode was so similar to The X-Files that it gave the impression that Millennium had [...] "lost its own identity". He found that the script contained [...] "enough wit in the dialogue" [...] but that its plot seemed too [...] "vague and elliptical". Writing for the Star Tribune, Bill Ward felt that the episode featured a [...] "lighter" [...] tone than usual, comparing it to The X-Files. Ward described the episode as taking [...] "some nice turns en route to an ambivalent semiresolution".|$|E

2500|$|Propp {{broke up}} fairy tales into {{sections}}. Through these sections {{he was able}} to define the tale into a series of sequences that occurred within the Russian fairytale. Usually there is an initial situation, after which the tale usually takes the following 31 functions. Propp used this method to decipher Russian folklore and fairy tales. First of all, there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least two distinct types of structural analysis in folklore. One is the [...] "syntagmatic" [...] manner of assessment (as termed following Lévi-Strauss 1964: 312), covering Propp's Morphology among others in which the structure of a piece folklore is described in the chronological order of the linear events it comprises. If a tale consists of elements A to Z, the structure of the tale is thus delineated in the same sequence. The other type of analysis is termed [...] "paradigmatic" [...] (cf. Sebag 1963:75), and describes instead the underlying pattern (usually based upon a priori binary principle of opposition) of the folkloric text, independent of chronology. Elements of the plot may be taken out of their [...] "given" [...] order and regrouped in various analytic schemes.|$|E
