25|$|Hemipepsis ustulata larva feed on tarantulas {{that are}} paralyzed and {{captured}} by the adult wasp. Adult wasps spend lengthy periods of time patrolling, actively searching for prey on the ground. Adult wasps feed on nectar, and they visit flowers and flowering plants during the day. Popular sources of nectar include milkweeds (Asclepias) and western <b>soapberry</b> <b>trees</b> (Sapindus saponaria).|$|R
50|$|In India, {{a variety}} of herbs and their {{extracts}} were used as shampoos since ancient times. A very effective early shampoo was made by boiling Sapindus with dried Indian gooseberry (aamla) {{and a few other}} herbs, using the strained extract. Sapindus, also known as soapberries or soapnuts, is called Ksuna (Sanskrit: क्षुण) in ancient Indian texts and its fruit pulp contains saponins which are a natural surfactant. The extract of <b>soapberries,</b> a tropical <b>tree</b> widespread in India, creates a lather which Indian texts called phenaka (Sanskrit: फेनक). It leaves the hair soft, shiny and manageable. Other products used for hair cleansing were shikakai (Acacia concinna), soapnuts (Sapindus), hibiscus flowers, ritha (Sapindus mukorossi) and arappu (Albizzia amara). Guru Nanak, the founding prophet and the first Guru of Sikhism, made references to <b>soapberry</b> <b>tree</b> and soap in 16th century.|$|R
50|$|The Saharan Zone {{has little}} vegetation. Some mountainous areas with a water source support small-leafed and spiny plants and scrub grasses {{suitable}} for camels. Because seeds of desert plants can remain dormant for many years, dunes often sprout sparse vegetation after a rain. In depressions between dunes, {{where the water}} is nearer the surface, some flora—including acacias, <b>soapberry</b> <b>trees,</b> capers, and swallowwort—may be found. Saline areas have {{a particular kind of}} vegetation, mainly chenopods, which are adapted to high salt concentrations in the soil. Cultivation is limited to oases, where date palms are used to shade other crops from the sun.|$|R
25|$|Adult {{tarantula}} hawks are nectarivorous. The {{consumption of}} fermented fruit sometimes intoxicates {{them to the}} point that flight becomes difficult. While the wasps tend to be most active in daytime summer months, they tend to avoid high temperatures. The male tarantula hawk does not hunt; instead, it feeds off the flowers of milkweeds, western <b>soapberry</b> <b>trees,</b> or mesquite trees (females feed on these same plants, as well). Male tarantula hawks have been observed practicing a behavior called hill-topping, in which they sit atop tall plants and watch for passing females ready to reproduce. Females are not very aggressive, in that they are hesitant to sting, but the sting is extraordinarily painful.|$|R

50|$|Serinethinae is a {{subfamily}} of the hemipteran family Rhopalidae, sometimes {{known as}} soapberry bugs. They are brightly colored seed-eaters, comprising three genera and about sixty-five species. These bugs are specialists on {{plants in the}} soapberry family (Sapindaceae), which includes maples, balloon vines, and <b>soapberry</b> <b>trees,</b> among others. Seeds of the plants are the main resource used by adults for reproduction and nymphs for growth and development. Their diversity {{is the result of}} an adaptive radiation on these plants, whose cyanide-based defenses the bugs have overcome. The New World genus Jadera consists of nearly 20 species that range naturally from Kansas to southern Argentina. Boisea consists of 4 species, 1 in Africa, 1 in India, and 2 in North America, including the well-known box elder bug, Boisea trivittata. Leptocoris includes more than 40 species, in Oceania, Australia, Asia, and Africa.|$|R
40|$|Host range expansion, or {{adaptation}} of insects to new hosts, is a worldwide phenomenon {{that has been}} observed repeatedly and extensively; still, the genetic mechanisms behind host-shifts are not well known. In this thesis I focus on the morphological and genetic variation associated with two recent anthropogenic host shifts in two species of soapberry bug, Leptocoris tagalicus and Jadera haematoloma [...] First, I investigated the host-associated genetic differentiation in Australian Leptocoris soapberry bugs, as determined by genome-wide variation patterns. My results show that specimens feeding on two naturalized Neotropical balloon vines, (Cardiospermum halicacabum and C. grandiflorum) have longer “beaks” that those living on the native trees Atalaya hemiglauca and Alectryon tomentosus. Genetic analyses of mitochondrial haplotypes and amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers indicate that the lineage of bugs on the annual vine C. halicacabum, is intermediate between two subspecies of L. tagalicus found on the native hosts. Moreover, where this annual vine and whitewood tree (A. hemiglauca) co-occur, the morphology and genomic composition of the bugs {{are similar to those}} occurring in allopatry. These results show that hybridization provided the genetic elements underlying the strongly differentiated ‘halicacabum bugs’. In contrast, the bugs feeding on the recently introduced perennial balloon vine (C. grandiflorum) showed no evidence of admixture, and are genetically indistinguishable from the nearby populations on a native host. Second I used a candidate gene approach to investigate the molecular genetic basis of host-adaptation in Floridian populations of the red-shouldered soapberry bug, J. haematoloma. While in <b>Southern</b> Florida <b>soapberry</b> bugs have long beaks to penetrate the large fruits of the native balloon vine (C. corindum), in northern and central Florida, bugs have evolved to feed on an introduced, flat-podded host, the Taiwanese Golden rain tree (Koelreuteria elegans). Specifically I focused on five genes because of their potential role in host preference (orco), “beak” length (Dll, dac, hth) and the adaptation to the toxic compounds of host-plants (Na+/K+-ATPase). My results suggest these genes are highly conserved in this system, and that genetic variation at these loci is not associated with the different host-plants...|$|R
