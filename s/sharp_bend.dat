5|$|A new bridge, the Greenville Bridge, {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} further downriver from the <b>sharp</b> <b>bend.</b> It opened in 2010. In 2011, work began to remove the Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Battersea Bridge is a five-span {{arch bridge}} with {{cast-iron}} girders and granite piers crossing the River Thames in London, England. It is situated on a <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> in the river, and links Battersea {{south of the}} river with Chelsea to the north. The bridge replaced a ferry service that had operated near the site {{since at least the}} middle of the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself, there are 19drop {{structures}}, and while doing nothing to reduce the creek's rainy season surges, the drop structures were constructed to mitigate the catastrophic erosion {{that came with the}} creek's increased flow. Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon, a major bottleneck lies {{at the south end of}} the canyon where a <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> in the creek is constricted between crowded development and steep cliffs. In flooding events, this area generally sustains heavy damage.|$|E

5|$|With {{river traffic}} increasing, damage from barge {{collisions}} increased. By 1972, the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges {{than any other}} bridge on the Mississippi. The bridge was located close to a <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> in the Mississippi; towboats and barges had difficulty making the sharp turn and regaining their course in time to avoid a collision with the bridge. Over the years many {{have not been able}} to make the turn quickly and have hit it. The bridge had become a danger to river traffic.|$|E
5|$|The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, {{the first}} bridge {{to connect the}} two towns, had become {{functionally}} obsolete. Its narrow road had only two lanes with no shoulders. Because of its location near a <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> in the Mississippi River, the bridge had become a hazard to river traffic; barges and towboats frequently collided with it. In 1994, a study concluded that a new bridge was needed and the old one should be torn down. Construction was begun in 2001 and the new bridge opened in 2010. In 2011, the process of removing the old bridge began.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1972, {{while driving}} {{home from a}} session of work on his injured {{shoulder}} with the Stoke physiotherapist, Banks lost control of his new Ford Consul (a re-badged Ford Granada Mk 1) car, which {{ended up in a}} ditch. He had attempted to overtake a car on a <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> and collided with an oncoming Austin A60 van. He was taken to the North Staffordshire Hospital and during an operation received 200 stitches in his face and over 100 micro-stitches inside the socket of his right eye, and was told the chances of saving the sight in his eye were 50–50. His sight never returned, and as the loss of binocular vision severely limited his abilities as a goalkeeper, he retired from professional football the following summer.|$|E

5|$|Muncy Creek {{begins in}} southeastern Laporte Township, Sullivan County, near its border with Davidson Township, Sullivan County. The creek flows {{southwest}} and then west {{for a short}} distance before reaching the border between Laporte Township and Davidson Township. It then turns southwest as it begins to follow this border. Shortly afterwards it turns northwest and begins to flow into a valley, then turns west and begins receiving very short tributaries from both sides. Examples of these include Rock Run and Lopez Pond Branch. After picking up Peters Creek, one such tributary, Muncy Creek turns southwest and passes the community of Nordmont, where the tributary Elklick Run flows into it. The creek then turns southwest and later west. Deep Hollow Run then enters the creek, which heads south away from the Laporte Township/Davidson Township border. Upon leaving behind the Laporte Township/Davidson Township border, the creek enters Davidson Township and heads west-southwest, passing a gauging station. After several miles, it reaches the community of Sonestown, where the tributary Big Run flows into it from the north. Muncy Creek then makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> south and begins flowing parallel to U.S. Route 220. After a few miles, it passes the community of Muncy Valley and makes a sharp turn south, exiting Davidson Township.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the five}} spans {{of the current}} bridge are far wider than the {{nineteen}} spans of the original bridge, Battersea Bridge's location on a <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> in the river still presents a hazard to navigation. In 1948, the MV Delta jammed under the bridge, and its master Hendrikus Oostring suffered broken arms {{and needed to be}} rescued from the smashed wheelhouse. On 23 March 1950, the collier John Hopkinson collided with the central pier, causing serious structural damage, leaving the tram tracks as the only element holding the bridge together. The London County Council was concerned that the entire structure would collapse and closed the bridge until January 1951. Tram services in the area were withdrawn on 30 September 1950, so when the bridge was reopened the tram tracks were lifted. Another serious incident took place on 21 September 2005, when the James Prior, a 200-ton barge, collided with the bridge, causing serious structural damage costing over £500,000 to repair. The bridge was closed to all motor vehicles other than buses while repairs were carried out, causing severe traffic congestion; it eventually reopened on 16 January 2006. Brian King, the master of the James Prior, was formally cleared of navigating without due care and attention in 2008, when the judge in the case injured his back and was unable to proceed, and prosecutors decided not to re-present the case.|$|E
25|$|The only virgin trees left {{untouched}} were on steep ground {{above the}} Laurel Hill Creek that was apparently {{too difficult for}} the loggers to reach. The Hemlock Trail now winds through this ancient stand of trees, and is accessible from one end at the <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> on Buck Run Road, and from the other {{at the head of}} the lake.|$|E
40|$|Meandering rivers {{are complex}} natural {{systems that are}} studied intensively, {{but there is little}} {{knowledge}} about <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> in meandering rivers. Compared to gentle <b>bends,</b> <b>sharp</b> meander <b>bends</b> often alter the location of the strongest and weakest flow, because of the occurrence of flow separation on the inner bend bank and in some outer banks, also called recirculation eddies. The frequency of the occurrence of recirculations is high, which is why research is needed to improve the knowledge about the effects on morphology, flow direction, flow velocity, and erosion patterns. For this thesis both field and lab work was carried out. The field work was performed in a small river in the Netherlands, the Groenlose Slinge; the lab work was done in the ‘Total Environment Simulator’, which is a flume in Hull, England. In the latter a channel was constructed with fixed banks, containing two <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> alternately with a fixed gravel bed and a mobile sand bed. For all three situations, fixed bed with fixed banks, mobile bed with fixed banks and mobile bed with mobile banks, morphology is mapped and in the lab surface water flow velocity and direction is measured. In all three situations recirculations are found; in the investigated lab bends only one recirculation type occurs per bend, in the field bends two types occur in one bend. At the same locations of the recirculations types dead zones are often discerned, also when recirculations do not develop. In this research it is found that bend tightness and also flow velocity and bank erosion influence the occurrence of recirculation. The trend in Europe is to renaturalise rivers; this research increased the knowledge needed for implementing <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> in these rivers. Besides that, this research expands the knowledge of <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> in meandering rivers for further research...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRoad cycling {{races in}} general, but {{particularly}} criteriums (short circuit race), have {{a considerable number}} of bends along the race course. <b>Sharp</b> <b>bends</b> force the rider to decelerate in order to retain the grip between the tires and the road. This study focused on how these course bends influence the optimal pacing strategy in road cycling. For this purpose, we used a numerical model that simulates cycling by solving the equation of motion. The optimisation was carried out with the Method of Moving Asymptotes, constrained with the Margaria-Morton model for human energetics and a separate course bend constraint. The results showed that <b>sharp</b> course <b>bends</b> greatly affect the pacing strategy and finishing time. The average power output and the average speed decreased with a decrease in the curve radius. Moreover, the kinetic energy lost due to braking in <b>sharp</b> course <b>bends</b> {{is likely to be the}} crucial mechanism affecting the finishing time. Therefore, we believe that the outcome of races that contain <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> may be strongly dependent on the athlete's pacing strategy...|$|R
25|$|In case of {{a sudden}} {{reduction}} of pipe diameter, without streamlining, the flow {{is not able to}} follow the <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> into the narrower pipe. As a result, there is flow separation, creating recirculating separation zones at the entrance of the narrower pipe. The main flow is contracted between the separated flow areas, and later on expands again to cover the full pipe area.|$|E
25|$|Recklessness {{among the}} boatmen was common. Many {{accidents}} {{were due to}} excessive speed. Aqueduct #3 (Catoctin) had a <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> at the upstream end, had been {{the site of a}} number of collisions from boatmen going too fast. In July 1855, a freight boat collided with a packet boat which sank. One of the most frequent problems was careless boatmen in their rush to lock through, hitting lock gates.|$|E

Blow flies are {{about the size of}} a house fly or a little larger, many are metallic blue or green. Key characteristics of this species include black gena, mostly white calypteres and anterior thoracic spiracles that appear to be orange yellow due to being surrounded by bright orange setae.|$|E

50|$|The railway {{forms an}} {{ascending}} spiral southwards, with two relatively short tunnels, {{a circle and}} three hairpin bends. From the north, trains pass Raurimu before going round a 180° bend to the left in a horseshoe curve, climbing above the track on which they have just travelled. Two <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> to the right follow, after which the line passes through two short tunnels. Trains then complete a full circle, crossing over the longer of the two tunnels through which they have just passed, before continuing towards Wellington. 2 km further on the line has two further <b>sharp</b> <b>bends,</b> {{to the right and}} then to the left.|$|R

25|$|The tensor tympani {{arises from}} the {{cartilaginous}} portion of the auditory tube, and the adjoining {{part of the great}} wing of the sphenoid, {{as well as from the}} osseous canal in which it is contained. Passing backward through the canal, it ends in a slender tendon which enters the tympanic cavity, makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> around the extremity of the septum, known as the processus cochleariformis, and is inserted into the neck of the malleus, near its root.|$|E
25|$|When TBP binds to a TATA box {{within the}} DNA, it distorts the DNA by {{inserting}} amino acid side-chains between base pairs, partially unwinding the helix, and doubly kinking it. The distortion is accomplished through {{a great amount}} of surface contact between the protein and DNA. TBP binds with the negatively charged phosphates in the DNA backbone through positively charged lysine and arginine amino acid residues. The <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> in the DNA is produced through projection of four bulky phenylalanine residues into the minor groove. As the DNA bends, its contact with TBP increases, thus enhancing the DNA-protein interaction.|$|E

On October 29, 2012, the island experienced severe damage and loss of life along with the destruction of many homes during Hurricane Sandy.|$|E
25|$|South Avenue ends at this point, leaving NY9D to turn {{northwest}} onto East Main Street. The highway follows East Main Street {{for several}} blocks through the central village district before crossing Wappinger Creek, {{which serves as}} {{the boundary between the}} towns of Wappinger and Poughkeepsie. Past the creek, the route changes names to West Main Street and makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>bend</b> to the north, passing the Bain Commercial Building and running alongside Wappinger Lake for a short distance before leaving the village limits. The road serves a handful of homes on the northern fringe of Wappinger Falls prior to entering a commercial district surrounding a junction with US9 near the South Hills Mall and the Poughkeepsie Galleria. NY9D ends here while its right-of-way continues past US9 as County Route77 (Vassar Road).|$|E

40|$|Protein-bound duplex DNA {{is often}} bent or kinked. Yet, {{quantification}} of intrinsic DNA bending {{that might lead}} to such protein interactions remains enigmatic. DNA cyclization experiments have indicated that DNA may form <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> more easily than predicted by the established worm-like chain (WLC) model. One proposed explanation suggests that local melting of a few base pairs introduces flexible hinges. We have expanded this model to incorporate sequence and temperature dependence of the local melting, and tested it for three sequences at temperatures from 23 °C to 42 °C. We find that small melted bubbles are significantly more flexible than double-stranded DNA and can alter DNA flexibility at physiological temperatures. However, these bubbles are not flexible enough to explain the recently observed very <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> in DNA...|$|R
