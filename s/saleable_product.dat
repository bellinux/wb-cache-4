5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a <b>saleable</b> <b>product,</b> but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|E

40|$|Trials were {{performed}} with red beet and white cabbage in 1998 - 2001 {{to assess the}} effects on yields and nutrient utilization of surface mulch (chopped grass and/or red clover). No other nutrients were applied. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) contents were measured in mulch, <b>saleable</b> <b>products</b> and above-ground plant residues. A single mulch application of about 12 Mg DM ha- 1 increased the yields of both crops significantly. Mean yields of <b>saleable</b> <b>products</b> were increased from 27 to 33, and from 44 to 56 Mg FW ha- 1 of red beet and white cabbage, respectively. However, the average apparent recoveries of mulch derived nutrients in above-ground plant parts (calculated by subtraction of uptakes in the control treatment) were only 13 %, 14 % and 18 % of N, P and K, respectively. Some 3 - 10 % of the N supplied in mulch was found as mineral N at 0 - 60 cm soil depth after harvest, and in late autumn {{approximately half of the}} P and all the K supplied was found as P-AL or K-AL (ammonium lactate and acetic acid) plus acid-soluble K in the topsoil.

40|$|A {{chemical}} plant involves the following basic operations, or stages: (a) Raw material handling and preparation, (b) The chemical reaction itself and (c) {{the separation of}} the various <b>saleable</b> <b>products</b> from one another and from the waste products. In practice, however, the three operations may not take place separately. The rate of a chemical reaction, for instance, may be determined not so much by chemical kinetics as by the mechanical process of mixing the reagents (the reacting components) within the reactor if these are not freely miscible. Fluid and solid mechanics may therefore dominate even the chemical reaction stage (b) of production in some instances...|$|R

50|$|In chemistry, {{fractional}} crystallization {{is a method}} of refining substances based on differences in solubility. It fractionates via differences in crystallization (forming of crystals). If a mixture {{of two or more}} substances in solution are allowed to crystallize, for example by allowing the temperature of the solution to decrease or increase, the precipitate will contain more of the least soluble substance. The proportion of components in the precipitate will depend on their solubility products. If the solubility products are very similar, a cascade process will be needed to effectuate a complete separation. This technique is often used in chemical engineering to obtain very pure substances, or to recover <b>saleable</b> <b>products</b> from waste solutions.|$|R

5000|$|While home {{distillation}} {{is illegal}} in the United States, {{it continues to}} be practiced, mainly in Appalachia. [...] The product is sometimes called white lightning, because it is not aged and is generally sold at high alcohol proof, often bottled in Mason jars. A typical moonshine still may produce 1000 gallons per week and net $6000 per week for its owner. [...] The simplicity of the process, and the easy availability of key ingredients such as corn and sugar, make enforcement difficult. However, the price advantage that moonshine once held over its legally sold competition has fallen. Nevertheless, over half the retail price of a bottle of distilled spirits typically consists of taxes.

5000|$|Chemical {{engineering}} as {{a discipline}} that was developed out of those practising [...] "industrial chemistry" [...] in the late 19th century. Before the Industrial Revolution (18th century), industrial chemicals and other consumer products such as soap were mainly produced through batch processing. Batch processing is labour-intensive and individuals mix predetermined amounts of ingredients in a vessel, heat, cool or pressurize the mixture for a predetermined length of time. The product may then be isolated, purified and tested to achieve a <b>saleable</b> <b>product.</b> Batch processes are still performed today on higher value products, such as pharmaceutical intermediates, speciality and formulated products such as perfumes and paints, or in food manufacture such as pure maple syrups, where a profit can still be made despite batch methods being slower and inefficient in terms of labour and equipment usage. Due to the application of Chemical Engineering techniques during manufacturing process development, larger volume chemicals are now produced through a continuous [...] "assembly line" [...] chemical processes. The Industrial Revolution was when a shift from batch to more continuous processing began to occur. Today commodity chemicals and petrochemicals are predominantly made using continuous manufacturing processes whereas speciality chemicals, fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals are made using batch processes.|$|E
