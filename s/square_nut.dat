60|$|Most botanists rank all the {{varieties}} {{under the same}} species, the common wild nut. (10/134. The following details are taken from the 'Catalogue of Fruits, 1842 in Garden of Hort. Soc.' page 103; and from Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 943.) The husk, or involucre, differs greatly, being extremely short in Barr's Spanish, and extremely long in filberts, {{in which it is}} contracted so as to prevent the nut falling out. This kind of husk also protects the nut from birds, for titmice (Parus) have been observed (10/135. 'Gardener's Chron.' 1860 page 956.) to pass over filberts, and attack cobs and common nuts growing in the same orchard. In the purple-filbert the husk is purple, and in the frizzled-filbert it is curiously laciniated; in the red-filbert the pellicle of the kernel is red. The shell is thick in some varieties, but is thin in Cosford's-nut, and in one variety is of a bluish colour. The nut itself differs much in size and shape, being ovate and compressed in filberts, nearly round and of great size in cobs and Spanish nuts, oblong and longitudinally striated in Cosford's, and obtusely four-sided in the Downton <b>Square</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|E
50|$|Carriage bolts are {{extensively}} used {{in security}} fixings, {{such as the}} Brenton Bolt where the bolt must only be removable from one side. The smooth domed head and <b>square</b> <b>nut</b> below prevent the carriage bolt from being unlocked from the insecure side.|$|E
50|$|Square steel nuts {{were common}} on {{machinery}} {{of the late}} 19th through mid 20th century. Today hex nuts have displaced them. One reason is that a hex nut offers a new wrenching access at every 60°, whereas a <b>square</b> <b>nut</b> offers one only at every 90°.|$|E
50|$|The Allen socket may be 6 {{point or}} 12 point (also {{known as a}} double hex socket). They are used where hex or <b>square</b> <b>nuts</b> won't fit.|$|R
50|$|<b>Square</b> <b>nuts,</b> {{as well as}} bolt heads, {{were the}} first shape made and {{used to be the}} most common largely because they were much easier to manufacture, {{especially}} by hand. While rare today due to the reasons stated below for the preference of hexagonal nuts, they are occasionally used in some situations when a maximum amount of torque and grip is needed for a given size: the greater length of each side allows a spanner to be applied with a larger surface area and more leverage at the nut.|$|R
50|$|These {{nuts are}} very similar to {{standard}} <b>square</b> or hex <b>nuts,</b> but have a locating boss and welding projections. The bosses also keep weld spatter out of the threads.|$|R
50|$|A {{cage nut}} or caged nut (also called a captive or clip nut) {{consists}} of a (usually <b>square)</b> <b>nut</b> in a spring steel cage which wraps around the nut. The cage has two wings that when compressed allow the cage to be inserted into the square holes, for example, in the mounting rails of equipment racks. When the wings are released, they hold the nut in position behind the hole. Cage nuts conforming to this description were patented in 1952 and 1953.|$|E
5000|$|A J-nut is a nut that clips to {{the edge}} of the sheet metal. It is named after the way it is shaped; the thread is on the long side of the [...] "J". The thread may either be of a speed nut form or have an {{integrated}} hex or <b>square</b> <b>nut.</b> Due to the short retaining leg the nut is allowed to float more, which can help with misalignment, but the nut is free to un-clip from the sheet metal as well.|$|E
50|$|A square style clip-on nut {{does not}} clip onto {{the edge of}} the sheet metal, but rather the edges of a square hole or slot. It is a <b>square</b> <b>nut</b> that has a sheet metal {{retainer}} that protrudes down two sides of the nut. These legs are formed to have lips that grab onto the sheet metal object. Prior to tightening the nut, it can float in the hole or slot, but when the nut is tightened it presses the lips of the retainer out and anchors itself in place.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lower half}} of the stack is braced {{internally}} with two sets of four heavy steel rods running horizontally through each side of the stack and protruding from the brickwork near each corner. Clamping plates are sited flush with the brickwork then packing/washers with <b>square</b> sided <b>nuts</b> are used to tighten the bracing against the brick work. These clamping plates have [...] "AWCS" [...] stamped onto each corner suggesting at least partial on-site manufacture in a blacksmith's or smelter workshop.|$|R
30|$|Animals {{were killed}} at 4 and 8  weeks post-surgery. The treated femora {{as well as}} the {{contralateral}} femora were resected and stored at − 20  °C in saline (0.9  % NaCl)-soaked gauze. Prior to testing, all femora were removed from the freezer and allowed to thaw to room temperature. Samples were cleaned of soft tissue and femur dimensions were measured using calipers. Proximal and distal ends of the femora were then embedded in ¾-inch (6 -mm) <b>square</b> <b>nuts</b> with Wood’s metal (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA, USA), leaving an approximate gauge length of 14  mm. The samples were then torsionally tested to failure using a servo hydraulics machine (MTS Systems Corp., Eden Prairie, MN, USA) with a 20  N m torque cell (Interface, Scotsdale, AZ, USA) at a rate of 2.0 °/s. Maximum torque to failure and angle of failure were obtained from the torque force to angular displacement data. Standard equations modeling each femur as a hollow ellipse were used to calculate polar moment of inertia. Peak torque to failure (Tmax), angle of failure (θ), gauge length (L), and polar moment of inertia (J) were used to calculate maximum torsional rigidity (TR), shear modulus (SM), and maximum torsional shear stress (SS). Mechanical testing values were normalized to minimize inter-animal variability. Normalized data is presented as a percentage and was calculated by dividing treated femur values by the contralateral untreated femur values.|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{are that}} most {{are not very}} efficient. Due to the low efficiency they cannot be used in continuous power transmission applications. They also have {{a high degree of}} friction on the threads, which can wear the threads out quickly. For <b>square</b> threads, the <b>nut</b> must be replaced; for trapezoidal threads, a split nut may be used to compensate for the wear.|$|R
50|$|A <b>square</b> <b>nut</b> is a four-sided nut. Compared to {{standard}} hex nuts, square nuts {{have a greater}} surface {{in contact with the}} part being fastened, and therefore provide greater resistance to loosening (though also greater resistance to tightening). They are also much less likely to become rounded-off after repeated loosening/tightening cycles. Square nuts are typically mated with square-headed bolts. Square nuts are used along with flat washers in order to avoid damage from its sharp edges and helps to increase the strength of the fastener. Square nuts can have standard, fine or coarse threading with platings of zinc yellow, plain, zinc clear, tin and cadmium, among others. Most can meet either the ASTM A194, ASTM A563, or ASTM F594 standard.|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{self-assembly}} {{offers a}} ‘bottom-up ’ route to fabrication with subnanometre precision of complex structures from simple components 1. DNA has proven a versatile building block 2 – 5 for programmable construction of such objects, including two-dimensional crystals 6, nanotubes 7 – 11, and three-dimensional wireframe nanopolyhedra 12 – 17. Templated self-assembly of DNA 18 into custom two-dimensional shapes on the megadalton scale {{has been demonstrated}} previously with a multiple-kilobase ‘scaffold strand ’ that is folded into a flat array of antiparallel helices by interactions with hundreds of oligonucleotide ‘staple strands’ 19, 20. Here we extend this method to building custom three-dimensional shapes formed as pleated layers of helices constrained to a honeycomb lattice. We demonstrate the design and assembly of nanostructures approximating six shapes — monolith, <b>square</b> <b>nut,</b> railed bridge, genie bottle, stacked cross, slotted cross — with precisely controlled dimensions ranging from 10 to 100 nm. We also show hierarchical assembly of structures such as homomultimeric linear tracks and of heterotrimeric wireframe icosahedra. Proper assembly requires week-long folding times and calibrated monovalent and divalent cation concentrations. We anticipate that our strategy for self-assembling custom three-dimensiona...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProjection welding of nuts to sheets is {{a widely}} {{utilized}} manufacturing process in the automotive industry. The process entails challenges due the necessity of joining different sheet thicknesses and nut sizes made from dissimilar materials, and {{due to the fact}} of experiencing large local deformations ranging from room temperature to above the melting point. Heating is facilitated by resistance heating and is highly influenced by the contact area resulting from the amount of deformation, which is also temperature dependent due to material softening and frictional conditions. Resort to new materials and applications require a new level of understanding of the process by combining finite element modelling and experimentation. This paper draws from the challenge of developing a three-dimensional computer program for electro-thermo-mechanical modeling of resistance welding and presents, as far as the authors are aware, the first ever three-dimensional simulation of the projection welding of square nuts to sheets by means of finite element analysis. Results are compared with experimental observations and measurements produced by the authors with the aim and objective of assessing the accuracy, reliability and validity of the theoretical and numerical developments. Numerical simulations support the evaluation of the experiments by providing detailed information on the process like the initial heating location and the following temperature development, and allowing to analyze the weldability of the <b>square</b> <b>nut</b> to the sheet under different operating conditions...|$|E
