50|$|In Egypt, shadoofs and sakiehs are used. When {{compared}} {{to each other}} however, the Sakkieh is much more efficient, as it can bring up water from a depth of 10 metres (versus the 3 metres of the shadoof). The <b>Sakieh</b> is the Egyptian version of the Noria.|$|E
50|$|A sakia, {{alternative}} spelling <b>sakieh</b> or saqiya (from ساقية, sāqīya), {{also called}} Persian wheel, tablia, and in Latin tympanum is a mechanical water lifting device which uses buckets, jars, or scoops fastened either {{directly to a}} vertical wheel, or to an endless belt activated by such a wheel. The vertical wheel is itself attached by a drive shaft to a horizontal wheel, which is traditionally {{set in motion by}} animal power (oxen, donkeys, etc.) Because it is not using the power of flowing water, the sakia is different from a noria and any other type of water-wheel. It is still used in India, Egypt {{and other parts of the}} Middle East, and in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands. It may have been invented in Hellenistic Egypt, Persia or India. The sakia was mainly used for irrigation, but not exclusively, as the example of Qusayr Amra shows, where it was used at least in part to provide water for a royal bathhouse.|$|E
50|$|A {{water well}} is an {{excavation}} or structure {{created in the}} ground by digging, driving, boring, or drilling to access groundwater in underground aquifers. The well water is drawn by a pump, or using containers, such as buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand. Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the stepwells of India, the qanats of Iran, and the shadoofs and <b>sakiehs</b> of India. Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability and linings of wood or wickerwork date back {{at least as far}} as the Iron Age.|$|R
5000|$|A {{description}} of Zeita from {{the mid-19th century}} travels of James Turner Barclay notes that it is, [...] "... a picturesque Arab village, situated on a conical hill." [...] Writing at length of the well {{at the foot of}} the hill where he and his travel companions were directed after inquiring for water, he relates: [...] "... arriving there, we found several persons drawing water for themselves, donkeys, horses, and cattle. And notwithstanding the water was rather warm and considerably muddied by a Fellah who was wading about in the deep fountain, or more correctly speaking, shallow well, yet so thirsty were we that we drank it with decided gusto. It was eight or ten feet deep, and four or five yards in diameter, with the usual stone troughs for watering animals ..." [...] Camping between the well and the millet fields of the village, Barclay describes the expanse of the cultivated fields, as well as the construction and operation of the well in more detail: [...] "This <b>Sakieh</b> or well, supplied with machinery for raising water, is plied day and night by camels. A beautiful marble Corinthian capital supports the shaft of the main wheel. There are eighty-five stone jars, each containing two or three gallons, fastened at intervals of four feet on the two endless grass ropes going over the large rough pulley wrapped with grass cords. The water, which is incessantly poured out of the jars, is received into a channel cut into a marble pillar laid horizontally, and thus delivered into a reservoir twenty-four feet square, and thence let off into a trough of masonry thirty-six feet long and two and half broad, the outer border of which is made up of marble pillars worked in horizontally, as in other instances. But copious and unremitting as is this supply of water, it would seem totally inadequate to the demand. Herd after herd, and flock after flock, came crowding in about sunset, and the cry was, [...] "still they come", until it was too dark to count them ..." ...|$|E
