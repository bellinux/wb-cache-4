Depending on the phosphorus substituents, ring-chain valence tautomerism allows montréalones to display variable degrees of equilibrium and structural blending with N-acylamino phosphonium ylide forms. The cyclic 1,3-dipolar form is detectably or exclusively formed with phosphite and phosphonite-based analogs. Triphenylphosphine-based variants lack sufficient tendency for intramolecular cyclization, and exist as acylic phosphonium ylides.|$|E
5000|$|Nanogeoscience {{deals with}} structures, {{properties}} {{and behaviors of}} nanoparticles in soils, aquatic systems and atmospheres. One of the key features of nanoparticles is the size-dependence of the nanoparticle <b>stability</b> <b>and</b> <b>reactivity.</b> This arises from the large specific surface area and differences in surface atomic structure of nanoparticles at small particle sizes. In general, the free energy of nanoparticles is inversely proportional to their particle size. For materials that can adopt two or more structures, size-dependent free energy may result in phase stability crossover at certain sizes. Free energy reduction drives crystal growth (atom-by-atom or by oriented attachment [...] ), which may again drive the phase transformation due to the change of the relative phase stability at increasing sizes. These processes impact the surface reactivity and mobility of nanoparticles in natural systems.|$|E

Eighteen resonance frequencies on 14 N were detected at 180  K and assigned to particular nitrogen sites (−NH 2, –N=, and –NH–) in 2 -thiocytosine. Factors such as the nonequivalence of molecules (connected to the duplication of sites) and possible prototropic tautomerism (capable of modifying the type of site due to proton transfer) were taken into account during frequency assignment. The result of replacing oxygen with sulfur, which leads {{to changes in the}} intermolecular interaction pattern and molecular aggregation, is discussed.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{transformation}} that WO 3 nanoparticles produced by Flame Spray Pyrolysis undergo when subjected to {{heating and cooling}} cycles by means of accurate in situ XRD and HRTEM investigations supported by atomistic modeling {{at the level of}} Density Functional Theory. As-deposited particles, initially in the monoclinic phase, reversibly transform into the high-temperature orthogonal and tetragonal phases (and vice versa) irrespective of the direction of the temperature gradient. However, upon heating the particles experience an irreversible change of morphology as a consequence of evaporation/reprecipitation processes leading to the formation of larger particles, some of which are elongated (aspect ratios of up to 3 : 1) along various crystallographic directions of the tetragonal unit cell. On the basis of the results of extensive ab initio thermodynamic calculations of surface energies and first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of the growth process, we rationalize these findings in terms of different surface <b>stabilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>reactivities</b> towards gas-phase deposition of molecular WO 3 presented by the nanocrystal facets...|$|R

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{bioactivity}} {{is mainly}} conveyed through reactions with iron and thiols, furnishing iron nitrosyls and S-nitrosothiols with wide-ranging <b>stabilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>reactivities.</b> Triiodide chemiluminescence methodology has been popularized as uniquely capable of quantifying these species together with NO byproducts, such as nitrite and nitrosamines. Studies with triiodide, however, have challenged basic ideas of NO biochemistry. The assay, which involves addition of multiple reagents whose chemistry {{is not fully}} understood, thus requires extensive validation: Few protein standards have in fact been characterized; NO mass balance in biological mixtures has not been verified; and recovery of species that span the range of NO-group reactivities has not been assessed. Here {{we report on the}} performance of the triiodide assay vs. photolysis chemiluminescence in side-by-side assays of multiple nitrosylated standards of varied <b>reactivities</b> <b>and</b> in assays of endogenous Fe- and S-nitrosylated hemoglobin. Although the photolysis method consistently gives quantitative recoveries, the yields by triiodide are variable and generally low (approaching zero with some standards and endogenous samples). Moreover, in triiodide, added chemical reagents, changes in sample pH, and altered ionic composition result in decreased recoveries and misidentification of NO species. We further show that triiodide, rather than directly and exclusively producing NO, also produces the highly potent nitrosating agent, nitrosyliodide. Overall, we find that the triiodide assay is strongly influenced by sample composition <b>and</b> <b>reactivity</b> <b>and</b> does not reliably identify, quantify, or differentiate NO species in complex biological mixtures...|$|R

40|$|In this work, a new {{methodology}} for {{the synthesis of}} a number of silylated bicyclic dienes has been reported. These bicyclic dienes allowed access to a variety of enones and phenols in 2 further steps. The <b>stabilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>reactivities</b> of different dialkylisopropoxy silanes have been evaluated,revealing relative instability of the dimethylisopropoxy silyl group towards chromatography. When using the analogous diethylisopropoxy silyl group instead, the products showed greater stability towards chromatography, however a higher temperature was necessary to oxidise the more sterically hindered silyl group to the desired hydroxyl moiety. A powerful cascade cyclisation for the synthesis of the CDE-core of rubriflordilactone A was then demonstrated and was successfully used for the synthesis of two systems, 284 and 333. The phenolic oxygen has been successfully installed by oxidation of a dialkylisopropoxy silane. The synthesis of these ring systems provides a solid foundation for the completion of the total synthesis of rubriflordilactone A.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{effects of}} atmospheric cold plasma generated reactive species are mediated through {{and at a}} liquid interface. The diversity of antimicrobial efficacy or intensity of effects may differ {{with respect to the}} plasma device or set up, and {{it is important to understand}} how these differences occur to advance understanding and successful applications. Thus, plasma treated water (PTW) from a microwave driven plasma source (PTW-MW) and plasma treated water from a di-electric barrier discharge system (PTW-DBD) were compared in terms of long lived reactive species chemical composition and antimicrobial activity. The influence of a post-treatment storage time (PTST), where reactive species in the gas phase were maintained in contact with the liquid was investigated. Nitrogen-based chemistry dominated in PTW-MW, with high concentrations of nitrous acid decomposing to nitrite and nitrate, while H 2 O 2 and nitrate were predominant in PTW-DBD. PTST could enhance H 2 O 2 concentrations in di-electric barrier PTW over time while nitrous acid, the main oxidative species in microwave driven PTW, decreased.
