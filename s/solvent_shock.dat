40|$|This is {{the final}} {{technical}} report for a project involving the study of stress response systems in the radiation-resistant bacterium, Deinococcus radiodurans. Three stresses of importance for a mixed waste treatment strain were studied, heat shock, <b>solvent</b> <b>shock,</b> and phosphate starvation. In each case, specific genes involved {{in the ability to}} survive the stress were identified using a systems biology approach, and analysis of mutants was used to understand mechanisms. This study has led to increased understanding {{of the ways in which}} a potential treatment strain could be manipulated to survive multiple stresses for treatment of mixed wastes...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{quantitative}} image analysis techniques, together with physiological information {{might be used}} to monitor and detect operational problems in advance to reactor performance failure. Industrial organic solvents such as white spirit are potentially harmful to granular sludge. In preliminary batch assays, 33 mg. Lˉ¹ of solvent caused 50 % relative biomass activity loss. In an Expanded Granular Sludge Blanket reactor fed with 40 mg. Lˉ¹ of solvent, during 222 h, the reactor performance seemed to be unaffected, presenting COD removal efficiency constantly above 95 %. However, in the first hours of exposure the specific acetoclastic and the specific hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activities decreased by 29 and 21 %, respectively. The % of projected aggregates area with equivalent diameter (Deq) higher than 1 mm decreased from 81 to 53 % and consequently the % of projected area of small aggregates increased. The average equivalent diameter of the aggregates larger than 2 mm decreased as well as the settling velocity, showed that the granules experienced fragmentation phenomenon caused by the <b>solvent</b> <b>shock</b> load. The ratio between total filaments length and total aggregates projected area (LfA) increased 2 days before effluent volatile suspended solids, suggesting that LfA could be an early-warning indicator of washout events.

30|$|Microalgae cell {{disruption}} methods can be mechanical or non-mechanical (thermal, chemical, biological) {{depending on the}} characteristics of the microalgae cell wall/membrane and target molecules. Mechanical {{cell disruption}} methods include bead beating, high pressure homogenization (HPH), high speed homogenization (HSH), ultrasonication, and pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment. Thermal cell disruption can occur via microwave treatment, autoclaving, or freezing. Chemical cell disruption methods include organic <b>solvent</b> treatment, osmotic <b>shock,</b> and acid–alkali reactions. Biological cell disruption occurs by microbial degradation or enzymatic hydrolysis. See Green Microalgae “Extracellular matrices and pretreatment strategies for disruption” section for more information on each of these disruption techniques.|$|R
40|$|In a model {{where all}} banks are {{initially}} <b>solvent,</b> an exogenous <b>shock</b> affects confidence, causing {{a flight from}} deposits into domestic and foreign currency. Real interest rates increase unexpectedly, affecting firms and raising {{the share of the}} banks’ nonperforming assets. This increase causes genuine solvency problems and accelerates the bank run. Policy simulations show that compensatory monetary policy (increasing currency supply when deposits fall) mitigates the bank run but causes inflation and external imbalances. Combining compensatory monetary policy with tight fiscal policies also slows the bank run and mitigates insolvency, but at a lower macroeconomic cost. A devaluation is shown to have little positive impact. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} aims of {{this project}} are to: (1) Clone and express broad spectrum oxygenases in D. radiodurans with a target TCE degradation rate of 1 nmol/min/mg protein, (2) analyze and upregulate stress response systems in D. radiodurans, and (3) test survival and activities of these strains in artificial mixtures of contaminants, designed to simulate DOE mixed waste streams, using bench-scale treatment reactors. In addition, we proposed to generate a set of new genetic tools {{to carry out this}} work. In this report, progress is described in the development of new tools and in the study of <b>solvent</b> resistance, heat <b>shock</b> regulation, and polyP metabolism...|$|R
