50|$|The {{harvested}} sticklac is {{crushed and}} sieved to remove impurities. The sieved material is then repeatedly washed to remove insect parts and other soluble material. The resulting product {{is known as}} <b>seedlac.</b> The prefix seed refers to its pellet shape. <b>Seedlac</b> which still contains 3-5% impurities is processed into shellac by heat treatment or solvent extraction.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, if <b>seedlac</b> or shellac is being produced, most insects can escape because less {{coloured}} pale lac is generally more desired.|$|E
50|$|India {{exported}} {{significant amounts}} of sticklac derivatives, especially lac dye, from the 1700s to the late 1800s. Production declined as synthetic dyes emerged, and after the late 1940s, production of <b>seedlac</b> and shellac also declined due to replacement.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1950s, India {{annually}} produced about 50,000 tons of sticklac and exported about 29,000 tons of lac; by {{the late}} 1980s the figures were about 12,000 tons and 7,000 tons, respectively. By 1992-93, India's lac exports fell further to 4,500 tons. In the same period, Thailand's production increased somewhat, with annual lac exports of around 7,000 tons in the 1990s, mainly of <b>seedlac.</b> China exported only about 500 tons of shellac {{per year in the}} 1990s but produced more lac internally: 4,000-5,000 tons of sticklac and 2,000-3,000 tons of shellac in Yunnan province, with additional, smaller production in Fujian province. While India, Thailand, and China are the major lac producers, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka also play small roles.|$|E
40|$|Lac is {{secreted}} by Laccifer lacca kern {{that has}} been widely used as food coating materials. To get the best food coatings from lac, the sticklac which processed need to be converted to <b>seedlac</b> and further become shellac.

40|$|Abstract: Pd/C {{catalyst}} {{was used}} to eliminate chlorine compacted in shellac while it was being bleached with sodium hypochlorite in alkaline solution for the preparation of shellac with low chlorine content, a natural and biological product used in large scale in food industry and pharmaceutical fields. Experiments demonstrated that the Pd/C could catalyze dechlorination process effectively, which was affected by several factors such as reaction temperature, Pd/C ratio, and the induction of Pd/C catalyst, and that the dechlorination efficiency reached 88. 2 % under the optimal conditions of Pd/C loading ratio of 1. 0 % (mass), catalyst usage 12 g/L, H 2 flowing rate 50 mL/min, and reaction temperature 90 for 120 min. Moreover, the mechanism of catalytic hydrogenation was elucidated through structure characterization of the final products using elementary analysis, and ultraviolet spectrophotometer. It was shown from the result of ultraviolet spectrophotometer that the wavelength of the maximum absorption of <b>seedlac,</b> the raw materials for obtaining shellac, was 235 nm. However, it was blue shifted to the same scope 220 ~ 225 nm when the shellac was dechlorinated by catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C as the shellac without catalyzed. The big difference of wavelength of the maximum absorption between shellac and <b>seedlac</b> was due to {{that there was a}} lot of compacted chlorine in the shellac, while the little difference of wavelengt...|$|E
40|$|Keywords:. Shellac; dechlorination; Pd/Fe binary metal; {{catalytic}} hydrogenation Abstract: Pd/Fe bimetallic catalysts were synthesized via chemical deposition {{and used to}} eliminate chlorine compacted in shellac while it was being bleached with sodium hypochlorite in alkaline solution for the preparation of low chlorine shellac, a natural and biological product used in large scale in food industry and pharmaceutical fields. Experiments demonstrated that the Pd/Fe bimetallic particles could catalyze dechlorination process effectively, which was affected by several factors such as reaction temperature, Pd/Fe ratio, and the induction of Pd/Fe. The dechlorination efficiency reached 81. 9 % under the conditions of Pd/Fe loading ratio of 0. 10 wt%, binary metal usage 10 g/L, H 2 flowing rate 50 mL/min, and reaction temperature 90 Â°C for 240 min. Moreover, the mechanism of {{catalytic hydrogenation}} was elucidated through structure characterization of the final products using elementary analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet spectrophotometer. It was shown from the result of ultraviolet spectrophotometer that the wavelength of the maximum absorption of <b>seedlac,</b> the raw materials for obtaining shellac, was 235 nm. However, it was blue shifted to the same value 222 nm when the shellac was dechlorinated by catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/Fe binary metal particle as the shellac without catalyzed. The results of elementary analysis showed that chlorine content in the final product was only 0. 46 %, just 1 / 5 comparing to that of non-declorination by catalytic hydrogenation under the optimum conditions. It was shown that the chlorine ions compacted in the shellac was substituted by hydrogen ions...|$|E
