50|$|The matter {{came back}} to the Divisional Court (Hobhouse LJ, Collins J and Moses LJ) which ruled on 31 July 1997 that HMG had {{committed}} a <b>sufficiently</b> <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> of Community law in passing the offending provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, and that that breach gave rise to damage for which Factortame should be compensated. The court rejected a claim by Factortame for exemplary damages. The decision was appealed by HMG to the Court of Appeal (Lord Woolf MR, Schiemann LJ and Walker LJ) which rejected the appeal on 8 April 1998. HMG appealed again to the House of Lords (Lord Slynn, Lord Nicholls, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Clyde and Lord Hope).|$|E
40|$|OMISSION OF EU's MEMBER STATES LEADING TO THE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE RESUMÉ This thesis {{deals with}} the {{responsibility}} of the member states of EU for damages caused by failure of member states. Both problems are solved in this work, as general requirements for liability relationship, as description of these failures modes with numerous references to case law of the European Court of Justice. Indeed, case law represented a huge range of sources for this thesis. To sum up the work into several points, we can start by making a breakthrough in the issue of liability in the European Union which Francovich case meant. This case established the rule that it is the responsability of member states to implement EU law properly and in time and provide protection to the rights that follow these standards. This rule was followed by other cases which are called "the first generation of cases liability" by many authors. Typical liability sentence: unlawful act (caused by the EU's institution), the damage suffered by the other party and the causal nexus, was subsequently supplemented by the Schöppenstedt criterion, which established the rule that during the process of adopting EU's legislation must be <b>sufficiently</b> <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> of the law standards, which serves to protect the individual. The last unification of the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The International Law Commission's {{decision}} to maintain Articles 40 and 41 {{is based on}} the conviction that <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> of peremptory norms entail specific legal consequences within the field of state responsibility. Among these consequences, it is possible to distinguish between (i) specific obligations binding on other states, (ii) specific rights of other states and (iii) specific obligations of the responsible state. This article critically assesses whether international law recognizes specific consequences falling within the third of these categories. It discusses six prominent candidates suggested in international practice, literature, and the work of the ILC - such as the obligations to provide assurances of repetition, to pay punitive or exemplary damages or to prosecute individual perpetrators of serious wrongful acts. The article concludes that none of these candidates qualifies as a specific consequence of <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> of peremptory norms — partly because the alleged specific obligation has not been recognized in international law, and partly because it equally applies to internationally wrongful acts that do not constitute <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> in the sense of Article 40. It follows that international law at present does not impose specific obligations on states responsible for <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> of peremptory norms. This in turn raises doubts as to the viability of the distinction between <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> and ordinary wrongful acts...|$|R
