The boiler was fired with a pressure <b>jet</b> <b>burner,</b> a small quantity of pressurised naphtha being tapped off from the boiler. A prominent tube and funnel {{on the front of}} the boiler casing (sometimes mistaken for a whistle) is the air inlet. The fuel jet mixes with the downwards air flow in this vertical tube, then the mixed air and fuel is fed to a ring-shaped burner inside the boiler casing. For starting, a hand air pump was used to pressurise the fuel tank and encourage fuel flow, together with pre-heating of the burner coil by lighting a little of the fuel in a tray below it.|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000379270400016 International audienceIn {{this work}} {{three-dimensional}} turbulent and separated jets are numerically studied and compared with experimental data. The basic {{idea of the}} separated <b>jet</b> <b>burner</b> consists in separating fuel and oxidizer injection to dilute reactants with combustion products before the reactants mix. The computation is achieved using the finite-volume numerical method. The turbulence is modeled using a second order Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) by Launder Reece Rodi. A non uniform grid is applied and particularly tightened close to the exit jets in order to capture the near field mechanisms. The validation of the numerical tools is done by comparison with experimental data of the non ventilated jets. Ventilated jets are investigated only numerically. The obtained results show that mixing is improved using three jets compared to the <b>single</b> <b>jet.</b> A comparison between computed ventilated and non ventilated jets is presented. It yields a larger velocity mean value, but a decreasing of the corresponding root mean square of the turbulent velocity fluctuations (rms). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{collective}} modes {{due to the}} propagation of two oppositely moving relativistic jets (dijet) in an anisotropic quark-gluon plasma(AQGP) and compare the results with the case of <b>single</b> <b>jet</b> propagation. For the sake of simplicity, assuming a tsunami-like initial jet distribution, we observe that the dispersion relations for both the stable and unstable modes are altered significantly due {{to the passage of}} dijet in comparison with the case of <b>single</b> <b>jet</b> propagation. It has been further demonstrated that the growth rate of instability, due to introduction of dijet in the system, increases compared to the case of <b>single</b> <b>jet</b> case. As in the case of <b>single</b> <b>jet</b> propagation, the instability always grows when the jet velocity is perpendicular to the wave vector.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis {{experimental}} investigation to study turbulent flame characteristics using laser based methods is presented. Combustion inside almost all technical industrial devices takes place under turbulent environment. In addition, {{a significant amount}} of effort is ongoing to improve the knowledge of turbulent combustion. This work is focussed on the turbulent-chemistry interaction, which remains to be the bottleneck problem in turbulent combustion. Combustion flames from turbulent opposed <b>jet</b> <b>burner</b> and swirl stabilized burner have been investigated using laser induced fluorescence utilizing single-point, single-scalar as well as state of the art multi-scalar, planar technique. Investigation on flames from turbulent opposed <b>jet</b> <b>burner</b> has been carried out. With the same burner set-up, flames from the partially-premixed mode to the premixed mode have been studied while varying parameters like Reynolds numbers and equivalence ratio. The results from the current work provide a detailed insight on flame physics, flame front characteristics, flame front dynamics and extinction phenomenon. Local flame area distribution results have been evaluated and used to confirm for the flame symmetry of turbulent opposed <b>jet</b> <b>burner.</b> It is found that flame stability is decreased not due to small wrinkling of the flame front but due to the total flame stretch, thus confirming the presence of "young turbulence". Young turbulence is characterized by large eddies that yet do not have decayed to smaller structures along the turbulent energy cascade due to limited residence time. In addition it is also concluded that flame extinction phenomenon is due to the large eddies rather than small eddies that disrupts the reaction zone. A technical relevant lean premixed flame from a swirled stabilized turbulent <b>jet</b> <b>burner</b> was used as another test case. Location of peak heat release rate using state of the art planar laser induced fluorescence has been studied in this flame. Single laser system has been used to simultaneously detect two molecular species namely, hydroxyl [OH] and formaldehyde [HCHO]. Snap-shot of peak heat release rate have been provided by simultaneously multiplying spatially and temporarily matched images from both detected molecule. 1000 single-shot images have been taken to build sufficient and clean statistical results. In addition to the experimental work, advanced image processing routines have been developed and applied for automatic data enhancement and analysis. Several algorithms employing filters, smoothing functions and image enhancement were tested and checked for their end results. Sensitive analysis to choose the combination of right parameters has been also done and is specific to the images evaluated in the present work. Lastly, experimental investigation from the current thesis will help in building a data bank for such flames. As the numerical models due to their limitations, requires experimental information to test for their efficacy and capabilities, these results will help to validate numerical models...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{experimental study}} {{was performed to}} elucidate the conditions for which cellular patterns of diluted hydrogen diffusion flames near extinction were observed. The formation of cellular instabilities was studied for several burners: <b>jet</b> <b>burners</b> (axisymmetric <b>jet</b> and two-dimensional jet) and a novel one-dimensional burner. The fuel and oxidizer Lewis numbers and the initial mixture strength (fuel-to-oxygen concentration ratio normalized by the stoichiometric value) were identified as the key governing parameters. The formation of cellular flames occurs for low reactant Lewis numbers (less than one) and near the extinction limit. For the <b>jet</b> <b>burners,</b> the parameter space for cellularity was found to decrease with either decreasing initial mixture strength, either increasing the fuel jet velocity. For a given fuel mixture, the wavelength associated with the cellular instabilities was found to decrease with either decreasing oxygen concentration, or increasing the fuel jet velocity. To study the supression of hydrodynamic effects on the cellular instabilities, a unique burner was constructed to experimentally realize a onedimensional unstrained planar non-premixed flame, previously only considered in idealized theoretical models. The results shos that when the oxidizer diffuses against the bulk flow the propensity of cellular instabilities increases with decreasing the initial mixture strength which is {{in agreement with the}} theoretical predicitions for this type of burner as well as experimental results for jet diffusion flames...|$|R

40|$|In a non-premixed flame, {{the mixing}} of fuel {{emerging}} from a <b>jet</b> <b>burner</b> with quiescent air plays a dominant role in the combustion process. The use of radial injectors upstream of the nozzle exit {{can be used to}} increase boundary layer turbulence, and thereby enhancing {{the mixing of}} fuel and air. In the current paper, a <b>single</b> side <b>jet</b> entering radially into a pipe is investigated experimentally using planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF). This configuration is variant of a jet in cross-flow (JICF), although the cross-flow generated by the central pipe is confined cross-flow. Therefore, the walls of the pipe may influence the side-jet and the existing knowing of JICF may not extend completely to the confined cross-flow environment. In the current paper the penetration of a side jet into the pipe flow is assessed and a new scaling parameter is determined. Scaling the depth by r 0. 75 D, where r is the velocity ratio and D is the central pipe diameter, is proposed and compared with conventional scaling for JICF (rD and r 2 D). The results indicate the proposed scaling produces in a very good collapse of data onto a single line for non-laminar side jet emerging into turbulent flows. C. H. Birzer, B. B. Dally and R. M.
