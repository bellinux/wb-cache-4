40|$|In {{order to}} find out how their {{in-house}} technical expertise are organised, the organisational structures of eleven international development organisations and multinational agencies have been explored. Issues which cut across countries and sectors (thematic approaches) are also listed for each organisation, as this may affect the level/type of expertise available. Some organisations have re-organised their in-house structures or set up new programmes to account for low staff numbers (World Bank, USAID, DFAT) including re-assigning administration to technical positions or hiring external expertise/volunteers (UNDP, GIZ, FAO) when needed. However, this was not possible for other organisations (Sida, Danida). Thematic or cross-cutting approaches have resulted in reduced (Word Bank, UNDP, Global Affairs Canada) or increased (USAID) numbers of staff available for technical expertise. A number of organisations rely on technical staff working in multiple positions (UNDP, Sida, DFAT, Danida) because of low numbers in-house technical staff available. Due to the sensitive nature of this query, as well as other work-related issues, it is difficult to confirm the numbers and variety of staff expertise available for developmental work for some organisations using available online data. This report is based primarily on summarising information from public documents published by the agencies themselves. The amount of information available varies widely from agency to agency, and is not necessarily comparable across agencies. Some information included in this report was also obtained through informal personal communication with staff members of the agencies mentioned, who <b>spoke</b> with us <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> anonymity...|$|R

5000|$|A {{series of}} {{confidential}} emails was leaked in July 2011 on Gamesindustry.biz along with further comments from staff members.

Speaking about this situation, a source who worked with Team Bondi, and <b>spoke</b> to GamesIndustry.biz <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> anonymity, stated that [...] "Ive {{heard a lot about}} Rockstars disdain for Team Bondi, and it has been made quite clear that they will not publish Team Bondis next game. Team Bondi are trying to find another publisher for their next title, but the relationship with Rockstar has been badly damaged -- Brendan treats L.A. Noire like a success due to his vision but I think Rockstar are the ones who saved the project. They continued to sink money into L.A. Noire, and their marketing was fantastic. Without their continued support, Team Bondi would have gone under several years ago." [...] In the interview with GamesIndustry.biz, the same source also claimed that:"Rockstar also made a huge contribution to the development; their producers were increasingly influential {{over the last two years}} of the games development, and overruled many of the insane decisions made by Team Bondi management. At a lower level, Rockstar also pitched in with programmers, animators, artists, QA, etc. Part of the conflict between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstars frustration with Team Bondis direction, and eventually Team Bondis management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. Its also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like Rockstar Sydney - the more they worked with Team Bondi management, the more they came to understand that this was a terrible idea. I have a few logs (see below) that show the relationship souring." [...] The emails include Brendan McNamaras responses to Rockstar pulling out of E3 2010, to a redesign of the L.A. Noire logo, and to the lack of a Team Bondi logo on the game announcement.|$|R
