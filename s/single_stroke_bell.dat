5000|$|A <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> system, as {{the name}} implies, uses a <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> of the pump to {{compress}} a cylinder full of air, which is then all used for one shot of the gun. <b>Single</b> <b>stroke</b> systems are both inexpensive and capable of high accuracy due to the simplicity and consistency of the <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> design. [...] The downsides are the low power provided, though {{this is not a}} handicap in standard 10 meter airgun target shooting. When Daisy introduced an inexpensive <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> pistol, the model 717, in the late 1970s, American Olympic shooter Don Nygord demonstrated the potential of the design by shooting an accurized version in a California State air pistol championship, and winning the gold medal. The (at the time) US$40 Daisy, with a better rear sight and an adjustable trigger added, shot as well as the US$400 Olympic class air pistols it was competing against.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis deals with selection strategies in gaze interaction, specifically for a context where gaze is the sole input modality for users with severe motor impairments. The goal has been {{to contribute to the}} subfield of assistive technology where gaze interaction is necessary for the user to achieve autonomous communication and environmental control. From a theoretical point of view research has been done on the physiology of the gaze, eye tracking technology, and a taxonomy of existing selection strategies has been developed. Empirically two overall approaches have been taken. Firstly, end-user research has been conducted through interviews and observation. The capabilities, requirements, and wants of the end-user have been explored. Secondly, several applications have been developed to explore the selection strategy of <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> gaze gestures (SSGG) and aspects of complex gaze gestures. The main finding is that <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> gaze gestures can successfully be used as a selection strategy. Some of the features of SSGG are: That horizontal <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> gaze gestures are faster than vertical <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> gaze gestures; That there is a significant difference in completion time depending on gesture length; That <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> gaze gestures can be completed without visual feedback; That gaze tracking equipment has a significant effect on the completion times and error rates of <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> gaze gestures; That there is not a significantly greater chance of making selection errors with <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> gaze gestures compared with dwell selection. The overall conclusion is that the future of gaze interaction should focus on developing multi-modal interactions for mono-modal input...|$|R

40|$|Sketch-based {{interfaces}} {{are becoming}} a useful methodology for interaction {{with a wide range}} of applications. Drawing is a natural and simple paradigm for designers. One of the problems in most of the current generation of such interfaces is that designers are forced to use <b>single</b> <b>strokes</b> where they may prefer to use many strokes while drawing with traditional tools such as a pencil. In this work we have addressed this problem by analyzing multiple strokes and replacing them with a <b>single</b> <b>stroke</b> that makes a reasonable estimate of the designer's intention. Our solution recursively subdivides space stopping where either there is only a <b>single</b> <b>stroke,</b> or several strokes that have a proper ordering using Principal Component Analysis. The subspaces are then reconnected...|$|R
