40|$|Starting-up of {{photovoltaic}} (PV) inverters involves pre-charging of {{the input}} dc bus capacitance. Ideally, direct pre-charging of this capacitance from the PV modules is possible as the PV modules are current limited. Practically, the parasitic {{elements of the}} system such as the PV module capacitance, effective wire inductance and resistance determine the <b>start-up</b> <b>transient.</b> The <b>start-up</b> <b>transient</b> is also affected by the contactor connecting the PV modules to the inverter input dc bus. In this work, the start-up current and voltages are measured experimentally for different parallel and series connections of the PV modules. These measurements are used to estimate the stray elements, namely the PV module capacitance, effective inductance and resistance. The estimation {{is based on a}} linear small-signal model of the start-up conditions. The effect of different connections of the PV modules and the effect of varying irradiation on the scaling of the values of the stray elements are quantified. The System model is further refined by inclusion of connecting cable capacitance and contactor resistance. Dynamics of the resulting fifth-order model are seen to be consistent with those of the simplified third-order model. The analysis of this paper can be used to estimate the expected peak inrush current in PV inverters.

40|$|International audienceMonitoring the {{condition}} of a component is typically based on an empirical model that estimates the values of some measurable variables (signals) in normal conditions and triggers the fault alarm when the reconstruction deviates from the measured signal. When condition monitoring is performed during plant operational transients the intrinsically dynamic behavior of the signals {{should be taken into}} account. To this purpose, two approaches are proposed in this work. The former is based on the development of several reconstruction models, each one dedicated to a different operational zone of the component. The latter is based on the preprocessing of the signals by means of Haar wavelet transforms.

A novel model is introduced {{to simulate the}} nonlinear contact behaviour between the stylus tip and the measured surface.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to define the solid rocket booster (SRB) nozzle throat flow field, and to investigate one possible mechanism for the severe erosion which occurred on a recent flight. The flow field {{in the vicinity of}} the eroded area was not found to be exceptional, and the presence of a notch or scored area near the imbedded region nose did not appear to produce sufficient flow fluctuations to exacerbate the erosion characteristics of the throat liner. An interesting fluctuating mechanism was found in the imbedded cavity, but that mechanism (while of possible importance for erosion of the seal region) did not seem to adversely affect the region of concern. On the basis of this analysis, the conclusion can be drawn that the anomalous erosion did not result from a single mechanical defect (pit, or gouge) since the flow fluctuations which result seem insufficient to induce a repetitive pattern downstream. It further appears that the emission pattern exhibited did not result from a steady flow phenomena in the throat region. This does not rule out acoustic phenomena or severe <b>start-up</b> <b>transients...</b>|$|R

The {{influence of the}} damping ratio on the dynamic performance of the stylus instrument is examined and tends to confirm other recent work. The best combinations of signal fidelity and measurement speed occur with damping ratios considerably higher than conventionally used, mainly because the damping can suppress or delay tip flight.

Hence, {{the responses of the}} stylus system to three typical velocity control signals are investigated.

The four well-known initial conditions between the evaporator and CC prior to the LHP start-up were created in this experimental study through combinations of: 1) the test configuration; 2) the method of preconditioning the loop prior to start-up, and 3) the heat load distribution among the evaporators. A total of 165 start-ups were conducted under the five test configurations. All of these start-ups were successful.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of closed-loop Brayton cycle power plants, {{such as the}} PBMR, resulted in the need to simulate <b>start-up</b> <b>transients</b> for industrial multi-stage axial flow compressors operating at subsonic conditions. This implies that the delivery pressure and power requirements must be predicted for different mass flow rates and rotational speeds while operating {{in the first and}} fourth quadrants on the compressor performance charts. Therefore, an analytical performance prediction model for subsonic multi-stage axial flow compressors had to be developed that can be integrated into a generic network analysis software code such as Flownex. For this purpose, performance calculations based on one-dimensional mean-line analysis demonstrated good accuracy, provided that the correct models for losses, incidence and deviation are used. Such a model is therefore the focus of this study. A preliminary analytical performance prediction code, with the capability of interchanging between different deviation and loss models is presented. Reasonably complex loss models are integrated in association with the correct incidence and deviation models in a software package called "Engineering Equation Solver " (EES).

The time series model is statistically equivalent to the multiplicative seasonal model, ARIMA (0, 1, 1) (0, 1, 1) s, of Box and Jenkins. It is shown that the steady-state filter's forecasts of this model are identical to the Box and Jenkins' values. The seasonal adjustment and decomposition algorithm {{is based on a}} multipass filtering technique for back forecasting and smoothing in order to correct <b>start-up</b> <b>transients</b> and replace lost filter's estimates during the initialization phase. The in-sample performances of this multipass seasonal adjustment filter (MSAF) are compared with the Census X- 11 procedure, using real time series. The empirical results clearly show the superiority of the proposed method for all time series in the study. Additionally, a sample from the Makridakis-Hibon's 111 time series is used for ex-post forecasting evaluation of the proposed method in comparison to the Winters and simple ratio-to-moving-average methods.

40|$|A {{literature}} review indicates {{that almost all}} moving boundary heat exchanger models used in dynamic simulations of heat pumps rely on the common hypothesis that the refrigerant pressure drop is negligible. In fact, {{it is important to}} include the momentum balance in some applications, such as electronics cooling where microchannels are commonly used and significant pressure drop is observed and large-scale heat exchangers in solar thermal plants where tube length can be longer than several hundred meters. In addition, a comprehensive and robust switching approach is needed to handle transitions between different model states due to phase change. It is found that the current switching methods in the literature exhibit several shortcomings which may cause serious errors and stability issues when simulating cycling transients of vapor compression systems. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose an improved moving boundary formulation that aims to fill in the above research gaps. Specifically, two different approaches are presented to account for the refrigerant pressure drop across the heat exchanger. A novel and comprehensive switching scheme is introduced to ensure smooth transition between different model representations under large disturbances.

Ion optics performance tests were conducted over a beam current range of 1. 20 to 3. 52 A and an engine input power range of 1. 1 to 6. 9 kW.
