40|$|Background: Changes in the {{proprioceptive}} {{system are}} associated with aging. Proprioception is important to maintaining and/or recovering balance and to {{reducing the risk of}} falls. Objective:To compare the performance of young and active elderly adults in three proprioceptive tests. Method:Twenty-one active elderly participants (66. 9 ± 5. 5 years) and 21 healthy young participants (24. 6 ± 3. 9 years) were evaluated in the following tests: perception of position of the ankle and hip joints, perceived force level of the ankle joint, and two-point discrimination of the sole of the foot. Results:No differences (p> 0. 05) were found between groups for the joint position and perceived force level. On the other hand, the elderly participants showed lower sensitivity in the two-point discrimination (higher threshold) when compared to the young participants (p < 0. 01). Conclusion:Except for the cutaneous plantar sensitivity, the active elderly participants had maintained proprioception. Their physical activity status may explain similarities between groups for the joint position sense and perceived force level, however it may not be sufficient to prevent <b>sensory</b> <b>degeneration</b> with aging...|$|E

In this study, we performed sensory tests and histological analyses to study the effect of recombinant human FGF- 2 (rhFGF 2) treatment on damaged mental nerves. The mental nerves of 6 -week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were crush-injured for 1 minute and then treated with 10 or 50 μg/mL rhFGF 2 or PBS in crush injury area with a mini Osmotic pump. Sensory test using von Frey filaments at 1 week revealed the presence of <b>sensory</b> <b>degeneration</b> based on decreased gap score and increased difference score. However, at 2 weeks, the gap score and difference score were significantly rebounded in the mental nerve crush group treated with 10 μg/mL rhFGF 2. Interestingly, treatment with 10 μg/mL rhFGF had a more obviously positive effect on the gap score than treatment with 50 μg/mL rhFGF 2. In addition, retrograde neuronal tracing with Dil revealed a significant increase in nerve regeneration in the trigeminal ganglion at 2 and 4 weeks in the rhFGF 2 groups (10 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL) than in the PBS group. The 10 μg/mL rhFGF 2 group also showed an obviously robust regeneration in axon density in the mental nerve at 4 weeks. Our results demonstrate that 10 μg/mL rhFGF induces mental nerve regeneration and sensory recovery after mental nerve crush injury...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBPAG 1 is {{the major}} {{antigenic}} determinant of autoimmune sera of bullous pemphigoid (BP) patients. It is made by stratified squamous epithelia, where it localizes to the inner surface of specialized integrin-mediated adherens junctions (hemidesmosomes). To explore the function of BPAG 1 {{and its relation to}} BP, we targeted the removal of the BPAG 1 gene in mice. Hemidesmosomes are otherwise normal, but they lack the inner plate and have no cytoskeleton attached. Though not affecting cell growth or substratum adhesion, this compromises mechanical integrity and influences migration. Unexpectedly, the mice also develop severe dystonia and <b>sensory</b> nerve <b>degeneration</b> typical of dystonia musculorum (dt/df) mice.

40|$|Peripheral glia {{are known}} to have a {{critical}} role in the initial response to axon damage and degeneration. However, {{little is known about the}} cellular responses of non-myelinating glia to nerve injury. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptomes of wild-type and mutant (lacking peripheral glia) zebrafish larvae that were treated with metronidazole. This treatment allowed us to conditionally and selectively ablate cranial sensory neurons whose axons are ensheathed only by non-myelinating glia. While transcripts representing over 27, 000 genes were detected by RNAseq, only a small fraction (~ 1 % of genes) were found to be differentially expressed in response to neuronal degeneration in either line at either 2 hrs or 5 hrs of metronidazole treatment. Analysis revealed that most expression changes (332 out of the total of 458 differentially expressed genes) occurred over a continuous period (from 2 to 5 hrs of metronidazole exposure), with a small number of genes showing changes limited to only the 2 hr (55 genes) or 5 hr (71 genes) time points. For genes with continuous alterations in expression, some of the most meaningful sets of enriched categories in the wild-type line were those involving the inflammatory TNF-alpha and IL 6 signaling pathways, oxidoreductase activities and response to stress. Intriguingly, these changes were not observed in the mutant line. Indeed, cluster analysis indicated that the effects of metronidazole treatment on gene expression was heavily influenced by the presence or absence of glia, indicating that the peripheral non-myelinating glia play a significant role in the transcriptional response to <b>sensory</b> neuron <b>degeneration.</b> This is the first transcriptome study of metronidazole-induced neuronal death in zebrafish and the response of non-myelinating glia to <b>sensory</b> neuron <b>degeneration.</b> We believe this study provides important insight into the mechanisms by which non-myelinating glia react to neuronal death and <b>degeneration</b> in <b>sensory</b> circuits...|$|R

However, optimized growth and differentiation protocols along with reliable safety assays should be established prior to the clinical application of SCs.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that fast anterograde molecular motor proteins power the slow axonal transport of neurofilaments (NFs), we used homologous recombination to generate mice lacking the neuronal-specific conventional kinesin heavy chain, KIF 5 A. Because null KIF 5 A mutants die immediately after birth, a synapsin-promoted Cre-recombinase transgene was used to direct inactivation of KIF 5 A in neurons postnatally. Three fourths of such mutant mice exhibited seizures and death at around 3 wk of age; the remaining animals survived to 3 mo or longer. In young mutant animals, fast axonal transport appeared to be intact, but NF-H, as well as NF-M and NF-L, accumulated in the cell bodies of peripheral sensory neurons accompanied by a reduction in sensory axon caliber. Older animals also developed age-dependent <b>sensory</b> neuron <b>degeneration,</b> an accumulation of NF subunits in cell bodies {{and a reduction in}} axons, loss of large caliber axons, and hind limb paralysis.

40|$|AbstractNotch receptors are {{expressed}} in neurons and glia in the adult nervous system, but why this expression persists is not well-understood. Here we examine {{the role of the}} Notch pathway in the postnatal mouse main olfactory system, and show evidence consistent with a model where Notch 2 is required for maintaining sustentacular cell function. In the absence of Notch 2, the laminar nature of these glial-like cells is disrupted. Hes 1, Hey 1, and Six 1, which are downstream effectors of the Notch pathway, are down-regulated, and cytochrome P 450 and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression by sustentacular cells is reduced. Functional levels of GST activity are also reduced. These disruptions are associated with increased olfactory <b>sensory</b> neuron <b>degeneration.</b> Surprisingly, expression of Notch 3 is also down-regulated. This suggests the existence of a feedback loop where expression of Notch 3 is initially independent of Notch 2, but requires Notch 2 for maintained expression. While the Notch pathway has previously been shown to be important for promoting gliogenesis during development, this is the first demonstration that the persistent expression of Notch receptors is required for maintaining glial function in adult...|$|R
40|$|Deprivation of afferent input {{in young}} animals results in transneuronal <b>degeneration</b> of postsynaptic <b>sensory</b> neurons {{in a variety}} of species and <b>sensory</b> pathways. Transneuronal <b>degeneration</b> is {{generally}} not seen in adult animals. The cellular and molecular basis for this dramatic developmental change in susceptibility is not understood. One possibility is that genes involved in the apoptotic process are involved in determining cell death or survival after afferent deprivation. To further investigate this possibility, we performed unilateral cochlear ablation on wild-type and bcl- 2 -overexpressing mice at a variety of ages. In postnatal day 5 (P 5) or P 8 wild-type mice, cochlea removal resulted in a 54 % or 31 % neuronal loss in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN), respectively. When the same manipulation is performed on a P 30 mouse, no loss of AVCN neurons occurs. This confirmed a rather abrupt change in the sensitivity to disruption of afferent input,...|$|R
40|$|Bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (BPAG 1) is {{a member}} of the plakin family with cytoskeletal linker properties. Mutations in BPAG 1 cause <b>sensory</b> neuron <b>degeneration</b> and skin {{fragility}} in mice. We have analyzed the BPAG 1 locus in detail and found that it encodes different interaction domains that are combined in tissue-specific manners. These domains include an actin-binding domain (ABD), a plakin domain, a coiled coil (CC) rod domain, two different potential intermediate filament–binding domains (IFBDs), a spectrin repeat (SR) -containing rod domain, and a microtubule-binding domain (MTBD). There are at least three major forms of BPAG 1 : BPAG 1 -e (302 kD), BPAG 1 -a (615 kD), and BPAG 1 -b (834 kD). BPAG 1 -e has been described previously and consists of the plakin domain, the CC rod domain, and the first IFBD. It is the primary epidermal BPAG 1 isoform, and its absence that is the likely cause of skin fragility in mutant mice. BPAG 1 -a is the major isoform in the nervous system and a homologue of the microtubule actin cross-linking factor, MACF. BPAG 1 -a is composed of the ABD, the plakin domain, the SR-containing rod domain, and the MTBD. The absence of BPAG 1 -a is the likely cause of sensory neurodegeneration in mutant mice. BPAG 1 -b is highly expressed in muscles, and has extra exons encoding a second IFBD between the plakin and SR-containing rod domains of BPAG 1 -a...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{surgical}} innovation, {{the sensory}} and motor outcome after {{peripheral nerve injury}} is incomplete. In this thesis, the biological pathways potentially responsible for the poor functional recoveries were investigated in both the distal nerve stump/target organ, spinal motoneurons and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The effect of delayed nerve repair was determined in a rat sciatic nerve transection model. There was a dramatic {{decline in the number}} of regenerating motoneurons and myelinated axons found in the distal nerve stumps of animals undergoing nerve repair after a delay of 3 and 6 months. RT-PCR of the distal nerve stumps showed a decline in expression of Schwann cells (SC) markers, with a progressive increase in fibrotic and proteoglycan scar markers, with increased delayed repair time. Furthermore, the yield of SC which could be isolated from the distal nerve segments progressively fell with increased delay in repair time. Consistent with the impaired distal nerve stumps the target medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles at 3 - and 6 -months delayed repair were atrophied with significant declines in wet weights (61 % and 27 % compared with contralateral sides). The role of myogenic transcription factors, muscle specific microRNAs and musclespecific E 3 ubiquitin ligases in the muscle atrophy was investigated in both gastrocnemius and soleus muscles following either crush or nerve transection injury. In the crush injury model, the soleus muscle showed significantly increased recovery in wet weight at days 14 and 28 (compared with day 7) which was not the case for the gastrocnemius muscle which continued to atrophy. There was a significantly more pronounced up-regulation of MyoD expression in the denervated soleus muscle compared with the gastrocnemius muscle. Conversely, myogenin was more markedly elevated in the gastrocnemius versus soleus muscles. The muscles also showed significantly contrasting transcriptional regulation of the microRNAs miR- 1 and miR- 206. MuRF 1 and Atrogin- 1 showed the highest levels of expression in the denervated gastrocnemius muscle. Morphological and molecular changes in spinal motoneurons were compared after L 4 -L 5 ventral root avulsion (VRA) and distal peripheral nerve axotomy (PNA). Neuronal degeneration was indicated by decreased immunostaining for microtubule-associated protein- 2 in dendrites and synaptophysin in presynaptic boutons after both VRA and PNA. Immunostaining for ED 1 -reactive microglia and GFAPpositive astrocytes was significantly elevated in all experimental groups. qRT-PCR analysis and Western blotting of the ventral horn from L 4 -L 5 spinal cord segments revealed a significant upregulation of apoptotic cell death mediators including caspases- 3 and - 8 and a range of related death receptors following VRA. In contrast, following PNA, only caspase- 8 was moderately upregulated. The mechanisms of primary <b>sensory</b> neuron <b>degeneration</b> were also investigated in the DRG following peripheral nerve axotomy, where several apoptotic pathways including those involving the endoplasmic reticulum were shown to be upregulated. In summary, these results show that the critical time point after which the outcome of regeneration becomes too poor appears to be 3 -months. Both proximal and distal injury affect spinal motoneurons morphologically, but VRA induces motoneuron degeneration mediated through both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.

Materials and methods The present study included 29 type I and 11 type II SMA patients diagnosed on the basis of clinical history and typical electromyographic patterns, and 25 age-matched and sex-matched healthy pediatric participants, who comprised the control group. Sensory and motor conduction studies were carried out for both groups. Sensory conduction studies of sural and median nerves assessed peak latency, sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude, and sensory nerve conduction velocity. Mixed posterior tibial somatosensory evoked potential latency and amplitude were also assessed for both groups. Results SMA I patients had lower sural and median SNAP amplitudes, as well as lower peroneal and femoral compound muscle action potential amplitudes, slower tibial motor conduction velocity (MCV), and prolonged femoral and peroneal distal latency compared with the control group. SMA II patients had lower sural SNAP amplitude, slower sural sensory nerve conduction velocity, lower tibial somatosensory evoked potential amplitude, and lower tibial peroneal and femoral compound muscle action potential amplitudes, as well as slower tibial motor conduction velocity and prolonged peroneal distal latency, compared with the control group.

Newborn Wistar rats were given vehicle or 50 mg/kg capsaicin subcutaneously on {{the first and second}} days of life. After the weaning period, male rats were divided into eight groups, and subjected to the following treatments for 2 weeks: control normal salt diet (ConNS, 0. 5 %), control high salt diet (ConHS, 4 %), control high salt diet ABT- 627 (ConHSABT- 627), control high salt diet A- 192621 (ConHSA- 192621), capsaicin normal salt diet (CapNS), capsaicin high salt diet (CapHS), capsaicin high salt diet ABT- 627 (CapHSABT- 627), capsaicin high salt diet A- 192621 (CapHSA- 192621). Both ABT- 627 (5 mg/kg/d) and A- 192621 (30 mg/kg/d) were given by oral gavage twice a day. Mean arterial pressure (MAP, mm Hg) was higher in ConHSA- 192621 (14111) than in ConNS (9410), ConHS (955), and ConHSABT- 627 (976) (P 0. 05).

40|$|Axon {{degeneration}} is {{a feature}} of many peripheral neuropathies. Understanding the organismal response to this degeneration may aid in identifying new therapeutic targets for treatment. Using a transgenic zebrafish line expressing a bacterial nitroreductase (Ntr) /mCherry fusion protein in the peripheral sensory neurons of the V, VII, IX, and X cranial nerves, {{we were able to}} induce and visualize the pathology of axon degeneration in vivo. Exposure of 4 days post fertilization Ntr larvae to the prodrug metronidazole (Met), which Ntr metabolizes into cytotoxic metabolites, resulted in dose-dependent cell death and axon degeneration. This was limited to the Ntr-expressing sensory neurons, as neighboring glia and motor axons were unaffected. Cell death was rapid, becoming apparent 3 - 4 hours after Met treatment, and was followed by phagocytosis of soma and axon debris by cells within the nerves and ganglia beginning at 4 - 5 hours of exposure. Although neutrophils appear to be activated in response to the degenerating neurons, they did not accumulate at the sites of degeneration. In contrast, macrophages were found to be attracted to the sites of the degenerating axons, where they phagocytosed debris. We demonstrated that peripheral glia are critical for both the phagocytosis and inflammatory response to degenerating neurons: mutants that lack all peripheral glia (foxD 3 -/-; Ntr) exhibit a much reduced reaction to axonal degeneration, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the clearance of debris, and impaired macrophage recruitment. Overall, these results show that this zebrafish model of peripheral <b>sensory</b> axon <b>degeneration</b> exhibits many aspects common to peripheral neuropathies and that peripheral glia {{play an important role in}} the initial response to this process...|$|R

Previously published work by our lab evaluating injury-induced changes in sensory neuron protein expression identified substantially {{increased levels of}} the neurosecretory protein VGF (non-acronymic), a neuropeptide precursor. To further characterize the functional role of VGF-derived peptides in sensory neuron signaling and {{in the development of}} pain-relevant behavior, we utilized animal models, behavior analyses, and complementary morphologic and molecular techniques to pursue two approaches: using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to modulate VGF expression in primary afferent neurons, and exploring whether VGF up-regulation is limited to somatic pain. From this work, we learned intrasciatic administration of AAV 5 vectors yields inefficient and variable transduction of sensory and motor neurons, reminiscent of the AAV 8 serotype. Intrathecal administration of AAV 5 -VGF resulted in successful transduction of the choroid plexus but poor expression in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons. Unexpected DRG <b>sensory</b> neuron <b>degeneration</b> was observed following highly-efficient transduction of AAV 9, warranting caution in future experiments utilizing this vector serotype. Antibiotic-induced visceral hypersensitivity was associated with up-regulation of VGF and other nociceptive neuropeptides in sensory neurons of the sixth lumbar DRG. However, contrary to expectations, referred cutaneous allodynia associated with antibiotic-induced visceral hypersensitivity was not readily detected using a non-invasive mechanical stimulation assay. Collectively, these findings encourage a re-evaluation of the tools employed to modulate VGF expression in primary afferent neurons in vivo, support the investigation of this novel signaling system beyond models of nerve injury, and are presented such that they can be used as an aid in the design of future work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Dystonia musculorum (dt) is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary neuropathy with a characteristic uncoordinated movement and {{is caused by}} a defect in the bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (BPAG 1) gene. The neural isoform of BPAG 1 is expressed in various neurons, including those in the central and peripheral nerve systems of mice. However, most previous studies on neuronal degeneration in BPAG 1 -deficient mice focused on peripheral sensory neurons and only limited investigation of the autonomic system has been conducted. Methods In this study, patterns of nerve innervation in cutaneous and iridial tissues were examined using general neuronal marker protein gene product 9. 5 via immunohistochemistry. To perform quantitative analysis of the autonomic neuronal number, neurons within the lumbar sympathetic and parasympathetic ciliary ganglia were calculated. In addition, autonomic neurons were cultured from embryonic dt/dt mutants to elucidate degenerative patterns in vitro. Distribution patterns of neuronal intermediate filaments in cultured autonomic neurons were thoroughly studied under immunocytochemistry and conventional electron microscopy. Results Our immunohistochemistry results indicate that peripheral sensory nerves and autonomic innervation of sweat glands and irises dominated degeneration in dt/dt mice. Quantitative results confirmed that the number of neurons was significantly decreased in the lumbar sympathetic ganglia {{as well as in the}} parasympathetic ciliary ganglia of dt/dt mice compared with those of wild-type mice. We also observed that the neuronal intermediate filaments were aggregated abnormally in cultured autonomic neurons from dt/dt embryos. Conclusions These results suggest that a deficiency in the cytoskeletal linker BPAG 1 is responsible for dominant <b>sensory</b> nerve <b>degeneration</b> and severe autonomic degeneration in dt/dt mice. Additionally, abnormally aggregated neuronal intermediate filaments may participate in neuronal death of cultured autonomic neurons from dt/dt mutants. </p...|$|R
40|$|Increasing the {{expression}} of Hsp 70 (heat-shock protein 70) can inhibit <b>sensory</b> neuron <b>degeneration</b> after axotomy. Since the onset of DPN (diabetic peripheral neuropathy) {{is associated with the}} gradual decline of sensory neuron function, we evaluated whether increasing Hsp 70 was sufficient to improve several indices of neuronal function. Hsp 90 is the master regulator of the heat-shock response and its inhibition can up-regulate Hsp 70. KU- 32 (N-{ 7 -[(2 R, 3 R, 4 S, 5 R) - 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 5 -methoxy- 6, 6 -dimethyl-tetrahydro- 2 H-pyran- 2 -yloxy]- 8 -methyl- 2 -oxo- 2 H-chromen- 3 -yl}acetamide) was developed as a novel, novobiocin-based, C-terminal inhibitor of Hsp 90 whose ability to increase Hsp 70 expression is linked to the presence of an acetamide substitution of the prenylated benzamide moiety of novobiocin. KU- 32 protected against glucose-induced death of embryonic DRG (dorsal root ganglia) neurons cultured for 3 days in vitro. Similarly, KU- 32 significantly decreased neuregulin 1 -induced degeneration of myelinated Schwann cell DRG neuron co-cultures prepared from WT (wild-type) mice. This protection was lost if the co-cultures were prepared from Hsp 70. 1 and Hsp 70. 3 KO (knockout) mice. KU- 32 is readily bioavailable and was administered once a week for 6 weeks at a dose of 20 mg/kg to WT and Hsp 70 KO mice that had been rendered diabetic with streptozotocin for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of diabetes, both WT and Hsp 70 KO mice developed deficits in NCV (nerve conduction velocity) and a sensory hypoalgesia. Although KU- 32 did not improve glucose levels, HbA 1 c (glycated haemoglobin) or insulin levels, it reversed the NCV and sensory deficits in WT but not Hsp 70 KO mice.

40|$|Oligodendrocyte {{differentiation}} {{and central}} nervous system myelination require massive reorganization of the oligodendrocyte cytoskeleton. Loss of specific actin- and tubulin-organizing factors can lead to impaired morphological and/or molecular differentiation of oligodendrocytes, resulting in a subsequent loss of myelination. Dystonin is a cytoskeletal linker protein with both actin- and tubulin-binding domains. Loss of function of this protein results in a sensory neuropathy called Hereditary Sensory Autonomic Neuropathy VI in humans and dystonia musculorum in mice. This disease presents with severe ataxia, dystonic muscle and is ultimately fatal early in life. While loss of the neuronal isoforms of dystonin primarily leads to <b>sensory</b> neuron <b>degeneration,</b> {{it has also been}} shown that peripheral myelination is compromised due to intrinsic Schwann cell differentiation abnormalities. The role of this cytoskeletal linker in oligodendrocytes, however, remains unclear. We sought {{to determine the effects of}} the loss of neuronal dystonin on oligodendrocyte differentiation and central myelination. To address this, primary oligodendrocytes were isolated from a severe model of dystonia musculorum, Dstdt- 27 J, and assessed for morphological and molecular differentiation capacity. No defects could be discerned in the differentiation of Dstdt- 27 J oligodendrocytes relative to oligodendrocytes from wild-type littermates. Survival was also compared between Dstdt- 27 J and wild-type oligodendrocytes, revealing no significant difference. Using a recently developed migration assay, we further analysed the ability of primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cell motility, and found that Dstdt- 27 J oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were able to migrate normally. Finally, in vivo analysis of oligodendrocyte myelination was done in phenotype-stage optic nerve, cerebral cortex and spinal cord. The density of myelinated axons and g-ratios of Dstdt- 27 J optic nerves was normal, as was myelin basic protein expression in both cerebral cortex and spinal cord. Together these data suggest that, unlike Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes do not have an intrinsic requirement for neuronal dystonin for differentiation and myelination...|$|R

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to participate in the regulatory mechanisms of inner ear development and homeostasis. However, their involvement in cochlear <b>sensory</b> cell <b>degeneration</b> following acoustic trauma is unknown. Here, we profiled the expression pattern of miRNAs in the cochlear sensory epithelium, defined miRNA responses to acoustic overstimulation, and explored potential mRNA targets of miRNAs that may be responsible for the stress responses of the cochlea. Expression analysis of miRNAs in the cochlear sensory epithelium revealed constitutive expression of 176 miRNAs, many of which have not been previously reported in cochlear tissue. Exposure to intense noise caused significant threshold shift and apoptotic activity in the cochleae. Gene expression analysis of noise-traumatized cochleae revealed time-dependent transcriptional changes in the expression of miRNAs. Target prediction analysis revealed potential target genes of the significantly downregulated miRNAs, many of which had cell death- and apoptosis-related functions. Verification of the predicted targets revealed a significant upregulation of Taok 1, a target of miRNA- 183. Moreover, inhibition of miR- 183 with morpholino antisense oligos in cochlear organotypic cultures revealed a negative correlation between the expression levels of miR- 183 and Taok 1, suggesting the presence of a miR- 183 /Taok 1 target pair. Together, miRNA profiling as well as the target analysis and validation suggest the involvement of miRNAs in the regulation of the degenerative process of the cochlea following acoustic overstimulation. The miR- 183 /Taok 1 target pair is likely {{to play a role in}} this regulatory process...|$|R
40|$|Up-regulation of 12 / 15 -lipoxygenase, which {{converts}} {{arachidonic acid}} to 12 (S) - and 15 (S) -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, causes impaired cell signaling, oxidative-nitrosative stress, and inflammation. This study evaluated the role for 12 / 15 -lipoxygenase in diabetic {{large and small}} fiber peripheral and autonomic neuropathies. Control and streptozotocin-diabetic wild-type and 12 / 15 -lipoxygenase-deficient mice were maintained for 14 to 16 weeks. 12 / 15 -lipoxygenase gene deficiency did not affect weight gain or blood glucose concentrations. Diabetic wild-type mice displayed increased sciatic nerve 12 / 15 -lipoxygenase and 12 (S) -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid levels. 12 / 15 -lipoxygenase deficiency prevented or alleviated diabetes-induced thermal hypoalgesia, tactile allodynia, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity deficits, and reduction in tibial nerve myelinated fiber diameter, but not intraepidermal nerve fiber loss. The frequencies of superior mesenteric-celiac ganglion neuritic dystrophy, the hallmark of diabetic autonomic neuropathy in mouse prevertebral sympathetic ganglia, were increased 14. 8 -fold and 17. 2 -fold in diabetic wild-type and 12 / 15 -lipoxygenase-deficient mice, respectively. In addition, both diabetic groups displayed small (< 1 %) numbers of degenerating sympathetic neurons. In conclusion, whereas 12 / 15 -lipoxygenase up-regulation provides {{an important contribution to}} functional changes characteristic for both large and small fiber peripheral diabetic neuropathies and axonal atrophy of large myelinated fibers, its role in small <b>sensory</b> nerve fiber <b>degeneration</b> and neuritic dystrophy and neuronal degeneration characteristic for diabetic autonomic neuropathy is minor. This should be considered in the selection of endpoints for future clinical trials of 12 / 15 -lipoxygenase inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of acquired hearing loss is very high. About 10 % {{of the total}} population and more than one third of the population over 65 years suffer from debilitating hearing loss. The most common type of hearing loss in adults is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL). In the majority of cases, ISSHL is permanent and typically associated with loss of sensory hair cells in the organ of Corti. Following the loss of sensory hair cells, the auditory neurons undergo secondary <b>degeneration.</b> <b>Sensory</b> hair cells and auditory neurons do not regenerate throughout life, and loss of these cells is irreversible and cumulative. However, recent advances in stem cell biology have gained hope that stem cell therapy comes closer to regenerating sensory hair cells in humans. A major advance in the prospects for the use of stem cells to restore normal hearing comes with the recent discovery that hair cells can be generated ex vivo from embryonic stem (ES) cells, adult inner ear stem cells and neural stem cells. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that stem cells can promote damaged cell repair in part by secreting diffusible molecules such as growth factors. These results suggest that stem-cell-based treatment regimens can be applicable to the damaged inner ear as future clinical applications. Previously we have established an animal model of cochlear ischemia in gerbils and showed progressive hair cell loss up to 4 days after ischemia. Auditory brain stem response (ABR) recordings have demonstrated that this gerbil model displays severe deafness just after cochlear ischemia and gradually recovers thereafter. These pathological findings and clinical manifestations are reminiscent of ISSHL in humans. In this study, we have shown the effectiveness of stem cell therapy by using this animal model of ISSHL...|$|R
5000|$|Physical {{development}} in midlife and beyond include {{changes at the}} biological level (senescence) and larger organ and musculoskeletal levels. <b>Sensory</b> changes and <b>degeneration</b> begin to be common in midlife. Degeneration can include the break down of muscle, bones and joints, leading to physical ailments such as sarcopenia or arthritis. At the sensory level, changes occur to vision, hearing, taste, touch, and smell, and taste. Two common sensory changes that begin in midlife include our ability to see close objects and our ability to hear high pitches. [...] Other developmental changes to vision might include cataracts, glaucoma, {{and the loss of}} central visual field with macular degeneration [...] Hearing also becomes impaired in midlife and aging adults, particularly in men. In the past 30 years, hearing impairment has doubled. [...] Hearing aids as an aid for hearing loss still leave many individuals dissatisfied with their quality of hearing. Olfaction can co-occur with changes in sense of taste. “Olfactory dysfunction can impair quality of life and may be a marker for other deficits and illnesses” and can also lead to decreased satisfaction in taste when eating. Losses to the sense of touch are usually noticed when there is a decline in the ability to detect a vibratory stimulus. The loss in sense of touch can harm a person’s fine motor skills such as writing and using utensils. The ability to feel painful stimuli is usually preserved in aging, but the process of decline for touch is accelerated in those with diabetes. Physical deterioration to the body begins to increase in midlife and late life, and includes degeneration of muscle, bones, and joints. Sarcopenia, a normal developmental change, is the degeneration of muscle mass, which includes both strength and quality. This change occurs even in those who consider themselves athletes, and is accelerated by physical inactivity. [...] Many of the contributing factors that may cause sarcopenia include neuronal and hormonal changes, inadequate nutrition, and physical inactivity. [...] Apoptosis has also been suggested as an underlying mechanism in the progression of sarcopenia. The prevalence of sarcopenia increases as people age and is associated with the increased likelihood of disability and restricted independence among elderly people. Approaches to preventing and treating sarcopenia are being explored by researchers. A specific preventative approach includes progressive resistance training, which is safe and effective for the elderly.|$|R
40|$|The German waltzing {{guinea pig}} {{is a new}} strain of animals with yet unknown gene mutation(s) {{displaying}} recessively inherited cochleovestibular impairment. The homozygous animals (gw/gw) are deaf already at birth and display Wpical waltzing behavior throughout life. The heterozygous animals (gw/+) do not suffer from hearing loss and vestibular symptoms. The present thesis {{is focused on the}} homozygous German waltzing guinea pig (gw/gw). Cochlear histological analysis in the postnatal animals revealed a characteristic cochleosaccular defect: collapse of scala media compartment, atrophy of stria vascularis, <b>degeneration</b> of <b>sensory</b> hair cells, and slow loss of spiral ganglion neurons. The stria vascularis was atrophic and appeared a single layer composed of only marginal cells, as further evidenced by morphometric measurement of strial height and width. The abnormal appearance of strial intermediate cells (melanocytes) were sparsely scattered in the spiral ligament, whereas strial basal cells were difficult to identify. The degree of <b>sensory</b> hair cells <b>degeneration</b> varied even among animals of the same age. Morphometric analysis of the spiral ganglion neuron profile density showed a significant reduction in the old (1 - 2 years of age) animals. An ensuing morphological study in the cochlea of prenatal embryos showed a progressive reduction of the scala media from embryonic day (E) 35 and its complete absence by E 50. The degeneration of hair cells was first observed at E 50 and onwards. The stria vascularis failed to transform into a multilayered epithelium but consisted of one layer of underdeveloped/degenerate marginal cells. The strial intermediate cells were sparsely distributed in the spiral ligament and showed signs of degeneration Strial basal cells were not easily recognized. RT-PCR analysis of the expression of genes regulating strial melanocyte development showed that Pax 3 mRNA was remarkably decreased in the cochlear lateral wall but remained intact in the diaphragm muscle and skin tissue. The loss of the endolymphatic compartment in the gw/gw cochlea suggests a disruption of cochlear fluid and ion homeostasis. The mRNA and protein expression of several key players in cochlear homeostasis were thus investigated in the cochlear lateral. wall by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR analysis showed a significant reduction in expression of the strial intermediate cellspecific gene Dct and the tight junction gene Cldn 11 in the gwIgw cochlear lateral wall. Immunohistochemical analysis of the gw/gw cochlea showed loss of the tight junction protein CLDN 11 in strial basal cells from E 40, loss of the potassium channel subunit KCNJ 10 in strial intermediate cells from E 50, and loss of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter SLC 12 A 2 in strial marginal cells from E 50. In conclusion, dysfunctional strial cells, in particular intermediate cells, fail to maintain the integrity of the stria vascularis and eradicate the main cochlear K+ recycling pathway in the German waltzing guinea pig inner ear, ultimately resulting in the disruption of cochlear homeostasis and cochlear degeneration...|$|R
40|$|Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is {{the most}} common {{inherited}} disorder of the peripheral nervous system, affecting 1 in 2500 people. Progressive degeneration of the motor nerves leads to the development of motor problems such as muscle wasting and weakness, steppage gate and deformities of hand and feet. Also the sensory nerves are affected leading to reduced sensation of touch, pain and temperature. When only motor axons are affected, the disease is referred to as distal Hereditary Motor Neuropathy (distal HMN). Currently, no curative treatment exists for CMT or distal HMN patients. Previously, it was shown that pharmacologic inhibition of Histone Deacetylase 6 (HDAC 6) is beneficial in a mouse model for the axonal form of CMT (CMT 2), expressing mutations in small Heat Shock Protein B 1 (HSPB 1). HDAC 6 is a major α-tubulin deacetylating enzyme and plays a role in the regulation of axonal transport. Defects in mitochondrial axonal transport are often associated with neurodegenerative disorders and peripheral neuropathies in particular. Specifically, we wanted to study if HDAC 6 could serve as a potential target {{for the development of a}} therapeutic strategy. This research question was tackled in two different ways. CMT and distal HMN can be caused by mutations in more than 70 genes. Therefore, in a first step, we wanted to investigate whether pharmacological inhibition of HDAC 6 has beneficial effects when motor and <b>sensory</b> axonal <b>degeneration</b> arises as a consequence of other genetic alterations in HSPB 1 and in Glycyl-tRNA Synthetase (GARS). In a second step, we focused on the translation of selective HDAC 6 inhibition into a clinical application. To investigate our first approach, we selected different mouse models for distal HMN or CMT 2 in which we could study the effect of selective HDAC 6 inhibition on the motor and sensory behavioral defects. First, we focused on other mutations in the gene encoding HSPB 1 as a cause of distal HMN. Therefore, we used the previously developed and characterized mouse model for distal HMN, caused by the neuronal overexpression of human HSPB 1 P 182 L. Secondly, we extended our research to another animal model representative for CMT 2. This mouse model was developed by inducing a mutation in the gene encoding GARS and became an interesting tool to study the pathogenesis of CMT 2 as the motor and sensory deficits are caused by an endogenous mutation in Gars and thus no overexpression is needed to develop a phenotype. In both animal models for distal HMN and CMT 2 we were able to demonstrate that the therapeutic potential of HDAC 6 inhibition extends beyond mutant HSPB 1 -induced CMT 2. We could show that inhibition of HDAC 6 restores the motor and sensory problems on the behavioral level and also on the electrophysiological level. Moreover, these mouse models allowed us to study the presence of specific pathological deficits, such as alterations in the acetylation of α-tubulin and defects in the mitochondrial axonal transport, as possible hallmarks of peripheral nerve degeneration. Decreased acetylation of α-tubulin was present only in peripheral nerve tissue and in both the mutant HSPB 1 -induced distal HMN and in the mutant Gars-induced CMT 2 mouse models. Also the disturbances in the axonal transport of mitochondria were observed in DRG neurons cultured from both disease models. Interestingly, these defects could be restored by selective inhibition of HDAC 6. This indicates that decreased α-tubulin acetylation and mitochondrial transport defects are part of pathology common to peripheral nerve degeneration. Additionally, this can form the basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies for CMT. Lastly, to focus on the translation of HDAC 6 inhibition into a clinical therapeutic strategy, we developed a compound screening based on the pathological findings of the mutant HSPB 1 -induced CMT 2 mouse model. This screening method was used to develop and characterize HDAC 6 inhibitors with improved pharmacokinetic properties suited for testing in clinical trials. In total, 70 chemical structures were tested in our screening method. The testing results of 35 compounds are summarized in this work. All the compounds were similar in their functional group, a hydroxamic acid, but different in their capping group which is responsible for HDAC 6 surface recognition. The compound screening resulted in a selection of 3 molecules as potent and selective HDAC 6 inhibitors that were able to restore the motor and sensory deficits of the mutant HSPB 1 -induced CMT 2 mouse model. Interestingly, one of the inhibitors is already being tested in a phase IIb clinical trial for multiple myeloma. Thus, the positive results obtained in this screening will advance this compound faster into clinical trials for CMT patients. In summary, we were able to demonstrate that selective inhibition of HDAC 6 is beneficial in several animal models of distal HMN and CMT 2, further supporting the therapeutic potential of pharmacological inhibition of HDAC 6 in specific subtypes of distal HMN and CMT patients. These data encourage further investigation of the effects of HDAC 6 inhibition in other subforms of distal HMN and CMT, eventually aiming at the development of a curative treatment for distal HMN and CMT. Moreover, decreased acetylation of α-tubulin and defects in mitochondrial axonal transport are part of pathology common to mutant HSPB 1 -induced distal HMN/CMT 2 and mutant GARS-induced CMT 2. This indicates a more general mechanism for peripheral neuropathies involving decreased acetylation of α-tubulin and mitochondrial axonal transport defects. Finally, through our compound screening we were able to identify ACY- 1215 with a good drug-like profile that acts as a potent and selective HDAC 6 inhibitor for the treatment of CMT and distal HMN.
