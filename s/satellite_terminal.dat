5|$|A$330million {{expansion}} programme for Terminal 2 {{was announced}} in 2007 and was completed in 2012. The objectives of this project include new lounges and retail facilities, a new <b>satellite</b> <b>terminal,</b> increased luggage capacity and a redesign of customs and security areas. A new <b>satellite</b> <b>terminal</b> features floor-to-ceiling windows offers views of the North-South runway. The new concourse includes three double-decker aerobridges which are gates 16, 18 and 20, each accommodating an A380 aircraft or two smaller aircraft and one single aerobridge. The baggage handling capacity will be increased, and two new baggage carousels will cater to increased A380 traffic. Work commenced in November 2007 and will be completed in 2011 but was opened in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Although {{described}} as a <b>satellite</b> <b>terminal,</b> the terminal building is connected by an above-ground corridor to Terminal 2. Departures {{take place on the}} lower deck (similar to the A380 boarding lounges currently in use at Gates 9 and 11), with arrivals streamed on to the first floor to connect with the current first floor arrivals deck. All gates including 18 and 20 are now handling passengers.|$|E
5|$|At 19:30 General Carey {{directed}} {{that the}} remaining elements guarding the Annex be withdrawn to DAO headquarters (the Alamo) where {{the last of}} the evacuees would await their flight. Once completed, the new defensive perimeter encompassed only LZ 36 and the Alamo. By 20:30 the last evacuees had been loaded onto helicopters. With the evacuation of the landing control teams from the Annex and Alamo completed, General Carey ordered the withdrawal of the ground security forces from the DAO Compound around 22:50. At 23:40 Marines destroyed the <b>satellite</b> <b>terminal,</b> the DAO Compound's last means of direct communication with the outside world. At 00:30 on 30 April, thermite grenades, having been previously placed in selected buildings, ignited as two CH-53s left the DAO parking lot carrying the last elements of BLT 2/4.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Herein, {{we study}} {{transmit}} beamforming techniques in an underlay cognitive mode for the coexistence of satellite and terrestrial networks with the satellite forward link as primary and the terrestrial downlink as secondary. Since geostationary <b>satellite</b> <b>terminals</b> have predetermined propagation characteris-tics {{so that they}} always point towards the geostationary satellite, the interference received by the <b>satellite</b> <b>terminals</b> from the ter-restrial Base Station (BS) is confined in an angular sector. Based on this a priori knowledge, we propose transmit beamforming techniques at the BS to maximize the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) towards the desired secondary user and to mitigate the interference towards the primary <b>satellite</b> <b>terminals.</b> Different types of Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) techniques have been proposed for our con-sidered scenario where the exact locations {{and the number of}} <b>satellite</b> <b>terminals</b> within a specific angular sector are not known while designing the beamformer. Furthermore, an optimization problem is formulated for maximizing the Secondary User (SU) rate and it is shown that the worst case SU rate depends on the Primary User (PU) distance, PU interference threshold and the angular separation of the desired SU from the region of interest...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the cognitive satellite uplink where <b>satellite</b> <b>terminals</b> reuse frequency bands of Fixed-Service (FS) terrestrial microwave links which are the incumbent users in the Ka 27. 5 - 29. 5 GHz band. In this scenario, the transmitted power of the cognitive <b>satellite</b> <b>terminals</b> has to be controlled so as to satisfy the interference constraints imposed by the incumbent FS receivers. We investigate and analyze a set of optimization frameworks for the power and rate allocation problem in the considered cognitive satellite scenario. The main objective is to {{shed some light on}} this rather unexplored scenario and demonstrate feasibility of the terrestrial-satellite co-existence. In particular, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem where the rates of the <b>satellite</b> <b>terminals</b> form the objective vector and derive a general iterative framework which provides a Pareto-optimal solution. Next, we transform the multi-objective optimization problem into different single-objective optimization problems, focusing on popular figures of merit such as the sumrate or the rate fairness. Supporting results based on numerical simulations are provided which compare the different proposed approaches...|$|R

40|$|Herein, {{we study}} an {{underlay}} beamforming technique for the coexistence scenario of satellite and terrestrial networks with the satel- lite return link as primary and the terrestrial uplink as secondary. Since <b>satellite</b> <b>terminals</b> are {{unique in that}} they always point towards the geo- stationary satellite, interference received by the terrestrial Base Station (BS) is concentrated in a specific angular sector. The priori knowledge that all the geostationary <b>satellite</b> <b>terminals</b> are facing south for the European coverage {{can be used in}} designing a beamformer at the ter- restrial BS. Based on this concept, we propose a receive beamformer at the BS to maximize the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) towards the desired user and to mitigate the interference coming from the interfering <b>satellite</b> <b>terminals.</b> The performances of Minimum Vari- ance Distortionless (MVDR) and Linear Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamformers are compared for our considered scenario. It is shown that LCMV beamformer is better suited in rejecting interference even in case of Direction of Arrival (DoA) uncertainty of interfering satel- lite terminals as long as DoA range of the interfering sector is known to the beamformer. Furthermore, it is noted that MVDR beamformer is suitable for a large number of interferers...|$|R
