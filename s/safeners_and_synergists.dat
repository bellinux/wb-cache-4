40|$|Dichloroacetamide safeners protect maize (Zea mays L.) against injury from chloroacetanilide and thiocarbamate herbicides. Etiolated maize {{seedlings}} have a high-affinity cytosolic-binding {{site for}} the safener [3 H](R,S) - 3 -dichloroacetyl- 2, 2, 5 -trimethyl- 1, 3 -oxazol-idine ([3 H]Saf), and this safener-binding activity (SafBA) is competitively inhibited by the herbicides. The safener-binding protein (SafBP), purified to homogeneity, has a relative molecular weight of 39, 000, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and an isoelectric point of 5. 5. Antiserum raised against purified SafBP specifically recognizes a 39 -kD protein in etiolated maize and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), which have SafBA, but not in etiolated wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), or Arabidopsis, which lack SafBA. SafBP is most abundant in the coleoptile and scarcest in the leaves, consistent with the distribution of SafBA.

The growth inhibition effects of the Sa 5 safener could be overcome in a sulfonylurea-resistant background. In 2 - 2 promoter activity could also be induced by the sulfonylurea herbicide chlorsulfuron. In the sulfonylurea-resistant background, which derives from herbicide-resistant acetolactate synthase activity, induction of the In 2 - 2 promoter by chlorsulfuron was lower.

40|$|Several {{methods were}} {{examined}} to minimize crops injury caused by herbicides. Thus increase their selectivity. A selective herbicide {{is one that}} controls weeds at rates that do not injure the crop. Herbicides are selective in a particular crop within certain limits imposed by the herbicide, the plant, the application rate, the method and time of application, and environment conditions. Herbicide safeners are compounds of diverse chemical families. They are applied with herbicides to protect crops against their injury. Using chemical safeners offer practical, efficient and simple method of improving herbicide selectivity. This method has been applied successfully in cereal crops such as maize, rice and sorghum, against pre-emergence thiocarbamate and chloroacetanilide herbicides.

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases play {{paramount}} {{roles in}} the detoxification of herbicides {{as well as in}} the synthesis of lignins, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Biochemical analysis of triasulfuron metabolism in maize (Zea mays) seedlings has demonstrated that the P 450 (s) responsible for detoxification of this herbicide is induced by naphthalic anhydride (NA), a plant <b>safener,</b> <b>and</b> by triasulfuron, the herbicide itself. Induction studies conducted with seedlings of different ages suggest that two separate response pathways modulate this P- 450 activity. Induction by NA is independent of the developmental age of the seedlings up to 6. 5 d; induction by triasulfuron is tightly modulated with respect to developmental age in that triasulfuron metabolism can be induced by triasulfuron in young (2. 5 d) but not older (6. 5 d) seedlings. Induction by NA administered in combination with triasulfuron synergistically enhances triasulfuron metabolism in younger seedlings to levels substantially above that obtained with either herbicide or safener treatment alone. In older seedlings, NA plus triasulfuron treatment induces triasulfuron metabolism to only the level of NA treatment alone, indicating again that the induction cascade responding to triasulfuron is nonfunctional in later development. MnCl 2 studies indicate that the triasulfuron insensitivity of older seedlings does not result from a general limitation in the inducibility of this P- 450 detoxification system but rather from specific limitations in the triasulfuron-response pathway...|$|R

40|$|Peripheral nerve {{regeneration}} fails to restore complete normal function after surgical repair of severed nerves, and this failure has primarily {{been attributed to}} errors in connecting with peripheral targets. However, recent evidence suggests that central deficits remain even after peripheral target reinnervation is largely successful. It has long been established that regeneration fails to restore the stretch reflex despite observation {{that many of the}} neural components are intact. Regenerated Ia afferents are largely successful in reinnervating muscle spindles, are capable of encoding stretch, and elicit EPSPs in homonymous motoneurons, while regenerated motor pools are capable of responding to uninjured sources of excitatory input. We now know this areflexia {{is due in part to}} a retraction of Ia afferent collaterals from motor pools in lamina IX (Alvarez et al., 2011). However, Ia afferents project not only to homonymous motoneurons but also to heteronymous synergist motor pools, even ones that are injury-spared. Ia afferents also project to antagonist motor pools through an interposed inhibitory interneuron. Therefore stretch of a muscle is capable of producing reflex contraction of both itself <b>and</b> <b>synergist</b> muscles while producing reflex inhibition of antagonist muscles. The function of these heteronymous projections after regeneration, however, remains unknown. The goal of this thesis is to determine the limitations of recovery of spinal circuit function after peripheral {{nerve regeneration}} by direct examination of stretch-evoked reflexes among <b>synergists</b> <b>and</b> antagonists. Direct examination of the force response to stretch in vivo is extremely valuable as changes in behavior, the muscle response to stretch, after peripheral nerve regeneration must necessarily reflect changes in the underlying circuitry. We found that heteronymous stretch reflexes initiated by reinnervated muscle were dramatically decreased in both regenerated <b>and</b> injury-spared <b>synergist</b> motoneuronal pools. Additionally, both homonymous and heteronymous stretch reflexes were reduced in an injury-spared synergist after regeneration. These results give physiological evidence for retraction of regenerated Ia afferents from all <b>synergist</b> motor pools, <b>and</b> this retraction may extend to afferents that are injury-spared. Dysfunction also extends to antagonist stretch-evoked reflexes as we found a shift from net inhibition to net excitation of the injury-spared muscle due to reinnervated antagonist stretch. This shift is readily explained by the differential preservation of synapses located in lamina where interneurons mediating these responses are presumably located (Alvarez et al., 2011). Therefore functional deficits after peripheral nerve regeneration extend to heteronymous connections of Ia afferents with <b>synergists</b> <b>and</b> antagonists, both reinnervated and injury-spared. Taken together, these findings suggest that there is a profound discoordination of spinal reflexes and reorganization of spinal circuits after peripheral nerve regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Background: Azoles play an {{important}} role in the management of Aspergillus diseases. Azole resistance is an emerging global problem in Aspergillus fumigatus, and may develop through patient therapy. In addition, an environmental route of resistance development has been suggested through exposure to 14 a-demethylase inhibitors (DMIs). The main resistance mechanism associated with this putative fungicide-driven route is a combination of alterations in the Cyp 51 A-gene (TR 34 / L 98 H). We investigated if TR 34 /L 98 H could have developed through exposure to DMIs. Methods and Findings: Thirty-one compounds that have been authorized for use as fungicides, herbicides, herbicide <b>safeners</b> <b>and</b> plant growth regulators in the Netherlands between 1970 and 2005, were investigated for cross-resistance to medical triazoles. Furthermore, CYP 51 -protein homology modeling and molecule alignment studies were performed to identify similarity in molecule structure and docking modes. Five triazole DMIs, propiconazole, bromuconazole, tebuconazole, epoxiconazole and difenoconazole, showed very similar molecule structures to the medical triazoles and adopted similar poses while docking the protein. These DMIs also showed the greatest cross-resistance and, importantly, were authorized for use between 1990 and 1996, directly preceding the recovery of the first clinical TR 34 /L 98 H isolate in 1998. Through microsatellite genotyping of TR 34 /L 98 H isolates we were able to calculate that the first isolate would have arisen in 1997, confirming the results of the abovementioned experiments.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of herbicides used in cereals, corn and rice owe their strong efficacy aligned with crop selectivity to safeners. The first commercial safener was 1, 8 -naphthalic anhydride used as a seed treatment in corn. Since then approximately 20 Safeners have been commercialized in monocot crops, although several were superseded. According to independent market research, in 2011 approximately 30 % of herbicide use value from all companies in corn and cereals came from products containing safeners. In rice the percentage was 6 %. Almost all safeners work by inducing the expression of genes which code for enzymes involved in herbicide detoxification. Thereby, herbicides are degraded rapidly enough to ensure a damaging concentration is not reached. This gene induction may occur in just one crop or several. For commercial success no significant induction of herbicide degradation should occur in the weeds. The actual molecular target(s) of safeners is/are not known and therefore the reasons for species specificity are unclear. Bayer CropScience has a strong track record of <b>safener</b> discovery <b>and</b> has developed product portfolios based on its <b>safeners</b> mefenpyr-diethyl, isoxadifen-ethyl <b>and</b> cyprosulfamide.

While studying the selectivity of fenoxaprop ethyl in wheat, we {{determined that the}} <b>safeners</b> mefenpyr diethyl <b>and</b> fenchlorazole ethyl also enhanced herbicide tolerance in the competing weed black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides). Fenoxaprop ethyl was detoxified by conjugation with glutathione in both wheat and black-grass, with the resulting metabolites processed to the respective cysteine derivatives, which were then N-glycosylated. in black-grass, these detoxification pathways were only slightly enhanced by safeners, suggesting that metabolism alone was unlikely to account for increased herbicide tolerance. instead, {{it was determined that}} safening was associated with an accumulation of glutathione and hydroxymethylglutathione and enzymes with antioxidant functions including phi and lambda glutathione transferases, active as glutathione peroxidases and thiol transferases respectively. These safener-induced changes closely mirrored those determined in two independent black-grass populations that had acquired multiple herbicide resistance (MHR) in the field. In addition to enhanced glutathione metabolism, both <b>safener</b> treatment <b>and</b> MHR resulted in elevated levels of flavonoids in the foliage of black-grass plants, notably flavone-C-glycosides and anthocyanins.

The objective of this review was to synthesize the published literature on weeds and weed management in rice in Karnataka, identify improved weed-management technologies for delivery to farmers, and suggest research needs. Some 98 weed species are reported to be associated with rice in Karnataka. Weed control to date in Karnataka has mostly been based on herbicides.

5000|$|Casida {{is known}} for his {{research}} on the toxicology and mode of action of most major insecticides, herbicides and fungicides, <b>and</b> their <b>synergists.</b> This research included the discovery that ryanoid and cyclodiene insecticides disrupt the calcium and GABA channels, which has opened up research directed towards identifying new compounds that interact with GABA receptors. Additional areas of study include research on the synthesis, metabolism, toxicokinetics and mechanisms of toxicity of the organophosphates, pyrethroids and neonicotinoids. In addition, he is described as being a [...] "Highly Cited" [...] researcher by ISI Web of Knowledge, and currently has in excess of 850 scientific publications.|$|R
40|$|The present article {{studies the}} {{technological}} possibilities {{of using a}} combined mixture of tomato extract, ascorbic acid as an antioxidant <b>synergist</b> <b>and</b> sodium polyphosphate as a chelating agent {{with a view to}} reducing the amount of nitrites added and enhancing the quality and safety of cooked sausages. The results obtained demonstrate that the addition of tomato extract, containing 10...|$|R
50|$|RID {{contains}} these active ingredients: DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), Di-n-propyl isocinchomeronate (a fly repellent), N-octyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide (an insecticide <b>synergist)</b> <b>and</b> Triclosan (an {{antimicrobial agent}} which kills {{a broad range}} of bacteria). Although RID once contained DDT as an active ingredient, it has since been removed when the effects of this highly toxic substance became more known worldwide.|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is widely}} regarded as the major toxicant in fire effluents. It is produced as a result of incomplete combustion, by low temperatures, flame quenching, or under-ventilation. Polymers containing halogens and aromatic rings give higher carbon monoxide yields in well-ventilated conditions, when burnt in the steady state tube furnace (ISO 19700) at a furnace temperature of 650 °C. This is believed to result from flame quenching by hydrogen halides or the enhanced stability of aromatic rings in flames, respectively. This work investigates the effect of ventilation condition and furnace temperature on the yield of carbon monoxide from burning mixtures of polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene, polyamide 6 containing a brominated flame retardant <b>and</b> an antimony <b>synergist,</b> <b>and</b> polystyrene. In each case, the high carbon monoxide yields in well-ventilated burning reduced at higher furnace temperatures, showing a diminution of both flame retardancy and fire toxicity above 850 °C...|$|R
40|$|Pyrethroid {{resistance}} {{was found in}} 54 field strains of Helicoverpa armigera collected between 1995 and 1999 from 23 districts in seven states of India. LD 50 values of the field strains ranged from 0. 06 to 72. 2 μg/larva with slopes of 0. 5 - 3. 1. Resistance was highest in regions where pyrethroid use was frequent (four to eight applications per season). Resistance to deltamethrin was exceptionally high with resistance ratios of 13, 570 and 27, 160 in two strains collected during February 1998 in central India. Resistance to cypermethrin, fenvalerate and cyhalothrin also was high with resistance ratios of > 1, 000 in four strains collected from central and southern India. Resistance ratios were below 100 in > 50 % of the strains tested. Pyrethroid {{resistance was}} high in strains collected from the districts in Andhra Pradesh where {{a majority of the}} cotton farmer suicide cases in India were reported. Resistance to pyrethroids appeared to have increased over 1995 - 1998 in most of the areas surveyed. Studies carried out through estimation of detoxification enzyme activity <b>and</b> <b>synergists</b> indicated that enhanced cytochrome p 450 and esterase activities were probably important mechanisms for pyrethroid resistance in field strains. Pyrethroid nerve insensitivity also was found to be a major mechanism {{in some parts of the}} country where the use of pyrethroids was high. The information presented illustrates the importance of proper insect management programs to avoid the consequences associated with improper insecticide use...|$|R
