Briefly, <b>safetying</b> is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on {{the aircraft}} so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, oil caps, drain cocks, valves, and parts. Three basic methods are used in safetying; safety-wire, cotter pins, and self-locking nuts. Retainer washers and pal nuts are also sometimes used.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{techniques}} for different applications. The word <b>safetying</b> is a term universally used in the aircraft industry. Briefly, <b>safetying</b> is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, oil caps, drain cocks, valves, and parts. The wire itself maintains tension and remains in place by being twisted around itself and attached to the fastener to be secured on one end and an anchor point (which could be another fastener) on the other end. Since safety wire is made of a malleable alloy, it retains its shape after being bent, rather than springing back to its original shape. This property allows it to remain locked around an object, such as when it is passed through a small hole on a fastener, looped back upon itself and then twisted. The same process is then repeated around the anchor point, which could be another fastener. Since it remains twisted instead of unraveling, it acts as a fixed loop and will not back out without considerable force (greater than the stresses which {{it is intended to}} counter) being applied.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The main {{purposes}} of the paper are to discuss designing and exploitation problems of machines used in strip mines and investigation of its reasons based on steering frame brake-down of the dumping conveyor. Design/methodology/approach: Numerical and experimental approach was used to investigate reasons of the break-down of the dumping conveyor. Numerical simulations based on the finite element method were used. Fractographic and microscopic evaluation and chemical analysis, were used to perform material evaluations. The objectives are achieved by analysis of the numerical simulations results of the broken part of machine and data coming from material evaluations. Based on the mentioned results conclusions concerning results of the failure were given. Additionally the new design of the steering frame half-shafts systems was discussedFindings: The causes of break-down of the steering frame of dumping conveyor were found. Designing and manufacturing problems were the main reasons of the failure. The half shafts systems in undercarriages of the open pit machines are prone to break-downs. They require detailed analysis to be successfully implemented into steering system. Recommendations for the single shaft system are given in the paper. Research limitations/implications: in the half-shaft undercarriage system, the friction in the supporting areas limits horizontal forces acting on <b>safetying.</b> Investigations of the static and sliding friction coefficients should be performed to estimate correct forces and optimal designing rules. Practical implications: The study provides practical implication into designing of half-shafts undercarriage systems and their safetyings. Discussed design of the <b>safetying</b> should be redesigned or the half-shaft system should be changed into one shaft design. Originality/value: The paper provides information backed by evaluation and test results, stating the nexus of causes of the dumping conveyor failure. The experimental and numerical approaches show relationship between designing and manufacturing process of machines. This can be helpful for the designers and researchers looking for reasons, methods of investigations or how to prevent failures of similar machines...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper discuss {{designing}} and operating problems of half-shafts undercarriage systems of open pit machines. Example of failure of such system and investigation of its reasons are presented. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental and numerical methods {{were used to}} investigate reasons of dumping conveyor breakdown. In order to perform material evaluation fractographic and microscopic methods as well as chemical analysis, were used. Based on results of numerical simulations analysis and data coming from material evaluations the objectives are achieved. In order to prevent future similar problems, the new design of the the half-shafts steering frame was discussed as well. Findings: It was found that manufacturing and designing of the half shaft system were the main failure reasons. Such open pit machines undercarriages systems are prone to failures. Detailed analyses are required to implement half – shaft systems without risk of break-down. Recommendation is given in the paper for the single shaft system. Research limitations/implications: Friction in the supporting areas limits horizontal forces acting on <b>safetying</b> of the half-shaft. Sliding and static friction coefficients should be investigated in order to estimate optimal designing rules and correct forces. Practical implications: Practical implications into designing of half-shafts undercarriage systems and safetyings are given.

However, <b>safety</b> leadership in relation to <b>safety</b> climate has rarely been examined. This study has investigated the relationship between <b>safety</b> leadership and <b>safety</b> climate in the context of coal mine. Self-administered questionnaires that included a <b>safety</b> leadership scale and a <b>safety</b> climate scale were used to collect data in three coal mines in China. The number of returned valid questionnaires was 450, and the response rate was 88. 2 %. Exploratory factor analysis identified three dimensions of <b>safety</b> leadership and four dimensions of <b>safety</b> climate. The structural equation modeling results suggest that the active management of <b>safety</b> leadership positively affects <b>safety</b> training of <b>safety</b> climate, the <b>safety</b> motivation of <b>safety</b> leadership positively affects the <b>safety</b> commitment and the <b>safety</b> involvement of <b>safety</b> climate, and the <b>safety</b> monitor of <b>safety</b> leadership positively affects the <b>safety</b> awareness of <b>safety</b> climate.

The objective of the research was to examine how the industry manages <b>safety,</b> how <b>safety</b> is perceived by employees working in the oil industry, employees' action in preventing accidents, and a model explaining overall <b>safety</b> culture. <b>Safety</b> culture was assessed, collecting both qualitative and quantitative data, in the Ghana oil industry. The assessment was based on a systems approach to corporate culture. This approach involves method triangulation (distribution of questionnaires, interviews, and observation). Questionnaires were distributed to oil workers at the beginning of a behavioural <b>safety</b> initiative. Prior to the distribution, interviews were conducted with managers in the oil industry and results formed the basis for further studies. Instruments were developed based on literature review and the first study, reflecting the norms of the industry. The results presented findings on the components of <b>safety</b> culture: <b>safety</b> climate, <b>safety</b> management system, <b>safety</b> performance. Principal component analysis revealed a seven factor <b>safety</b> climate structure and a two factor <b>safety</b> management system structure. Analyses of variance showed some differences based on age, years of experience, and occupational group. Finally, to test the relationship between these components and <b>safety</b> performance, a model was proposed and tested. An extended model was developed showing relationship between the three dimensions of <b>safety</b> culture (<b>safety</b> management systems, <b>safety</b> climate, and <b>safety</b> behaviour). Regression analyses demonstrated that employees' attitude, employees' involvement, and <b>safety</b> management system were ii predictive of actual <b>safety</b> behaviour. Also, <b>safety</b> priorities and need for <b>safety</b> and <b>safety</b> climate (attitude to <b>safety</b> and behaviour) predicted accident involvement. In addition, <b>safety</b> management moderated the <b>safety</b> climate and <b>safety</b> performance (observable behaviour and accident involvement) relationship confirming and contradicting findings with the extant <b>safety</b> culture literature.
