He soon discovers {{that one of his}} former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. It is eventually revealed that both Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, <b>Saddler</b> orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser's defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon finally confronts <b>Saddler,</b> and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island self-destructs.|$|E

25|$|In June Camarine raced {{away from}} Newmarket {{for the first}} time when she ran in the Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles in front of a large and {{enthusiastic}} crowd which included the King. She was ridden by James Robinson and was opposed by the six-year-old Rowton, the winner of the 1829 St Leger and The <b>Saddler,</b> winner of the 1831 Doncaster Cup. Rowton, ridden by Sam Chifney, made the running from The <b>Saddler,</b> with Camarine held up in third before Robinson moved her up to challenge for the lead in the straight. After a particularly severe contest, Camarine and Rowton crossed the line together, with the judge calling a dead heat. The older horse hung away from the rails and appeared to have hampered the filly in the closing stages; it was only with some difficulty that Wood was persuaded not to lodge a formal objection. A run-off over the same course was arranged to decide the race, and Robinson again restrained the filly in the early stages before overtaking Rowton in the straight and winning by two lengths.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} old roads {{out of the}} Market Place: <b>Saddler</b> Street heads south-east, towards Elvet Bridge, the Bailey and Prebends Bridge.

25|$|Costing around £600,000 {{and begun}} on 18 August 2014, the building's {{brickwork}} and timber {{was built by}} the museum's own staff and apprentices, using Georgian bricks salvaged from demolition works to widen the A1. Unlike previous buildings built on the site, the museum had to replicate rather than relocate this one {{due to the fact}} that fewer buildings are being demolished compared to the 1970s, and in any case it was deemed unlikely one could be found to fit the curved shape of the plot. The studio is named after a real business run by John Reed Edis and his daughter Daisy. Mr Edis, originally at 27 Sherburn Road, Durham, in 1895, then 52 <b>Saddler</b> Street from 1897. The museum collection features several photographs, signs and equipment from the Edis studio.
