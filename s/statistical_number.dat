Cancer is a multifaceted genetic disease caused primarily by environmental factors and its treatment is usually a combination of numerous varied modalities.

One of the most important characteristic features in this kind of problem is the existence of a lag phase before self-assembly takes off, which is what we focus attention on. We study the associated lag time {{as a function of the}} system size and kinetic pathway. We find that the leading order stochastic contribution to the lag time before polymerisation commences is inversely proportional to the system volume for large-enough system size for all nine reaction pathways tested.

Over the past decades, great efforts have been made to elucidate the underlying genetic basis of CAD and massive data have been accumulated.

We classified these candidate genes into 12 functional categories based on their roles in CAD.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of our {{understanding}} of star formation in the local universe has been built upon an extensive foundation of H-alpha observational studies. However, recent work in the ultraviolet (UV) with GALEX has shown that star formation rates (SFRs) inferred from H-alpha in galactic environments characterized by low stellar and gas densities {{tend to be less}} than those based on the UV luminosity. The origin of the discrepancy is actively debated because one possible explanation is that the stellar initial mass function is systematically deficient in high mass stars in such environments. In this contribution, we summarize our work on this topic using a dwarf galaxy dominated sample of ~ 300 late-type galaxies in the 11 Mpc Local Volume.

We use a macrospin approximation and model the effect of finite temperature as a Boltzmann distribution of initial magnetization states (adiabatic limit). We compare three model spin-valves: a spin-valve with a free layer whose easy axis {{is parallel to the}} pinned layer magnetization (standard geometry), a pinned layer with magnetization tilted with respect to the free layer easy axis (pinned layer biasing), and a free layer whose magnetization is pulled away from easy axis by a hard axis bias (free layer biasing). In the conventional geometry, the switching durations follow a broad regular distribution, with an extended long tail comprising very long switching events. For the two biasing strategies, the switching durations follow a multiply-stepped distribution, reflecting the precessional nature of the switching, and the <b>statistical</b> <b>number</b> of precession cycles needed for reversal. We derive analytical criteria to avoid switching events lasting much longer than the average switching duration, in order to achieve the highest reproducibilities.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} of taking into account scattering of material parameters (zinc in this example) to perform sheet metal forming simulations. The approach described in this paper is efficiently pragmatic to consider as inputs the material parameters obtained during the industrial quality process. Large amount of collected data enables to obtain statistical evolution of the material law parameters and to determine afterwards the variability domain which is the final goal of this work. In order to get these parameters, an automatic calculation of material parameters (consistency, hardening coefficient and stress criterion for the formability as described by Jansen et al. (2013)) is developed in this work. Tensile tests have been performed in three directions (0 °, 45 ° and 90 °) and a Lagrangian interpolation was used for other orientations. In addition, scattering of the entire forming limit diagram is obtained from bulge tests performed for a sufficient <b>statistical</b> <b>number</b> of sheets. Based on this data, a numerical model integrating the scattering parameters was developed to build a statistical prediction of the stress failure criterion. All parameters of the material behavior law can be associated to the local calculations of the stress, strain, strain rate and temperature provided by a standard deterministic FEM computation and therefore giving a view of the failure rate of the process.

Second, the idea of Collective Dose, which presumes that extremely small doses in an exposed population can be added up to predict a <b>statistical</b> <b>number</b> of deaths. Since no radiation level is considered small enough to be harmless, the requirement of ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) naturally arises and is applied to ever-lower doses. These basic premises have never been adequately justified scientifically, and contradictory evidence has been dismissed. NCRP- 121, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements ’ 106 -page definitive report (NCRP 1995) {{on the use of}} LNT to calculate collective dose, justifies this position as follows: Few experimental studies, and essentially no human data, can be said to prove or even to provide direct support for the concept of collective dose with its implicit uncertainties of nonthreshold linearity and dose-rate independence with respect to risk. The best that can be said is that most studies do not provide quantitative data that, with statistical significance, contradict the concept of collective dose. Ultimately, confidence in the linear no-threshold dose-response relationship at low doses is based on our understanding of the basic mechanisms involved. …It is conceptually possible, but with a vanishingly small probability, that any of these effects could result from the passage of a single charged particle, causing damage to DNA that could be expressed as a mutation or small deletion. It is a result of this type of reasoning that a linear nonthreshold dose-response relationship cannot be excluded. [emphasis added] If this is the best that can be said in defense of the LNTH, then research yielding contradictory evidence should be encouraged and given very careful attention...|$|E
