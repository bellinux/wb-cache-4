The value of alphalac decreases with growth rate (60 % between 0. 67 and 2. 1 doublings/h) and after a nutritional <b>shift-up.</b> This decrease is presumed to reflect {{a decrease in the}} intracellular concentration of free active RNA polymerase after a <b>shift-up,</b> which implies that the increase in ribosome synthesis after a <b>shift-up</b> is due to an active induction of the ribosomal components...|$|E
40|$|A {{nutritional}} <b>shift-up</b> from glucose minimal {{medium to}} LB broth was previously shown {{to cause a}} division delay of about 20 min in synchronized cultures of Escherichia coli, and a similar delay was observed after a nutritional pulse (a <b>shift-up</b> followed rapidly by a return to glucose minimal medium). Using synchronized cultures, we show here that the pulse-induced division delay does not require protein synthesis during the period in LB broth, suggesting that a nonprotein signal is generated by the <b>shift-up</b> and transmitted to the cell division machinery. The cell division protein FtsZ, target of the SOS-associated division inhibitor SfiA (or SulA), seems {{to be involved in}} the postshift division delay. Mutants in which the FtsZ-SfiA interaction is reduced, either sfiA (loss of SfiA) or ftsZ(SfiB) (modification of FtsZ), have a 50 - to 60 -min division delay after a <b>shift-up.</b> Furthermore, after a nutritional pulse, the ftsZ(SfiB) mutant had only a 10 - to 16 -min delay.

40|$|Studies of {{upwelling}} {{centers in}} the eastern Pacific suggest that maximum rates of nitrate uptake (light and nutrient saturated) increase, or <b>shift-up,</b> as newly upwelled water moves downstream. The rate of <b>shift-up</b> appears {{to be related to}} irradiance and the ambient concentration of limiting nutrient at the time of upwelling. A mathematical model was developed to evaluate effects of irradiance and initial nitrate concentration on temporal patterns of <b>shift-up</b> and subsequent time scales of nutrient utilization over a range of simulated upwelling conditions. When rates consistent with field studies were used, complete <b>shift-up</b> was possible only under certain conditions, and the time scale was on the order of 7 - 10 d. These results are consistent with field observations. Increased initial nitrate concentrations resulted in more rapid depletion of the nutrient supply. Making acceleration of V,,, constant and independent of the nitrate concentration reversed the qualitative pattern of nutrient utilization and predicted longer time scales in the region of optimal growth (12 - 15 d) than have been observed in the field. Since changes in nitrogen-specific V,,,,, observed in situ may be due to downstream sinking of detrital nitrogen, a third hypothesis was evaluated, in which there was no <b>shift-up</b> in V,,,,,.

40|$|The time of {{replication}} of a bacterial plasmid, Flac, during the division cycle of Escherichia coli {{has been estimated}} in exponentially growing cultures and at various times after a shift from minimal medium to a richer medium (a <b>shift-up).</b> There is {{a variation in the}} cell age at which the capacity to synthesize β-galactosidase (β-D-galactoside galactohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 23) doubles (assumed to be a measure of the time at which the Flac plasmid replicates) when this capacity is measured at various times during the <b>shift-up,</b> and with increasing steady-state exponential growth rate. Cells growing at slow and moderate growth rates exhibit Flac replication {{in the middle of the}} division cycle. With increasing time after a <b>shift-up</b> or with increasing growth rate the plasmid replicates at earlier times, eventually at cell division, and finally in the older cells.

40|$|The syntheses {{of stable}} ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) and {{transfer}} RNA in bacteria {{depend on the}} concentration and activity of RNA polymerase and on the fraction of active RNA polymerase synthesizing stable RNA. These parameters were measured in Escherichia coli B/r after a nutritional <b>shift-up</b> from succinate-minimal to glucose-amino acids medium and were found to change in complex patterns during a 1 - to 2 -h period after the <b>shift-up</b> before reaching a final steady-state level characteristic for the postshift growth medium. The combined effect of these changes was an immediate, one-step increase in the exponential rate of stable RNA synthesis and thus of ribosome synthesis. This suggests that the distribution of transcribing RNA polymerase over ribosomal and nonribosomal genes and the polymerase activity are continuously adjusted during postshift growth to some growth-limiting reaction whose rate increases exponentially. It is proposed that this reaction is the production of amino-acylated transfer RNA and that is exponentially increasing rate results in part from a gradually increasing concentration of aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetases after a <b>shift-up.</b> This idea was tested and {{is supported by a}} computer simulation of a nutritional <b>shift-up...</b>|$|E
40|$|Temperature-sensitive mutants of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 {{representing}} eight DNA-negative complementation groups were grouped into the following three categories based on the viral DNA synthesis patterns after <b>shift-up</b> from the permissive to the nonpermissive temperature and after shift-down from the nonpermissive to the permissive temperature in the presence and absence of inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis. (i) Viral DNA synthesis was inhibited after <b>shift-up</b> in cells infected with tsB, tsH, and tsJ. After shift-down, tsB- and tsH-infected cells synthesized viral DNA {{in the absence of}} de novo RNA and protein synthesis whereas tsJ-infected cells synthesized no viral DNA in the absence of protein synthesis. The B, H, and J proteins appear to be continuously required for the synthesis of viral DNA. (ii) Viral DNA synthesis continued after <b>shift-up</b> in cells infected with tsD and tsK whereas no viral DNA was synthesized after shift-down in the absence of RNA and protein synthesis. Mutants tsD and tsK appear to be defective in early regulatory functions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Nutritional <b>shift-up</b> {{experiments}} have revealed many important macromolecular interactions in bacteria. It {{has been shown}} that RNA synthesis can be dissociated from protein and DNA synthesis. The rates of protein synthesis were found to be, at a given temperature, strictly dependent on the numbers of mature ribosomes present. DNA synthesis remained unaffected by the increased rates of RNA and protein synthesis for some time after <b>shift-up.</b> The rate of cell division was not coupled to the new rates of RNA, DNA, and protein synthesis for one pre-shift generation time after the shift. Recent experiments with yeast, however, have indicated that the rates of DNA synthesis and cell division are tightly coupled to the rates of RNA and protein synthesis after nutritional <b>shift-up.</b> Our {{experiments have}} demonstrated that these results are in error. The rates of cell division are maintained in yeast for one generation time after shift. Also a rate maintenance phenomenon is observed with respect to DNA synthesis. These results indicate that the times of genome replication and the time for cell division to occur are constant between generation times of 120 300 minutes.

During amino acid and pyrimidine starvation, cell mass and RNA showed little increase, whereas total DNA increased 11 to 17 %. After a shift from broth medium to a minimal defined medium, increase in RNA and protein remained at the preshift rate before assuming a lower rate. DNA increase remained at an intermediate rate during shift-down, and then dropped to a low rate. During <b>shift-up</b> from minimal to broth medium, increase in cell number, protein, and DNA showed varying lag periods before increasing to the new rate characteristic of broth medium; each of these quantities exhibited a step sometime in the first 2 hr after transfer to rich medium, suggesting a partial synchronous division.

40|$|When Escherichia coli 15 T- cells growing {{exponentially}} at 70 - to 80 -min doubling {{times are}} subjected to a nutritional <b>shift-up</b> via glucose addition, cell division continues at the preshift rate for about 70 min (rate maintenance). The same cells growing at doubling times of 120 min or longer, however, begin to divide at a new faster rate immediately upon glucose addition. In both the rate maintenance and immediate division situations, cell mass, as measured by optical density (OD), begins to increase immediately upon <b>shift-up.</b> Consequently, the OD/cell pattern differs in the two growth-rate transitions. During rate maintenance, the OD/cell ratio increases dramatically for 60 to 70 min, and then slows appreciably and approaches the OD/cell characteristic of the new medium. During immediate division situations, the OD/cell increases only slightly for the first 180 +/- min; then {{the rate of increase}} accelerates but does not stop at the OD/cell characteristic of the new medium. Immediate division upon nutritional <b>shift-up</b> apparently depends upon initial doubling times in excess of 115 to 120 min and provision of a readily metabolized carbon source supporting doubling times of about 40 min.

Analysis of the labeled DNA, at different times after the <b>shift-up,</b> by alkaline sucrose gradient centrifugation showed that unit-length DNA was formed after infection with mutant ts 3 (132), suggesting a role of protein p 3 in the initiation of replication. A similar result was obtained after ts 2 (98) infection. On the contrary, mutant ts 5 (17) did not produce unit-length phage DNA even at very late times after the <b>shift-up,</b> consistent with the possibility that this mutation affects an elongation (or maturation) process. Mutant ts 6 (1360) gave rise to unit-length DNA late after the <b>shift-up</b> suggesting that the mutation might affect an elongation or maturation process but that either it is leaky or that its function may be slowly replaced by a bacterial function. Infection of B. subtilis, under restrictive conditions, with sus mutants in cistron 3 produced unit-length θ 29 DNA, both in neutral and alkaline sucrose gradients, suggesting that the parental protein itself present in the sus 3 mutants is able to initiate the viral replication.

40|$|To {{gain insight}} on the interrelationships of the {{cellular}} environment, {{the properties of}} growth, and cell cycle progression, we analyzed the dynamic reactions of individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to changes and manipulations of their surroundings. We used a new flow cytometric approach which allows, in asynchronous growing S. cerevisiae populations, tagging of both the cell age and the cell protein content of cells belonging to the different cell cycle set points. Since the cell protein content is a good estimation of the cell size, {{it is possible to}} follow the kinetics of the cell size increase during cell cycle progression. The analysis of the findings obtained indicates that both during a nutritional <b>shift-up</b> (from ethanol to glucose) and following the addition of cyclic AMP (cAMP), two important delays are induced. The preexisting cells that at the moment of the nutritional <b>shift-up</b> were cycling before the Start phase delay their entrance into S phase, while cells that were cycling after Start are delayed in their exit from the cycle.

40|$|During glucose-lactose diauxie lag, Escherichia coli synthesizes {{ribonucleic acid}} (RNA) at about 7 % {{of the rate}} in {{exponentially}} growing cells. RNA synthesis could be restored to the log-phase rate within 3 min after the addition of glucose to the culture (<b>shift-up).</b> This stimulation occurred equally well {{in the presence of}} chloramphenicol and therefore did not require the synthesis of new proteins. RNA synthesis could also be stimulated by the addition of glycerol, but only after a delay of 15 to 20 min. Glycerol stimulation occurred more rapidly in cells preadapted by prior growth on glycerol and occurred immediately in a mutant (glpR) constitutive for the enzymes of glycerol catabolism. Measurement of a parameter related to the rate of initiation of stable (ribosomal and transfer) RNA chains showed that the initiation of transcription of these stable RNA species was completely inhibited during the diauxie lag, but could be restored to the rate characteristic of log-phase cells by <b>shift-up</b> with glucose. Sucrose gradient analysis of RNA purified from cells after a glucose <b>shift-up</b> indicated an increased rate of accumulation of the ribosomal and transfer RNA species. It is proposed that a specific mechanism to inhibit the initiation of transcription of ribosomal and transfer RNA operates during diauxie lag. This inhibitory mechanism is governed by the level of cellular energy resources insofar as the inhibition is readily reversed by metabolizable energy sources...|$|E

Strain JV- 9 was temperature sensitive for initiation by glucose alone, and strain JV- 10 was temperature sensitive for initiation by glucose, L-leucine, L-proline, KBr, or calcium dipicolinate. The kinetics of initiation were followed after two kinds of temperature change (<b>shift-up</b> and shift-down) experiments. Mutant spores incubated for different times at 46 C and then shifted down to 30 C showed no significant differences in the rates of absorbance decrease, i. e., no stimulation or inhibition.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a mutational {{analysis of the}} interaction between the beta and sigma subunits of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. The rpoD 800 mutant has a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype because the mutant sigma 70 polypeptide is not stable at a high temperature. Some rpoB mutations, including rpoB 114, enhanced the temperature sensitivity of the rpoD 800 mutant. We determined the mechanism by which the rpoB 114 rpoD 800 double mutant becomes hyper-temperature sensitive for growth. We found that the levels of the mutant sigma 70 in the rpoB 114 rpoD 800 mutant were dramatically reduced compared to that in the rpoD 800 mutant after temperature <b>shift-up.</b> The rate of synthesis of the sigma 70 polypeptide was reduced in the rpoB 114 rpoD 800 double mutant compared to the rpoD 800 mutant, whereas the half-life of the mutant sigma 70 polypeptide after temperature <b>shift-up</b> was the same in both strains. We conclude that because of the reduction of expression of rpoD 800 by rpoB 114, in concert with the intrinsic instability of the mutant sigma 70 polypeptide, the amount of holoenzyme containing sigma 70 becomes limiting upon temperature <b>shift-up.</b> This results in the hyper-temperature sensitivity of the rpoB 114 rpoD 800 double mutant. Furthermore, the effect of rpoB 114 on the expression of sigma 70 is independent of the rpoD 800 allele and is at the transcriptional level. In vitro transcription assays showed that the mutant RNA polymerase RpoB 114 was defective in transcribing the two major promoters of the rpoD operon specifically. The effects of these rpoB mutations on gene expression are discussed...|$|E

The temperature-sensitive defect, which was reversible on shift-down {{in the absence}} of protein synthesis, was expressed as early as 2 h postinfection, and the results of density-labeling experiments are in agreement with at least a DNA replication initiation block. On <b>shift-up,</b> after allowing viral DNA synthesis at permissive temperatures, the newly synthesized viral DNA and the mature viral DNA were cleaved into fragments which sedimented as a broad peak with a mean coefficient of 10 - 12 S. This cleavage was more marked in the presence of hydroxyurea as the DNA synthesis inhibitor. Parental DNA in infected cells was degraded to a much lesser extent regardless of the incubation temperature. In contrast, the parental DNA was strongly degraded when early gene expression was permitted at 33 degrees C before <b>shift-up</b> to 39. 5 degrees C. Furthermore, cellular DNA was also degraded at 39. 5 degrees C in ts 111 -infected cells, the rate of cleavage being related to the multiplicity of infection.

40|$|During {{inhibition}} of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in Bacillus subtilis 168 Thy-minus Tryp-minus, {{the rate of}} length extension is constant. A nutritional <b>shift-up</b> during thymine starvation causes an acceleration in the linear rate of length extension.

The steady-state rates of nuclear division and length extension are reached at approximately the same time. The ratio of average cell length to numbers of nuclei per cell in exponential cultures is constant over a fourfold range of growth rates. These observations are consistent with: (i) surface growth zones which operate at a constant rate of length extension under any one growth condition, but which operate at an absolute rate proportional to the growth rate of the culture, (ii) a doubling in number of growth zones at nuclear segregation, and (iii) a requirement for deoxyribonucleic acid replication for the doubling in a number of sites...|$|E

40|$|The ftsZ gene of Escherichia coli, {{which lies}} in a cluster of cell {{division}} genes at 2 min on the genetic map, codes for a protein which is thought to {{play a key role}} in triggering cell division. Using an ftsZ::lacZ operon fusion, we have studied the transcription of the ftsZ gene under conditions in which cell division was either inhibited or synchronized in the bacterial population. In ftsZ, ftsA, ftsQ, and ftsI (or pbpB) mutants, there was no change in the differential rate of expression of the ftsZ gene in nonpermissive conditions, when cell division was completely blocked. Although the FtsZ protein is thought to be limiting for cell division, in synchronized cultures the ftsZ gene was expressed not only at the moment of septation initiation but throughout the cell cycle. Its expression, however, was not exponential but linear, with a rapid doubling in rate at a specific cell age; this age, about 20 min after division in a 60 -min cycle, was different from the age at which the ftsZ::lacZ operon was duplicated. However, it was close to the age at which replication initiated and at which the rate of phospholipid synthesis doubled. During the transient division inhibition after a nutritional <b>shift-up,</b> ftsZ transcription again became linear, with two doublings in rate at intervals equal to the mass doubling time in the rich medium; it adopted the exponential rate typical of rich medium about 60 min after the <b>shift-up,</b> just before the bacterial population resumed cell division.

The synthesis of the lacZ fusion protein encoded by the phage showed the expected inhibition during oversynthesis of ribosomal protein L 4, the autogenous regulatory protein of the S 10 operon. Moreover, the fusion gene responded to a nutritional <b>shift-up</b> {{in the same way that}} genuine ribosomal protein genes did.

These results suggest that, at least for the 11 -gene S 10 ribosomal protein operon, additional regulatory processes are required to coordinate the synthesis of ribosomal proteins with cell growth rate and, furthermore, that sequences downstream of the proximal one and one-half genes of the operon are involved in this control...|$|E

To describe the regulation of these enzymes during a nutritional <b>shift-up,</b> use was made of the recent identification of polypeptide chains of several synthetases in whole cell lysates resolved by the O'Farrell two-dimensional gel system. A culture growing in acetate minimal medium was shifted to glucose-rich medium and pulse labeled with [3 H]leucine and [3 H]isoleucine for 30 - or 6 -s intervals during the 20 min after the shift. After mixing with a uniformly [35 S]sulfate-labeled reference culture, the samples were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The 3 H/ 35 S ratio in the resolved synthetase polypeptides provided an accurate estimation of their transient rates of synthesis. Five aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetases (those for argnine, glycine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and valine) exhibited an increase in formation within 30 to 90 s after the <b>shift-up.</b> The magnitude of the increases corresponded to the final steady-state values and were reached within 2 to 3 min. The addition to rifampin revealed that the increase in the differential rate of valyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase formation was the result of increased messenger ribonucleic acid transcription and not of a relaxation of some translation restriction...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and protein was followed in cultures of Escherichia coli B/r during exponential growth in different media and for 2 h after a nutritional <b>shift-up</b> from succinate minimal medium (growth rate [mu 1] = 0. 67 doublings per h) to glucose plus amino acids medium (mu 2 = 3. 14 doublings per h). During postshift {{growth of the}} culture, the amounts of RNA (R), DNA (D), and protein (P) increased such that the ratios of the increments (delta R/delta P; delta D/delta P) were constants (k 1, k 2). This implies that the rates of {{accumulation of}} nuclei 1 :k 2 : 1. These constants change from their preshift value to their final postshift value (i. e., k 1 and k 2) {{within a few minutes}} after the shift. k 1 {{is a function of the}} activity of ribosomes, whereas k 2 is related to the initiation of rounds of DNA replication. These parameters and the observed change in the doubling time of RNA (= mu 2 /mu 1) were used to derive kinetic equations that describe the accumulation of DNA, RNA, protein, and cell mass during the 2 - to 3 -h transition period after a <b>shift-up.</b> The calculated kinetics agree closely with the observed kinetics...|$|E
40|$|Temperature-sensitive {{simian virus}} (SV 40) -{{transformed}} 3 T 3 cells (tsSV 3 T 3), which express the transformed phenotype when growing at 32 C {{but not at}} 39 C, were used to study changes in growth behavior during <b>shift-up</b> or shift-down experiments. In cultures of tsSV 3 T 3 cells which had reached or were beyond monolayer density at 32 C, DNA synthesis reached very low levels within 24 to 48 h after <b>shift-up.</b> When cells which {{had been allowed to}} grow to high densities at 32 C were shifted to 39 C, not only cell growth stopped, but within two to three days the cultures shed a large number of cells into the medium. These cells were nonviable, and shedding stopped only when the number of cells attached had been reduced to that characteristic of the saturation density at 39 C. The remaining attached cells were viable and after the shift to 32 C were again able to grow from the monolayer to high cell densities. This behavior has been compared with that of normal 3 T 3 and wild-type SV 3 T 3 cells under different conditions. We have also isolated new tsSV 3 T 3 lines, using cells which had been infected with non-mutagenized wild-type SV 40. This further demonstrates that the temperature sensitivity of these lines is due to a cellular rather than a viral mutation...|$|E
40|$|A luciferase-based {{reporter}} {{system for}} the expression of the toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 gene (tst) of Staphylococcus aureus FRI 1187 was used in continuous culture to determine whether high cell density on transient shift-down or <b>shift-up</b> of specific growth rate (μ) induced expression of tst. Little expression occurred at steady state at a low dilution rate (D) and in a transient period of increasing μ. However, a rapid and approximately 130 -fold increase in expression occurred during a transient shift-down of μ. These findings suggest reduction of μ is a key element in the control of tst expressio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fastest abacus adder with modified parallel addition module. The Chinese abacus adder was previously presented using <b>shift-up</b> module and parallel addition module that compose thermometric conversion. In this paper, we present {{improvement in the}} parallel addition adder by combining both existing modules without thermometric conversion. The result shows that the speed of 8 -bit modified abacus adder architecture is 17 % faster than existing parallel addition adder. We compare the adder in terms of delay by using Altera Quartus II tool. Altera Cyclone II device is applied for synthesis and simulation of the adder...|$|E
