40|$|Abstract — Monitoring of {{environmental}} phenomena with embedded networked sensing confronts {{the challenges of}} both unpredictable variability in the spatial distribution of phenomena, coupled with demands for a high spatial sampling rate in three dimensions. For example, low distortion mapping of critical solar radiation properties in forest environments may require two-dimensional spatial sampling rates of greater than 10 samples/m 2 over transects exceeding 1000 m 2. Clearly, adequate sampling coverage of such a transect requires an impractically large number of sensing nodes. A new approach, Networked Infomechanical System (NIMS), has been introduced to combine autonomous-articulated and static sensor nodes enabling sufficient <b>spatiotemporal</b> <b>sampling</b> density over large transects to meet a general set {{of environmental}} mapping demands. This paper describes our work on a critical parts of NIMS, the Task Allocation module. We present our methodologies and the two basic greedy Task Allocation policies- based on time of the task arrival (Time policy) and distance from the robot to the task (Distance policy). We present results from NIMS deployed in a forest reserve and from a lab testbed. The results show that both policies are adequate for the task of <b>spatiotemporal</b> <b>sampling,</b> but also complement each other.

40|$|The single Kronecker product (KP) {{model for}} the spatiotemporal {{covariance}} of MEG residuals is extended to a sum of Kronecker products. This sum of KP is estimated such that it approximates the <b>spatiotemporal</b> <b>sample</b> covariance best in matrix norm. Contrary to the single KP, this extension allows for describing multiple, independent phenomena in the ongoing background activity. Whereas the single KP model can be interpreted by assuming that background activity is generated by randomly distributed dipoles with certain spatial and temporal characteristics, the sum model can be physiologically interpreted by assuming a composite of such processes. Taking enough terms into account, the <b>spatiotemporal</b> <b>sample</b> covariance matrix can be described exactly by this extended model. In the estimation of the sum of KP model, {{it appears that the}} sum of the first 2 KP describes between 67 % and 93 %. Moreover, these first two terms describe two physiological processes in the background activity: focal, frequency-specific alpha activity, and more widespread non-frequency-specific activity. Furthermore, temporal nonstationarities due to trial-to-trial variations are not clearly visible in the first two terms, and, hence, play only a minor role in the sample covariance matrix in terms of matrix power. Considering the dipole localization, the single KP model appears to describe around 80 % of the noise and seems therefore adequate. The emphasis of further improvement of localization accuracy should be on improving the source model rather than the covariance model. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Traditionally, under appropriate hypotheses, any x can be recovered from its samples on Z and A can be recovered by the classical techniques of deconvolution. In this paper, we will exploit the spatiotemporal correlation and propose a new <b>spatiotemporal</b> <b>sampling</b> scheme to recover A and x that allows to sample the evolving states x,Ax, [...] ., A^N- 1 x on a sub-lattice of Z, and thus achieve the spatiotemporal trade off.
