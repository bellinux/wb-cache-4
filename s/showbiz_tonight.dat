25|$|Aiken {{has been}} a {{dedicated}} advocate for education and for children's causes. His interest in autism issues led him, along with Diane Bubel (whose son Michael is diagnosed with autism and was tutored by Aiken), to found the National Inclusion Project (formerly the Bubel/Aiken Foundation), which supports the integration {{of children with disabilities}} into the life environment of their non-disabled peers. The Foundation runs summer camps which reflect its mission, and also presents Able to Serve awards to support the volunteer efforts of children with physical and mental disabilities. In July 2005, Raleigh's WRAL-TV reported on an internet campaign mounted by critics questioning how Aiken's foundation used its money. WRAL news hired an independent accountant who reported that program services totaled $920,000 in 2004—around 85 cents on every dollar donated—which is considered a solid percentage compared to other charities. CNN picked up the story, and Aiken appeared on <b>Showbiz</b> <b>Tonight</b> to provide details about the Foundation's programs. In late 2004, the Foundation was awarded a $500,000 grant by the US government to develop a K–12 model for inclusion in community service projects to be used in schools across the country. In addition, State Farm granted $1.5million to the Foundation to help develop a primary education curriculum focused on teaching social and life skills through service to children of all levels of ability.|$|E

[...] After the episode {{was scheduled to be}} rebroadcast, Trey Parker and Matt Stone were interviewed on CNN's <b>Showbiz</b> <b>Tonight,</b> where they stated that all of the controversy increased publicity for the episode. Parker was quoted: [...] "But it's really like a publicist couldn't have orchestrated this any better for us. You know what I mean? It's like it's been phenomenal.

[...] In the same interview, Hammer asked television host Wendy Walsh of The Doctors about the storyline, to which she responded, [...] "The main theme of the show was about this poor 'stupid' woman who was too dumb to leave her relationship. And domestic violence is far more complicated than that. We're watching someone rationalize a domestic violence relationship {{and this is the}} kind of thought process that actually goes on in real life. It’s not satire anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's <b>Showbiz</b> <b>Tonight,</b> Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing.

2500|$|In 1975, Laughlin {{released}} The Master Gunfighter, {{a western}} {{set in the}} 1840s, detailing {{the plight of the}} Chumash people. Laughlin grew a full beard for the film and his character fought with both a 12-shot revolver and a samurai sword. Although it did reasonably well at the box office, critics were not pleased with the film. He returned to the Billy Jack franchise in 1977. However, the fourth entry in the series, Billy Jack Goes to Washington was a failure because of distribution problems, and it proved to be Laughlin's final film as a director. Laughlin blamed individuals within the United States government for the failure of the picture, telling CNN's <b>Showbiz</b> <b>Tonight</b> in 2005:At a private screening, Senator Vance Hartke [...] got up, because it was about how the Senate was bought out by the nuclear industry.

Other former contestants who came to publicly back Clark's claims included second season semi-finalist Nasheka Sidall, who, it was stated on Primetime Live, first heard [...] "whispers" [...] about the affair soon after her time on the show as a contestant, and fellow second season finalist Trenyce, who corroborated Clark's claims on CNN's <b>Showbiz</b> <b>Tonight.</b> Clark also points to the fact in his e-book that his Idol roommates Ricky Smith and Ruben Studdard were never asked for their views on the validity of his claims, but that third season winner Fantasia Barrino was questioned as to her opinion about Clark's allegations, which Clark saw as an attempt by Fox or its investigators to use Barrino's following to bias the public against Clark.
