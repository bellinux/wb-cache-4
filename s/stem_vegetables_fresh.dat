Innovative products and processes and competitive advantage can be gained by the creation and use of unique resources as an outcome of cooperation between producers and complementary actors in local clusters. However, locally clustered producers do not sell to open markets but instead need access to value chains governed by lead firms: the large European retail chains, which decide the rules and conditions of participation. The study claims the necessity to combine aspects from cluster theory with ideas from global value chain approach to discover elements in European <b>fresh</b> <b>vegetable</b> business that could enable local producers to gain competitive advantages in the global market.
