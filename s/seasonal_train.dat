30|$|Limitations of {{the present}} study relate to the limited {{cumulative}} number of subjects, which provided a low explanatory power, and the classification of the different <b>seasonal</b> <b>training</b> phases. In the literature, several similar-sounding terms have been used to describe time points of data collection in athletes. However, assigning the appropriate classification into one of the three <b>seasonal</b> <b>training</b> phases is essential and has a great impact on the final analysis. Furthermore, if articles reported several time points of data collection within one <b>seasonal</b> <b>training</b> phase, we included only the first time point into the analysis in order to assure standardization and avoid selection bias. The exclusion of other time points might have led to the loss of interesting data.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{distinction}} between bus and train service, {{with the exception of}} the <b>seasonal</b> <b>train</b> service to Niagara Falls: passengers paying single-ride tickets and travelling by train to Niagara Falls are assessed a $3 surcharge on top of existing fares.|$|E

50|$|The {{service was}} first {{introduced}} on 30 June 1986, as a <b>seasonal</b> <b>train</b> named simply Moonlight (ムーンライト), to directly compete with overnight bus services between Tokyo and Niigata introduced the previous year. The locomotive-hauled rolling stock was replaced by EMUs from September 1987. The service became a regular daily service from March 1988.|$|E
30|$|In this {{systematic}} review, {{we examined}} fluctuations in TEE, energy intake, and/or body composition in endurance athletes across the training season. We found that some, but not all, of the investigated outcomes {{depended on the}} time point of data assessment during <b>seasonal</b> <b>training.</b> TEE was highest during the competition phase and higher than energy intake in all <b>seasonal</b> <b>training</b> phases. Alterations in TEE {{did not lead to}} adaptations of energy intake in females, whereas in males, a higher absolute energy intake during the competition phase was observed. The finding that male endurance athletes demonstrated the highest fat mass values during the competition phase and the lowest FFM during the transition phase seems to be an anomaly from the pooling of data.|$|R
30|$|In males, the {{absolute}} energy intake was higher during the competition phase {{compared to the}} preparation phase (p[*]<[*] 0.001), whereas relative energy intake was unchanged (p[*]=[*] 0.553). In females, neither {{the absolute}} (p[*]=[*] 0.735) nor relative (p[*]=[*] 0.951) energy intake was different between the two <b>seasonal</b> <b>training</b> phases.|$|R

It is a <b>seasonal</b> <b>train,</b> only operating during the non-summer months.

The northbound train operates on Saturdays, while the southbound train operates on Sundays.|$|E
50|$|The Hocking Valley Scenic Railway {{began as}} part of the {{historic}} Hocking Valley Railway in the early 1870s. Today, the railway offers scenic excursions from Nelsonville to Logan, traversing the Hocking Hills. Known for their specialty trains, the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway hosts thousands of passengers each year. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>train</b> rides include: Easter Train, Robbery Trains, North Pole Express, Fall Foliage Trips, Haunted Hills Train, Santa Train, Caboose Train, Great Hocking Valley Train Pull and wine trains. During World War II, the original Hocking Valley Railroad ran 138 steam locomotives, 70 passenger cars and 15,000 freight cars along 340 route-miles of track. Today, the trains of the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway again pull out of Nelsonville, for pleasure this time, to take passengers on leisurely glides through beautiful, historic Southeastern Ohio.Two train rides depart from the railroad depot at U.S. Rt. 33 and the Hocking Parkway Drive on Saturdays and Sundays, Memorial Day Weekend through the end of October, in addition to the <b>seasonal</b> <b>train</b> rides. The Nelsonville Yards was once the busiest railroad yard in the entire state of Ohio.|$|E
50|$|New and {{improved}} GO {{service is a}} top transit priority listed in the regional transportation plan. Since 2009, GO Transit has introduced <b>seasonal</b> <b>train</b> service to Barrie and Niagara Falls, extended service to Kitchener and Lake Simcoe, opened four new stations at Acton, Guelph Central, Allandale Waterfront, and Hamilton West Harbour. Since June 2013, GO Trains along the Lakeshore rail lines run every 30 minutes, making the biggest expansion in GO Transit history.|$|E
40|$|Endurance athletes perform periodized {{training}} {{in order to}} prepare for main competitions and maximize performance. However, the coupling between alterations of total energy expenditure (TEE), energy intake, and body composition during different <b>seasonal</b> <b>training</b> phases is unclear. So far, no systematic review has assessed fluctuations in TEE, energy intake, and/or body composition in endurance athletes across the training season. The {{purpose of this study}} was to (1) systematically analyze TEE, energy intake, and body composition in highly trained athletes of various endurance disciplines and of both sexes and (2) analyze fluctuations in these parameters across the training season. An electronic database search was conducted on the SPORTDiscus and MEDLINE (January 1990 - 31 January 2015) databases using a combination of relevant keywords. Two independent reviewers identified potentially relevant studies. Where a consensus was not reached, a third reviewer was consulted. Original research articles that examined TEE, energy intake, and/or body composition in 18 - 40 -year-old endurance athletes and reported the <b>seasonal</b> <b>training</b> phases of data assessment were included in the review. Articles were excluded if body composition was assessed by skinfold measurements, TEE was assessed by questionnaires, or data could not be split between the sexes. Two reviewers assessed the quality of studies independently. Data on subject characteristics, TEE, energy intake, and/or body composition were extracted from the included studies. Subjects were categorized according to their sex and endurance discipline and each study allocated a weight within categories based on the number of subjects assessed. Extracted data were used to calculate weighted means and standard deviations for parameters of TEE, energy intake, and/or body composition. From 3589 citations, 321 articles were identified as potentially relevant, with 82 meeting all of the inclusion criteria. TEE of endurance athletes was significantly higher during the competition phase than during the preparation phase (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and significantly higher than energy intake in both phases (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). During the competition phase, both body mass and fat-free mass were significantly higher compared to other <b>seasonal</b> <b>training</b> phases (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Limitations of the present study included insufficient data being available for all <b>seasonal</b> <b>training</b> phases and thus low explanatory power of single parameters. Additionally, the classification of the different <b>seasonal</b> <b>training</b> phases has to be discussed. Male and female endurance athletes show important <b>training</b> <b>seasonal</b> fluctuations in TEE, energy intake, and body composition. Therefore, dietary intake recommendations should take into consideration other factors including the actual training load, TEE, and body composition goals of the athlete...|$|R
