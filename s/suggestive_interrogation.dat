50|$|In {{common law}} systems {{that rely on}} {{testimony}} by witnesses, a leading question or <b>suggestive</b> <b>interrogation</b> {{is a question that}} suggests the particular answer or contains the information the examiner is looking to have confirmed. Their use is restricted in eliciting testimony in court, to reduce the ability of the examiner to direct or influence the evidence presented. Depending on the circumstances, leading questions can be objectionable or proper.|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on notions of ‘intermediality’, {{examining}} {{the ways in which}} Marivaux’s novel La Vie de Marianne (1731 - 42) has been pictured through time in the light of this concept. Focusing on a series of episodes involving Marianne and her putative benefactor M. de Climal, I explore the relationship between text and image in different sets of illustrations for the novel, and in the film adaptation Marianne directed by Benoît Jacquot (1995). Not only do these different transpositions suggest complex forms of reception of Marivaux’s text, but in their anticipation of and engagement with other media (theatre, painting, illustration, cinema), they also provide a <b>suggestive</b> and rich <b>interrogation</b> of the conditions of theatricality and {{of what it means to}} become a ‘spectacle’...|$|R
50|$|Unethical or unskilled police {{officers}} can use <b>suggestive</b> questioning in <b>interrogation</b> rooms. Such interrogators use {{different kinds of}} techniques and questions {{in order to get}} people to confess. They use response framing when getting people to falsely confess. This is when they purposely limit certain answers and suggest others. For example, they would ask someone if they were at the house at 1, 2, or 3 o’clock, forcing them to think it had to have been one of those choices. It causes people to recall things from the prompt instead of their memories. Also, interrogators use stereotype induction, which is when they tell the witness only negative characteristics of the alleged perpetrator. Part of stereotype induction is the incriminating condition where everything the witness says is labeled as bad. The detective would slightly shake his head or tell the witness to try again. This contrasts with another interrogating option of using a neutral interview technique, which includes both the bad and good aspects of the perpetrator.|$|R
40|$|<b>Suggestive</b> or {{misleading}} <b>interrogation</b> techniques {{may have}} the effect that innocent people start to remember having committed a serious crime. Confessions are therefore not the best possible evidence, especially not when {{it is obvious that}} the interrogation contained elements of suggestion and deception. The problem is illustrated by a case that has become famous in The Netherlands, because two innocent men were imprisoned for about eight years, after obviously false confessions. The confessions were obtained during long and repeated interrogations in which various types of psychological deception were used. In the end, the amount of contradiction, and even of sheer impossibilities, made it clear that the confessions were false and the men innocent. Some of the literature on the creation of false memories is reviewed. It is argued that the practice of criminal investigation may elicit even stronger effects, because empirical research is constrained by ethical limits. The objective of criminal investigation seems to put no limit on what is deemed acceptable, even though we know quite well that the elicitation of false confessions is a serious risk. European agreements about criminal interrogation techniques may provide an effective protection against undesirable practices; but it will not be easy to convince the European legislators of this. ...|$|R
