50|$|<b>Submucous</b> <b>Resection</b> (Submucosal Resection, SMR) of {{the nose}} is a {{surgical}} procedure during which the bony structures of the turbinate are partially removed from below the mucous membrane.It is usually intended to treat a deviated septum causing chronic nasal airway obstruction or chronic nosebleeds. Other reasons include nasal obstruction due to allergy or chronic sinus infections which have not responded to other treatments. SMR may be required for another nasal sinus surgery, when the deviated septum makes the access to other parts {{of the nose}} difficult. Sometimes it is performed as part of a cleft lip and palate repair.|$|E

40|$|Publisher’s {{permission}} requested and denied. The rhinologist {{is commonly}} consulted by {{a patient who}} has breathing problems due to a deviated septum, combined with a nasal deformity. A number of patients desire to have the septal deviation corrected {{at the same time}} as an operation to improve cosmesis. Previously this problem was dealt with in two stages. Originally the rhinoplasty preceded the <b>submucous</b> <b>resection</b> of the septum, for the reason that a later rhinoplasty and removal of dorsal hump would open into an excised area of the nasal septum and cause saddling. With experience this complication was found not to occur and for many years a <b>submucous</b> <b>resection</b> has preceded a rhinoplasty by a few weeks. Today, the surgery for these deformities is quite often performed in one stage. It is still not clear to what extent this can be safely done without endangering the support of the nose.

50|$|Septoplasty sep′tō·plas′tē(Etymology: L, saeptum, septum; Gk, πλάσσειν plassein - to shape), or {{alternatively}} <b>submucous</b> septal <b>resection</b> and septal reconstruction, is a corrective surgical procedure done to straighten the nasal septum, the partition {{between the two}} nasal cavities. Ideally, the septum should run {{down the center of}} the nose. When it deviates into one of the cavities, it narrows that cavity and impedes airflow. Deviated nasal septum or “crooked” internal nose can occur at childbirth or as the result of an injury or other trauma. If the wall that functions as a separator of both sides of the nose is tilted towards one side at a degree greater than 50%, it might cause difficulty breathing. Often the inferior turbinate on the opposite side enlarges, which is termed compensatory hypertrophy. Deviations of the septum can lead to nasal obstruction. Most surgeries are completed in 60 minutes or less, while the recovery time could be up to several weeks. Septoplasty is sometimes done with rhinoplasty for cosmetic correction of the deformities of the external nasal framework.|$|R
30|$|Our {{data suggest}} no {{difference}} in observed pregnancy and delivery rates according {{to the type of}} submucous myomas after myomectomy, and this has also been reported in the literature [17]. The bleeding symptoms disappeared in 84 % of patients and hysteroscopic myomectomy offered long-term improvement in the menstrual pattern and patient satisfaction, as is also reported by others [28]. Appropriate selection of patients (with no multiple myomas and no deep myomas penetrating the uterine wall) is essential for the success of the procedures, which were performed as outpatient surgery in most cases. Depending {{on the size of the}} intramural part of a submucosal myoma, one- or two-step surgery was required and has been reported [29, 30], while GnRH agonists proved useful in reducing myoma size and expelling the myoma inside the uterine cavity, as has also been established elsewhere [31]. The recurrence rate of the procedure was 8 % 1  year after the initial procedure, a percentage also observed by others [19]. Hysteroscopic <b>submucous</b> myoma <b>resection</b> seems to increase pregnancy rates in patients with Type 0 or Type I myomas. Myomectomy efficacy has not been statistically proven, but almost 75 % of patients became pregnant 12  months after surgery.|$|R
30|$|The new special skills module {{beginning}} in August 2007 specifies the {{minimum number of}} cases that should ideally be performed in each procedure for a trainee to be signed as competent (Fig.  2). Ideally, a person should perform over 20 polypectomies, over 10 transcervical endometrial resection of endometrium (TCRE) first-generation procedures, over 10  second-generation TCRE procedures and over 15 <b>submucous</b> fibroid <b>resections,</b> giving an overall of over 50 operative hysteroscopy procedures. As with regards to diagnostic hysteroscopy procedures, the minimum number of cases that a trainee needs to carry out {{in order to be}} signed off as competent is 50. So, assuming that a trainee performs the minimum number of operative and diagnostic hysteroscopy cases necessary to pass the module, he would need to carry out over 55 operative hysteroscopy cases and over 50 diagnostic hysteroscopy cases, i.e. the ratio of operative to diagnostic hysteroscopies would be 55 to 50, which is equivalent to 53 % operative and 47 % diagnostic. The results of the survey suggest that the average trainee performs 72.2 % diagnostic hysteroscopy in comparison to only 27.8 % operative hysteroscopy. This would suggest that, although the trainees may find it easy to be signed off as competent in diagnostic hysteroscopy, they would struggle in getting signed off as being competent in operative hysteroscopy in one year.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a modification of}} the standard Le Fort I maxillotomy {{in favor of a}} unilateral palatal hinge flap. Used in combination with a partial medical maxillectomy, <b>submucous</b> <b>resection</b> of the nasal septum, and contralateral inferior turbinectomy, this approach provides direct access to the entire nasal cavity, ipsilateral maxillary antrum, pterygopalatine fossa, nasopharynx, clivus, and first two cervical vertebrae. Use of the palatal hinge serves both to maintain palatal vascularity and eliminates the need for intermaxillary fixation. Facial incisions are avoided through a midfacial degloving approach. A variety of other surgical techniques used to access the central skull base are critically reviewed and compared with this new technique...|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of 34 {{patients}} with sarcoidosis affecting the upper respiratory tract and nose, 26 had lupus pernio (LP) and 17 had sarcoidosis of the upper respiratory tract (SURT). In nine patients these features coexisted. A patient presenting with SURT carried a 50 % risk of developing LP although one feature could be present without the other. Both were disorders of women of the child-bearing years of life. SURT, like LP, was an indicator of chronic fibrotic sarcoidosis, developing insidiously and progressing indolently over the years. It was complicated by ulceration, septal perforation, and LP. Three patients had nasal septal perforations, in two instances following <b>submucous</b> <b>resection.</b> This operation is contraindicated in patients with active sarcoidosis, particularly when granulomas are found on nasal biopsy. The Kveim-Siltzbach skin test was positive in all patients with SURT, making it invaluable in the differential diagnosis of granuloma of the nasal cavity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Prolonged {{perceived}} {{nasal obstruction}} resulting from inferior turbinate hypertrophy (ITH) {{is a common}} complaint encountered in Otorhinolaryngology practice. A wide variety of surgical procedures like partial resections, <b>submucous</b> <b>resection,</b> electrocautery, submucous diathermy, cryosurgery, laser ablation and endoscopic resection have been performed but results have been universally unsatisfactory. There is very less literature available regarding Histopathological aspects of hypertrophied inferior turbinate which can throw more light on appropriate management of hypertrophied inferior turbinate. Hence this study was undertaken to provide quantitative and qualitative information on various soft tissue and bony constituents of hypertrophic inferior turbinate. Objective: Comparison of Histopathological features between inferior turbinate hypertrophy in allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis and deviated nasal septum. Materials and methods: A total of 100 patients who presented with nasal obstruction due to hypertrophied inferior turbinate were chosen for study. All patients underwent partial turbinectomy of hypertrophied inferior turbinate under general anesthesia with or without septoplasty. Turbinectomy included anterior 2 /...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the contribution of}} several variables to fluid loss during transcervical <b>resection</b> of <b>submucous</b> myomas. An observational study using multiple linear regression analyses. A university-affiliated training hospital and a university department of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics. Patients with <b>submucous</b> myomas. Transcervical <b>resection</b> of <b>submucous</b> myomas and monitoring of fluid loss. Patient age, uterine enlargement, treatment with GnRH analogues or 8 -ornithine-vasopressin, type of anesthesia, number of myomas, intramural extension of the myoma (type of myoma), and operating time were tested as variables. Only intramural extension of the myoma and operating time were obviously related to fluid loss. For the other variables, such a relation was weak at best. The relation between fluid loss and operating time was not modified {{by any of the}} other variables. Because fluid loss is an important limiting factor in the transcervical <b>resection</b> of <b>submucous</b> myomas, special attention should be paid to reduction of the operating time and preoperative assessment of the intramural extension of the myoma to guide appropriate patient selectio...|$|R
30|$|Complications occur also {{during the}} hysteroscopic surgery, {{including}} air embolism, haemorrhage and uterine perforation. Air embolism is possible usually when air {{has been left}} in the tubing system, but it can occur because of re-insertion of the resectoscope or, rarely, if the patient has been placed into a steep Trendelenburg position, thus creating negative pressure in the vena cava. Haemorrhagic complications occur during endometrial, septal and <b>submucous</b> myoma <b>resection.</b> Small venous bleeding is usually suppressed by {{the pressure of the}} uterine distention medium. Moderate to major bleeding will require a ball electrode, bipolar needle or laser fibre to coagulate the vessel and occasionally the insertion of a Foley catheter balloon to create tamponade. Uterine perforation can be diagnosed easily by direct visualization, but it will also be suspected when the hysteroscope passes to a depth greater than expected or when suddenly there is insufficient distention of the uterine cavity. When perforation of the uterus is purely mechanical, usually it is without consequences, but when it occurs with an electrosurgical device, injury to organs and structures adjacent to the uterus cannot be excluded. This situation requires exploratory laparotomy in order to rule out damage to intra-abdominal viscera. Despite the above, international surveys have shown that in practice hysteroscopic surgery is associated with very few complications. Aydeniz, reporting data from a multicenter survey of 21, 676 operative hysteroscopies performed in 92 centers, found that the rate of complications such as perforation, fluid-overload, infection and peri-operative bleeding was small, although in most German hospitals hysteroscopy was just being established. Jansen, reporting data from 82 hospitals in The Netherlands, had 38 complications among 13, 600 diagnostic and operative hysteroscopic procedures (rate 0.28 %), half of them being entry-related.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Septal surgery {{has been}} {{identified}} as suitable for day-surgery, but is not widely performed as such. Guidelines for day-surgery state that the unexpected admission rate should be 2 - 3 %. Previous audits have not achieved this figure and septoplasty is not universally considered suitable for day-surgery. We have reviewed practice over 4 years in our institution to identify surgical and patient factors associated with unexpected admission following septoplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective case note based audit of day-case septoplasty procedures reviewed {{at the end of each}} year between October 1998 and October 2002. RESULTS: A total of 432 septal surgery procedures were performed, comprising 378 septoplasties and 54 submucous resections. Thirty-eight patients were admitted, overwhelmingly because of haemorrhage in the immediate postoperative period, giving an overall admission rate of 8. 8 % within the first 24 h. Factors associated strongly with re-admission were the use of intranasal splints, the performance of revision surgery, <b>submucous</b> <b>resection</b> (as opposed to septoplasty) and, less so, the performance of additional procedures and the peri-operative administration of diclofenac. There was no correlation between unexpected admission and grade of surgeon, surgical technique or any of the patient factors analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The unexpected admission rate of septal surgery performed at our unit is above that recommended for day-case procedures, but is within the range previously published. Patient satisfaction with day-case septoplasty has been shown to be high. We believe that septoplasty should be performed in this setting but there is a significant chance that patients may need admission, and a pathway should be in place for this to occur with minimal disruption to the patien...|$|E
40|$|Background: Nasal septal {{surgery is}} a common {{procedure}} but there are concerns {{that the benefits of}} this surgery are mainly cosmetic. Objective of review: The primary aim is to identify any functional benefits of septal surgery and provide any evidence of a change in patency of the nasal airway, as assessed by objective methods such as rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry, and peak nasal inspiratory flow. Type of review: Systematic review. Search strategy: A systematic search of the available literature was performed, using Pubmed, Medline (1950 -Dec 2013), Embase (1947 -Nov 2010), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Papers written in English that objectively compared pre- and post-surgical treatment of nasal obstruction in adults due to septal deviation were reviewed. Objective measurements of rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry, and nasal peak inspiratory flow were specified within the search. Searches were restricted to surgery on the nasal septum, which included septoplasty, <b>submucous</b> <b>resection,</b> and septal (deviation) corrective surgery. Results: Seven studies (460 participants) involving rhinomanometry, six studies (182 participants) with acoustic rhinometry, and one study (22 participants) using nasal peak inspiratory flow, were included in the review. All the studies reported an objective improvement in nasal patency after septal surgery. Mean unilateral nasal resistance (data from 6 studies) decreased from pre-operative 1. 19 Pa/cm 3 /s to post-operative 0. 39 Pa/cm 3 /s, mean minimum cross sectional area (data from 5 studies) increased from pre-operative 0. 45 cm 2 to post-operative 0. 61 cm 2, median peak nasal inspiratory flow (data from one study) increased by 35 L/min after surgery. Conclusions: There is sufficient evidence in the literature to conclude that septal surgery improves objective measures of nasal patency, and that improved nasal airflow may have beneficial effects for the patient...|$|E
