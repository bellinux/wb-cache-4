After long and contentious negotiations that dragged into the start of spring training, Ramirez signed a two-year $45 million contract to remain with the Dodgers on March 4.|$|E

[...] <b>So</b> <b>am</b> I. [...] Maybe we'll grow up together." [...] The often-reprinted [...] "Ace Hole, Midget Detective" [...] of 1974 was a Cubist-style nonlinear parody of hardboiled crime fiction full of non sequiturs.

The rejection of violence in society is recognized in Buddhism as a prerequisite for the spiritual progress of society's members, because violence brings pain to beings with similar feelings to oneself. The Buddha is quoted in the Dhammapada as saying, [...] "All are afraid of the stick, all hold their lives dear. Putting oneself in another's place, one should not beat or kill others". Metta (loving kindness), the development of mindstates of limitless good-will for all beings, and karuna, compassion that arises when you see someone suffering of the human being, are attitudes said to be excellent or sublime because they are the right or ideal way of conduct towards living beings (sattesu samma patipatti).

2500|$|On 16 January, it was {{announced}} that the church had had its listing upgraded to Grade 1 status. Announcing the decision, Andrew Derrick stated:"Grade I is the right grade for St. Laurence's Church and it confirms it as a very important building.

This means that demolishing the church would be unthinkable. Any decision on moving the church will {{have to go through the}} local planning authority, but being Grade I listed will make a difference on how people view the building." [...] On hearing the news, airport director Roger Campbell stated:"The decision was simple – the church has to move if the airport is to survive. Thousands of jobs, which could be created if expansion plans go ahead, will be lost. It is not just a case of expansion. We have to comply with safety standards set down by the Civil Aviation Authority and they must be implemented. The future hinges on these plans." [...] The vicar of the church, Rev. Nigel Ransom, was delighted at the news."I was not surprised to hear from English Heritage that the church has been upgraded to a Grade I listed building. It is a unique and historic place. For more than 1,000 years the church has stood on this site undisturbed. It is shrouded in history and is truly a magnificent example of architecture.
