Another application in forensic practice is the determination of date-rape drugs (DRDs) in urine. These drugs are used to incapacitate victims and then rape or rob them. The analyses of these drugs are difficult due to the low concentrations in the body fluids and often a long time delay between the event and clinical examination.

50|$|The {{evaluation}} of the performance cannot be considered complete without considering the limit of detection, the range of linear response and the signal reproducibility. EI {{is known as a}} low-efficiency ionization technique. Because less than 1/10 000 of the gas-phase sample molecules are ionized, impressive detection limits cannot be expected. However, the efficient interfacing mechanism of this interface allows picogram-level detection limit in <b>selected</b> <b>ion</b> <b>monitoring</b> (SIM) for most substances. On the other hand, soft ionization techniques such as ESI are, in some cases, far more efficient but generate fewer fragment ions. The cost of this attitude is paid in terms of structural information so that a second analyzer to generate MS/MS spectra is an obligation. A typical EI spectrum, in general, has extensive structural information, and a cheaper, single-stage mass spectrometer might be sufficient for analyte characterization or identification. As a rule of the thumb, nanogram-level sensitivity is obtained in full-scan mode for most substances. Linearity and reproducibility are two point of strength of the interface. Up to four orders of magnitude linearity with RSD lower than 10% are common values in many applications.|$|E

For each PRVB, mass spectra obtained by LC-ESI-IT-MS/MS from two digests (trypsin, Glu-C) were de novo sequenced manually with help of two programs (PEAKS, DeNovoX). The deduced peptide sequences were arranged and the theoretical Mr for the resulting sequences was calculated. Experimental Mr for each PRVB was measured with high mass accuracy by FTICR-MS (0. 05 - 4. 47 ppm). The masses of several missing peptide gaps were estimated by comparing the theoretical and experimentalMr, and the MS/MS spectra corresponding to these ions were obtained by LC-ESI-IT-MS/MS in the SMIM scanning mode.

Here we present a new method to continuously determine the detection limits of the AMS analyzers during regular measurements, yielding DL information under various measurement conditions. Minimum detection limits range from 0. 03 μg m&minus; 3 (nitrate, sulfate, and chloride) up to 0. 5 μg m&minus; 3 (organics) for the Q-AMS. Those of the c-ToF-AMS are found between 0. 003 μg m&minus; 3 (nitrate, sulfate) and 0. 03 μg m&minus; 3 (ammonium, organics). The DL values found for the c-ToF-AMS were ~ 10 times lower than those of the Q-AMS, mainly due to differences in ion duty cycle. Effects causing an increase of the detection limits include long-term instrument contamination, measurement of high aerosol mass concentrations and short-term instrument history. The self-cleaning processes which reduce the instrument background after measurement of large aerosol concentrations as well as the influences of increased instrument background on mass concentration measurements are discussed.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to determination of hop utilisation {{in terms of}} beer bitterness, analytical measurement of the yield of hop aromatisation is not straightforward {{on account of the}} enormous chemical complexity of hop essential oil and hoppy aroma derived thereof. In this paper, selective determination of hop oil-derived constituents in the flavour profile of pilsner beer is achieved through headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Highly enriched floral and spicy hop essences were prepared by density programmed supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), followed by solid phase extraction (SPE), and subsequently added in well-defined amounts to an experimental pilsner, exclusively bittered with purified iso-α-acids extract. In view of reliable measurement of the yield of aromatisation of the pilsner with the respective hop oil fractions, characteristic marker components for the floral and spicy SFE/ SPE hop essences, respectively, were selected. Reliable determination of the selected markers for floral and spicy SFE/SPE hop essences in the aromatised beers turned out to be possible on condition that HS-SPME is combined with GC-MS comprising <b>selected</b> fragment <b>ion</b> <b>monitoring</b> (SIM). Using this approach, application of hop oil preparations can be monitored analytically, allowing improved control and specification of hop aromatisation according to the desired beer flavour. The average yield of beer aromatisation using floral and spicy hop essences was determined at about 95 %. On the basis of their sesquiterpenoid GC-MS/SIM pattern, fresh commercial lager beers could be differentiated, which may be useful for brand fingerprinting and identification. Upon forced ageing of the beers, levels of hop oil-derived sesquiterpenoids, in particular of caryophyllene and humulene epoxides, decrease significantly.

40|$|Analysts {{involved}} in qualitative mass spectrometry have long debated the {{minimum data requirements}} for demonstrating that signals from an unknown sample are identical to those from a known compound. Often this process is carried out by comparing a few <b>selected</b> <b>ions</b> acquired by multiple <b>ion</b> <b>monitoring</b> (MIM), with due allowance for expected variability in response. In a few past experiments with electron-ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS), the number of <b>ions</b> <b>selected</b> and the allowable variability in relative abundance were tested by comparing one spectrum against a library of mass spectra, where library spectra served to represent potential false positive signals in an analysis. We extended these experiments by carrying out large-scale intercomparisons between thousands of spectra and a library of one hundred thousand EI mass spectra. The results were analyzed to gain insights into the identification confidence associated with various numbers of <b>selected</b> <b>ions.</b> A new parameter was investigated for the first time, {{to take into account}} that a library spectrum with a different base peak than the search spectrum may still cause a false positive identification. The influence of peak correlation among the specific ions in all the library mass spectra was also studied. Our computations showed that (1) false positive identifications can result from similar compounds, or low-abundance peaks in unrelated compounds if the method calls for detection at very low levels; (2) a MIM method’s identification confidence improves in a roughly continuous manner as more <b>ions</b> are <b>monitored,</b> about one order of magnitude for each additional ion selected; (3) full scan spectra still represent the best alternative, if instrument sensitivity is adequate. The use of large scale intercomparisons with a comprehensive library {{is the only way to}} provide direct evidence in support of these conclusions, which otherwise depend on the judgment and experience of individual analysts. There are implications for residue chemists who would rely on standardized confirmation criteria to assess the validity of a given confirmatory method. For example, standardized confirmation criteria should not be used in the absence of interference testing and rational selection of diagnostic ions...|$|R

The time-domain excitation waveform is formed from the inverse Fourier transform of the appropriate frequency-domain excitation spectrum, which is chosen to excite the resonance frequencies of <b>selected</b> <b>ions.</b> The SWIFT procedure can be used to <b>select</b> <b>ions</b> for tandem mass spectrometry experiments.|$|R
