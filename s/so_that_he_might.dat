5|$|The attempt {{had great}} {{influence}} on Reagan's popularity; polls indicated {{his approval rating}} to be around 73%. Reagan believed that God had spared his life <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> go on to fulfill a greater purpose and, although not a Catholic, meetings with Mother Teresa, Cardinal Terence Cooke, and fellow shooting survivor Pope John Paul II reinforced his belief. Agent Parr {{came to believe that}} God had directed his life to save Reagan, and became a pastor.|$|E
5|$|From the age {{of about}} twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham, which taught Latin and Greek and {{probably}} imparted a significant foundation of mathematics. He was removed from school, and by October 1659, {{he was to be}} found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him. Newton hated farming. Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> complete his education. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills.|$|E
5|$|This {{reputation}} {{seems to}} have its origins in a legend surrounding the famous warrior Minamoto no Yoshitsune. When Yoshitsune was a young boy going {{by the name of}} Ushiwaka-maru, his father, Yoshitomo, was assassinated by the Taira clan. Taira no Kiyomori, head of the Taira, allowed the child to survive on the grounds that he be exiled to the temple on Mount Kurama and become a monk. But one day in the Sōjō-ga-dani Valley, Ushiwaka encountered the mountain's tengu, Sōjōbō. This spirit taught the boy the art of swordsmanship <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> bring vengeance on the Taira.|$|E

5|$|After having Lord Rivers arrested, the two dukes {{moved to}} Stony Stratford where Richard {{informed}} the young king of a plot aimed at denying him {{his role as}} Protector whose perpetrators had been dealt with. He proceeded to escort the young king to London where they entered on 4 May displaying the carriages of weapons Earl Rivers had taken with his 2000 man army. Richard first accommodated Edward in the Bishop's apartments, then, on the Duke of Buckingham's suggestion, in the Royal Apartments of the Tower of London where kings customarily awaited their coronation. On hearing the news of her brother's arrest on 30 April, the Dowager Queen fled to sanctuary in Westminster Abbey together with her son by her first marriage Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, her five daughters and her youngest son Richard, Duke of York. On 16 June Elizabeth Woodville agreed {{to hand over the}} younger prince to the Archbishop of Canterbury <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> attend his brother Edward's coronation, still planned for 22 June.|$|E
5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{he began}} to study German <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> read Hölderlin, Goethe and Heine in the original.|$|E
60|$|His {{tone was}} final, and her answer seemed to accept at last his determination. Yet {{she was very}} quick with <b>that</b> answer; <b>so</b> quick <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have {{suspected}} it to be preconceived.|$|R
60|$|A civil, {{but not a}} very eager note came {{in reply}} to John from Dr. Ruthven, making the appointment, but <b>so</b> dispassionately <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> fairly be {{supposed}} to expect little from the interview.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was <b>so</b> afraid <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> get {{upon the}} drink that I made him promise to go {{straight}} to you, sir, the very instant he should arrive. He had a note to deliver." ...|$|R
25|$|David Landes {{similarly}} condemns {{of what he}} {{terms the}} unscientific moral geography of Ellsworth Huntington. He argues that Huntington undermined geography as a science by attributing all human activity to physical influences <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> classify civilizations hierarchically – favoring those civilizations he considered best.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, however, {{his army}} was routed by Philopoemen {{and shut up}} {{within the walls of}} Sparta. After ravaging the {{surrounding}} countryside, Philopoemen returned home. Within a few months, Nabis appealed to the Aetolian League to send troops <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> protect his territory against the Romans and the Achaean League.|$|E
25|$|Fearful that Chasteler and Gyulai would {{combine with}} Archduke John, Eugène ordered a {{concentration}} <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> defeat John {{before the other}} two columns could arrive. Accordingly, he drew together forces under Grenier, Baraguey d'Hilliers, and Grouchy. MacDonald left Broussier's division to continue the siege of Graz and hurried to join Eugène.|$|E
60|$|And <b>so,</b> fearing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{see them}} {{before he was}} ready for them,--and {{how he was going to}} make himself ready for them he did not know,--he stood on the lookout and scanned the ocean for Rynders and his men.|$|R
60|$|They {{seemed in}} no haste to do so, but heard in silence {{the hum of}} insects and the distant song of one bird. Then Sunday spoke, but <b>so</b> dreamily <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been {{continuing}} a conversation rather than beginning one.|$|R

25|$|After {{learning}} from Ehrlichman that John Dean was {{cooperating with the}} U.S. attorney and would be revealing to him what happened on June 21, Gray told his staunchest congressional supporter, Senator Lowell Weicker, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be prepared for that revelation. As a result, Senator Weicker leaked this revelation to some chosen reporters.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus {{appears to}} have {{eventually}} resolved the contradiction between his two results. His aim in calculating {{the distance to the}} moon was to obtain an accurate value for the lunar parallax, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> predict eclipses with more precision. To this, he had to settle on a particular value for the distance/parallax, not a range of values.|$|E
25|$|At his death, most critics had forgiven {{him and he}} {{was praised}} for good works. Barnum was hailed as an icon of American spirit and ingenuity, and was perhaps the most famous American in the world. Just before his death, he gave {{permission}} to the Evening Sun to print his obituary, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> read it. On April 7 he asked about the box office receipts for the day; a few hours later, he was dead.|$|E
60|$|The coffee-room had {{no other}} occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, <b>he</b> sat <b>so</b> still, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been sitting for his portrait.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is she very rich?" [...] He {{had begun}} to strike her as almost embarrassed, <b>so</b> shy <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have found himself with a young lady {{with whom he had}} little in common.

60|$|He {{left the}} train {{at the county}} town. <b>He</b> had <b>so</b> arranged, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> see the {{prisoner}} on his way home; but he had hardly the heart to go, except <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew he was expected, and no disappointment <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could help must add to the pangs of these last days.|$|R
25|$|When Elisha heard, {{he invited}} the king to send Naaman to him, and so Naaman came to Elisha's {{house with his}} horses and his chariots. Elisha sent a {{messenger}} to Naaman {{to tell him to}} wash seven times in the Jordan River and be healed, but that angered Naaman, who expected Elisha to come out, call on the name of God, and wave his hands over Naaman. Naaman asked whether the Amanah and Pharpar rivers of Damascus were not better than any river in Israel, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> wash in them and be clean.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Boyd Hilton argues Peel {{knew from}} 1844 {{he was going}} to be deposed as the Conservative leader. Many of his MPs had taken to voting against him, and the rupture within the party between liberals and paternalists which had been so damaging in the 1820s, but masked by the issue of parliamentary reform in the 1830s, was brought to the surface over the Corn Laws. Hilton's hypothesis is that Peel wished to actually be deposed on a liberal issue <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> later lead a Peelite/Whig/Liberal alliance.|$|E
25|$|After Moses' death, God told Moses' {{minister}} Joshua {{to cross}} the Jordan with the Israelites. God would give them every place on which Joshua stepped, from the Negev desert to Lebanon, from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean Sea. God enjoined Joshua {{to be strong and}} of good courage, for none would be able to stand in his way, as God would lead him all of his life. God exhorted Joshua strictly to observe God's law, and to meditate on it day and night, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> succeed.|$|E

25|$|Amid the Diocletian Persecutions, Anthony {{wished to}} become a martyr and in 311 went to Alexandria. He visited those who were imprisoned {{for the sake of}} Christ and comforted them. When the Governor saw that he was confessing his Christianity publicly, not caring what might happen to him, he ordered him not to show up in the city. However, the Saint did not heed his threats. He faced him and argued with him in order that he might arouse his anger <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be {{tortured}} and martyred, but it did not happen.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{he notes}} that Ran and Rivash were the source of Rema’s claim that women could not be called up to read all the {{portions}} of the Torah. Ran’s comment is ambiguous (<b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> agree that they could take any three aliyyot), but Rivash assumes that Ran agreed with him that women could only take the seventh or, perhaps, the reading added on for the maftir. Further, when Hagahot Maimoniyot limits slaves to the seventh portion, the comment closes by citing his teacher, the more famous R. Meir of Rothenburg.|$|E
25|$|Tsar Alexander {{appointed}} Czartoryski {{curator of}} the Vilna Academy (3 April 1803) <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> give full play to his advanced ideas. Czartoryski was, however, unable to devote much attention to education, for {{from the beginning of}} 1804, as foreign-affairs adjunct, he had exercised practical control of Russian diplomacy. His first act had been to protest energetically against Napoleon's murder of a Bourbon royal prince the Duke of Enghien (20 March 1804) and insist on an immediate rupture with the government of the French Revolution, then under First Consul Napoléon Bonaparte, whom the tsar considered a regicide.|$|E

60|$|So long as Mr Pecksniff was in sight, {{and turned}} his head at {{intervals}} to salute him, Montague stood in the road smiling, and waving his hand. But when his new partner had disappeared, and this show was no longer necessary, {{he sat down on}} the stile with looks <b>so</b> altered, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have grown ten years older in the meantime.|$|R
60|$|Felix's face <b>so</b> clearly intimated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not ask {{anything}} of the kind, or <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> did his curiosity would not be satisfied, that Wolfenden felt compelled to make some apology.|$|R
