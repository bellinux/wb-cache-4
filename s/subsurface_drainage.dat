25|$|The water {{management}} options include irrigation, drainage, {{and the use}} of <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage</b> water from pipe drains, ditches or wells for irrigation.|$|E
25|$|Field {{drainage}} systems are differentiated in surface and <b>subsurface</b> field <b>drainage</b> systems.|$|R
25|$|Like {{the surface}} field <b>drainage</b> systems, the <b>subsurface</b> field <b>drainage</b> systems {{can also be}} {{differentiated}} in regular systems and checked (controlled) systems.|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{producers}} {{have been using}} <b>subsurface</b> artificial <b>drainage</b> since the late 1800 ’s. This allows areas that would have otherwise been deemed unproductive for agriculture to grow substantial yields. Data and records on drainage tile location are not consistent. In recent years, researchers have turned to aerial photography to map functioning drainage tiles. Knowing the location of drainage can allow more accurate hydrology studies. This research explores photo interpretation and compares it to remote sensing and decision tree analysis techniques to delineate <b>subsurface</b> agricultural <b>drainage</b> tiles in the Eagle Creek Watershed in Iowa, USA...|$|R
25|$|If {{one wishes}} to {{distinguish}} an upper and {{lower part of the}} transition zone {{in the absence of a}} <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage</b> system, one may specify in the input data a drainage system with zero intensity.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it can also}} happen that a surface {{drainage}} system diminishes the recharge of the groundwater {{to such an extent}} that the <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage</b> problem is considerably reduced or even eliminated.|$|E
25|$|To {{anticipate}} these problems, {{water is}} monitored at coal mines. The five principal technologies {{used to control}} water flow at mine sites are: diversion systems, containment ponds, groundwater pumping systems, <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage</b> systems and subsurface barriers.|$|E
40|$|Thoroughly tested {{simulation}} models {{are needed to}} help quantify {{the long-term effects of}} agriculture. We evaluated the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) response to different N management strategies and then used the tested model with observed weather data from 1961 – 2003 to quantify long-term effects on corn (Zea mays L.) yield and flow weighted nitrate-N concentration in <b>subsurface</b> “tile” <b>drainage</b> water (Nconc). Fourteen years (1990 – 2003) of field data from 30, 0. 4 ha plots in northeast Iowa were available for model testing. Annual crop yield, nitrate-N loss to <b>subsurface</b> “tile” <b>drainage</b> water (Nloss), Nconc, and <b>subsurface</b> “tile” <b>drainage</b> amount (drain) for various management scenarios were averaged over plots and years to create five chemical fertilizer and five swine manure treatments. Predicted corn yield and Nconc for the 10 treatments were significantly correlated with observed data (R 2 3 ̆e 0. 83). The Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) were 15...|$|R
5000|$|Deep {{drainage}} (from over-irrigation) {{may result}} in rising water tables which in some instances will lead to problems of irrigation salinity requiring watertable control by some form of <b>subsurface</b> land <b>drainage.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Deep {{collector}} drains {{are required}} for <b>subsurface</b> field <b>drainage</b> systems, whereas shallow collector drains are used for surface field drainage systems, {{but they can also}} be used for pumped subsurface systems. The deep collectors may consist of open ditches or buried pipe lines.|$|R
25|$|If a {{horizontal}} <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage</b> system is present, {{this must be}} placed in the transition zone, which is then divided into two parts: an upper transition zone (above drain level) and a lower transition zone (below drain level).|$|E
25|$|In some instances, <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage</b> can be {{achieved}} simply by breaking up slowly permeable soil layers by deep plowing (sub-soiling), provided that the underground has sufficient natural drainage. In other instances, a combination of sub-soiling and subsurface drains may solve the problem.|$|E
25|$|Salt {{concentrations}} of outgoing water (either from one reservoir {{into the other}} or by <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage)</b> are computed {{on the basis of}} salt balances, using different leaching or salt mixing efficiencies to be given with the input data. The effects of different leaching efficiencies can be simulated by varying their input value.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Subsurface</b> land <b>drainage</b> [...] aims at {{controlling}} {{the water table}} of the groundwater in originally waterlogged land at a depth acceptable for the purpose for which the land is used. The depth of the water table with drainage is greater than without.|$|R
50|$|The {{other major}} known {{drainage}} basin is nearly entirely <b>subsurface</b> karst <b>drainage</b> {{and includes a}} known area that runs from Harrison Spring {{to the north and}} northeast to Ramsey and Central Barren, just 2 - 3 mi south of Palmyra and contains an area of at least 39 sq mi.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>subsurface</b> field <b>drainage</b> systems {{consist of}} {{horizontal}} or slightly sloping channels {{made in the}} soil; they can be open ditches, trenches, filled with brushwood and a soil cap, filled with stones and a soil cap, buried pipe drains, tile drains, or mole drains, {{but they can also}} consist of a series of wells.|$|R
25|$|The method uses {{seasonal}} {{water balance}} components as input data. These {{are related to}} the surface hydrology (like rainfall, evaporation, irrigation, use of drain and well water for irrigation, runoff), and the aquifer hydrology (like upward seepage, natural drainage, pumping from wells). The other water balance components (like downward percolation, upward capillary rise, <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage)</b> are given as output.|$|E
25|$|Further, SaltMod {{gives the}} option of the re-use of {{drainage}} and well water (e.g. for irrigation) and it can account for farmers' response to waterlogging, soil salinity, water scarcity and over-pumping from the aquifer. Also it offers the possibility to introduce <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage</b> systems at varying depths and with varying capacity {{so that they can}} be optimized.|$|E
25|$|Under certain conditions, {{the height}} of the water table {{influences}} the water balance components. For example a rise of the water table towards the soil surface may lead to an increase of evaporation, surface runoff, and <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage,</b> or a decrease of percolation losses from canals. This, in turn, leads to a change of the water balance, which again influences {{the height of}} the water table, etc.|$|E
30|$|Drainage {{in an area}} {{depends on}} the topography, slope and the <b>subsurface</b> characteristics. <b>Drainage</b> density is {{calculated}} as the total length of all the streams and rivers in a basin divided by the total area of the drainage basin. The higher the drainage density, the higher the run-off will be, and infiltration of water into the subsurface is affected.|$|R
40|$|Drainage water management, in {{the context}} of <b>subsurface</b> {{agricultural}} <b>drainage,</b> consists of managing outflow with a goal of reducing drainage volume. Because less water is leaving the system, a corresponding reduction in the amount nitrate-nitrogen can be expected, although concentrations tend to be similar when compared with conventional drainage. The objective of this work is to determine the impact of drainage water management on drainage outflow, water table depth, and crop yields...|$|R
50|$|Figure 1 classifies {{the various}} types of {{drainage}} systems. It shows the field (or internal) and the main (or external) systems. The function of the field drainage system is to control the water table, whereas the function of the main drainage system is to collect, transport, and dispose of the water through an outfall or outlet. In some instances one makes an additional distinction between collector and main drainage systems.Field drainage systems are differentiated in surface and <b>subsurface</b> field <b>drainage</b> systems.|$|R
25|$|When {{the land}} needs a <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage</b> system, but saline {{groundwater}} is present at great depth, {{it is better}} to employ a shallow, closely spaced system of pipes or ditches instead of a deep, widely spaced system. The reason is that the deeper systems produce a more salty effluent than the shallow systems. Environmental criteria may then prohibit the use of the deeper systems.|$|E
25|$|For {{salinity}} {{control in}} such a case, annually an amount of drainage water is to be discharged from the aquifer {{by means of a}} <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage</b> system and disposed of through a safe outlet. The drainage system may be horizontal (i.e. using pipes, tile drains or ditches) or vertical (drainage by wells). To estimate the drainage requirement, the use of a groundwater model with an agro-hydro-salinity component may be instrumental, e.g. SahysMod.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice between}} a <b>subsurface</b> <b>drainage</b> system by pipes and ditches or by tube wells {{is more a}} matter of {{technical}} criteria and costs than of agricultural criteria, because both types of systems can be designed to meet the same agricultural criteria and achieve the same benefits. Usually, pipe drains or ditches are preferable to wells. However, when the soil consists of a poorly permeable top layer several meters thick, overlying a rapidly permeable and deep subsoil, wells may be a better option, because the drain spacing required for pipes or ditches would be considerably smaller than the spacing for wells.|$|E
50|$|As of Monday, 11 April 1994, 6:30 am Central time, three {{real-time}} radar {{images were}} downlinked from Endeavour overnight.

50|$|The McMurray Formation was {{deposited}} by {{an extensive}} drainage system that flowed northward following a regional north-south depression. The depression {{was created by}} the dissolution of thick salt deposits in the Devonian Elk Point Group deep within the <b>subsurface.</b> The <b>drainage</b> system was encroached upon from the north by a rising sea, and as this marine transgression progressed, depositional environments changed from fluvial at the base (Lower Member), to estuarine (Middle Member), to shore-face at the top (Upper Member), and finally to open marine in the overlying Clearwater Formation.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} two potential beneficial management practices that will reduce the impact of fecal and fertilizers contamination on the environment. The study was conducted in Eastern Ontario on typical small scale agricultural practices. The first part evaluates the impact of a conventional pasture system and an excluding pasture system on surface water quality. The three year study compared water quality endpoints such as: indicator bacteria, pathogens, parasites and nutrients between treatments. Microbial source tracking indicated that livestock was the main source of fecal contamination in the stream. Greater bacteria and nutrient loads were observed in the unrestricted pasture system than the excluding pasture. Moreover, parasite and indicator bacteria concentrations increased after cattle introduction in both systems. The second part compares nitrogen mass balance between managed and conventional <b>subsurface</b> tile <b>drainage.</b> Over two years, nitrogen loads in groundwater, in tile flow, in plants, in soil and denitrification were compared between treatments. Nitrogen was mostly removed from managed tile drainage fields through plant uptake. Compared to nitrogen plant uptake, denitrification, the second greatest nitrogen removing process was 10 times smaller. The denitrification was greater in the unmanaged tile drainage fields. Generally, managed <b>subsurface</b> tile <b>drainage</b> reduces nitrogen mass loads to surface waters and increases nitrogen uptake by plant, which resulted in greater yields...|$|R
