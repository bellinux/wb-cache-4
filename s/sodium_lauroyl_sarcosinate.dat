The endpoint used to assess toxicity was a tetrazolium-based assay whereas, the phototoxic potential of acylglutamate surfactants was predicted using two models namely, the Photo-Irritation Factor and Mean Photo Effect. The results of this study showed that the fatty acid chain length of acylglutamate greatly influences toxic effects on human keratinocyte cells. In addition, all the acylglutamate surfactants tested on human keratinocyte cells demonstrated significantly less cytotoxicity (when irradiated and non-irradiated with ultraviolet B light; p < 0. 05) and no phototoxic potential was observed in any of the acylglutamate surfactants, when compared with the positive control chlorpromazine.

40|$|The binding of {{surfactants}} to {{stratum corneum}} proteins has been implicated {{as one of}} the factors governing their harshness towards skin. In this paper, the binding characteristics of several anionic surfactants, including relatively harsh surfactants uch as sodium dodecyl sulfate, TEA-sodium laurate, TEA-sodium oleate, and a relatively milder one such as <b>sodium</b> <b>lauroyl</b> isethionate (SLI), are presented. The effect of variables relevant to cleansing such as solution pH, temperature, and contact time on surfactant binding has been determined.

In sodium deoxycholate (DOC), the enzyme activity was slightly activated {{in the presence of}} 0. 2 % DOC but not activated in 1. 0 % DOC. The enzyme activity was also activated by pretreating the cells with SC, DOC or MC 10. On the contrary, the enzyme activity of the cell envelope prepared from the cells was strongly inhibited by these detergents. The enzyme activity of the cells cultured in detergent medium containing SC, DOC or MC 10 was higher than that of the normal cells. The enzyme activity was the highest in the cells cultured at 20 ℃, followed by the cells cultured at 30 ℃ and then at 40 ℃ in order of decreasing activity. However, the activation of the enzyme by SC or MC 10 was higher in the cells cultured at high temperature than those cultured at low temperature. On the other hand, the enzyme activity of the cells cultured at 20 ℃ was inhibited by DOC but was activated in case of the cells cultured at 40 ℃. The enzyme activity was inhibited by cross-linking the outer membrane with dimethylsuberimidate; besides, the enzyme activity of the cells cross-linked was markedly inhibited by detergents. These results suggest that these detergents do not directly act on the enzyme of the cells, but rather on the outer membrane-peptidoglycan layer and the permeability of the layer would alter {{as a result of the}} action. The variation of enzyme activity, in vivo, may be dependent on the permeability of the altered layer to the substrates. 1. 大腸菌浮遊液のSDH活性に対する界面活性剤の作用を検討した.

40|$|Surfactants {{are used}} in many {{industrial}} applications, such as flotation, flocculation, water treatment, enhanced oil recovery, emulsification, drug delivery, personal care, detergency, chemical mechanical polishing, etc. The design, development, and characterization of greener surfactants in their applications are required to meet the increasing requirements for environmental protection and an escalating demand from the society for sustainable development. It is a challenge currently to develop structure-property-performance relationships for surfactant mixtures containing greener reagents to obtain maximum efficiency with minimum environmental damages. Even though conventional surfactants and their mixtures are well studied, the fundamental studies of the structure, property and performance relationships for greener surfactants when used individually or in combination with others are just started {{as more and more}} attentions are focusing on this area. In this work, solution behaviors of surfactant systems containing several amino acid based greener surfactants have been systematically investigated using various techniques, including surface tensiometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, viscometry and computer simulation to obtain information of the structures of the aggregates formed by greener surfactants or their mixtures with conventional ones in solutions. This comprehensive study helps to elucidate the mechanism of micellization behaviors of the greener surfactant mixtures and understand the roles of molecular structures and interactions in determination of system properties and performance. The colloidal and interfacial properties of a series of lipopeptides synthesized by chemo-enzymatic reactions were studied. They were found very surface active, especially C 12 /oligo(L-Glu). The effects of chain length of hydrophobic moiety, composition of oligopeptide as well as aqueous chemical conditions, such as pH, on the interfacial properties of the lipopeptides were studied. Results showed the mechanism of how the interfacial and colloidal properties of amino acid based surfactants can be fine tuned by adjusting structures of the molecules. Two new surfactants, Surfactin and FA-Glu, synthesized by genetically engineered bacteria were also evaluated. Both of them showed exceptional surface activity. Genetic engineering also showed its advantages when it was found that Surfactin was limited by its solubility. Quick modifications were made in the bacteria and better option FA-Glu was produced with improved structure for better solubility. The results provide fundamental knowledge of those greener surfactants on their structure-property relationships. A number of amino acid based greener surfactants with systematic structural variations, including sodium lauroyl glutamate (C 12 Glu), sodium lauroyl alaninate (C 12 Ala), <b>sodium</b> <b>lauroyl</b> <b>sarcosinate</b> (C 12 Sar), and sodium lauroyl glycinate (C 12 Gly), were tested as triblend mixtures with dodecyl glucoside (C 12 G 1) and lauramidoproply betaine (LAPB) to evaluate their performance as a function of their molecular structures. The C 12 Gly/C 13 G 1 /LAPB system was confirmed to have very high viscosity compared to the other systems. It was found the following micellar evolution processes happened in this system that delivered the high viscosity: small spherical micelles evolved into elongated rod-like micelles in the low concentration range, and networks of worm-like micelles formed in the high concentration range. The unique properties achieved by this system were attributed to the packing of the surfactant molecules in the system. Further results confirmed that C 12 Gly has a desired structure with a packing parameter of 0. 4 which favors formation of worm-like micelles. Foaming performance of the selected greener surfactant was also evaluated to compare with commercial benchmark system. Even though sodium dodecyl glycinate itself is not a good foaming agent as the petroleum based non-green surfactant sodium lauryl ether sulfate, when it is mixed with the other two ingredients, significant improvement can be achieved for both foamability and foam stability due to strong synergistic interactions among them. The mixture of sodium dodecyl glycinate, dodecyl glucoside and lauramidopropyl betaine actually can deliver equal viscosity, foamability and foam stability as the benchmark system, which makes this system a leading option for the future formulations in personal care industry. Computer simulation as a powerful tool was used to understand the mechanism how greener surfactant molecules interacted with each other and how they aggregated into micelles from molecular level. Simulation found that when different surfactant molecules were mixed together, the synergistic interaction reduced the electrostatic repulsion between molecules, which led to reduction of the effective space occupied by head groups making the two head groups overlapping on each other partially. The overlapping led to a close packing of molecules. The results suggest that geometry of molecules and the interactions among them play equally important roles in determining the packing of surfactants and in turn the packing controls properties and performance of the whole system. Thus a new formula for effective packing parameter of surfactant mixtures was proposed, in which not only the geometries of molecules but also the interactions among them were included to calculate the effective packing parameter for surfactant mixtures for better predictions of the properties and performance of surfactant mixture systems. The fundamental and systematical work accomplished through this work will have a profound impact on the understanding of greener surfactant mixture systems, as structure, property and performance relationships developed herein will in turn direct the use of greener surfactants in future applications for efficiency and low chemical footprin...|$|E

Several of these analyses showed that the amount of Casamino Acids significantly influenced the diversity of the recovered Pseudomonas isolates. Furthermore, the data suggested that specific Pseudomonas subpopulations were represented on the nutrient-poor media. The NAA 1 : 100 medium, containing ca. 15 mg of organic carbon per liter, consistently gave significantly higher Pseudomonas CFU counts than Gould's S 1 when tested on four Danish soils.

40|$|The {{pathological}} {{and physiological}} hallmarks of the protein α-synuclein are its misfolding into cytotoxic aggregates and its binding to synaptic vesicles, respectively. Both events are mediated by seven 11 -residue amphiphilic pseudorepeats and, most generally, involve {{a transition from}} intrinsically unstructured to structured conformations. Based upon α-synuclein interactions with aggregation-inhibiting small molecules, a α-synuclein variant termed SaS, wherein the first six pseudorepeats had been rearranged, was introduced. Here, {{the effects of this}} rearrangement upon misfolding, vesicle binding and micelle binding are examined in reference to α- and β-synuclein to study the sequence characteristics underlying these processes. Fibrillization correlates with the distinct clustering of residues with high β-sheet propensities, while vesicle affinities depend on the mode of pseudorepeat interchange and loss. In the presence of micelles, the pseudorepeat region of SaS adopts an essentially continuous helix, whereas α- and β-synuclein encounter a distinct helix break, indicating that a more homogeneous distribution of surfactant affinities in SaS prevented the formation of a helix break in the micelle-bound state. By demonstrating the importance of the distribution of β-sheet propensities and by revealing inhomogeneous aS surfactant affinities, the present study provides novel insight into two central themes of synuclein biology.

40|$|UnrestrictedParkinson's {{disease has}} been {{associated}} with misfolding of the protein alpha-synuclein (aS). Previous studies of micelle bound alpha-synucleins have shown that it forms two anti-parallel helices on the micelle surface with elevated dynamics in the glycine residues of the III, V, and VI repeat of its amino acid sequence. Thus by mutating these residues to alanine a significant change in the dynamics and structure has been observed. A better micelle system has been established using <b>sodium</b> <b>lauroyl</b> sarcosine (SLS) which has more aggregation number than SDS and decreases the negative restraint on the C-alpha chemical shifts. Two aS variants, aSG(III) with mutated Gly residues at 31, 36 and 41 mutated to Ala and aSG(II) with mutated Gly residues at 67 and 68 to Ala are studied. Backbone and dynamic parameters of the variants show that there is an increase in chemical shift causing an increment in helical character in the regions of mutation. But this is been compensated at other distant residues where the same character is significantly reduced. Similar pattern is observed in the dynamic parameters which show an increase in rigidity of the helix in the mutated regions. These strong increase in chemical shift and decrease in dynamics suggest that the glycine residues in these positions {{play a significant role in}} the interaction of the protein alpha-synuclein with the lipid surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB 2), {{a member}} of the endocannabinoid system belongs to the Rhodopsin family of G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). It is {{expressed}} mainly in the immune cells and exerts immunomodulatory roles in normal and pathophysiological conditions. Therapeutic modulation of the CB 2 presents a promising strategy for the treatment of several diseases like multiple myeloma, osteoporosis, pain etc. In the face of the huge therapeutic importance of the CB 2, high resolution structural information and mechanistic details of receptor activation are poorly understood. This principally owes to the paucity of large amounts of purified recombinant functionally active CB 2 in-vitro. GPCRs and most eukaryotic membrane proteins pose a formidable challenge for recombinant expression and purification. Limitations include low expression, toxicity towards host cells, loss of function etc. In an effort to produce functionally active recombinant CB 2 {{that can be used for}} subsequent structural studies, in the present study, we have developed two distinct approaches for the functional expression and purification of CB 2 from the E. coli. In the first approach we used Mistic, an integral membrane protein expression enhancer, and TarCF, a C-terminal fragment of the bacterial chemosensory transducer Tar, as fusion partners at the N'- and C'-terminal respectively of the CB 2 for its membrane targeted expression in the E. coli C 43 (DE 3). Using the fusion partners individually or in combination, we found that CB 2 fusion protein expression was maximal when both partners were used in combination. More importantly, the fusion protein Mistic–CB 2 –TarCF localized to the E. coli membrane and these extracted membrane fractions exhibited functional binding activities with known CB 2 ligands including CP 55, 940, WIN 55, 212 - 2 and SR 144, 528. In the second approach, we expressed the CB 2, in fusion with GST at its N'- terminal, as inactive inclusion bodies (IBs). The receptor protein was engineered to carry a 6 Histidine (His 6) tag at its C'-terminal for subsequent immobilized metal affinity chromatographic (IMAC) purification. Pilot studies supported extraction of GST-CB 2 in a denaturing detergent, N- <b>Lauroyl</b> <b>sarcosinate</b> (Sarkosyl) followed by exchange to Dodecyl-beta-D-Maltoside (DDM) for “on-column” cleavage. Post size exclusion chromatography, eluted purified monodisperse CB 2 were subjected to refolding either in lipidic (DMPC) or proteic (Amphipol) environments.
