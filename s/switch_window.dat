40|$|For {{crosstalk}} noise calculation, computing <b>switching</b> <b>windows</b> of a net helps us identify noise sources accurately. Traditional approaches use a single continuous <b>switching</b> <b>window</b> for a net. Under this model, signal switching {{is assumed to}} happen any time within the window. Although conservative and sound, this model can result in too much pessimism since in reality the exact timing of signal switching is determined by a path delay up to the net, i. e. the underlying circuit structure does not always allow signal switching at arbitrary time within the continuous <b>switching</b> <b>window.</b> To address this inherent inaccuracy of the continuous <b>switching</b> <b>window,</b> we propose a refinement of the traditional approaches, where signal switching {{is characterized by a}} set of discontinuous <b>switching</b> <b>windows</b> instead of a single continuous <b>window.</b> Each continuous <b>switching</b> <b>window</b> is divided into multiple windows, called time slots, and the signal switching activity of each slot is analyzed separately to calculate the maximum noise with more accuracy. By controlling the size of a time slot we can trade off accuracy and runtime, which makes this approach highly scalable.

Since both NLEs receive a second control signal at the same time, they decay together and thus avoid creation of unintended <b>switching</b> <b>windows.</b> Additionally, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the second control signal can be input on the data port or the output port, eliminating the need for a separate port for the second control signal as required by certain known TOADs...|$|R

By performing dynamic <b>switching</b> <b>window</b> measurements with a time resolution of about 1 ps, the temporal width and the contrast of the <b>switching</b> <b>windows</b> are investigated for SOA lengths of 500, 1000 and 1500 ?m.
