5|$|The classic legionary scutum, a convex {{rectangular}} shield, also disappeared {{during the}} 3rd century.

40|$|AbstractAs {{an effort}} to find a lighter <b>shield,</b> the wood stuffed <b>shield</b> was {{proposed}} in this paper based on the wood properties such as low density, low cost, high yield strength when the strain rate is high. Hypervelocity impact tests (Ф= 5. 5 mm, V= 4. 79 km/s∼ 4. 96 km/s) were carried out to compare the <b>shielding</b> capabilities of the pinewood stuffed <b>shield,</b> aluminum triple-wall <b>shield</b> and Nextel/Kevlar fabric stuffed <b>shield</b> with the same areal density. It was found in all the tests that a perforation with diameter of 2. 0 mm was formed in the rear plate of the aluminum triple-wall <b>shield.</b> No perforation but slight deformation was found in the rear plates of both pinewood stuffed <b>shield</b> and Nextel /Kevlar fabric stuffed <b>shield.</b> The height of the deformation on the rear plates of the pinewood stuffed <b>shield</b> was 1. 99 mmm, and that on the Nextel/Kevlar fabric stuffed <b>shield</b> was 2. 01 mm. Results show that, with the same areal density, the <b>shielding</b> capability of the wood stuffed <b>shield</b> is greater than that of the aluminum triple-wall <b>shield</b> and {{is similar to that of}} Nextel /Kevlar fabric stuffed <b>shield</b> which is widely used on the spacecraft. To explore the reason why the <b>shielding</b> capability of the wood stuffed <b>shield</b> is prominent, the SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamic) simulation on the glass-epoxy stuffed <b>shield</b> was carried out...|$|R

5|$|This was Arsenal's first {{appearance}} in the Charity Shield in 10 years; prior to the game they had won seven <b>Shields</b> (1930, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1938, 1948 and 1953), and lost three (1935, 1936 and 1979). By contrast, Liverpool had won seven previous <b>Shields</b> outright (1966, 1974, 1976, 1979, 1980, 1982 and 1988), shared two with Manchester United (1965 and 1977) and one apiece with Everton (1986) and West Ham United (1984).

5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, <b>shields,</b> armor, barriers, or a combination thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, <b>shields</b> are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the <b>shields,</b> armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E

40|$|A {{structure}} of calorimeter provides a calorimetric head (1) comprising a calorimetric cell (10) suitable for receiving a sample holding container (20) containing a sample (25) to examine.
