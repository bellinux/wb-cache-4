40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to validate the Iranian version of the <b>Social</b> Achievement <b>Goal</b> Orientation Scale and test the <b>Social</b> Achievement <b>Goal</b> Orientation theory in the context of Iranian students. A total of 403 Iranian high school students completed a <b>Social</b> Achievement <b>Goal</b> Orientation Scale and an Achievement Goal Questionnaire. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the hypothesized model of <b>social</b> achievement <b>goals.</b> The fit of the proposed three-factor model was promising and moderate support for the three factor structure of <b>social</b> <b>goal</b> orientation was found using scores from an abbreviated 13 -item SAGOS. Graded Response Model showed an information function that was peaked at the upper end of the scale, indicating that severe <b>social</b> <b>goal</b> orientation is measured with most precision. Convergent validity for the new measure of <b>social</b> achievement <b>goals</b> was established. Findings generally supported the trichotomous framework of the <b>social</b> achievement <b>goal</b> orientation theory with Iranian students. Consistent with the academic goal orientation theory, findings indicated that social mastery and performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals had positive relationships with academic goals...|$|R
40|$|University {{life can}} be {{stressful}} and students may struggle to adjust socially. We examined students’ social achievement goals—their orientations towards their relationships with their peers—as one important factor underlying students’ social and psychological adjustment in college. When investigating the direct and indirect effects of <b>social</b> achievement <b>goals</b> on psychological adjustment (i. e., life satisfaction, depression, stress, and worry), the mediating role of emotion regulation was examined. Data were collected from students attending a university in China (N = 1, 242, 35 % male). The widely adopted three-factor structure of <b>social</b> achievement <b>goals</b> (i. e., <b>social</b> development <b>goals,</b> <b>social</b> demonstration-approach <b>goals,</b> <b>social</b> demonstration-avoidance <b>goals)</b> was confirmed to fit the data among Chinese college students. The results show the direct and indirect benefits of endorsing a <b>social</b> development <b>goal.</b> Augmented emotion regulation mediated the effect of <b>social</b> development <b>goals.</b> The total effects of a <b>social</b> demonstration-approach <b>goal</b> were weak, but the goal indirectly impaired students’ psychological adjustment via reduced emotion regulation. Endorsing a <b>social</b> demonstration-avoidance <b>goal</b> tended to compromise psychological adjustment and the effects were mediated through reduced emotion regulation. Implications for supporting students’ adjustment to college are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this {{cross-sectional}} study we investigated {{to what extent}} autonomous and controlled motivation and <b>social</b> achievement <b>goals</b> are associated with students' emotional experiences at school. We found {{in a sample of}} 426 elementary school students, aged from 10 to 12 years, autonomous motivation (i. e. students' engagement in class activities because they find such activities enjoying or personally important) and <b>social</b> development <b>goals</b> (i. e. students' focus on developing meaningful social relationships) to be positively associated with positive emotions. In contrast, controlled motivation (i. e. students' engagement in class activities because they feel coerced to do so) and <b>social</b> demonstration-approach <b>goals</b> (i. e. students' focus on demonstrating popularity) were positively associated with negative emotions. These associations remained significant even after controlling for perceived competence. Cluster analysis further showed that students high in autonomous motivation and <b>social</b> development <b>goals</b> and low in controlled motivation and <b>social</b> demonstration-approach <b>goals</b> exhibited a better motivational profile compared to students high or low in all the above motivational variables.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{correlational}} {{study was to investigate}} Turkish students’ social motivation for their studies. Specifically, it investigated to what extent they endorse a <b>social</b> achievement <b>goal</b> for autonomous or for controlling reasons. Furthermore, the research examined the relation of the endorsed reasons (autonomous and controlling) underlying the <b>social</b> achievement <b>goals</b> to students’ perceived social competence and negative behavior (e. g., aggression, hostility and anger). A cross-sectional design was chosen to measure each variable at one point in time for each participant. A questionnaire was administrated to 226 graduate and undergraduate students (Mage = 22. 36, SD = 3. 92; 67. 4 % females), from a private nonprofit university in Ankara, who participated voluntarily in the study. Descriptive statistics showed that Turkish students scored higher on <b>social</b> development <b>goals</b> (the goal to develop meaningful relationships) than on either the <b>social</b> demonstration-approach <b>goals</b> (the goal to be popular) or the <b>social</b> demonstration-avoid <b>goals</b> (the <b>goal</b> to avoid <b>social</b> disapproval). The descriptive statistics also showed that the Turkish students endorsed <b>social</b> development <b>goals</b> for both autonomous (volitional) and controlling (pressuring) reasons. Moreover, a regression analysis showed that controlling reasons underlying <b>social</b> development <b>goals</b> tended to mediate the relation of perceived social competence and negative behavior (e. g., aggression, hostility and anger). Specifically, perceived social competence was negatively related to controlling reasons underlying <b>social</b> development <b>goals</b> and controlling reasons were positively related to negative behavior (e. g., aggression, hostility and anger). Students who had low-perceived social competence adopted <b>social</b> development <b>goals</b> for controlling reasons. Subsequently, those that adopted <b>social</b> development <b>goals</b> for controlling reasons reported high levels of aggressive, anger or hostile behavior toward others. The results are discussed in terms of implications for Turkish curriculum and instruction and they suggest modifications for curriculum and instruction to increase Turkish students’ perceived social competence and to decrease their controlled motivation. by Saniye Yalçın.
