5|$|There is no {{consensus}} among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether <b>science</b> <b>can</b> reveal the truth about unobservable things and whether scientific reasoning can be justified at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as biology or physics). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{has long}} been claimed that a better {{understanding}} of human or social dimensions of environmental issues will improve conservation. The social sciences are one important means through which researchers and practitioners can attain that better understanding. Yet, a lack of awareness of the scope and uncertainty about the purpose of the conservation social sciences impedes the conservation community's effective engagement with the human dimensions. This paper examines the scope and purpose of eighteen subfields of classic, interdisciplinary and applied conservation social sciences and articulates ten distinct contributions that the social <b>sciences</b> <b>can</b> make to understanding and improving conservation. In brief, the conservation social <b>sciences</b> <b>can</b> be valuable to conservation for descriptive, diagnostic, disruptive, reflexive, generative, innovative, or instrumental reasons. This review and supporting materials provides a succinct yet comprehensive reference for conservation scientists and practitioners. We contend that the social <b>sciences</b> <b>can</b> help facilitate conservation policies, actions and outcomes that are more legitimate, salient, robust and effective...|$|R

25|$|Birdwatchers {{may take}} part in censuses of bird populations and migratory {{patterns}} which are sometimes specific to individual species. These birdwatchers may also count all birds in a given area, as in the Christmas Bird Count or follow carefully designed study protocols.

25|$|Historically, {{the debate}} of whether creationism is {{compatible}} with <b>science</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced back to}} 1874, the year science historian John William Draper published his History of the Conflict between Religion and Science. In it Draper portrayed the entire history of scientific development as a war against religion. This presentation of history was propagated further by followers such as Andrew Dickson White in his two-volume A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896). Their conclusions have been disputed.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Lawrence Troster is {{a critic}} of {{positions}} such as this. He holds that much of Judaism (and other religions) have not successfully created a theology which allows {{for the role of}} God in the world and yet is also fully compatible with modern-day evolutionary theory. Troster maintains that the solution to resolving the tension between classical theology and modern <b>science</b> <b>can</b> be found in process theology, such as in the writings of Hans Jonas, whose view of an evolving God within process philosophy contains no inherent contradictions between theism and scientific naturalism.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} Boolean algebras and group {{theory in the}} 19th century proved correct Leibniz's intuition that {{algebraic}} methods {{could be used to}} reason about qualitative and non-numerical phenomena. Specifically, the members of the universal set of a Boolean algebra or group need not be numbers. Moreover, a fair bit of philosophy and theoretical <b>science</b> <b>can</b> be formalized as axiomatic theories embodying first-order logic and set theory. Note also how model theory has been employed to formalize and reason about such emphatically nonnumerical subjects as semantics and pragmatics of natural languages. But these approaches have yet to result in any pictographic notations.|$|E
25|$|Having a paper (article or letter) {{published}} in Nature or any Nature publication such as Nature chemistry or Nature chemical biology is very prestigious, and the papers are often highly cited, {{which can lead}} to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these positive feedback effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like Nature and its closest competitor, <b>Science,</b> <b>can</b> be very fierce. Natures impact factor, a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by Thomson ISI), among the highest of any science journal.|$|E
25|$|Religious persons acquire {{religious}} {{ideas and}} practices through social exposure. The {{child of a}} Zen Buddhist will not become an evangelical Christian or a Zulu warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a Roman Catholic but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says cognitive <b>science</b> <b>can</b> help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations {{and in so doing}} enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.|$|E

25|$|Experimental finance aims to {{establish}} different market settings and environments to observe experimentally {{and provide a}} lens through which <b>science</b> <b>can</b> analyze agents' behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion and aggregation, price setting mechanisms, and returns processes. Researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and therefore prove them, and attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended and be applied to future financial decisions. Research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behavior, {{and the way that}} these people act or react, of people in artificial competitive market-like settings.|$|E
25|$|A second {{exception}} {{is to be}} found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings. This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social <b>science</b> <b>can</b> address the content of legal practice.|$|E
25|$|Paul Feyerabend {{advanced}} {{the idea of}} epistemological anarchism, which holds {{that there are no}} useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth of knowledge and that the idea that <b>science</b> <b>can</b> or should operate according to universal and fixed rules are unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself. Feyerabend advocates treating science as an ideology alongside others such as religion, magic, and mythology, and considers the dominance of science in society authoritarian and unjustified. He also contended (along with Imre Lakatos) that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules. Feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of uniformity of law and process across time and space.|$|E
