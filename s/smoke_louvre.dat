2500|$|The Roundhouse is Grade II* listed. It was {{declared}} a National Heritage Site in 2010, when a Transport Trust Heritage Plaque was presented by Prince Michael of Kent. It {{is regarded as}} a notable example of mid-19th century railway architecture. The original building, [...] in diameter, is constructed in yellow brick and is distinctive for its unusual circular shape and pointed roof. The conical slate roof has a central <b>smoke</b> <b>louvre</b> (now glazed) and is supported by 24 cast-iron Doric columns (arranged around the original locomotive spaces) and a framework of curved ribs. The interior has original flooring and parts of the turntable and fragments of early railway lines.|$|E

The 15th-century construction {{can be seen as}} the central frontage with 3 gables and a porch which is thought to date to the 13th century. The building at that time would have had a great hall open to the roof, a parlour with a chamber above and some service rooms and kitchen. The original facing was decorated with flint rubble and herringbone tile courses. The original windows were of Ham Hill stone and traces of these are visible on the frontage. The porch vaulting is also of Ham Hill stone which is rare in buildings in Salisbury but common in buildings in Sherborne which implies that the building was carried out in the Sherborne Abbeyâ€™s tenancy. The oak entrance door inside the porch with small wicket leaf and strap hinges is thought to be original. Later extensions have been added to the north and south. There are <b>smoke</b> <b>louvre</b> trusses in the roof and original fireplaces in several rooms.In the 16th century the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury Cathedral let the house to a number of secular tenants. Around that period the north end of the house was extended with a large brick cross-wing out of proportion to the original house. This extension has two large mullioned and transomed windows and a staircase from the ground floor to the attic with oak balustrades around two newel posts. Two of the rooms have elaborately decorated plaster ceilings. This work was carried out under the direction of the tenants Thomas and Eleanor Sadler, Thomas was Registrar to the Bishops of Sarum. It is quite probable that it was in these rooms that King James 1 and his wife, Anne of Denmark, were entertained when they visited in 1610 and 1613.|$|E

2500|$|Little {{remains of}} the {{original}} monastic buildings, although remnants of medieval stonework from an arch are concealed in a cupboard in the house, and pieces of carved stone {{have been found in}} the grounds. The existing house, a grade I listed building, incorporates a building from the west range of the monastery, generally considered to represent the Abbot's House. It has a timber frame with a late-medieval false hammerbeam roof, described by de Figueiredo and Treuherz as [...] "extremely fine" [...] and [...] "exceptionally grand." [...] The timbers are decorated with coats of arms, including those of the abbey, and elaborate bosses to the centre of the trusses. Hammerbeam roofs are rare in Cheshire; the only other known examples are at Vale Royal Abbey and St Nicholas' Chapel in the park of Cholmondeley Castle. [...] The north end of the Great Hall retains the abbey's dais canopy, and in the centre is a <b>smoke</b> bay and <b>louvre.</b>|$|R
