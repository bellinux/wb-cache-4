6000|$|When Miss Dunstable met {{her friends}} the Greshams--young Frank Gresham and his wife--at Gatherum Castle, she {{immediately}} asked after one Dr. Thorne, who was Mrs. Gresham's uncle. Dr. Thorne {{was an old}} bachelor, in whom both as {{a man and a}} doctor Miss Dunstable was inclined to place much confidence. Not that she had ever entrusted the cure of her bodily ailments to Dr. Thorne--for she kept a doctor of her own, Dr. Easyman, for this purpose--and it may moreover be said that she rarely had bodily ailments requiring the care of any doctor. But she always spoke of Dr. Thorne among her friends as a man of wonderful erudition and judgement; and had once or twice asked and acted on his advice in matters of much moment. Dr. Thorne was not a man accustomed to the London world; he kept no house there, and seldom even visited the metropolis; but Miss Dunstable had known him at Greshamsbury, where he lived, and there had for some months past grown up a considerable intimacy between them. He was now staying at the house of his niece, Mrs. Gresham; but the chief reason of his coming up had been a desire expressed by Miss Dunstable, that he should do so. She had wished for his advice; and at the instigation of his niece he had visited London and given it. The special piece of business as to which Dr. Thorne had thus been summoned from the bedsides of his country patients, and especially from the bedside of Lady Arabella Gresham, to whose son his niece was married, related to certain large money interests, as to which one might have imagined that Dr. Thorne's advice would not be peculiarly valuable. He had never been much versed in such matters on his own account, and was knowing neither in the ways of the <b>share</b> <b>market,</b> nor in the prices of land. But Miss Dunstable was a lady accustomed to have her own way, and to be indulged in her own wishes without being called on to give adequate reasons for them. [...] "My dear," [...] she had said to young Mrs. Gresham, [...] "if your uncle don't come up to London now, when I make such a point of it, I shall think that he is a bear and a savage; and I certainly will never speak to him again,--or to Frank--or to you; so you had better see to it." [...] Mrs. Gresham had not probably taken her friend's threat as meaning quite all that it threatened. Miss Dunstable habitually used strong language; and those who knew her well, generally understood when she was to be taken as expressing her thoughts by figures of speech. In this instance she had not meant it all; but, nevertheless, Mrs. Gresham had used violent influence in bringing the poor doctor up to London. [...] "Besides," [...] said Miss Dunstable, [...] "I have resolved on having the doctor at my conversazione, and if he won't come of himself, I shall go down and fetch him. I have set my heart on trumping my dear friend Mrs. Proudie's best card; so I mean to get everybody!" ...|$|E

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBryan W. SchurleThe {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} simulation model to determine the probability of achieving a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal. Two different simulation models were developed and compared allowing the author to select the best model. The first simulation model developed used the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the mean and the standard deviation of historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the standard deviation. So, a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> of 31. 00 % and a standard deviation of 3. 88 % were used in the simulation. When these values were simulated the results determined the probability of achieving the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal of 33 %. The simulation results indicated that only 12 out of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal. Therefore, there is a 12 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> standard deviation. To predict future <b>market</b> <b>share,</b> a regression model was used to determine the impact of factors on <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The regression model was used to forecast an estimate of <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> This forecasted share of 31. 13 % was used as the mean and 3. 45 %, the standard error of the model, was used to generate a second simulation model. The simulation results indicated that 26 of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal of 33 %. This indicates that there is a 26 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on results using regression to predict future <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and variability in <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The second simulation model generated from the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> forecast and standard error from the regression model produced the better results.
