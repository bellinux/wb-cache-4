John Murray Cobbold, the club President, called together rival factions for {{a meeting at the}} Town Hall on 1 May 1936, at which it was agreed that Ipswich Town <b>should</b> <b>turn</b> professional. The club was unanimously elected to the Southern League for the 1936–37 season and former Irish international footballer Mick O'Brien was appointed as the club's first professional manager.|$|E
5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was {{tuned to the}} transmission, and the operator would listen for the signal and try {{to determine if they}} heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they would know they were too far to the left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they <b>should</b> <b>turn</b> left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving office}} as CGS, Dannatt {{effectively}} {{retired from the}} Army, but technically remained a serving officer until November 2009. Shortly after leaving office, Dannatt was approached by David Cameron, then leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition. Cameron invited Dannatt to become a defence adviser for the Shadow Cabinet once he was officially retired from the Army and no longer bound by Queen's Regulations, which mandate political neutrality in the armed forces. Although uncommon for a former service chief to align himself with one political party, Dannatt accepted the role on an informal basis. The timing of the decision, which became public in October 2009—within two months of Dannatt's effective retirement—attracted some controversy, with some former ministers and civil servants suggesting it potentially compromised the neutrality of the armed forces. He advised Cameron and his shadow cabinet until he resigned, shortly after the 2010 general election, stating that Cameron, by then prime minister, <b>should</b> <b>turn</b> to the incumbent chiefs of staff for defence advice and citing no desire to become a special adviser.|$|E

25|$|Development {{for both}} The Lightning Thief and the Percy Jackson series {{commenced}} when Rick Riordan began making stories {{for his son}} Haley Riordan, who {{had at the time}} been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. His son, Haley, had been studying Greek mythology in second grade and requested that his father tell him bedtime stories based on Greek myths. When Riordan ran out of myths, his son suggested that he make up new stories using existing mythological characters and new ones. This led Riordan to create the fictional character of Percy Jackson and create the story of how he travels across the United States to recover Zeus's lightning-bolt. Haley suggested that he <b>should</b> <b>turn</b> that story into a book, and Riordan wrote the book over the next year despite being busy at that time.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} the war, many of {{the oldest}} vessels that the Coast Guard {{operated}} were decommissioned in 1946 or 1947 and others were laid up in the reserve moorings the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland or at Kennydale, Washington. The Army and the Navy provided some newer replacement ships which were being decommissioned and they became patrol cutters and buoy tenders. In 1946 the International Ice Patrol was re-instituted after being suspended during the war years and additional cutters and aircraft had to be reserved for this mission. Congressional concerns about the Coast Guard's lack of interest in aviation led to sub-committee hearings on whether the Coast Guard <b>should</b> <b>turn</b> over the search and rescue mission aircraft assets to the Navy. Farley and Treasury Secretary Snyder pointed out that the Coast Guard was interested in aviation used for search and rescue but didn't have the funds to expand the service. The situation was not completely resolved until after Farley left office.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{maintained}} {{that the right to}} wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century, but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine (J. Braun, Liturgische Gewandung, p.453). The first undoubted instance is the bull by which Alexander II in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. The mitred abbots in England were those of Abingdon, St Alban's, Bardney, Battle, Bury St Edmunds, St Augustine's Canterbury, Colchester, Croyland, Evesham, Glastonbury, Gloucester, St Benet's Hulme, Hyde, Malmesbury, Peterborough, Ramsey, Reading, Selby, Shrewsbury, Tavistock, Thorney, Westminster, Winchcombe, and St Mary's York. Of these the precedence was yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in AD 1154 Adrian IV (Nicholas Breakspear) granted it to the abbot of St Alban's, in which monastery he had been brought up. Next after the abbot of St Alban's ranked the abbot of Westminster and then Ramsey. Elsewhere, the mitred abbots that sat in the Estates of Scotland were of Arbroath, Cambuskenneth, Coupar Angus, Dunfermline, Holyrood, Iona, Kelso, Kilwinning, Kinloss, Lindores, Paisley, Melrose, Scone, St Andrews Priory and Sweetheart. To distinguish abbots from bishops, it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials, and should not be ornamented with gold, a rule which was soon entirely disregarded, and that the crook of their pastoral staff (the crosier) <b>should</b> <b>turn</b> inwards instead of outwards, indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house.|$|E

500|$|Stede Bonnet (1688 – 10December 1718) was {{an early}} {{eighteenth-century}} Barbadian pirate, sometimes called [...] "The Gentleman Pirate" [...] {{because he was a}} moderately wealthy landowner before turning to a life of crime. Bonnet was born into a wealthy English family on the island of Barbados, and inherited the family estate after his father's death in 1694. In 1709, he married Mary Allamby, and engaged in some level of militia service. Because of marital problems, and despite his lack of sailing experience, Bonnet decided he <b>should</b> <b>turn</b> to piracy in the summer of 1717. He bought a sailing vessel, named it Revenge, and travelled with his paid crew along the Eastern Seaboard of what is now the United States, capturing other vessels and burning other Barbadian ships.|$|E

500|$|Gens {{started a}} {{theater in the}} ghetto, where poetry {{readings}} {{as well as the}} production of new and old plays took place. Gens continued the policy of supporting the ghetto library and in March 1943 he ordered that all ghetto residents <b>should</b> <b>turn</b> their privately owned books over to the library, except for textbooks and prayer books. He also set up a ghetto publishing house. Nothing was ever published, but the authors were paid for their manuscripts. An archive of historical documents relating to the ghetto was set up. The ghetto had a symphony orchestra, the formation of which owed some impetus to Gens and his police force. Gens justified these cultural activities by claiming that the Jewish administration [...] "wanted to give man the chance to be free of the ghetto for a few hours, and we succeeded in this. Our days here are harsh and grim. Our body is here in the ghetto, but they have not broken our spirit." ...|$|E

When Lois tells Chris that the only person he <b>should</b> <b>turn</b> to in this situation is himself, Chris beats Brian with a chair as an excuse to return to the vet, sees Anna there, and apologizes to her. She forgives Chris and they renew their relationship, while Brian collapses to the floor in pain. Brian asks for help but Stewie comes in and kicks Brian in his stomach, before leaving him there.|$|E
500|$|The {{need for}} the two lines to {{actually}} reach parallel lines so they might fully engage led Graves to give conflicting signals that were interpreted critically differently by Admiral Hood, directing the rear squadron, than Graves intended. None of the options for closing the angle between the lines presented a favourable option to the British commander: any manoeuvre to bring ships closer would limit their firing ability to their bow guns, and potentially expose their decks to raking or enfilading fire from the enemy ships. Graves hoisted two signals: one for [...] "line ahead", under which the ships would slowly close the gap and then straighten the line when parallel to the enemy, and one for [...] "close action", which normally indicated that ships <b>should</b> <b>turn</b> to directly approach the enemy line, turning when the appropriate distance was reached. This combination of signals resulted in the piecemeal arrival of his ships into the range of battle. Admiral Hood interpreted the instruction to maintain line of battle to take precedence over the signal for close action, {{and as a consequence}} his squadron did not close rapidly and never became significantly engaged in the action.|$|E
