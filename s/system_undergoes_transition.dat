40|$|Proteomics {{studies have}} {{revealed}} unexpected plasticity and dynamic {{nature of the}} human proteome. The paradigm that the time evolution of a biological system can be described by abundance variation of relatively few “regulated” proteins has been shuttered, being replaced by the growing understanding that the whole proteome is regulated, and no protein remains unaffected when the <b>system</b> <b>undergoes</b> <b>transition</b> from one state to another. This finding underlines the importance of systems biology analysis of expression proteomics data. Systems biology shifts the analytical focus from thousands of proteins to hundreds of signaling pathways, thus {{reducing the number of}} entities to be analyzed. Application of these methods required the development of novel systems biology tools, such as the pathway search engine (PSE [1 - 3]). These tools can only be effective when they are quantitative, i. e. predict not only the activated pathway, but also the relative degree of its activation. Introducing the quantitative aspect in systems biology {{is one of the greatest}} challenges this field is facing today, since the final goal of pathway analysis, which is the creation of a quantitative predicting model of the biological process under investigation. 1.

This system, called ω-SQUIPT, consists of a T-shaped diffusive normal metal (N) attached to three superconductors (S) forming a double loop configuration. By using the quasiclassical Green function formalism, we calculate the local normalized density of states, the Josephson currents through the device and the dependence of the former on the length of the junction arms, the applied magnetic field and the S/N interface transparencies. We show that by tuning the fluxes through the double loop, the <b>system</b> <b>undergoes</b> <b>transitions</b> from a gapped to a gapless state.

Prime examples include classical nonlinear <b>systems</b> <b>undergoing</b> <b>transitions</b> to chaos. Quantum mechanical counterparts show intriguing phenomena such as dynamical localization on the single particle level. Here we extend the concept of dynamical maps to an open-system, many-particle context: We experimentally explore the stroboscopic dynamics of a complex many-body spin model by means of a universal quantum simulator using up to five ions. In particular, we generate long-range phase coherence of spin by an iteration of purely dissipative quantum maps. We also demonstrate the characteristics of competition between combined coherent and dissipative non-equilibrium evolution. This opens the door for studying many-particle non-equilibrium physics and associated dynamical phase transitions with no immediate counterpart in equilibrium condensed matter systems. An error detection and reduction toolbox that facilitates the faithful quantum simulation of larger systems is developed as a first step in this direction.
