Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction.

25|$|A deeper {{understanding}} of the mechanisms underlying consciousness on the biochemical level has practical implications which extend to the development of more effective and reliable anesthetics. This method is especially useful for the study of consciousness because of anesthetic's well-known ability to elicit unconsciousness.

25|$|Einstein (1908) tried– as a {{preliminary}} {{in the framework}} of special relativity– also to include accelerated frames within the relativity principle. In the course of this attempt he recognized that for any <b>single</b> <b>moment</b> of acceleration of a body one can define an inertial reference frame in which the accelerated body is temporarily at rest. It follows that in accelerated frames defined in this way, the application of the constancy of the speed of light to define simultaneity is restricted to small localities. However, the equivalence principle that was used by Einstein in the course of that investigation, which expresses the equality of inertial and gravitational mass and the equivalence of accelerated frames and homogeneous gravitational fields, transcended the limits of special relativity and resulted in the formulation of general relativity.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{development}} of modern scientific method, Catholic theology had allowed for biblical text to be read as allegorical, rather than literal, where it appeared to contradict that which could be established by science or reason. Thus Catholicism {{has been able to}} refine its understanding of scripture in light of scientific discovery. Among the early Church Fathers there was debate over whether God created the world in six days, as Clement of Alexandria taught, or in a <b>single</b> <b>moment</b> as held by Augustine, and a literal interpretation of Genesis was normally taken for granted in the Middle Ages and later, until it was rejected in favour of uniformitarianism (entailing far greater timeframes) by a majority of geologists in the 19th century. However modern literal creationism has had little support among the higher levels of the Church.|$|E

The academic and critic Jan Smaczny, echoing Bernstein, calls it one of the 20th century's most influential compositions, providing [...] "endless stimulation for performers and listeners". According to Kelly the 1913 premiere might be considered [...] "the most important <b>single</b> <b>moment</b> in the history of 20th century music", and its repercussions continue to reverberate in the 21st century.

According to biographer Johnny Rogan, his recording career was [...] "all too often crystallized in a <b>single</b> <b>moment.</b> Like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Astral Weeks was perceived as a one-off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed." [...] Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record's significance. In agreement with Logan's original criticism, he later said he should have [...] "changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey ... four or five other songs {{should have had a}} change of mood." [...] Merenstein, on the other hand, still admires the album: [...] "To this day it gives me pain to hear it. Pain is the wrong word—I'm so moved by it." [...] In 2001, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped 500,000 copies in the US. Music historian Andrew Ford said the album's commercial performance, much like its musical aesthetic, is similar to classical music: [...] "Neither instant nor evanescent: Astral Weeks will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and has every year in between".|$|E
