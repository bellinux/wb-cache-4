The current legal status of <b>Symbolics</b> software is uncertain. An assortment of <b>Symbolics</b> hardware was still available for purchase as of August 2007. The US DoD is still paying <b>Symbolics</b> for regular maintenance work.|$|R
50|$|<b>Symbolics</b> Document Examiner is a {{powerful}} and early hypertext system developed at <b>Symbolics</b> (a manufacturer of high-end workstations) by Janet Walker in 1985. The <b>Symbolics</b> Document Examiner was first used for a hypertext implementation of the <b>Symbolics</b> manual in the sixth release of the Genera operating system, and was well liked, winning an award from the Society for Technical Documentation.|$|R
5|$|Living things further play a {{wide variety}} of <b>symbolic</b> roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{authors have}} speculated that {{at the core of}} this <b>symbolic</b> explosion, and in tandem, was the {{development}} of syntactic language that evolved through a highly specialized social learning system providing the means for semantically unbounded discourse. Syntax would have {{played a key role in}} this process and its full adoption could have been a crucial element of the <b>symbolic</b> behavioral package in the MSA.|$|E

50|$|<b>Symbolics</b> {{introduced}} in 1987 {{one of the}} first commercial microprocessors designed to support the execution of Lisp programs: the <b>Symbolics</b> Ivory. <b>Symbolics</b> also used its own CAD system (NS, New Schematic) {{for the development of the}} Ivory chip.|$|R
50|$|The Lisp Machine system {{software}} was then copyrighted by MIT, and was licensed to both <b>Symbolics</b> and LMI. Until 1981, <b>Symbolics</b> shared all its copyrighted enhancements {{to the source}} code with MIT and kept it on an MIT server. According to Richard Stallman, <b>Symbolics</b> engaged in a business tactic in which it forced MIT to make all Symbolics' copyrighted fixes and improvements to the Lisp Machine OS available only to <b>Symbolics</b> (and MIT but not to <b>Symbolics</b> competitors), and thereby choke off its competitor LMI, which at that time had insufficient resources to independently maintain or develop the OS and environment.|$|R
50|$|The {{authoring}} {{environment for}} the Document Examiner was <b>Symbolics</b> Concordia. With <b>Symbolics</b> Concordia {{it was possible to}} edit all documentation.|$|R

50|$|<b>Symbolics</b> {{continued}} as an enterprise with very limited revenues, supported mainly by service contracts {{on the remaining}} MacIvory, UX-1200, UX-1201, and other machines still used by commercial customers. <b>Symbolics</b> also sold Virtual Lisp Machine (VLM) software for DEC, Compaq, and HP Alpha-based workstations (AlphaStation) and servers (AlphaServer), refurbished MacIvory IIs, and <b>Symbolics</b> keyboards.|$|R
50|$|The Lisp Machine File System {{supports}} versioning. This {{was provided}} by implementations from MIT, LMI, <b>Symbolics</b> and Texas Instruments. Such an operating system was <b>Symbolics</b> Genera.|$|R

5|$|<b>Symbolic</b> {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of <b>symbolic</b> behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey <b>symbolic</b> thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Symbolics</b> Graphics Division (SGD, {{founded in}} 1982, sold to Nichimen Graphics in 1992) {{developed}} the S-Graphics software suite (S-Paint, S-Geometry, S-Dynamics, S-Render) for <b>Symbolics</b> Genera.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, he co-founded <b>Symbolics,</b> {{developing}} {{software for}} the <b>Symbolics</b> Lisp Machine. He also participated significantly {{in the design of}} the Common Lisp programming language; he was one of the five co-authors of the original Common Lisp specification, Common Lisp: The Language, First Edition. He worked on Statice, an object-oriented database published by <b>Symbolics</b> in 1988.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} {{application}} {{program for the}} <b>Symbolics</b> Lisp Machine was the ICAD computer-aided engineering system. One of the first networked multi-player video games, a version of Spacewar, was developed for the <b>Symbolics</b> Lisp Machine in 1983. Electronic CAD software on the <b>Symbolics</b> Lisp Machine was used to develop the first implementation of the Hewlett-Packard Precision Architecture.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} interpretations of the <b>symbolic</b> meanings of Kaali's depiction, depending on a Tantric or devotional approach, and on whether one views her image symbolically, allegorically, or mystically.|$|E

50|$|When <b>Symbolics</b> {{was founded}} in 1985 to commercialize the Lisp Machine, {{he became one of}} its founders. He {{continued}} to develop new hardware and software at <b>Symbolics,</b> and was listed as a <b>Symbolics</b> Fellow in 1989, but left the company in 1990 to join a project to develop a new operating system. He also made important contributions to the standardization of Common Lisp.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Symbolics</b> {{felt that}} they no longer had {{sufficient}} control over their product. At that point, <b>Symbolics</b> began using their own copy of the software, located on their company servers [...] - [...] while Stallman says that <b>Symbolics</b> did that to prevent its Lisp improvements from flowing to Lisp Machines, Inc. From that base, <b>Symbolics</b> made extensive improvements to every part of the software, and continued to deliver almost all the source code to their customers (including MIT). However, the policy prohibited MIT staff from distributing the <b>Symbolics</b> version of the software to others. With the end of open collaboration came the end of the MIT hacker community. As a reaction to this, Stallman initiated the GNU project to make a new community. Eventually, Copyleft and the GNU General Public License would ensure that a hacker's software could remain free software. In this way <b>Symbolics</b> played a key, albeit adversarial, role in instigating the free software movement.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Symbolics</b> Document Examiner {{hypertext}} system originally {{used for}} the <b>Symbolics</b> manuals- {{it was based on}} Zmacs following a design by Janet Walker, and proved influential in the evolution of hypertext.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} Liliaceae genera are popular {{cultivated}} plants {{in private and}} public spaces. Lilies and tulips in particular have had considerable <b>symbolic</b> and decorative value, and appear frequently in paintings and the decorative arts. They are also an economically important product.|$|E
5|$|Another popular festival {{witnessed}} by visitors and locals is the Sho Dun Festival {{held in the}} month of August in the Gregorian calendar. The festival represents the <b>symbolic</b> Buddha-Unfolding, where worship of the Buddha is the essential part.|$|E
5|$|By August 1944, Turkey {{broke off}} {{relations}} with Germany, as defeat {{began to seem}} inevitable. In February 1945, it declared war on Germany and Japan, a <b>symbolic</b> move that allowed Turkey to join the emerging United Nations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Symbolics</b> {{developed}} Genera {{based on}} this foundation of the MIT Lisp machine operating system. It sells the operating system and layered software. Some of the layered software has been integrated into Genera in later releases. <b>Symbolics</b> improved the operating system software from the original MIT Lisp Machine and expanded it. The Genera operating system was only available for <b>Symbolics</b> Lisp Machines and the Open Genera virtual machine.|$|R
50|$|Around {{this time}} <b>Symbolics</b> (Noftsker's firm) began operating. It had been {{hindered}} by Noftsker's promise to give Greenblatt a year’s head start, and by severe delays in procuring venture capital. <b>Symbolics</b> {{still had the}} major advantage that while 3 or 4 of the AI Lab hackers had gone to work for Greenblatt, a solid 14 other hackers had signed onto <b>Symbolics.</b> Two AI Lab people were not hired by either: Richard Stallman and Marvin Minsky. Stallman, however, blamed <b>Symbolics</b> for {{the decline of the}} hacker community that had centered around the AI lab. For two years, from 1982 to the end of 1983, Stallman worked by himself to clone the output of the <b>Symbolics</b> programmers, with the aim of preventing them from gaining a monopoly on the lab's computers.|$|R
50|$|When Noftsker started <b>Symbolics,</b> {{while he}} was able to pay salaries, he didn't {{actually}} have a building or any equipment for the programmers to work on. He bargained with Patrick Winston that, in exchange for allowing Symbolics' staff to keep working out of MIT, <b>Symbolics</b> would let MIT use internally and freely all the software <b>Symbolics</b> developed. Unfortunately this openness would later lead to accusations of intellectual property theft.|$|R
