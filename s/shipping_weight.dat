2500|$|Mechanically, the Fiesta had {{a special}} version of the 98 engine which gained 5 {{horsepower}} to 170 through manifold streamlining and compression increased from 8.1:1 to 8.3:1. A four speed Hydramatic automatic transmission and faster rear axle rato were designed to keep the 4459 pound <b>shipping</b> <b>weight</b> Fiesta (336 more than a standard 98 convertible) up to Oldsmobile performance standards. At $5,715 (over $700 more than the Skylark) the Fiesta was nearly twice the $2963 price of a standard 98 convertible, with only 458 units produced to its 7,521.|$|E

2500|$|The Gran Torino Sport {{was only}} a shadow of its former self for 1974. [...] With the Sportsroof model discontinued, Sport models were often {{difficult}} to distinguish from Gran Torino 2-doors. To add insult to injury, the Sport was even available with optional opera windows (on vinyl-roofed cars) and fender skirts. The Sport continued to have its unique emblems displayed on the grille, the C-pillar, and the fuel filler door, plus [...] "Sport" [...] script was placed by the C-pillar emblem. When opera windows were ordered, the script was placed below the [...] "Gran Torino" [...] nameplate on the fenders, and the C-pillar emblem was deleted. The laser stripe was no longer available, but a lower body multi-coloured non-reflective stripe was an option. The Sport now used the same vinyl door panel of the other Gran Torinos. The instrument package became a standard feature, as were 78 series radial ply tires (70 series used in 1973). Bucket seats remained an option, but now were a low back design with separate head rests. At extra cost, Sport door panels and seats could be highlighted with coloured stripes. The optional [...] "Magnum 500" [...] wheel was revised with the formerly chromed wheel rim replaced by a polished trim ring and argent painted spokes. [...] Performance was even more lackluster for 1974 models, with power down and weight up. The 1974 Sport had a <b>shipping</b> <b>weight</b> almost [...] heavier than a 1972 Sport.|$|E
50|$|Riding on a 123.0 in {{wheelbase}} {{and measuring}} 215.6 in overall, the 1955 Capri was {{offered as a}} two-door hardtop coupé (4305 lb <b>shipping</b> <b>weight),</b> two-door convertible (4415 lb <b>shipping</b> <b>weight),</b> or a four-door sedan (4275 lb <b>shipping</b> <b>weight).</b>|$|E

25|$|Deckhouses on the France's {{superstructure}} {{were built}} of aluminium, {{to reduce the}} <b>ship's</b> <b>weight</b> and thereby conserve fuel in operation. Within the superstructure a full-length outdoor promenade deck was designed into {{both sides of the}} Pont Canots. Unlike on many other ships, this deck did not wrap completely around the ship, being blocked at the forward end by cabins built in behind the bridgescreen.|$|R
50|$|Like the Providence class cruisers, the Galveston class ships {{suffered}} from serious stability {{problems caused by}} the topweight of the missile system. Indeed, the Galveston class ships were more affected by heavy Talos missile system than the Terrier equipped <b>ships.</b> <b>Weight</b> reduction measures {{and the use of}} ballast were necessary to improve stability. The cruisers, particularly Galveston, also {{suffered from}} hogging of the hull.|$|R

50|$|Each lantern {{includes}} a solar panel, a rechargeable lithium polymer battery, and 10 LEDs. Exposing the solar panel to bright sunlight for about 8 hours charges the battery. A {{button on the}} lantern switches between off, low, high and blinking. A fully charged lantern can provide 100 lumens of light for up to 8-12 hours. The SolarPuff lantern (expanded 4.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches, 2.9 oz (<b>shipping</b> <b>weight</b> 3.2 oz.), flat pack to 0.25 inches) {{is larger than the}} SolarHelix lantern (expanded 4.3 x. 4.3 x.4.3 inches, 3 oz (<b>shipping</b> <b>weight</b> 3.5 oz.), flat pack to 0.5 inches). The SolarPuff lantern's material, that functions as a light diffuser, is very high quality sailcloth used for upscale ship sails. The Solar Helix lantern's material is flexible, recyclable TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane).|$|E
50|$|The 1971-76 Grand Safaris, {{shared their}} 127.0 in {{wheelbase}} with the Buick and Oldsmobile C-body cars but were designated as B-bodies. At 231.3 in in length the 1974-76 Grand Safaris are the longest Pontiacs ever built. And at 5112 lb <b>shipping</b> <b>weight,</b> or about 5300 lb curb weight, the three-seat 1974 Grand Safari wagons are easily the heaviest Pontiacs ever built.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not until}} 1922, {{in the wake of}} the Washington Naval Treaty that curtailed <b>ship</b> <b>weights</b> and with the {{introduction}} of the British s, that a true layered torpedo belt was introduced. The two Nelsons used a water-filled belt, which was written off in the tonnage limits, as water was not part of the calculations for allowed displacement. Over the next 20 years many innovative designs of TDS were tried by various nations.|$|R
25|$|In {{the end of}} July Ratnik {{appealed to}} the NTC again, arguing that the {{mechanisms}} and systems overlooked by the designers will add five to six hundred tons to the <b>ship's</b> <b>weight.</b> The NTC dismissed his complaint and proceeded with the flawed design. In line with Russian practice of the period, it was a collective work signed off by a ring of designers and bureaucrats. No one dared {{to take the lead}} and assume full responsibility.|$|R
25|$|Although icebreaking {{cargo ships}} {{had been built}} in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water {{performance}} and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the <b>ship's</b> <b>weight,</b> has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather. However, a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance, making it unsuitable for icebreakers. As a result, the total efficiency of icebreaking ships is 20–40% less than that of good open water vessels of similar size mainly due to the bow form.|$|R
5000|$|Norwegian International Ship Register or NIS is a {{separate}} Norwegian ship register for Norwegian vessels aimed at competing with flags of convenience registers like Panama, Liberia etc. Originally proposed by Erling Dekke Næss in 1984 it was established in Bergen in 1987 and is managed by the Norwegian Ship Registers. In 2010, it was the 12th ship register by gross weight representing 1% of the global <b>shipping</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Advantages {{of instant}} coffee include speed of {{preparation}} (instant coffee dissolves quickly in hot water), lower <b>shipping</b> <b>weight</b> and volume than beans or ground coffee (to prepare {{the same amount}} of beverage), and long shelf life—though instant coffee can spoil if not kept dry. Instant coffee also reduces cleanup since there are no coffee grounds, and at least one study has found that it has a lower environmental footprint than other preparation methods.|$|E
50|$|The Roths Garden King-Model W is a {{self-propelled}} two-wheel tractor {{which was}} introduced sometime around 1945. The {{number of units}} produced remains unknown. According to a March 15, 1949 part list, the 6 H.P. standard Garden King walking tractor and reverse drive with 6x12 tires had a domestic <b>shipping</b> <b>weight</b> of 504 lb, a net weight of 420 lb, and a list price of $375.00. Later in 1954 this tractor was listed as $345.00.|$|E
40|$|The project {{described}} in this report dealt with improving the materials performance and fabrication for hydrotreating reactor vessels, heat recovery systems, and other components for the petroleum and chemical industries. These reactor vessels can approach <b>ship</b> <b>weights</b> of about 300 tons with vessel wall thicknesses of 3 to 8 inches. They are typically fabricated from Fe-Cr-Mo alloy steels, containing 1. 25 to 12 % chromium and 1 to 2 % molybdenum. The goal of this project was to develop Fe-Cr-W(V) steels that can perform similar duties, {{in terms of strength}} at high temperatures, but will weigh less and thereby save energy...|$|R
50|$|On January 31, 1918, {{the ship}} was {{launched}} {{in the presence of}} Crown Prince Gustav VI Adolf. Before launching, there was anxiety that as the ship slipped into the water it would hit {{the opposite side of the}} harbor basin, as the distance to this was considered short and the <b>ship's</b> <b>weight</b> was so great. To prevent a collision with the basin edge heavy chains were attached to the ship which would help arrest its momentum and at the edge of the basin were laid wooden logs that would help dampen a possible collision. The launching proved successful when the chains effectively braked the ship before reaching the quayside.|$|R
