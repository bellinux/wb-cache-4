40|$|Context. Gestural {{interfaces}} {{involves the}} ability of technology identifying and recognizing human body language and then interpret this into commands. This is usually used to ease our everyday life, but also to increase usability in for example mobile phones. Objectives. In this study {{the use of a}} gestural interface is evaluated as an interaction method to facilitate the introduction of new and novice users to 3 D modeling tools. A gestural interface might reduce the modeling time without making an impact {{on the quality of the}} result. Methods. A gestural interface is designed and implemented based on previous research regarding gestural interfaces. Time and quality results are gathered through an experiment where participants are to complete a set of tasks in the modeling tool Autodesk Maya that relates to modeling. These tasks are executed in both the implemented gestural interfaces as well as the standard interface of Autodesk Maya. User experience is also gathered through the use of a <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Results. 17 participants took part in the experiment. Each participant generated time and quality results for each task of the experiment for each interface. For each interface the user experience was recorded through a <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Conclusions. The results showed that the use of a gestural interface did increase the modeling time for the users, indicating that the use of a gestural interface was not preferable as an interaction medium. The results did show that the time difference between the interfaces was reduced for each completed task, indicating that the gestural interface might have an increase in learnability of the software. The same indication were given from the <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Also, the results did not show any impact on the quality...|$|E

However, the currently existing applications for therapy of cockroach phobia that uses AR technology are still very dependent towards the presence of markers, which might lessen {{the feeling of being}} in an actual scenario from everyday lives. In this paper, we created a system that is able to use everyday things as a replacement for markers for phobia therapy for cockroach. There are five main processes: getting the live streaming feed from camera, preprocessing, extracting the center point of the objects, tracking the marker-substitute objects, and lastly, instantiating cockroaches randomly after user lifts the objects according to the number and mode of the cockroaches, whether it is moving or not, that are predetermined by the user. The evaluation in this paper includes eight participants that are carefully selected based on their Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) score that is translated into Indonesian and modified to accommodate cockroaches instead of spiders. The results is that the system can induce anxiety level on participants with the highest score of 10, which is the highest score in Standard Unit of Discomfort scale (SUDs).

Usability was evaluated using the System Usability Scale (<b>SUS),</b> a validated <b>questionnaire</b> resulting in a score from 0 to 100. For the content rating, we constructed a six-item scale resulting in a score from 1 to 5 (Cronbach's α, 0. 83). Comments were analyzed qualitatively. Fifty-five survivors and forty-three parents of survivors completed the questionnaire. Median age of respondents was 41 years (range, 17 - 58). Respondents rated the website's usability with a mean SUS score of 72. 5 (95 % CI, 69. 2 - 74. 9). The mean content rating was 3. 7 (95 % CI, 3. 5 - 3. 8). No determinants were significantly related to the perceived usability or content satisfaction in multivariate analyses. Qualitative analysis revealed respondents' preference for more detailed and even scientific information on late effects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{research}} studies investigating {{the effectiveness of}} the different treatments have demonstrated that exposure-based therapies are more suitable and effective than others for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Traditionally, exposure may be achieved in two manners: in vivo, with direct contact to the stimulus, or by imagery, in the person's imagination. However, despite its effectiveness, both types of exposure present some limitations that supported the use of Virtual Reality (VR). But is VR always an effective stressor? Are the technological breakdowns that may appear during such an experience a possible risk for its effectiveness? METHODS: To answer these questions we compared changes following the exposure to an academic examination, one of the most universal examples of real-life stressors, in a sample of 39 undergraduate students. The same experience was offered using text (TX), audio (AU), video (VD), and VR. However, in the virtual environment we manipulated the experience introducing technological breakdowns. The Post Media Questionnaire (PMQ) and the Slater-Usoh-Steed Presence <b>Questionnaire</b> (<b>SUS)</b> were administered to each participant in order to evaluated self-report measures of anxiety and relaxation and the level of presence experience during media exposure. Electrocardiogram (ECG), Thoracic Respiration Signal (RSP) and Facial corrugator supercilii muscle Electromyography (EMG) were recorded in order to obtain objective measures of subjects' emotional state. RESULTS: Analyses conducted on PMQ showed a significant increase in anxiety scores and a mirror decrease in relax scores after all our emotional procedures, showing that all the condition were effective in inducing a negative emotional response. Psychometric scores and psychophysiological indexes showed that VR was less effective than other procedures in eliciting stress responses. Moreover, we did not observe significative difference in SUS scores: VR induced a sense of presence similar to that experienced during the exposition to other media. CONCLUSIONS: Technological breakdowns significantly reduce the possibility of VR eliciting emotions related to complex real-life stressors. Without a high sense of presence, the significant advantages offered by VR disappear and its emotional induction abilities are even lower than the ones provided by much cheaper media.

Como procedimentos metodológicos foram adotados: a realização de um busca sistemática e a verificação do modelo proposto através de testes de usabilidade. A proposta do MORIC (Modelo para a Mediação Tecnológica em Redes Sociais Temáticas Inclusivas) definiu, por meio de uma metodologia de desenvolvimento de Sistemas Hipermídia Adaptativos (Modelo de Munich - UWE), os detalhes da solução proposta. Aplicou-se esse Modelo à plataforma Elgg, onde esse ambiente utilizado para o desenvolvimento de redes sociais sofreu alterações para atender os objetivos desta pesquisa. Depois disso, nos testes realizados com cinco usuários com deficiência visual, durante ensaios de interação destes com a RST, foram confirmadas falhas de usabilidade, mas que não prejudicaram o interesse e a aceitação do ambiente. Após os ensaios, a RST foi avaliada por meio do questionário SUS (System Usability of Scale) e atingiu a média de 78, 50 % (setenta e oito vírgula cinquenta por cento). A avaliação dos dados obtidos com os ensaios de interação e com o questionário aplicado resultou na indicação de trinta e três recomendações para o desenvolvimento de RST Inclusivas.

The recommendations arising from this paper describe the features and the main requirements that would allow people in the same environment to be perceived by the system, would then act in relations between them and the resources offered by the network itself. Among the general problems presented in the survey, we emphasize the lack of research on the formation of online communities formed by people with disabilities and the difficulty of offering alternative content without increasing cognitive overload and disorientation, according to the users? characteristics. With that in mind, this paper adopted the following theoretical approaches: adaptive hypermedia, accessibility, situated cognition theory and online communities. The following methodological procedures were adopted: the realization of a systematic search and verification of the proposed through usability testing model. The proposed Moric (Model for Technological Mediation in Social Issue Inclusive Networks) defined by means of a methodology for developing Adaptive Hypermedia Systems (Model Munich - UWE), details of the proposed solution.

40|$|These three manuscripts are {{presented}} as a PhD dissertation {{for the study of}} using GeoVis application to evaluate telehealth programs. The primary reason of this research was to understand how the GeoVis applications can be designed and developed using combined approaches of HC approach and cognitive fit theory and in terms utilized to evaluate telehealth program in Brazil. First manuscript The first manuscript in this dissertation presented a background about the use of GeoVisualization to facilitate visual exploration of public health data. The manuscript covered the existing challenges that were associated with an adoption of existing GeoVis applications. The manuscript combines the principles of Human Centered approach and Cognitive Fit Theory and a framework using a combination of these approaches is developed that lays the foundation of this research. The framework is then utilized to propose the design, development and evaluation of “the SanaViz” to evaluate telehealth data in Brazil, as a proof of concept. Second manuscript The second manuscript is a methods paper that describes the approaches that can be employed to design and develop “the SanaViz” based on the proposed framework. By defining the various elements of the HC approach and CFT, a mixed methods approach is utilized for the card sorting and sketching techniques. A representative sample of 20 study participants currently involved in the telehealth program at the NUTES telehealth center at UFPE, Recife, Brazil was enrolled. The findings of this manuscript helped us understand the needs of the diverse group of telehealth users, the tasks that they perform and helped us determine the essential features that might be necessary {{to be included in the}} proposed GeoVis application “the SanaViz”. Third manuscript The third manuscript involved mix- methods approach to compare the effectiveness and usefulness of the HC GeoVis application “the SanaViz” against a conventional GeoVis application “Instant Atlas”. The same group of 20 study participants who had earlier participated during Aim 2 was enrolled and a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessments was done. Effectiveness was gauged by the time that the participants took to complete the tasks using both the GeoVis applications, the ease with which they completed the tasks and the number of attempts that were taken to complete each task. Usefulness was assessed by System Usability Scale (<b>SUS),</b> a validated <b>questionnaire</b> tested in prior studies. In-depth interviews were conducted to gather opinions about both the GeoVis applications. This manuscript helped us in the demonstration of the usefulness and effectiveness of HC GeoVis applications to facilitate visual exploration of telehealth data, as a proof of concept. Together, these three manuscripts represent challenges of combining principles of Human Centered approach, Cognitive Fit Theory to design and develop GeoVis applications as a method to evaluate Telehealth data. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the usefulness and effectiveness of GeoVis to facilitate visual exploration of telehealth data. The results of the research enabled us to develop a framework for the design and development of GeoVis applications related to the areas of public health and especially telehealth. The results of our study showed that the varied users were involved with the telehealth program and the tasks that they performed. Further it enabled us to identify the components that might be essential to be included in these GeoVis applications. The results of our research answered the following questions; (a) Telehealth users vary in their level of understanding about GeoVis (b) Interaction features such as zooming, sorting, and linking and multiple views and representation features such as bar chart and choropleth maps were considered the most essential features of the GeoVis applications. (c) Comparing and sorting were two important tasks that the telehealth users would perform for exploratory data analysis. (d) A HC GeoVis prototype application is more effective and useful for exploration of telehealth data than a conventional GeoVis application. Future studies should be done to incorporate the proposed HC GeoVis framework to enable comprehensive assessment of the users and the tasks they perform to identify the features that might be necessary to be a part of the GeoVis applications. The results of this study demonstrate a novel approach to comprehensively and systematically enhance the evaluation of telehealth programs using the proposed GeoVis Framework...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the main}} reasons that leads to a low {{adoption}} rate of telemedicine systems is poor usability. An aspect that influences usability during the reporting of findings is the input mode, e. g., if a free-text (FT) or a structured report (SR) interface is employed. The objective of our study is to compare the usability of FT and ST telemedicine systems, specifically in terms of user satisfaction, efficiency and general usability. We comparatively evaluate the usability of these two input modes in a telecardiology system for issuing electrocardiography reports {{in the context of a}} statewide telemedicine system in Brazil with more than 350. 000 performed tele-electrocardiography examinations. We adopted a multiple method research strategy, applying three different kinds of usability evaluations: user satisfaction was evaluated through interviews with seven medical professionals using the System Usability Scale (<b>SUS)</b> <b>questionnaire</b> and specific questions related to adequacy and user experience. Efficiency was evaluated by estimating execution time using the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM). General usability was assessed based on the conformity of the systems to a set of e-health specific usability heuristics. The results of this comparison provide a first indication that a structured report (SR) input mode for such a system is more satisfactory and efficient with a larger conformity to usability heuristics than free-text (FT) input. User satisfaction using the <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire</b> has been scored in average with 58. 8 and 77. 5 points for the FT and SR system, respectively, which means that the SR system was rated 18. 65 points higher than the FT system. In terms of efficiency, the completion of a findings report using the SR mode is estimated to take 8. 5 s, 3. 74 times faster than using the FT system (31. 8 s). The SR system also demonstrated less violations to usability heuristics (8 points) in comparison to 14 points observed in the FT system. These results provide a first indication that the usage of structured reporting as an input mode in telecardiology systems may enhance usability. This also seems to confirm the advantages of the usage of structured reporting, as already described in the literature for other areas such as teleradiology...|$|E
30|$|Although {{there is}} a wide range of methods {{available}} for assessing a system’s ease of use, few of them are so far particularly tailored to ECAs. Using established questionnaires like the Software Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) (Kirakowski and Corbett 1993) and the Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS) (Shannon and Weaver 1987) might be problematic as they were developed for unimodal graphical user interfaces like websites. However, the scale measuring Pragmatic Qualities of the AttrakDiff may provide meaningful results (cf. Section “Hedonic and pragmatic qualities”). A possible explanation is that the AttrakDiff measures on a relatively high level appropriate for a variety of different interfaces. The <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire</b> also offers rather generic questions, which might be adaptable to ECAs (Brooke 1996). However, there are instrumental means to assess the cognitive load. In experimental conditions, providing a secondary task (dual task paradigm) can be used to increase the load so that indirect measures show differences in cognitive load more clearly (cf. Stevens et al. (2013) for details, especially for a method suited for ECAs).|$|E

To evaluate system usability, after using the QR Code Identity Tag system, volunteers were asked to complete the System Usability Scale (SUS) (Brooke 2013; Brooke et al. 1996) questionnaire. Many studies have been conducted to assist practitioners in assessing product/service usability. While many studies have focused on specific interface types, information from other studies may be used to analyze a wider range of interface types. In our study, we used the <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire</b> because it has the capacity to analyze a wide range of products and services with verified validity. Some features of the SUS make it quite useful. First, it is simple, consisting of only 10 statements, and is quick and easy for subjects to complete. Second, it is open source, free to use, and quick to score. Third, it employs agnostic technology, meaning that {{it can be used to}} analyze various types of user interfaces, such as websites, cell phones, interactive voice response systems (both touch-tone and speech), and TV applications. Finally, the result of the survey is a single score that varies between 0 and 100. Thus, it is relatively easy to understand for researchers from other disciplines who work on project teams (Bangor et al. 2008; Lewis and Sauro 2009; Sauro 2011; Bangor et al. 2009; Tullis and Stetson 2004).|$|E

Apart from typical symptoms like inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness, patients also evidence attention deficit problems with reading comprehension. This in turn causes poor school performance and widens the gap with peers without ADHD. This paper presents a novel and interactive tool based on Serious Games for Health, whose aim is not only to improve comprehension, but also hold the user’s attention. This tool is geared towards assessing reading quality and is intended for iPad devices. Preliminary results obtained from the experiment performed to evaluate the game are included in this report. A group of six typically developing children from Colegio Vizcaya aged between 8 and 12 took part in the evaluation of motivation, satisfaction and usability of the same therapy in the new media. Results obtained by participants playing the game were analysed together with questionnaires concerning the usability of the system. Game evaluation resulted in relatively good statistics-average score was 3 points out of 4 and average time for completing the exercise was 59 seconds. A <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire</b> with an average score of 92. 75 out of 100 indicates that the game presented is user-friendly and an effective tool. Moreover, based on the feedback obtained from participants, the game had been improved and additional functionality introduced. Older participants completed the first game faster than the younger ones, but age was not influential in subsequent games...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{increase}} the functional capabilities of stroke subjects during {{activities of daily}} living, patients receive rehabilitative training to recover adequate motor control. With the goal to motivate self-training by use of the arm in daily life tasks, a sensor system (Arm Usage Coach, AUC) was developed that provides VibroTactile (VT) feedback if the patient does not move the affected arm above a certain threshold level. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the usability of this system in stroke subjects. Method: The study was designed as a usability and user acceptance study of feedback modalities. Stroke subjects with mild to moderate arm impairments were enrolled. The subjects wore two AUC devices one on each wrist. VT feedback was given by the device on the affected arm. A semi-structured interview was performed before and after a measurement session with the AUC. In addition, the System Usability Scale (<b>SUS)</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was given. Results: Ten ischemic chronic stroke patients (39 ± 38 months after stroke) were recruited. Four out of 10 subjects have worn the VT feedback on their dominant, affected arm. In the pre-measurement interview, eight participants indicated a preference for acoustic or visual over VT feedback. In the post evaluation interview, nine of 10 participants preferred VT over visual and acoustic feedback. On average, the AUC gave VT feedback six times during the measurement session. All participants, with the exception of one, used their dominant arm more then the non-dominant. For the SUS, eight participants responded above 80 %, one between 70 and 80 %, and one participant responded below 50 %. Discussion: More patients accepted and valued VT feedback after the test period, hence VT is a feasible feedback modality. The AUC can be used as a telerehabilitation device to train and maintain upper extremity use in daily life tasks...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} Virtual Reality {{has been around}} since early 1960 s, but the {{availability}} and development of Virtual Re-ality systems were largely limited due to its nature of high cost and difficulty in maintenance. Until recently, thanks to the fast development of the modern technology, the idea of building Virtual Reality system using commodity-off-the-shelf hardware became feasible. By using Personal Com-puters, we have in this project developed a Low-Cost Dis-tributed Virtual Reality system that is much cheaper, easier to maintain and mobile. In this project, the design of stereo vision, corner projection and distributed architecture had been discussed and applied in the implementation of the Vir-tual Reality system. User experiment had been conducted. The aim of the user experiment is to test the system for presence level, Slater, Usoh and Steed (<b>SUS)</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was used as an indication to the level of presence. Fur-thermore, network performance related to scene complexi-ties were also evaluated. From these experiment, we have found that the Virtual Reality system developed creates a good level of presence to the participants and scene com-plexity would influence the roundtrip time of the network. Lastly, this paper concludes by discussing why the Low-Cost Virtual Reality system developed to be an effective Virtual Reality system.

40|$|If we are {{to learn}} {{the effects of the}} {{environment}} and our day-to-day actions, and choices on our physiology, we must develop systems that will label biophysiological senor data with contextual information. In this thesis I first present an architecture and implementation of FEEL: a system for the acquisition, processing and visualization of biophysiological signals and contextual information. The system comprises a mobile client application (FMC) and a backend server, The mobile client collects contextual information: phone call details, email reading details, calendar entries, and user location at a fixed interval that is transmitted to the backend server. The backend server stores the contextual information and biophysiological signal data that is uploaded by the user, processes the information and provides a novel interface for viewing the combined data. Next, I present the results of a 10 -day user study in which users wore Electrodermal Activity (EDA) wrist sensors that measured their autonomic arousal levels. These users were requested to upload the sensor data and annotate it {{at the end of the}} day at first, and then after two days. One group of users had access to both the signal and the full contextual information collected by the mobile phone and the other group could only access the bio physiological signal. At the end of the study the users were asked to fill in a System Usability Scale (<b>SUS)</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> a user experience survey and a Toronto-Alexithymia (TAS- 20) questionnaire. My results show that the FEEL system enables the users to annotate bio-physiological signals at a greater effectiveness than the current state of the art. Finally, I showed that there is a correlation between a person's ability to determine their own arousal level and their score on the Toronto-alexithymia test: the less alexythymic they were, the better their correlation between the EDA and their self-reported arousal. by Yadid Ayzenberg.

40|$|The {{computer}} mouse {{has been one}} of the most commonly used interaction devices for a long time. This thesis set out to explore new interaction possibilities in regards to effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. The Microsoft Kinect v 2 sensor and the traditional {{computer mouse}} were selected for comparison. Kinect support was implemented for Petrel software and a usability study was conducted to evaluate Kinect s feasibility. The metrics used for evaluating usability were effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction as reported by test participants through use of the think-aloud method and questionnaires. The test consisted of three parts, one about getting familiar with the software, one about data optimization and one about data visualization. Ten students in the age range 21 - 29 participated in the study. 70 % had used a Kinect before while only 10 % had used Petrel software before. The test was performed first with a mouse and afterwards with the Kinect. Participants were required to provide feedback both during and after testing, both vocally and in writing. A <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was used, with mouse scores being 2. 2 % higher on average than Kinect scores. Similarly close results were seen in execution times, with only one of the three test parts differing significantly between devices. Task two took one minute and 24 seconds longer on average with Kinect. It can be concluded that the precision of an implemented gesture is essential for the Kinect s performance. The qualitative analysis suggested that users preferred the mouse in regards to effectiveness and efficiency, but preferred the Kinect in regards to user satisfaction. It is likely that this is due to the Kinect s novelty effect. Both numerical results and the user evaluations were closer in value than anticipated. The findings implicate that supporting the right gestures and providing the required precision could make the Kinect a competitive interaction device in some areas. The most common suggestions made by study participants were demonstrations and presentations. It can be concluded that the Kinect is a good alternative where the fun and novelty aspects are important...|$|E
40|$|Background: A large {{proportion}} of patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis (OA) {{do not meet the}} recommended levels of physical activity (PA). Therefore, we developed a web-based intervention that provides a tailored PA program for patients with knee and/or hip OA, entitled Join 2 move. The intervention incorporates core principles of the behaviour graded activity theory (BGA). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the preliminary effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of Join 2 move in patients with knee and/or hip OA. Methods. A non-randomized pilot study was performed among patients with knee and/or hip OA. Primary outcomes were PA (SQUASH Questionnaire), physical function (HOOS and KOOS questionnaires) and self-perceived effect (7 -point Likert scale). Baseline, 6 and 12 week follow-up data were collected via online questionnaires. To assess feasibility and acceptability, program usage (modules completed) and user satisfaction (<b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire)</b> were measured as secondary outcomes. Participants from the pilot study were invited to be interviewed. The interviews focused on users' experiences with Join 2 move. Besides the pilot study we performed two usability tests to determine the feasibility and acceptability of Join 2 move. In the first usability test, software experts evaluated the website from a list of usability concepts. In the second test, users were asked to verbalize thoughts during the execution of multiple tasks. Results: Twenty OA patients with knee and/or hip OA between 50 and 80 years of age participated in the pilot study. After six weeks, pain scores increased from 5. 3 to 6. 6 (p= 0. 04). After 12 weeks this difference disappeared (p= 0. 5). Overall, users were enthusiastic about Join 2 move. In particular, performing exercise at one's own pace without time or travel restrictions was cited as convenient. However, some minor flaws were observed. Users perceived some difficulties in completing the entire introduction module and rated the inability to edit and undo actions as annoying. Conclusions: This paper outlines the preliminary effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of a web-based PA intervention. Preliminary results from the pilot study revealed that PA scores increased, although differences were not statistically significant. Interviews and usability tests suggest that the intervention is feasible and acceptable in promoting PA in patients with knee and/or hip OA. The intervention was easy to use and the satisfaction with the program was high. Trial registration. The Netherlands National Trial Register.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the field}} of {{occupational}} therapy, the assistive equipment provision process (AEPP) is a prominent preventive strategy used to promote independent living and to identify and alleviate fall risk factors via the provision of assistive equipment within the home environment. Current practice {{involves the use of}} paper-based forms that include 2 D measurement guidance diagrams that aim to communicate the precise points and dimensions that must be measured in order to make AEPP assessments. There are, however, issues such as "poor fit" of equipment due to inaccurate measurements taken and recorded, resulting in more than 50 % of equipment installed within the home being abandoned by patients. This paper presents a novel 3 D measurement aid prototype (3 D-MAP) that provides enhanced measurement and assessment guidance to patients via the use of 3 D visualization technologies. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the perceptions of older adults with regard to the barriers and opportunities of using the 3 D-MAP application as a tool that enables patient self-delivery of the AEPP. METHODS: Thirty-three community-dwelling older adults participated in interactive sessions with a bespoke 3 D-MAP application utilizing the retrospective think-aloud protocol and semistructured focus group discussions. The system usability scale (<b>SUS)</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was used to evaluate the application's usability. Thematic template analysis was carried out on the SUS item discussions, think-aloud, and semistructured focus group data. RESULTS: The quantitative SUS results revealed that the application may be described as having "marginal-high" and "good" levels of usability, along with strong agreement with items relating to the usability (P=. 004) and learnability (P<. 001) of the application. Four high-level themes emerged from think-aloud and focus groups discussions: (1) perceived usefulness (PU), (2) perceived ease of use (PEOU), (3) application use (AU) and (4) self-assessment (SA). The application was seen as a useful tool to enhance visualization of measurement guidance and also to promote independent living, ownership of care, and potentially reduce waiting times. Several design and functionality recommendations emerged from the study, such as a need to manipulate the view and position of the 3 D furniture models, and a need for clearer visual prompts and alternative keyboard interface for measurement entry. CONCLUSIONS: Participants perceived the 3 D-MAP application as a useful tool that has the potential to make significant improvements to the AEPP, not only in terms of accuracy of measurement, but also by potentially enabling older adult patients to carry out the data collection element of the AEPP themselves. Further research is needed to further adapt the 3 D-MAP application in line with the study outcomes and to establish its clinical utility with regards to effectiveness, efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of measurements that are recorded using the application and to compare it with 2 D measurement guidance leaflets...|$|E
