5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the skeletal remains revealed injuries including a broken ankle, and a double fracture to the larynx which indicated <b>strangulation</b> {{as the cause of}} death. At times, both Mme M'Barek and her brother admitted their involvement in the death of Lord Shaftesbury and the French authorities decided to charge both her and her brother with the crime of premeditated murder.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral {{dissection}} {{may occur}} after physical {{trauma to the}} neck, such as a blunt injury (e.g. traffic collision), <b>strangulation</b> or manipulation, but may also happen spontaneously. 1–4% of spontaneous cases have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the blood vessels. Treatment is usually with either antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or with anticoagulants such as heparin or warfarin.|$|E
5|$|Film noir is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch angle shots. Other devices of {{disorientation}} relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected {{in one or more}} mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the <b>strangulation</b> scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.|$|E

5000|$|The jutsukas try {{to bring}} one another down with various {{throwing}} techniques (and points are given according to how [...] "clean" [...] and effective the action was). Also - despite being uncommon - submission techniques as controlled <b>strangulations</b> and locks are allowed in part II.|$|R
5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or <b>strangulation.</b> The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Martínez Pérez {{was murdered}} {{early in the}} morning of 28 April 2012 in her home in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto {{neighborhood}} in Xalapa, the capital of Veracruz. When police went to her home to investigate in response to a neighbor's call about her door being open all day, Martínez Pérez's corpse was found on the bathroom floor. According to official reports, she had been severely beaten around her face and ribs, and then strangled to death. The cause of death was asphyxia by <b>strangulation.</b> At the time of her death, the Mexican authorities said they were investigating all the possible motives behind her assassination, including personal motives and theft, and that they would investigate whether the killing was work-related.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo's Dream Pool Essays {{argued against}} {{traditional}} Chinese beliefs in anatomy (such as his argument for two throat valves instead of three); this perhaps spurred {{the interest in}} the performance of post-mortem autopsies in China during the 12th century. The physician and judge known as Song Ci (1186–1249) wrote a pioneering work of forensic science on the examination of corpses in order to determine cause of death (<b>strangulation,</b> poisoning, drowning, blows, etc.) and to prove whether death resulted from murder, suicide, or accidental death. Song Ci stressed the importance of proper coroner's conduct during autopsies and the accurate recording of the inquest of each autopsy by official clerks.|$|E
50|$|The {{murder of}} Gertrude Albermann {{would prove to}} be Kürten's final fatal attack, {{although}} he did engage in a spate of non-fatal hammer attacks and attempted <b>strangulations</b> between February and May 1930, maiming 10 victims in these assaults. All recipients survived and many were able to describe their attacker to police.|$|R
5000|$|Conversely, Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film modest praise, saying it [...] "casts quite a spell, {{combining}} supernatural overtones with scenes of shootings, stabbings and (especially) <b>strangulations.</b> Without being crude or exploitative it tells its {{story in a}} modest, old-fashioned way with no reliance on gratuitous gore." ...|$|R

5|$|There was {{initially}} confusion as various conflicting reports of Nhung's demise surfaced, one source telling journalists that Nhung {{lived in a}} cottage within the grounds of Minh's villa and shot himself outside his house. These informants speculated that Nhung committed suicide {{to avoid having to}} live to see Minh being demoted or humiliated. The time of this incident was reported to be 21:00. Other reports at the time said that Nhung was found dead as a result of <b>strangulation</b> at the Joint General Staff headquarters. According to variations of this line, Nhung either hanged himself in custody or was murdered by an unknown hand.|$|E
5|$|Following the Rising of the Priests in 1775, {{three of}} the rebellion's leaders were {{executed}} without receiving fair trial. The death penalty was signed by the Castellano under the orders of Grand Master Francisco Ximenes de Texada. Prior to judgement, some of the priests and clerics were locked up in the secretive prisons near the courtroom of the Castallania, some at the Castellania dungeons, and in other Valletta buildings. All those arrested were recorded on the Libro del Carcerati Della Magna Curia Castellania. Among them was Gaetano Mannarino, {{the leader of the}} rebellion. Some of them were condemned to death by <b>strangulation</b> in the dungeons of the Castellania. The whole process went against the conformity of the courts in Malta as the priests were not to be subjected to the Castellania but to the court of the Bishop. Ximenes died a natural death within weeks after the sentences, with some locals believing it was a divine providence for his merciless judgement against the clergy.|$|E
5|$|The Ashley Smith inquest was an Ontario coroner's inquest {{into the}} death of Ashley Smith, a {{teenager}} who died by self-inflicted <b>strangulation</b> on 19 October 2007 while under suicide watch in custody at the Grand Valley Institution for Women. Despite guards watching her on video monitors, Smith was able to strangle herself with a strip of cloth, and it was 45 minutes before guards or supervisors entered her cell and confirmed her death. The warden and deputy warden were fired after the incident; although the four guards and supervisors in immediate contact with Smith were initially charged with negligent homicide, those charges were withdrawn a year later. Smith's family brought {{a lawsuit against the}} Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) for negligence; this lawsuit was settled out of court in May 2011.|$|E
40|$|External {{abdominal}} wall hernias {{located in the}} groin commonly affect the male population, and are the most frequent cause of mechanical small-and large-bowel obstructions seen in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. The mortality associated with gangrenous <b>strangulations</b> of these hernias is quite high (29. 4 percent), as revealed by this report. Early surgical intervention for strangulated hernias reduced this mortality to 0 percent for 34 patients who had ischemic, but viable, bowels at surgery...|$|R
50|$|The new {{voluntary}} ASTM International F2951 standard {{has been}} developed to address incidents associated with <b>strangulations</b> that can result from infant entanglement in the cords of baby monitors. This standard for baby monitors includes requirements for audio, video, and motion sensor monitors. It provides requirements for labeling, instructional material and packaging and is intended to minimize injuries to children resulting from normal use and reasonably foreseeable misuse or abuse of baby monitors.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the last}} of a trilogy of papers on culture in a future South Africa by Albie Sachs. It is crucial that we in South Africa now set about disestablishing our culture and {{breaking}} away from the conceptual and structural <b>strangulations</b> of the past. Long after our country was declared a republic, we remain mentally colonised. The scrapping of social apartheid has barely touched the apartheid in our minds. We take authoritarianism, secrecy and deceit as part of our way of life. As Robert Birley used to say, we hug our chains, feel naked without them...|$|R
5|$|The French {{would use}} the lessons learned at Muong Khoua {{and those of the}} 1952 Battle of Na San in their defence plans at Điện Biên Phủ, while the Viet Minh in turn would employ similar tactics of encirclement and <b>strangulation</b> there. The {{importance}} of an air bridge to maintain supply lines, strong artillery support to stave off human-wave Viet Minh attacks, and the need for isolated emplacements to mutually support each other, were also important tactics taken on board by the French from both conflicts. The disappearance of local civiliain populations previously friendly towards the French, which served as a precursor to Viet Minh attack, was also remembered by the Điện Biên Phủ troops. For the Viet Minh, their abilities to isolated and smother individual strongpoints while maintaining hidden artillery and support weapon emplacements {{out of the reach of}} French airstrikes and artillery were honed at both battles, as were their practicies of using human-wave attacks.|$|E
5|$|When hunting larger animals, tigers {{prefer to}} bite the throat and use their {{powerful}} forelimbs {{to hold onto the}} prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground. The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of <b>strangulation.</b> By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much. Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species. Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on their own. Whilst hunting sambars, which comprise up to 60% of their prey in India, tigers have reportedly made a passable impersonation of the male sambar's rutting call to attract them.|$|E
5|$|The German {{offensive}} {{caught the}} Red Army by surprise and made large gains {{on the first}} day. The spearhead forces enjoyed air support {{and were able to}} defeat counterattacks by Soviet troops. By 13 December, Soviet resistance slowed the German advance considerably. Although German forces took the area surrounding Verkhne-Kumskiy, the Red Army launched Operation Little Saturn on 16 December. Operation Little Saturn crushed the Italian 8th Army on Army Group Don's left flank, threatening the survival of Manstein's entire group of forces. As resistance and casualties increased, Manstein appealed to Hitler and to the commander of the German 6th Army, General Friedrich Paulus, to allow the 6th Army to break out of Stalingrad; both refused. The 4th Panzer Army continued its attempt to open a corridor to the 6th Army on 18–19 December, but was unable to do so without the aid of forces inside the Stalingrad pocket. Manstein was forced to call off the assault on 23 December and by Christmas Eve the 4th Panzer Army began to withdraw to its starting position. Due to the failure of the 6th Army to breakout and the attempt to break the Soviet encirclement, the Red Army was able to continue the <b>strangulation</b> of German forces in Stalingrad.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1951, L. Ron Hubbard kidnapped {{his wife}} Sara. After her release, she filed for divorce, {{charging}} Hubbard with causing her [...] "extreme cruelty, great mental anguish and physical suffering".

All is well in the land except that the Sultan {{seemingly}} can't have children. An evil devil-worshipping Vazir (Amrish Puri) seeks to usurp the throne, revive his [...] "fauladi shaitan" [...] (a huge demon-like figure made of stone), and take over the world. The Vazir instructs his maids to strangle every child born to the Sultan. Finally, however, a spark of divine intervention (presented literally as a spark which descends from the heavens and enters the womb) renders the next newborn son immune to the poisons and <b>strangulations</b> administered by the maids. This Shehezada (prince) eventually becomes Ajooba (miracle).|$|R
25|$|In recent years, <b>strangulation</b> in {{the context}} of DV has {{received}} significant attention. It is now {{recognized as one of the}} most lethal forms of DV; yet, because of the lack of external injuries, and the lack of social awareness and medical training in regard to it, <b>strangulation</b> has often been a rather hidden problem. As a result, in recent years, many US states have enacted specific laws against <b>strangulation.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Displacements, torsions, <b>strangulations,</b> and impactions may be {{identified}} on rectal examination. Other non-specific findings, such as [...] small intestinal loops, {{may also be}} detected, and can play a major part in determining if surgery is necessary. Thickness of the intestinal walls may indicate infiltrative disease or abnormal muscular enlargement. Roughening of the serosal surface of the intestine can occur secondary to peritonitis. Horses that have had gastrointestinal rupture may have gritty feeling and free gas in the abdominal cavity. Surgery is usually suggested if rectal examination finds severe distention of {{any part of the}} GI tract, a tight cecum or multiple tight loops of small intestine, or inguinal hernia. However, even if the exact cause can not be determined on rectal, significant abnormal findings without specific diagnosis can indicate the need for surgery.

30|$|In {{asphyxia}} related deaths, drowning and aspiration of gastric content {{accounted for}} most of the asphyxial deaths. Amdabe et al. in their study on autopsy on decomposed bodies in India found out that drowning (35.6 %) was the commonest cause of death in decomposed bodies (Ambade et al. 2011). The death from asphyxia were however seen more in the younger age group and this is consistent with other studies worldwide which showed asphyxia related BID occurred in the younger age group age range 0 – 78  years (mean age of 37 [*]±[*] 10  years). Bronchial asthma as well as aspiration of gastric contents, a purely medical emergency, are equally major causes of asphyxia deaths and if presented early can be managed properly and effectively. This brings to fore the need to improve the general awareness and proper knowledge of first aid management to the public. These major causes of asphyxia deaths, aspiration of gastric contents, drowning and <b>strangulations</b> are highly avoidable if proper precautionary measures are taken at home and at our recreational arenas.|$|R
