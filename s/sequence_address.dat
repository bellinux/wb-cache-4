40|$|We have {{developed}} a flexible, accurate and highly multiplexed SNP genotyping assay for high-throughput genetic analysis of large populations on a bead array platform. The novel genotyping system combines high assay conversion rate and data quality with> 1500 multiplexing, and Array of Arrays TM formats. Genotyping assay oligos corresponding to specific SNP sequences are each linked to a unique <b>sequence</b> (<b>address)</b> that can hybridize to its complementary strand on universal arrays. The arrays are made of beads located in microwells of optical fiber bundles (Sentrix ® Array Matrix) or silicon slides (Sentrix BeadChip). The optical fiber bundles are further organized into a matrix that matches a 96 -well microtiter plate. The arrays on the silicon slides are multi-channel pipette compatible for loading multiple samples onto a single silicon slide. These formats allow many samples to be processed in parallel. This genotyping system enables investigators to generate approximately 300, 000 genotypes per day with minimal equipment requirements and greater than 1. 6 million genotypes per day in a robotics-assisted process. With a streamlined and comprehensive assay, this system brings {{a new level of}} flexibility, throughput, and affordability to genetic research. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Recent {{extensions}} of learning vector quantization (LVQ) to general (dis-) similarity data have {{paved the way}} towards LVQ classifiers for possibly discrete, structured objects such as <b>sequences</b> <b>addressed</b> by classical alignment. In this contribution, we propose a metric learning scheme based on this framework which allows for autonomous learning of the underlying scoring matrix according to a given discriminative task.

40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{evaluation}} of the applicability of the classical and well-established linear polarimeter to the measurement of linear retardance in the presence of phase flicker. This analysis shows that there are large errors in the results provided by the linear polarimeter when measuring the linear retardance of a device. These errors depend on the specific retardance value under measurement. We show that there are some points where this limitation can be used to measure the fluctuation amplitude consistently. An elegant method is further proposed, enabling the measurement of the average retardance value, thus extending the applicability of the classical linear polarimeter. Experimental characterization results are provided for various electrical <b>sequences</b> <b>addressed</b> onto a parallel aligned liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) display. Good agreement is obtained with experiment, thus validating the linear polarimeter methodology proposed. Furthermore, results are provided for the LCoS in two reflection geometries, perpendicular incidence with and without nonpolarizing beam splitter, demonstrating robustness of the method. As a result, the evaluation of both phase modulation range and flicker magnitude for any electrical <b>sequence</b> <b>addressed</b> can be easily obtained, which is very important for optimal use of LCoS displays in applications.
