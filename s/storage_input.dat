40|$|Current {{concentrated}} {{solar power}} plants (CSP) use molten salt at 565 °C as a heat transfer and energy storage fluid. Due to thermal energy storage (TES), these solar plants can deliver dispatachable electricity to the grid; however, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for these plants is 12 - 15 c/kWh, about 2. 5 times as high as fossil fuel electricity generation. Molten salt technology limits peak operating temperatures to 565 °C and a heat engine efficiency of 40 %. Liquid metal (LM), however, can reach > 1350 °C, and potentially utilize a more efficient (60 %) heat engine and realize cost reductions. A 1350 °C LM-CSP plant would require ceramic containment, inert atmosphere containment, additional solar flux concentration, and redesigned internal receiver. It was initially unclear if these changes and additions for LM-CSP were technically feasible and could lower the LCOE compared to LS-CSP. To answer this question, a LM-CSP plant was designed with the same thermal input as a published LS-CSP plant. A graphite internal cavity receiver with secondary concentration heated liquid Sn to 1400 °C and transferred heat to a 2 -phase Al-Si fluid for 9 hours of thermal energy <b>storage.</b> <b>Input</b> heat to the combined power cycle was 1350 °C and had 60 % thermal efficiency for a gross output of 168 MW. The cost of this LM-CSP was estimated by applying material cost factors to the designed geometry and scaling construction costs from published LS-CSP estimates. Furthermore, graphite was experimentally tested for reactivity with liquid Sn, successful reaction bonds, and successful mechanical seals. The result is switching to molten metal can reduce CSP costs by 30 % and graphite pipes, valves, and seals are possible at least at 400 °C. M. S...|$|E
40|$|Assessment and {{prediction}} {{of the effects}} of Arctic river flows on ocean circulation and climate are hindered by lack of knowledge about the terrestrial water balance. This study quantifies the components of the annual water budget (precipitation, streamflow, and evapotranspiration) and their uncertainty for a large Russian river basin. Over long periods, assuming negligible change in <b>storage,</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs should balance. However, measurement limitations and errors lead to nonzero water balance closure (WBC). The variance of WBC, computed by summing the component variances, quantifies uncertainty in the water budget. The component terms and their uncertainty are calculated from independent observations and physically-based modeling. For the analysis period, the WBC is negative. The computed uncertainty is large, but not sufficient to conclude that WBC could be zero.

40|$|Power {{dissipation}} in {{switching devices}} {{is believed to}} be the single most important roadblock to the continued downscaling of charge based electronic circuits. At this time there is a lot of interest in analyzing alternative technologies which could enable further downscaling of electronic circuits. It has also been suggested that magnets as collective entities could require significantly low switching energies. In this thesis we analyze the intrinsic switching energy that is dissipated in the switching process of single-domain magnets. One central result is that the intrinsic switching energy of a magnet (which could be composed of millions of spins) is on the order of its energy barrier height Eb. This is different from conventional transistors in that the switching energy is on the order of NE b, N being the number of electronic charges participating in a switching process (usually on the order of thousands). Furthermore a spintronic device is proposed that uses spin at every stage of its operation: information manipulation, transport, <b>storage,</b> <b>input</b> and output are all accomplished with magnets and spin-coherent channels. Contrary to the typical spin/magnet based logic schemes, the all-spin scheme neither relies on ordinary magnetic fields (generated by current carrying wires) nor does it rely on electrical read-out of magnetic states. Binary data are represented by the bi-stable states of nanomagnets (i. e. magnetic polarization) which can be non-volatile. Application of a voltage signal to a magnetic contact (input data bit) creates a spin-current in a channel which can be conveniently guided and routed to another magnetic contact (output data bit) where it determines its final state based on spin-torque phenomenon. The all-spin device could potentially find use for low-power digital logic since it should satisfy the five essential characteristics for logic applications namely nonlinearity, gain, concatenability, feedback prevention and a complete set of Boolean operations. Moreover it could provide a basis for unconventional approaches. For example the spin accumulation in a channel underneath a magnetic contact could provide a weighted average of different inputs that makes it switch (2 ̆ 7 fire 2 ̆ 7) when it exceeds a threshold like neural networks. Alternatively the magnetic contacts on top of the channel could possibly serve as input-output interface for spin-based quantum computing. ...|$|E
