Indeed, it is widely recognized that diagrams are a valuable aid to intuition and help to convey ideas and information in a clear way. Traditionally, however, logicians have viewed diagrams as informal tools and, thus, {{could not be a}} part of any formal argument; only <b>symbolic</b> <b>logics</b> were seen to fulfil this role. Recently, this perception was overturned in seminal work by Shin. This paper explores the evolution of diagrammatic logics, focusing mainly on those based on the popular and intuitive Euler diagrams.

A between-groups study compared six frequently-used axiom types using the (textual) Manchester OWL Syntax (MOS), (<b>symbolic)</b> description <b>logic</b> (DL) and concept diagrams.

40|$|<b>Symbolic</b> {{temporal}} <b>logic</b> model checking is {{an automatic}} verification method. One {{of its main}} features is that a counterexample can be constructed when a temporal formula does not hold for the model. Most model checkers so far have restricted the type of formulae that can be checked and for which counterexamples can be constructed to fair CTL formulae. In a previous paper, we have presented an algorithm which constructs counterexamples and witnesses for the whole ¯-calculus. The witnesses constructed by this algorithm can be huge, however. In this paper, we show how to construct reduced witnesses. 1 Introduction Complex state-transition systems occur frequently {{in the design of}} sequential circuits and protocols. <b>Symbolic</b> temporal <b>logic</b> model checking [CGL 93] has shown in practice to be an extremely useful automatic verification method.

In a certain sense Brandi had an easy task introducing it into a situation like the Italian one, dominated – despite the pre-unification fragments – by almost uninterrupted lines of continuity. The continuity assured by the Church had always reabsorbed the political discontinuity suffered by mainland Italy, and in spite of the inequality between north and south it was simple to induce people to speak of the Italian world as one of organic societies.

40|$|In-depth {{interviews}} were combined with {{analysis of a}} wide range of secondary data to assess the formation of opposition and support in the case of the Wave Hub in Cornwall, UK. It is argued that stakeholder responses to renewable energy developments are, in part, related to interpretations of what both the technology and the location or 'place' are seen to represent or symbolise. There is a need to move beyond knowledge deficit and NIMBY models if these issues are to be explored. Place was interpreted at different scales and was seen as: economically vulnerable, as having a sense of local ownership, as a resource and as nature. Symbolic interpretations of the technology related to the contested environmental status and significance of electricity produced, as well as it being seen as a project for local people, commercial, experimental, pioneering, industrial and at one with Mother Nature. These interpretations gave rise to various <b>symbolic</b> <b>logics</b> of opposition and support, some of which are outlined. Although a case study of a wave energy development, many of the issues discussed relate to renewable energy developments more widely. Therefore the findings are discussed in relation to their implications for renewable energy developers and UK energy strategy. Wave energy Siting controversy Symbolism...|$|R
25|$|The syllogistic logic {{developed}} by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19thcentury, when {{interest in the}} foundations of mathematics stimulated the development of <b>symbolic</b> <b>logic</b> (now called mathematical logic).

In 1879, Gottlob Frege published Begriffsschrift, which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of quantifier notation.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with algorithms for the logical generalisation of probabilistic temporal models from examples. The algorithms combine logic and probabilistic models through inductive generalisation. The inductive generalisation algorithms consist of three parts. The first part describes the graphical generalisation of state transition models. State transition models are generalised by applying state mergers. The second part involves <b>symbolic</b> generalisation of <b>logic</b> programs which are embedded in each states. Plotkin’s LGG is used for <b>symbolic</b> generalisation of <b>logic</b> programs. The third part covers learning of parameters using statistics derived from the input sequences. The state transitions are unobservable in our settings. The probability distributions over the state transitions and actions are estimated using the EM algorithm. As an application of these algorithms, we learn chemical reaction rules from StochSim, the stochastic software simulator of biochemical reactions. ...|$|R
40|$|The present paper compares {{stochastic}} learning (Hidden Markov Models), <b>symbolic</b> learning (Inductive <b>Logic</b> Programming), and {{connectionist learning}} (Simple Recurrent Networks using backpropagation) on a single, linguistically fairly simple task, that of learning enough phonotactics to distinguish words from non-words for a simplified set of Dutch, the monosyllables.

40|$|SummaryAim: Uncontrolled hight blood {{pressure}} leads clinicians {{to wonder about}} adherence degree amongst hypertensive patients. In this context, our study aims to describe and analyse patients experience of antihypertensive drugs, in order {{to shed light on}} the multiple social and <b>symbolic</b> <b>logics,</b> forming part of the cultural factors shaping personal medication practices. Methods: The inductive and comprehensive anthropological approach implemented is based on an ethnographical survey (observations of medical consultations and interviews). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 68 hypertensive patients (39 women and 29 men,between the ages of 40 and 95, of whom 52 were over 60) who had been receiving treatment for over a year. Results: Antihypertensive drug is reinterpreted using popular representations of pathophysiology (the body as a machine). This symbolic dimension eases acceptance of therapy, but leads to a hierarchy forming of other prescribed medicines and of certain therapeutic classes(such as diuretics). Prescription compliance does not solely depend on the patient’s perception of cardiovascular risk, but also on how the patient appropriates the treatment and integrates it into his/her daily life, requiring identification with the product,building commitment and self-control of the treatment(experimentation; command of treatment; control of side effects, of intake, continuity of treatment). A relationship based on trust between the physician and patient is necessary for a prescription to be followed. We have identified three types of relationship: reasoned trust, emotional trust, conceded trust. Conclusion: Consideration and understanding of these pragmatic, symbolic issues by physicians should help practitioners support and advise patients with high {{blood pressure}}.

40|$|Euler {{diagrams}} are {{a visual}} language {{which are used}} for purposes such as the presentation of set-based data or {{as the basis of}} visual logical languages which can be utilised for software specification and reasoning. Such Euler diagram reasoning systems tend to be defined at an abstract level, and the concrete level is simply a visualisation of an abstract model, thereby capturing some subset of the usual boolean logic. The visualisation process tends to be divorced from the data transformation process thereby affecting the user's mental map and reducing the effectiveness of the diagrammatic notation. Furthermore, geometric and topological constraints, called wellformedness conditions, are often placed on the concrete diagrams to try to reduce human comprehension errors, and the effects of these conditions are not modelled in these systems. We view Euler diagrams as a type of graph, where the faces that are present are the key features that convey information and we provide transformations at the dual graph level that correspond to transformations of Euler diagrams, both in terms of editing moves and logical reasoning moves. This original approach gives a correspondence between manipulations of diagrams at an abstract level (such as logical reasoning steps, or simply an update of information) and the manipulation at a concrete level. Thus we facilitate the presentation of diagram changes in a manner that preserves the mental map. The approach will facilitate the realisation of reasoning systems at the concrete level; this has the potential to provide diagrammatic reasoning systems that are inherently different from <b>symbolic</b> <b>logics</b> due to natural geometric constraints. We provide a particular concrete transformation system which preserves the important criteria of planarity and connectivity, which may form part of a framework encompassing multiple concrete systems each adhering to different sets of wellformedness conditions...|$|R
