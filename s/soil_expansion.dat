40|$|Expansive clayey soils produce heaving and {{cracking}} of floor slabs and walls. Expansive soils owe their characteristics {{to the presence}} of swelling clay minerals. This soil expands and contracts due to changes in the moisture content of the soil. In this study the surcharge required to counteract <b>soil</b> <b>expansion</b> was measured in natural expansive soils (untreated soils) and lime treated soils starting at 19. 61  kPa (2  Ton/m 2) and continuing with increments of 19. 61  kPa. Additionaly in lime treated soils the amount of lime was determined under different surcharges {{in order to reduce the}} expansion. The test results indicated that the surcharges applied to untreated soils were not proportional to the decrease of expansion which is probably due to the increase of soil density. In fact, only the initial surcharge of 19. 61  kPa significantly decreased the expansion. According to the results, the <b>soil</b> <b>expansion</b> was considerably reduced (1. 54 %) with the surcharge of 78. 45  kPa, therefore this surcharge can be considered as the Swelling pressure. On the other hand the soil tested (high compressibility clay) was stabilized with 6 % of lime (without surcharges) which was determined with the lowest value of liquid limit and plastic index as well as expansion test. After the application of surcharges and lime treatment to expansive soil, the surcharges of 39. 22  kPa and 58. 84  kPa decreased expansion and increased their resistance. This was concluded by similar low values of expansion (without settlements) under both surcharges of each treated soil tested (2, 4 and 6 % of lime). It can be concluded that the surcharge contributed to the decrease of <b>soil</b> <b>expansion</b> due to the decrease of the amount of lime required (6 %) without surcharge. So, 4 % of lime was enough for the surcharge of 19. 61  kPa and 2 % of lime required the surcharge minimum of 39. 22  kPa. This shows that the surcharge of a house on expansive soil reduces <b>soil</b> <b>expansion</b> and therefore reduces costs of any method of soil improvement and special foundation...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The addition of hydrated lime to clay soils {{is one of the most}} common methods of soil stabilization. However, when sulfates are present in the soil, the calcium in the lime reacts with the sulfates to form ettringite, an expandable mineral.

The geometry {{of the problem is}} simplified to axial symmetry, considering the installation of one column only. Stone column installation is modelled as an undrained expansion of a cylindrical cavity. The excess pore pressures generated in this process are subsequently assumed to dissipate towards the permeable column. The process is simulated using a finite element code that allows for large displacements.

40|$|An ecomorphodynamic {{model was}} {{developed}} to study how Avicennia marina mangroves influence channel network evolution in sandy tidal embayments. The model accounts {{for the effects of}} mangrove trees on tidal flow patterns and sediment dynamics. Mangrove growth is in turn controlled by hydrodynamic conditions. The presence of mangroves was found to enhance the initiation and branching of tidal channels, partly because the extra flow resistance in mangrove forests favours flow concentration, and thus sediment erosion in between vegetated areas. The enhanced branching of channels is also the result of a vegetation-induced increase in erosion threshold. On the other hand, this reduction in bed erodibility, together with the <b>soil</b> <b>expansion</b> driven by organic matter production, reduces the landward expansion of channels. The ongoing accretion in mangrove forests ultimately drives a reduction in tidal prism and an overall retreat of the channel network. During sea-level rise, mangroves can potentially enhance the ability of the soil surface to maintain an elevation within the upper portion of the intertidal zone, while hindering both the branching and headward erosion of the landward expanding channels.

Numerous cracks, serious and regular alike, {{can be found in the}} underground garage of the Hefei Government Affairs Center. These cracks are mainly located around the central part of the bottom floor within a 44. 6 – 57. 8 m radius. To explore the causes of the cracks, two attempts are made.

On the basis of the calculation and monitoring results, the following conclusion can be made: underground water is the main cause of the bottom floor cracks because underground water exerts a pushing force from the bottom and causes the expansibility of expansive soil.
