25|$|Also {{referred}} to as Natasha. Natasha is a seventeen-year-old daughter of Dar’ya Mikhailovna. She is observant, well-read and intelligent, but also quite secretive. While her mother thinks {{of her as a}} good-natured and well-mannered girl, she is not of a high opinion about her intelligence, and quite wrongly. She also thinks Natasha is ‘cold’, emotionless, but in the beginning of Chapter Five we are told by the narrator that “Her feelings were strong and deep, but reserved; even as a child she seldom cried, and now she seldom even <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> only grew slightly pale when anything distressed her.” She engages in intellectual conversations with Rudin (which are not discouraged by her mother because she thinks that these conversations “improve her mind”); Natasha thinks highly of Rudin, who confides to her his ideas and “privately gives her books”, and soon falls in love with him. She also often compels him to apply his talents and act. Natasha is often thought of as the first of 'Turgenev maids' to feature in Turgenev's fiction.|$|E

[...] Emperor Jingzong, hearing reports of the Niu household being slaughtered, <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> blamed the incident on the chancellors' lack of ability. [...] The imperial scholar Wei Chuhou pointed out that Pei Du had great accomplishments but had been squeezed out of the chancellorship. [...] Further, Emperor Jingzong saw that whenever Pei submitted reports, he did not list an honorary chancellor title among his titles. [...] Wei blamed Li Fengji's machinations for this, and the chancellor Li Cheng also advised that Pei should be shown more respect. [...] Emperor Jingzong thus conferred the honorary chancellor title on Pei, {{although he did not}} recall Pei at that time.|$|E

Deng Dang was shocked to see his teenage brother-in-law in battle, so he scolded Lü Meng and warned him to stop. Lü Meng refused to listen so Deng Dang told Lü Meng's mother about this. When she wanted to punish him, Lü Meng said, [...] "It is difficult to survive in poverty. If we can prove ourselves through hard work, then wealth will come eventually.

2500|$|By summer 572, both Zu and Mu Tipo were in {{conflict}} with Hulü Guang. [...] Hulü disliked Zu, and he often complained to his generals that Zu rarely consulted military generals. [...] Once, when he was resting at a governmental building, Zu, who was blind, rode past him without realizing that Hulü was there, and never got off the horse as demanded by customs of the time. [...] Hulü angrily stated, [...] "Who {{does he think he}} is?" [...] Zu, realizing that Hulü disliked him, bribed Hulü's servant and asked the servant about Hulü's opinion of him. [...] The servant stated, [...] "Ever since you came into power, the Minister Prince each night <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> stated, [...] "With a blind man in power, the empire will surely be destroyed." [...] Meanwhile, Mu had once requested to marry Hulü's daughter by a concubine, but Hulü refused. [...] Further, when Mu requested that Gao Wei grant him the public fields at Jinyang, Hulü publicly opposed the action as being detrimental to the grazing of the army's horses. [...] Zu and Mu therefore both despited Hulü. [...] They therefore fostered suspicion of Hulü in the emperor's mind, and that suspicion was exacerbated by the fact that Hulü's daughter and Gao Wei's wife Empress Hulü was not favored by Gao Wei.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the film's controversy, The Birth of a Nation {{was very}} popular. At over three hours in length (including intermissions), {{the film was}} {{ground-breaking}} in its production value, budget and ambition. At the time, the film was unlike anything the American audiences had ever seen before. The Los Angeles Times in a review called The Birth of a Nation [...] "the greatest picture ever made and the greatest drama ever filmed", going on to say [...] "it was beyond doubt the most extraordinary picture that has ever been seen". The Reverend Charles Henry Parkhurst defended the film against the charge of racism by saying the film [...] "was exactly true to history" [...] by depicting freedmen as they were, and therefore the film was a [...] "compliment to the black man" [...] by showing how far black people had [...] "advanced" [...] since Reconstruction. The critic Dolly Dalrymple reported about an audience in Alabama [...] "when I saw it, {{it was far from}} silent...incessant murmurs of approval, roars of laughter, grasps of anxiety, and outbursts of applause greeted every new picture on the screen".. One man viewing the film was so moved by the scene where Flora Cameron flees Gus to avoid to being raped that he took out his handgun and began firing at the screen in an effort to help her. The American author Katherine DuPre Lumpkin in her 1947 autobiography The Making of a Southerner recalled watching the film as a 18-year old in 1915: [...] "Here was the black figure—and the fear of the white girl—though the scene blanked out just in time. Here were the sinister men the South scorned and the noble men the South revered. And through it all the Klan rode. All around me people <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> shivered, and now and then shouted or wept, in their intensity." [...] Dixon himself was well pleased with the reaction of white audiences to the film. In a letter sent on May 1, 1915, to Joseph P. Tumulty, the press secretary to President Wilson, Dixon wrote: [...] "The real purpose of my film was to revolutionize Northern sentiments by a presentation of history that would transform every man in the audience into a good Democrat...Every man who comes out of the theater is a Southern partisan for life!". In letter to President Wilson sent on September 5, 1915, Dixon boasted: [...] "This play is transforming the entire population of the North and the West into sympathetic Southern voters. There will never be an issue of your segregation policy". Dixon was alluding to the fact that Wilson upon becoming president in 1913 had imposed segregation on federal workplaces in Washington D.C. while reducing the number of black employees through demotion or dismissal.|$|E
