40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{elements}} of a vehicle traffic flow simulator are presented as a basis to model and improve traffic light control strategies. Traffic control simulators have been described (Haight 1963, Paal 1975, and Reitman 1971) for hardware using assembler and FORTRAN. This simulator is written in C, uses onesecond, discrete time steps for the traffic light controller agent and the simulation of vehicle movement. Vehicle movement is simulated with realistic velocity and acceleration limits and is constrained by minimum <b>following</b> <b>distances.</b> The speed limits on each lane are user specified and vehicles do not exceed these limits. The traffic environment occurs in a user defined grid of east-west and north-south streets. The simulator is fairly realistic: vehicles are stopped at red lights, vehicles maintain <b>safe</b> <b>following</b> <b>distances,</b> and the physics of motion of the traveling vehicles are closely approximated. Cars are inserted in the network with their starting and destinat...|$|R

In order for these (and many other) systems to be successfully used around the globe however, some appreciation will be necessary of how behaviours, and hence uses and impacts, may change between different sites and between different countries. This article reports on an instrumented vehicle study designed to assess differences in Motorway driving behaviour between three sites, one in the U. K., one in France and one in Germany.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to assess the effectiveness of the Graded Deceleration Display (GDD) that is designed to replace the rear center high mounted stop lamp on automobiles. Licensed drivers were treated in simulation to both a standard brake light displays (binary) and the GDD display while the lead vehicle (LV) varied its deceleration magnitude and ramping behavior. Results entailed that the graded system produced more accurate behavioral responses during deceleration, fewer collisions, and a <b>safer</b> <b>following</b> <b>distance</b> than the binary system. Future research should be concerned with solidifying this framework {{so that it can be}} used to improve safety, effectiveness, and efficiency for vehicle transportation.

40|$|At a {{priority}} intersection, critical gap is the threshold by which drivers judge whether {{to accept a}} gap or retain holding position. It is usually taken as a fixed value or considered to follow a certain distribution. Critical gap is needed at roadway segment to allow road user to make decisions relative to the lead vehicle. If the critical gap is larger than reaction time, drivers maintain <b>safe</b> <b>following</b> <b>distance</b> from the vehicle in front; otherwise the probability of vehicle collusion is heightened. The paper is aimed at determining critical gap acceptance at roadway segment under rainfall condition. Differential gap is expected under dry and rainfall conditions irrespective of rainfall intensity due to reduced visibility. Based on the hypothesis that rainy conditions have effect on critical gap acceptance, impact {{studies were carried out}} at Pontian-Skudai Route 5, Malaysia. The objectives are to estimate average gap and determine critical gap acceptance under prevailing conditions. In a 'dry and rainfall impact study', traffic stream gap was calculated from the headway, flow, length of vehicle and speed relationship. Headway was mainly derived from maximum flow rate. Results show that average traffic stream gap for dry weather is higher than that of rainfall conditions. However, motorists maintain a <b>safe</b> <b>following</b> <b>distance</b> under both circumstances. The paper concluded that rainfalls irrespective of their intensities have no significant impact on critical gap acceptance. These so because all observed vehicles on the roadway under rainy conditions are affected and there is no undue advantage enjoyed by any particular type of vehicle.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown {{adaptive}} cruise control (ACC) can compromise driving safety when drivers do not understand how the ACC functions, suggesting that drivers need to be informed about the capabilities of this technology. This study applies ecological interface design (EID) to create a visual representation of ACC behavior, which is intended to promote appropriate reliance and support effective transitions between manual and ACC control. The EID display reveals the behavior of ACC {{in terms of time}} headway (THW), time to collision (TTC), and range rate. This graphical representation uses emergent features that signal the state of the ACC. Two failure modes—exceedance of braking algorithm limits and sensor failures—were introduced in the driving contexts of traffic and rain, respectively. A medium-fidelity driving simulator was used to evaluate the effect of automation (manual, ACC control), and display (EID, no display) on ACC reliance, brake response, and driver intervention strategies. Drivers in traffic conditions relied more appropriately on ACC when the EID display was present than when it was not, proactively disengaging the ACC. The EID display promoted faster and more consistent braking responses when braking algorithm limits were exceeded, resulting in <b>safe</b> <b>following</b> <b>distances</b> and no collisions. In manual control, the EID display aided THW maintenance in both rain and traffic conditions, reducing the demands of driving and promoting more consistent and less variable car-following performance. These results suggest that providing drivers with continuous information {{about the state of the}} automation is a promising alternative to the more common approach of providing imminent crash warnings when it fails.

40|$|A 35 GHz, pulsed-Doppler {{radar system}} has been {{designed}} and assembled for wake vortex detection and tracking in low visibility conditions. Aircraft wake vortices continue {{to be an important}} factor in determining <b>safe</b> <b>following</b> <b>distances</b> or spacings for aircraft in the terminal area. Currently, under instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), aircraft adhere to conservative, fixed following-distance guidelines based primarily on aircraft weight classifications. When ambient conditions are such that vortices will either drift or dissipate, leaving the flight corridor clear, the prescribed spacings are unnecessarily long and result in decreased airport throughput. There is a potential for significant airport efficiency improvement, if a system can be employed to aid regulators and pilots in setting <b>safe</b> and efficient <b>following</b> <b>distances</b> based on airport conditions. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Federal Aviation Agency, and Volpe National Transportation Systems Center have promoted and worked to develop systems that would increase airport capacity and provide for safe reductions in aircraft separation. The NASA Aircraft Vortex Spacing System (AVOSS), a wake vortex spacing system that can provide dynamic adjustment of spacings based on real-time airport weather conditions, has demonstrated that Lidar systems can be successfully used to detect and track vortices in clear air conditions. To fill the need for detection capability in low-visibility conditions, a 35 GHz, pulsed-Doppler radar system is being investigated for use as a complimentary, low-visibility sensor for wake vortices. The radar sensor provides spatial and temporal information similar to that provided by Lidar, but under weather conditions that a Lidar cannot penetrate. Currently, we are analyzing the radar design based upon the data and experience gained during the wake vortex Lidar deployment with AVOSS at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. As part of this study, two numerical models were utilized in system simulations. The results of this study improve our understanding of the method of detection, resolution requirements for range and azimuth, pulse compression, and performance prediction. Simulations applying pulse compression techniques show that detection is good in heavy fog to greater than 2000 m. Both compressed and uncompressed short pulses show the vortex structure. To explore operational challenges, siting and scanning strategies were also analyzed. Simulation results indicate that excellent wake vortex detection, tracking and classification is possible in drizzle (+ 15 dBZ) and heavy fog (- 13 dBZ) using short pulse techniques (< 99 ns) at ranges on the order of 900 m, with a modest power of 500 W output. At 1600 m, detection can be expected at reflectivities as low as - 13 dBZ (heavy fog). The radar system, as designed and built, has the potential to support field studies of a wake vortex spacing system in low-visibility conditions ranging from heavy fog to rain, when sited within 2000 m of the flight path...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated a critical role of task demand in determining driving outcomes amongst individuals with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings are derived predominantly from laboratory simulations. The objective {{of the present study}} therefore was to investigate the relationship between factors influencing demand and arousal in real traffic, and the performance of drivers medicated (n = 15) and unmedicated for ADHD (n = 12), compared to a control group (n = 17). Self-reported data relating to risky driving behaviours and driving history, and symptoms of ADHD in adulthood were collected. To determine the influence of demand on driving performance and errors, participants navigated a route incorporating rural, urban, residential, and highway environments. Relative to controls, unmedicated ADHD drivers employed fewer safe driving skills (p <. 05), committed more inattentive (p <. 05), and impatient driving errors (p <. 01), and reported engaging in more frequent aggressive violations (p <. 05). ADHD was associated with higher rates of crashes (p <. 01) and multiple crashes (p =. 05). Attesting to the efficacy of stimulant treatment, medicated ADHD driver performance {{in the present study was}} comparable to, if not better than controls. While unmedicated drivers undervalued the risk related to driving behaviours predictive of poor outcomes, medicated ADHD drivers largely overestimated the severity of their risky driving (p <. 01). Demand was found to significantly impact the performance of unmedicated ADHD drivers particularly. Attention was best during high demand, urban driving. As environmental demand declined, more frequent attentional lapses occasioned increased impairment to performance (p <. 01). Relative to drivers of automatic vehicles, high demand manual driving was linked with better hazard detection (p <. 05) and overall performance (p <. 05) amongst medicated drivers, and <b>safer</b> <b>following</b> <b>distances</b> amongst unmedicated ADHD drivers (p <. 05). Apparently distinct driving styles were also revealed between ADHD subtypes. This is the first study to document the impact of factors influencing task demand on ADHD driver performance in real traffic.

One of the main features of ADASs is cruise control system that maintains the driver's desired speed without intervention from the driver. Adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems adjust the vehicle's speed to maintain a <b>safe</b> <b>following</b> <b>distance</b> to the vehicle in front. Adding vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications (V 2 X) to ACC systems, result in cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems, where each vehicle has trajectory data of all other vehicles in the same lane. Although CACC systems offer advantages over ACC systems in increasing throughput and average speed, they are more vulnerable to cyber-security attacks. This is due to V 2 X communications that increase the attack surface from one vehicle to multiple vehicles. In this paper, we inject common types of attack on the application layer of connected vehicles to show their vulnerability in comparison to autonomous vehicles.

Tailgating is a dangerous driving behavior and a leading cause of most rear-end crashes. Through a prior study, serious tailgating was identified on urban Rhode Island highways. It is critical to many urban traffic management authorities to understand tailgating and to explore means to mitigate drivers’ tailgating behavior, especially on urban highways with high-speed and high-volume traffic. Properly designed advisory signs could reduce tailgating and related motor crashes.

Understanding tailgating and finding means to mitigate tailgating behavior on highways has become a priority to many urban traffic management authorities. A human factors study was conducted to investigate the tailgating issue and possible counter-tailgating measures. The study started with a questionnaire survey and a traffic analysis to assess the causes and effects of tailgating and its impact on urban RI highway traffic. To identify drivers’ perceptions on tailgating behavior, 210 subjects were recruited in the survey. It found that 95 % of participants are potential tailgators and heavy traffic was identified as the top tailgating cause. Vehicle headways on specific urban segments of three major RI highways were next examined in the traffic analysis. It found that over 60 % of vehicles were tailgating during rush hours and about 40 % during non-rush hours. The findings confirmed that serious tailgating exists on urban RI highways. To advise drivers and mitigate their tailgating behaviors, counter-tailgating measures such as advisory signs and an educational video were designed and assessed through a driving simulation experiment.
