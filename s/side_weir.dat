At present, knowledge ot the outflow process when the flow along the weir is subcritical {{can be considered}} satisfactory. The same cannot be said when, as often happens in practice, the upstream flow is subcritical while the flow along the weir is supercritical. In this paper the local flow features along prismatic <b>side</b> <b>weirs</b> in a circular channel were investigated. In particular, the condition of supercritical flow along the weir was analysed. Based on experimental work and on data available in the literature, some characteristics of both the flow that remains in the main channel and the flow that leaves it were investigated. These include: {{the distribution of the}} discharge in the main channel, the lateral outflow angle and the lateral outflow velocity. The results combine to provide {{a better understanding of the}} outflow process and are also readily applicable for design.

In practice, circular channels used in sewage disposal networks are steep. Therefore, in this numerical study, the effects of increasing the main channel bed slope on the hydraulic behavior of supercritical flows along the <b>side</b> <b>weirs</b> are investigated.|$|R
30|$|The {{simplest}} side weirs have {{a rectangular}} shape. Many {{studies have been}} conducted to specify the characteristics of rectangular side weirs. However, besides the advantages of rectangular side weirs like easy construction, such side weirs have low efficiency (Bilhan et al. 2011). In case of overflow, there are two choices: first, the length of the rectangular <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> can be increased, and second, side wire efficiency can be increased. Increasing the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> length leads to increasing the tributary channel—a choice that seems costly. The economical alternative is to increase the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> efficiency. Modifying <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> shape could increase <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> efficiency between 1.5 and 4.5 times (Kumar and Pathak 1987; Cosar and Agaccioglu 2004; Ghodsian 2004; Emiroglu et al. 2010 b; Aydin and Emiroglu 2013; Mirnaseri and Emadi 2013).|$|E

30|$|A <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> is {{installed}} on the side wall of the main channel in order to adjust the flow level. Also, flow within open channel along the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> is considered as spatially varied flow (SVF) with decreasing discharge. Moreover, many experimental and analytical researches and {{studies have been conducted}} on the flow pattern of these types of structures. There are so many studies on the flow within rectangular channels along the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> carried out by various researchers. For example, Ackers (1957), Nandesamoorthy and Thomson (1972), Yu-Tech (1972), RangaRaju et al. (1979), Hager (1982), Uyumaz and Smith (1991), Jalili and Borghei (1996), Borghei et al. (1999), Khorchani and Blanpain (2004), Vatankhah and Bijankhan (2009), Emiroglu et al. (2010, 2011), Bagheri and Heidarpour (2012), Novak et al. (2013), Mohammed (2013) studied the hydraulic behavior of the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> flow. Additionally, various studies were carried out related to trapezoidal channels along the <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> For instance, Cheong (1991) presented an equation in order to compute the discharge coefficient of side weirs located on trapezoidal conduit. Also, Vatankhah (2012 a) proposed an analytical solution to predict the variations of flow free surface along the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> for subcritical and supercritical flow regimes. For U-shaped channels along the <b>side</b> <b>weir,</b> Uyumaz (1997) using the specific energy principles and the finite difference method provided an analytical solution for predicting variations of the flow free surface profile along the side weirs. Uyumaz, by conducting some experiments in both subcritical and supercritical flow conditions, showed an acceptable agreement between the experimental and mentioned method results. Vatankhah (2013) introduced a semi-analytical solution for predicting variations of the longitudinal profile of the flow free surface along the side weirs located on U-shaped channels. The method was based on the energy principles obtained by integration solution. Additionally, for triangular channels along the side weirs, Uyumaz (1992) presented an analytical solution for calculating variations of the flow free surface along the side weirs in subcritical and supercritical flow conditions. In addition, Vatankhah (2012 b) using integration and the principles of specific energy solved the governing dynamical equation on the passing flow over side weirs located on triangular channels. Vatankhah’s analytical method predicts the free surface flow profile along the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> with an acceptable accuracy. Moreover, channels with circular cross section are used in urban sewage disposal networks and drainage systems. In association with circular channels along the side weirs, Allen (1957) conducted an experimental study on the hydraulic behavior of the passing flow over rectangular side weirs. Uyumaz and Muslu (1985) by assuming that the flow in the main channel is two dimensional and the pressure is hydrostatical predicted the longitudinal profile of the flow free surface along the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> and the passing flow over it using the finite element method. Their analytical method for both supercritical and subcritical flow conditions was validated by experimental results. Ramamurthy et al. (1995) through the two-dimensional flow theory provided an analytical method for predicting the passing flow over a <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> located on a circular channel. They introduced the theoretical discharge coefficient of the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> {{as a function of the}} geometric parameters of the <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> Oliveto et al. (2001) investigated the characteristics of supercritical flow conditions along the side weirs located on circular channels. Their experiments have been focused on the local measurement of the flow output angle and the velocity along the <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> In all experiments, the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> upstream flow is subcritical and the flow along the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> is supercritical. Vatankhah (2012 c) by the incomplete elliptic integrals method and the specific energy principle provided a semi-analytical solution for calculating the longitude profile of the flow free surface in both subcritical and supercritical flow conditions. In practice, it is possible that the flow along the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> be supercritical. Many experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted on supercritical flows passing through channels with <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> Hager (1994) provided an analytical method for supercritical flows passing through circular channels with <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> His method is used in both flow conditions: with hydraulic jumps and without hydraulic jumps. He validated the obtained results from his analytical method by the experimental results obtained by other researches. Ghodsian (2003) investigated the passing supercritical flow over the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> located on a rectangular channel. He introduced the elementary discharge coefficient of the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> in supercritical flow conditions as a function of the ratio of the head above the weir to the weir crest height and the Froude number. Mizumura et al. (2003) provided an analytical solution for calculating the main channel discharge in a rectangular channel with <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> in supercritical flow conditions. Their analytical method was based on the energy principles, and the main channel discharge was introduced as a function of the Froude number. Pathirana et al. (2006) conducted an experimental study including investigation of the upstream specific energy, the discharge coefficient and the passing flow over the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> in supercritical flow conditions for a rectangular channel equipped with a <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> Using the specific energy principles and the regression analysis, they provided a relationship for calculating the discharge coefficient of side weirs in supercritical flow conditions. Rao and Pillai (2008) investigated the discharge coefficient of the <b>side</b> <b>weir,</b> the velocity in the main channel, the flow falling angle from the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> and measured the flow depth along the weir by conducting an experimental study on a rectangular channel with <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> in supercritical flow conditions. Coonrod et al. (2009) investigated the effect of guide vanes on increasing the diversion flow rate over side weirs located on rectangular channels in supercritical flow conditions. In recent years, computational fluids dynamics (CFD) has been introduced as a powerful tool for understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of fluids and the interaction between the fluid and the structure. Also, many studies were carried out in order to simulate the flow field of main channels along the <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> For example, Qu (2005) modeled three-dimensional (3 D) changes of the flow in rectangular channels along the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> using the k - ω turbulence model and the volume of fluid (VOF) scheme. Tadayon (2009) developed a numerical model to simulate the flow field within rectangular conduits along the <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> The numerical model simulated the flow turbulence and variations of the flow free surface with the RSM turbulence model and the VOF method, respectively. Aydin (2012) using the FLUENT software simulated the flow free surface within a rectangular channel along the triangular labyrinth <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> by the VOF scheme. Aydin and Emiroglu (2013) using the ANSYS FLUENT software simulated the discharge capacity of labyrinth side weirs. They modeled the free surface changes by the VOF method and the flow turbulence by different turbulence models. Furthermore, they showed that the discharge coefficient increased by increasing the Froude number. Azimi et al. (2014) simulated the velocity field along the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> in circular channels using RNG k - ε and VOF scheme. Also, Azimi and Shabanlou (2015) modeled the flow pattern in triangular channels along the <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> The effect of the Froude number was examined on the characteristics of the flow field.|$|E

In practice, flood flows, catchment from dams and flows within transmission lines are supercritical. In this numerical modeling, the turbulence and the flow field passing through the circular channel with <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> in supercritical flow conditions were simulated using the FLOW- 3 D model. The changes in the free surface of the numerical model and the flow turbulence were simulated using the VOF method and the RNG k - ε model, respectively. In this numerical study, the comparison of the flow free surface, the discharge coefficient of the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> (C_d [...]), the Froude number of the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> upstream end (F_ 1 [...]), the passing discharge over the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> (Q_w [...]) and the specific energy at the weir upstream indicated a good agreement between the numerical model and experimental results in predicting the flow characteristics. Then, the effects of circular channel slope change on transverse and longitudinal flow profiles along the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> in supercritical flow conditions were investigated. By increasing the main channel bed slope, the flow depth decreases although this depth decreasing is negligible. Increasing of circular channel bed slope causes reduction in the passing discharge over the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> and in opposite, the Froude number of the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> upstream end increases.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Side</b> <b>weir</b> {{structures}} are extensively used in hydraulic engineering, irrigation and environmental engineering, and it usually {{consists of a}} main weir and a lateral channel. Side weirs are also used as an emergency structure. This structure is installed on one side or {{both sides of the}} main channel to divert the flow from the main channel to the side channel. Lateral outflow takes place when the water surface in the main channel rises above the weir sill. Flow over a <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> is a typical case of spatially varied flow with decreasing discharge. There have been extensive studies on <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> overflows. Most of the previous theoretical analysis and experimental research works are related to the flow over rectangular side weirs in rectangular main channels. In the current study, the flow conditions over a trapezoidal <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> located in a rectangular main channel in subcritical flow regime is considered. Materials and Methods: The experiments were performed in a rectangular open channel having provisions for a <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> at one side of the channel. The main channel was horizontal with 12 m length, 0. 25 m width, and 0. 5 m height, and it was installed on a frame; lateral channel that has a length of 6 m, width of 0. 25 m, and height of 1 m. It was set up parallel to the main channel; walls and its bed were made up of Plexiglas plates. The <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> was positioned at a distance of 6 m from the channel’s entrance. A total of 121 experiments on trapezoidal side weirs were carried out. Results and Discussion: For trapezoidal <b>side</b> <b>weir,</b> effective non-dimensionnal parameters were identified using dimensional analysis and Buckingham's Pi-Theorem. Finally, the following non-dimensional parameters were considered as the most effective ones on the discharge coefficient of the trapezoidal <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> flow. in which Fr 1 = upstream Froude number, P= hight of the trapezoidal <b>side</b> <b>weir,</b> y 1 = upstream water depth, z=side slope of the trapezoidal <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> and T=top flow width of the trapezoidal <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> Water surface profiles were measured along the weir crest, the main channel centerline, and far from the weir section. Different elevations in water surface profile depend on the upstream Froude number in the main channel; depth differences in low Froude numbers are at minimum values, and in high Froude numbers are at maximum amounts. The water surface level along the crest drops at the entrance of the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> to {{the first half of the}} side weir; and it has been attributed to the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> entrance effect at the upstream. Afterwards, the water level rises towards the downstream of the weir. According to the experimental results, measurements of the water in the centerline of the main channel are reliable and water surface drop is negligible. According to the parameters affecting the discharge coefficient for each value of z, discharge coefficient equations were developed with acceptable accuracy such that the effects of this parameter were shown separately. Finally, the general equation was proposed. The general functional form for discharge coefficient is presented as follows where the effect of the side slope parameter, z, is also considered. The mean and maximum percentage errors of the discharge coefficient computed using the proposed equation are as 2. 6...|$|E

In practice, transmission channels used in irrigation networks and urban sewage disposal systems are steep.

40|$|A <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> is a {{hydraulic}} structure {{set into the}} side of a channel. This structure is used for water level control in channels, to divert flow from a main channel into a side channel when the water level in the main channel exceeds a specific limit and as storm overflows from urban sewerage system. Computation of water surface over the side weirs is essential to determine the flow rate of the <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> Analytical solutions for water surface profile along rectangular <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> are available only for the special cases of rectangular and trapezoidal channels considering constant specific energy. In this paper, a rectangular <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> located in a combined (trapezoidal with exponential) channel was considered. Expanding binominal series of integer and fraction powers and the using of reduction formula of cosine function integrals, a general analytical formula was obtained for water surface profile along a <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> in a combined (trapezoidal with exponential) channel. Since triangular, rectangular, trapezoidal and parabolic cross-sections are special cases of the combined cross section, the derived formula, is applicable to triangular, rectangular, trapezoidal cross-sections as analytical solution and semi-analytical solution to parabolic cross-section with maximum relative error smaller than 0. 76 %.

This type of overflow device induces a spatially varied free-surface flow with decreasing discharge and, because of the convergent geometry, it can potentially improve {{the performance of the}} distribution channels commonly used in irrigation systems, sewer networks, wastewater plants, and hydropower facilities for flow diversion and control and for flood protection. A laboratory investigation is carried out to analyze the main hydraulic characteristics of this kind of flow and assess the improvement in outflow efficiency compared to the conventional rectangular <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> in a prismatic channel. Only subcritical steady flow conditions are considered. Experimental data show that the Froude number in the main channel downstream of the weir and the dimensionless weir height are significant variables to describe the outflow efficiency, and they confirm that the nonprismaticity of the main channel induces a noticeable increase in outflow performance. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the assumption of constant specific energy usually adopted in one-dimensional <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> flow modeling is reasonably valid, despite the considerable increase in the velocity-head and momentum correction coefficients along the <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> Finally, the comparison between experimental data and numerical results shows that the classic one-dimensional modeling approach can adequately predict the main engineering aspects of <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> flows in nonprismatic channels...|$|E

The authors concluded that the ANFIS model could predict the trapezoidal <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> discharge coefficient with higher accuracy. Seyedian et al. (2014) used ANFIS to investigate the effect of changing the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> length, flow depth and <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> height on the discharge coefficient.|$|E

As wide permeable areas go {{through the process of}} urbanization, the most of the storm water dose not infiltrate into the ground and total amount of storm water runoff has increased. Likewise, insufficient drainage capacity and pump station, water retention system in metropolitan areas can also result in urban flooding. So, the researches for the mitigation the amount of storm water are essential. Due to this, underground storage systems are installed to mitigate damage of urban flooding. Estimation of overflowing discharge into those storage systems is significant for evaluation of their mitigation effects. Such overflow happens between pressurized sewer pipe and storage system over a <b>side</b> <b>weir.</b> The equation proposed by De Marchi to estimate overflow discharge over a <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> has been verified through several experimental researches only for open channel flow. Therefore in this study, overflow discharge coefficient is evaluated for pressurized flow of circular pipe through experiments with different <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> length. The discharge coefficient derived from experimental results implies applicability of constant value to estimate overflow discharge if mean value of integrated water head along the <b>side</b> <b>weir</b> is used, which should be verified through numerical simulation in the future...|$|E
