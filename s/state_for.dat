William Benn was elevated to the House of Lords with the title of Viscount Stansgate in 1942 – the new wartime coalition government was short of working Labour peers in the upper house. In 1945–46, William Benn was the Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>for</b> Air in the first majority Labour Government.|$|E

We show that the ground state of the pair tunneling term in the Hamiltonian has a high fidelity with the optimal <b>states</b> <b>for</b> estimation of a single particle tunneling amplitude, suggesting that high-performance probes for tunneling amplitude estimation may be produced by tuning the two-mode system through a quantum phase transition.
