40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that the use of monetary sanctions as a <b>supplementary</b> <b>penalty</b> in state and federal criminal courts is expanding, and that their imposition creates substantial and deleterious legal debt. Little is known, however, about the factors that influence the dis-cretionary imposition of these penalties. This study offers a comprehensive account of the role socio-cultural factors, especially race and ethnicity, have in this institutional sanctioning process. We rely on multilevel statistical analysis of the imposition of monetary sanctions in Washington State courts to test our theory. The theoretical framework emphasizes the need to treat race and ethnicity as complex cultural categories, the meaning and institutional effects of which may vary across time and space. Findings indicate that racialized crime scripts, such as the association of Latinos with drugs, affect defendants whose wrong-doing is stereo-type congruent. Moreover, all individuals accused of committing racially and ethnically stig-matized offenses in racialized contexts may experience the courtesy stigma that flows from racialization. We find that race and ethnicity are not just individual attributes but cultural categories that shape the distribution of stigma and the institutional consequences that flow from it...|$|E
50|$|Under the 1980 law, these offenses were {{punishable}} when {{criminal liability}} could be ascribed. Criminal liability {{was attributed to}} intentional offenses and those acts of negligence specifically provided for by the law. There were principal and <b>supplementary</b> <b>penalties.</b> Principal penalties were public surveillance, detention, fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, and death. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>penalties</b> were fines, deprivation of political rights, and confiscation of property. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>penalties</b> could be imposed exclusive of principal penalties. Foreigners could be deported with or without other penalties.|$|R
40|$|The author {{points out}} some {{practical}} consequences of non-coherence of penal system such as: incomplete legal protection {{of domestic violence}} victims and inefficiency of prevention measures regarding domestic violence. Therefore author advocates for changes of administrative law of the Republic of Serbia. Those changes will, on one hand, clarify conception, place and function of misdemeanor in the penal system and, {{on the other hand}} improve protection of domestic violence victims. This second goal could be achieved through new misdemeanor offences (applicable to cases of domestic violence and broader, to people living in the same household), and new protective orders, which could be imposed individually or as <b>supplementary</b> to existing <b>penalties.</b> The content of protection orders should be a warning to a perpetrator or supervision of his behaviour...|$|R
