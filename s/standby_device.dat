40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the reliability and}} availability analysis of three-state device systems with common-cause failures. The effect of common-cause failures on different systems is discussed. Different configurations are compared {{in order to obtain}} higher standby system reliability. Mathematical expressions are developed for the system reliability, the mean time to failure, the steady state availability and the time dependent availability of cold standby system, warm standby system, series system and parallel system. For system with constant common-cause failure rates, the Markov State Space approach is used to perform reliability analysis. The Method of Stages approach is used to investigate systems with non-constant common cause failure rates. Selected plots demonstrate the effect of the varying common cause failure rate on system reliability mean time to failure, steady state availability and time dependent availability. This study clearly shows that the occurrence of common-cause failure has a negative effect on standby system reliability parameters.

40|$|Abstract. Smart home uses a {{combination}} of the renewable energy power resources, the use of power generation from solar cells based on titanium dioxide (TiO 2) which acts as the only type which produces an efficient solar cell power to obtain the electricity to recharge the <b>standby</b> storage <b>device</b> from the sunlight. The thin film of Titanium dioxide is synthesized by the sol-gel spin coating techniques at 2000 rpm on the glass. The films have a constant thickness of ~ 240 nm. The annealing process consists of 150 °C, 250 °C and 350 °C. The study of the absorbance and the wavelength values are important. At this condition, for the solar cell, the wavelength is around ~ 280 nm to ~ 330 nm. As the temperature of annealing increases the higher absorbance would be produced. The refractive index of TiO 2 film is estimated at different annealing temperatures and it increases with the increasing of the annealing temperature. The application is suitable to smart home design. The dynamic output voltage obtained from the solar cells is interfaced with other circuitry such as inverters and interface charging circuit in order to inject the generated power into the <b>standby</b> storage <b>device.</b> The calculated result of this application is efficient to reduce the electrical bill by almost 30 % of its original value...|$|R

Measurements showed a significant energy savings potential in Dutch households with the use of <b>standby</b> reduction <b>devices</b> in the existing stock.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for high performance {{as well as}} low <b>standby</b> power <b>devices</b> has been {{the main reason for}} the aggressive scaling of conventional CMOS transistors. Current devices are at the 32 nm technology node. However, due to physical limitations as well as increase in short-channel effects, leakage, power dissipation, this scaling trend cannot continue and will eventually hit a barrier. In order to overcome this, alternate device topologies have to be considered altogether. Extensive research on ultra thin body double gate FETs and gate all around nanowire FETs has shown a lot of promise. Under strong inversion, these devices have demonstrated increased performance over their bulk counterparts. This is mainly attributed to full carrier inversion in the body. However, these devices are still limited by lithographic and processing challenges making them unsuitable for commercial production. This thesis explores a unique device structure called the CFET (Cylindrical Field Effect Transistors) which also like the above, relies on complete inversion of carriers in the body/bulk. Using dual gates; an outer and an inner gate, full-volume inversion is possible with benefits such as enhanced drive currents, high Ion/Ioff ratios and reduced short channel effects...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is a {{well-known}} low power design technique that reduces the processor energy by slowing down the DVS processor and stretching the task execution time. But in a DVS system consisting of a DVS processor and multiple devices, slowing down the processor increases the device energy consump-tion and thereby the system-level energy consumption. In this pa-per, we present dynamic task scheduling algorithms for periodic tasks that minimize the system-level energy (CPU energy + <b>device</b> <b>standby</b> energy). The algorithms {{use a combination of}} (i) optimal speed setting, which is the speed that minimizes the system en-ergy for a specic task, and (ii) limited preemption which reduces the numbers of possible preemptions. For the case when the CPU power and device power are comparable, these algorithms achieve up to 43 % energy savings compared to [1], but only up to 12 % over the non-DVS scheduling. If the device power is large compared to the CPU power, we show that DVS should not be employed...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, many {{embedded}} real-time systems have emerged with energy conservation requirements. Most of these systems comprise battery-operated microprocessors and I/O devices. The increasingly complex software and faster hardware used by these systems introduce more energy consumption, but battery technology is not keeping up. Therefore, aggressive energy conservation techniques are needed to extend their lifetimes. ^ Traditionally, the research community has focused on processor-based power management techniques, with many articles published on processor energy conservation. On the other hand, research of power conservation for I/O devices {{as well as the}} overall system has received little attention. ^ In this dissertation, we first analyze the problem of online energy aware I/O scheduling for embedded real-time systems. We introduce the concept of device slack to represent the length of time that a device can be put in the low power state without causing any job to miss its deadline. Based on the concept of device slack, we propose two online energy-aware I/O device scheduling algorithms based on the preemptive periodic task model: Energy-Efficient Device Scheduling (EEDS) and Energy-Efficient Device Scheduling with Non-preemptible Resources (EEDS_NR). The EEDS algorithm keeps track of device slack for devices and performs device power state transitions to save energy, without jeopardizing temporal correctness. Although EEDS can achieve excellent energy conservation, it can only support fully preemptive system. The EEDS_NR algorithm generalize EEDS to support non-preemptive shared critical regions. ^ Next, the trade-off between I/O-based energy conservation and processor-based energy conservation is studied. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) -based scheduling algorithms can effectively reduce the processor energy consumption at the cost of increased execution time, which in turn increases the I/O <b>device</b> <b>standby</b> energy consumption. On the other hand, I/O-based Dynamic Power Management (DPM) techniques save device energy by aggressively reducing the time that devices are active, which requires the highest processor speed. Therefore, DVS alone or DPM alone may not achieve the same level of energy conservation that a scheduling algorithm considering both can achieve. To this end, we introduce and evaluate the System-wide Energy-Aware EDF (SYS_EDF) algorithm, which integrates device scheduling and processor voltage scaling to reduce the overall system energy consumption. ^ In summary, this dissertation discusses the design, the theoretical correctness, and the evaluation of a set of energy-efficient scheduling algorithms for real-time systems. ...|$|R
