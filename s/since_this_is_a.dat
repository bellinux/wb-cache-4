25|$|According to Robert Zydendos, karma in Jainism can be {{considered}} a kind of system of laws, but natural rather than moral laws. In Jainism, actions that carry moral significance are considered to cause certain consequences in just the same way as, for instance, physical actions that do not carry any special moral significance. When one holds an apple in one's hand and then let go of the apple, the apple will fall: this is only natural. There is no judge, and no moral judgment involved, <b>since</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mechanical consequence of the physical action.|$|E
25|$|The term of {{supervised}} {{release that}} {{is subject to}} revocation is the term originally imposed by the court, not the existing unserved term of supervised release.

More than one revocation of supervised release is permitted. The statute provides for aggregated, rather than per violation, statutory maximum terms of imprisonment for violations of supervised release.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{time-frame}} of {{the capacitance}} change (as much as 50ms at 20Hz audio signal), {{the charge is}} practically constant and the voltage across the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance. The voltage across the capacitor varies {{above and below the}} bias voltage. The voltage difference between the bias and the capacitor is seen across the series resistor. The voltage across the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute no voltage gain as the voltage differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels. <b>Since</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very high impedance circuit, only current gain is usually needed, with the voltage remaining constant.|$|E

An echosounder installed at Folger Deep shows evidence of a dense zooplankton community and schools of fish in the water column, while hydrophones regularly record the songs of whales and dolphins in the area.|$|E
500|$|According to Indologist Robert J. Zydenbos, karma is {{a system}} of natural laws, where actions that carry moral {{significance}} are considered to cause certain consequences {{in the same way}} as physical actions. When one holds an apple and then lets it go, the apple will fall. There is no judge, and no moral judgment involved, <b>since</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mechanical consequence of the physical action. In the same manner, consequences occur naturally when one utters a lie, steals something, commits senseless violence or leads a life of debauchery. Rather than assume that these consequences—the moral rewards and retributions—are a work of some divine judge, Jains believe that there is an innate moral order in the cosmos, self-regulating through the workings of the law of karma. Morality and ethics are important in Jainism not because of a God, but because a life led in agreement with moral and ethical principles (mahavrata) is considered beneficial: it leads to a decrease—and finally to the total loss of—karma, which in turn leads to everlasting happiness. The Jain conception of karma takes away the responsibility for salvation from God and bestows it on man himself. In the words of the Jain scholar, J. L. Jaini: ...|$|E
