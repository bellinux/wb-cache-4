25|$|In {{some older}} guides, the <b>saffron</b> <b>milk</b> <b>cap</b> is {{considered}} an excellent mushroom, having 'a crisp texture'. In fact, when naming the mushroom, the mycologist had mistaken the mushroom with Lactarius sanguifluus, which is an excellent, pleasantly crunchy mushroom. Today, most mycologists hold Lactarius sanguifluus in higher esteem than its pretender, Lactarius deliciosus.|$|R
25|$|Lactarius deliciosus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>saffron</b> <b>milk</b> <b>cap</b> and red pine mushroom, {{is one of the best}} known members of the large milk-cap genus Lactarius in the order Russulales. It is found in Europe and has been accidentally introduced to other countries under conifers and can be found growing in pine plantations. A fresco in the Roman town of Herculaneum appears to depict Lactarius deliciosus and is one of the earliest pieces of art to illustrate a fungus.|$|R
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius sanguifluus are edible, and choice. This was noted by Paulet in his {{original}} {{description of the}} species, who wrote: [...] "This fungus is highly prized for use {{by those who are}} acquainted with it, it keeps well: I kept them for a whole year, it hardens without spoiling, then it takes on a taste of morels. The best way to eat is to cook it in the frying pan or on the grill with oil or butter & salt: it does not take long to cook". The mushrooms are sold in rural markets in France, Spain, Turkey, and Yunnan Province, China. They are also collected by locals in the upper valley of the Serchio River in central Italy. In Spain, where the mushroom is esteemed as a culinary delicacy in Catalan cuisine, it is known as níscalos (in Spanish) or rovelló (in Catalan). In Cyprus, it is known as γαιματάς (meaning [...] "the bloody one") and it is widely collected by the locals, but considered inferior to the <b>saffron</b> <b>milk</b> <b>cap</b> (Lactarius deliciosus). In India, young specimens are consumed along with L.deliciosus; and some consider L.sanguifluus to have a better flavor than its more well-known relative. Its English common name is the [...] "bloody milkcap".|$|R
50|$|Delyan (Делян) is {{a village}} in the Sofia Province, western Bulgaria, {{near the town of}} Breznik. The old {{historic}} name of the village is Karnul (Кърнул). As of 2007, the village has only 18 permanent inhabitants. Delyan is located in the municipality of Bozhurishte, 34 km west of Sofia on the eastern slopes of Viskyar Mountain with an average altitude of 790 meters. Its houses are nestled in a beautiful valley between three small peaks of Viskyar. It is named after the leader of the Bulgarian uprising against the Byzantine Empire (1040-1041) and for a short time Tsar (Emperor) of Bulgaria, Peter II Delyan. Administratively, the village is connected to the nearby village Zlatusha to which there is a tarmac road, built in early 1970s. It is close to the railroad Pernik-Voluyak, on the border between Sofia Province and Pernik Province, and nearby Dogandjia (Falconer), a remote neighborhood of Goz is in the Breznik Municipality. The village consists of 3 neighborhoods (mahali): Matsina and Rebrachka Mahala to the north of center, and Vanchina Mahala to the south of center. The church of St Mary, funded and built by local people on a hill near Delyan, was opened in the spring of 2008. To the south-west of Delyan, in the locality Ormana, there is a pine forest, planted in the 1970s. During favorable seasons, one can find there edible mushrooms, like <b>saffron</b> <b>milk</b> <b>cap</b> (Lactarius deliciosus) and sticky bun (Suillus luteus). Delyan is the birthplace of the writer Spas Antonov.|$|R
50|$|Because many {{children}} {{would keep the}} <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> they won in games from other players, many school districts considered <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> a form of gambling. <b>Milk</b> <b>caps</b> proved to be major distractions from classes {{and the source of}} various playground arguments. These elements eventually led to the banning of <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> from various schools across North America. Other bannings occurred across Australia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>caps</b> {{generally}} involves {{two types}} of playing discs: <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> and slammers. <b>Milk</b> <b>caps</b> are typically flat circular cardboard discs which are decorated with images on one or both sides. Traditional (or traditional-style) <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> are made of rougher cardboard, are printed with limited colors, and often have a staple in them (as they appeared when used as actual POG bottlecaps), while modern commercial pogs were stiffer, thicker and are often printed with colorful glossy imagery.|$|R

5000|$|The game of <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> {{possibly}} {{originated in}} Maui, Hawaii during the 1920s or 1930s, or possibly with origins in Menko, a Japanese card game {{very similar to}} <b>milk</b> <b>caps,</b> {{which has been in}} existence since the 17th century.

50|$|The Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the United States Department of Defense's {{largest and}} oldest {{exchange}} system, distributes milk-cap-like coinage as change at its stores in contingency areas (those supporting Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom). The reason for adopting <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> as currency was that supply flights overseas had limited capacity and air-freight shipping involved high costs. Metal coinage weighs {{significantly more than}} paper <b>milk</b> <b>caps,</b> which are also much thinner than standard <b>milk</b> <b>caps.</b> While they are only issued in contingency areas, they are redeemable at any AAFES store worldwide.|$|R

5000|$|The 1990s revival is {{credited}} to Blossom Galbiso, {{a teacher and}} guidance counselor who taught at Waialua Elementary School in Oahu. In 1991, Galbiso introduced the game she had played {{as a little girl}} to a new generation of students, soon incorporating <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> into her fifth grade curriculum as a way of teaching math and as a nonviolent alternative to other popular schoolyard games, such as dodgeball. The game quickly spread from Oahu's North Shore, and by early 1992, STANPAC Inc., the small Canadian packaging company that had been manufacturing the <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> distributed by Haleakala Dairy on Maui (the same caps that were collected by Galbiso for her class), was printing millions of <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> every week for shipment to the Hawaiian island chain.

5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other <b>milk</b> <b>caps.</b> Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different <b>milk</b> <b>caps</b> and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|R
