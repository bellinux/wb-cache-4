5|$|Paquette {{also created}} a similar <b>stainless-steel</b> {{monument}} to the three musicians located outside the Riverside Ballroom in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where Holly, the Big Bopper, and Valens played their second-to-last show {{on the night of}} February 1, 1959. This second memorial was unveiled on July 17, 2003.|$|E
5|$|After {{building}} two demonstrators in {{what would}} become its signature semi-streamlined, fluted <b>stainless-steel</b> style, the Budd Company built four production rubber-tired rail cars for American railroads: one for the Reading Company, two for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Silver Slipper for the Texas and Pacific Railway. All were plagued by problems, chief among them their tendency to derail. By 1935, the Silver Slipper had been scrapped, and the Pennsylvania's two cars, the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin collaborations, met the same fate in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The Expo MRT Station, {{located on}} the Changi Airport Branch Line (CAL) of the East West Line, is {{adjacent}} to the 100,000-square-metre Singapore Expo exhibition facility. Designed by Foster and Partners and completed in January 2001, the station features a large, pillarless, titanium-clad roof in an elliptical shape that sheathes {{the length of the}} station platform. This complements a smaller 40-metre reflective <b>stainless-steel</b> disc overlapping the titanium ellipse and visually floats over a glass elevator shaft and the main entrance. The other station with similar architecture is Dover.|$|E
5|$|This {{park was}} {{constructed}} {{to commemorate the}} official joining of Ikata to her Sister City of Red Wing, Minnesota, after which it is named. Of note is the 21-meter <b>stainless-steel</b> monument located {{at the entrance of}} the park, a twin sister of the one in Bay Point Park, Red Wing. Beneath the monument lies a commemorative stone plaque bearing the signatures of each of the mayors at the time. It is home to Adventure Hill—a playground full of climbing nets, roller slides, and other children's play equipment. The park is free and open to the public.|$|E
25|$|A K prefix in {{the model}} number {{indicates}} <b>stainless-steel</b> parts. The suffixes D indicates a decocker model, and (DAO) indicates a double-action-only model. For example, a P89 with a <b>stainless-steel</b> slide that only has a decocker would be a KP89D.|$|E
25|$|The DMC-12 {{features}} {{a number of}} unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted <b>stainless-steel</b> body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, the Budd company {{designed}} and fabricated the <b>stainless-steel</b> skin for the blades of the Smith-Putnam wind turbine, the largest wind turbine {{in the world}} for forty years.|$|E
25|$|The Bel Air {{utilized}} a <b>stainless-steel</b> {{belt and}} rocker molding, identifying signature {{on the rear}} fenders, a glove compartment light and power tailgate on 9-passenger wagons to distinguish itself from the lower-priced Biscayne series.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{structure}} at {{the station}} is an old powerhouse, timber-framed and clad with cement sheet and a gabled corrugated fibro cement roof with <b>stainless-steel</b> gutters. The new powerhouse is brick constructed on a concrete foundation.|$|E
25|$|The residences at {{the station}} consist of two one-storey {{lighthouse}} keeper's houses. They are timber framed, clad with fibro and with corrugated fibro roofs, with <b>stainless-steel</b> gutters. One of them is occupied by a site manager and the other serves as a display with lighthouse artefacts.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s (decade), {{public works}} to {{requalify}} the site, {{supported by the}} Programa Operacional de Cooperação Transfronteiriça Portugal-Espanha (Portugal-Spain Trans-frontier Cooperation/Operational Program), and integrated into Project Guaditer. These initiatives lead {{to the construction of}} <b>stainless-steel</b> guard-rails and platforms to allow visitors to view the structure and landscape in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The Bren Ten, {{manufactured}} by Dornaus & Dixon, was a <b>stainless-steel</b> handgun used by Don Johnson during Miami Vice's first two seasons. Dornaus & Dixon {{went out of}} business in 1986, and Smith & Wesson was offered a contract to outfit Johnson's character with a S Model 645 during season three.|$|E
25|$|Another work, Jim Beam - J.B. Turner Engine (1986) {{is based}} on a commemorative, {{collectible}} in bottle {{in the form of a}} locomotive that was created by Jim Beam; however, Koons appropriated this model and had it cast in gleaming <b>stainless-steel.</b> The train model cast in steel titled Jim Beam - Baggage Car (1986) even contains Jim Beam bourbon.|$|E
25|$|The Frankfurt Kitchen of 1926 {{was made}} of several {{materials}} depending on the application. The built-in kitchens of today use particle boards or MDF, decorated with veneers, in some cases also wood. Very few manufacturers produce home built-in kitchens from <b>stainless-steel.</b> Until the 1950s, steel kitchens were used by architects, but this material was displaced by the cheaper particle board panels sometimes decorated with a steel surface.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Koons {{presented}} Hanging Heart, a 9-foot-tall highly polished, steel heart, one of {{a series}} of five differently colored examples, part of his Celebration series. Large sculptures from that series were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2008. Later additions to the series include Balloon Swan (2004–2011), an 11.5-foot (3.5-meter), <b>stainless-steel</b> bird, Balloon Rabbit (2005–2010), and Balloon Monkey, all for which children's party favors are reconceived as mesmerizing monumental forms.|$|E
25|$|Store H3PO4 in {{containers}} made of corrosion-resistant materials. Sigma-Aldrich recommends storing phosphoric acid in a <b>stainless-steel</b> container with a resistant inner lining. Containers {{should always be}} stored upright to avoid leaks. Do not store in incompatible metals such as aluminium, the alloys of aluminium, and carbon steel. Store away from all incompatible chemicals and compounds. Keep away from food and foodstuffs. Ensure any solid material is kept dry. Do not reuse containers, even if they appear clean and empty.|$|E
25|$|The Sarafand was a six-engined biplane {{flying boat}} with equal span wings. Due {{to the high}} wing end loads, Gouge {{specified}} corrugated steel spars for both upper and lower wings. The six engines, in tractor/pusher pairs, were housed in monocoque nacelles mounted between the wings on integral girders; the central nacelle was further supported by two pairs of splayed struts to the lower wing-roots. The hull, largely constructed of anodised Alclad, had a <b>stainless-steel</b> planing bottom. It had a monoplane tail unit with one large fin and two small auxiliary fins on the tailplane.|$|E
25|$|The triumphal arches were {{crafted by}} Rock of Ages Corporation. Sculptor Raymond Kaskey created the bronze eagles and wreaths that were {{installed}} under the arches, {{as well as}} 24 bronze bas-relief panels that depict wartime scenes of combat and the home front. The bronzes were cast {{over the course of}} {{two and a half years}} at Laran Bronze in Chester, Pennsylvania. The <b>stainless-steel</b> armature that holds up the eagles and wreaths was designed at Laran, in part by sculptor James Peniston, and fabricated by Apex Piping of Newport, Delaware.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{a gearbox}} and the {{simplified}} rotor coupling to the aircraft meant that the design could employ a tilting rotor hub, and did not need drag hinges. The low torque coupling at the mast meant that very little was needed {{in the form of}} lateral control. The P.74 rotor was expected to be quieter in operation than tip jets, following tests with a Derwent engine powered rotor. The <b>stainless-steel</b> rotors were thick in cross section to accommodate the necessary ducting to the tips. They also were non-feathering, so ailerons were fitted to the blades.|$|E
25|$|Early P85 pistols were {{recalled}} for {{a safety}} issue {{that resulted in}} one accidental discharge. If the firing pin broke {{in front of the}} firing pin block, applying the safety, which dropped the hammer, could transfer enough energy to the broken firing pin to cause a discharge. The P85 was recalled, and a new safety was installed that prevented contact between firing pin and hammer during a decocking operation. This modification was done free of charge. The P85 MKII was released with the safety fix, larger safety levers, improved accuracy, and the option of a <b>stainless-steel</b> slide.|$|E
25|$|Another newer technology, {{thin-film}} PV, {{are manufactured}} by depositing semiconducting layers on substrate in vacuum. The substrate is often glass or <b>stainless-steel,</b> and these semiconducting layers {{are made of}} many types of materials including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). After being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser-scribing. Thin-film photovoltaics now make up around 20% of the overall production of PV because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers.|$|E
25|$|A {{rim band}} brake, as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of a}} <b>stainless-steel</b> cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the wheel rim. Squeezing the brake lever tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, no adjustment is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the band brake used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|E
25|$|The building's base is {{differentiated}} {{from the}} rest of the tower by a facade of polished granite and large windows. The base is wider than most of the tower above and is curved at the corner facing the Market Street and 12th Street intersection. The base housed the original banking hall and former retail space. Two-story-tall windows set in flat aluminum frames open into the banking hall area, curving with the rest of the base. Stainless steel rods make up the window mullions. The large banking hall features <b>stainless-steel</b> columns supporting the tower above and two mezzanine levels, now separated from the hall by a metal and glass wall. The mezzanine levels are connected by a black and white staircase.|$|E
25|$|Both the Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) {{purchased}} RDCs. The Canadian National purchased 25 cars outright, {{and acquired}} many more second-hand from the Boston and Maine Railroad. These cars, which CN called Railiners, were used primarily on secondary passenger routes. CP purchased 53 cars. The first one ran on November 9, 1954, between Detroit and Toronto. It {{was the first}} <b>stainless-steel</b> passenger train to operate in Canada. CP used the RDCs, which it called Dayliners, throughout its system. CP also made extensive use of them on commuter trains around Montreal and Toronto. Via Rail inherited many of these cars when it took over CN and CP passenger services in 1978. Via continues to use RDCs on the Sudbury–White River train in Ontario.|$|E
25|$|Kelly's two-paneled Blue Black (2001), 28 {{feet tall}} and made of painted {{honeycomb}} aluminum, was commissioned for the Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts, St. Louis, and the large-scale bronze Untitled (2005) was commissioned specifically for {{the courtyard of the}} Phillips Collection. In 2005, Kelly was commissioned with the only site-specific work for the Modern wing of the Art Institute of Chicago by Renzo Piano. He created White Curve, the largest wall sculpture he has ever made, which is on display since 2009. Kelly installed Berlin Totem, a 40 feet <b>stainless-steel</b> sculpture, in the courtyard of the Embassy of the United States, Berlin, in 2008. He later made a curtain, Spectrum VIII (2014), consisting of 12 coloured strips, for the auditorium of the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris.|$|E
25|$|In {{the base}} of the building, the banking hall, now called the Millennium Hall Ballroom, is used as {{function}} space. Separated by a metal and glass screen, the mezzanine levels are used as pre-function space and dining areas. Located by the 12th Street entrance on the ground floor, the lobby is decorated by the original vault door from the third-floor mezzanine, the bronze ceiling from the safe deposit box area, and the tellers' counters from the banking hall. Designed to mimic the building's original style, the lobby contains <b>stainless-steel</b> columns that replicate the ones found on the mezzanine, and the walls are of wood and marble. The ground floor also contains a Solefood Restaurant, Bar, and Lounge and a street-level, glass-walled news studio for the NBC affiliate WCAU.|$|E
25|$|All the 14 {{sections}} vary {{significantly from}} one another and were designed {{in such a way}} as to the differentiation of sections not leading to any break in the walkway, which is a continuous walking stretch from the Triumph of Labour Statue to the Kamaraj Statue. One of these galleries is flanked by two semi-circular <b>stainless-steel</b> pergolas resting on wire-cut brick columns. The galleries can accommodate over 1,000 people. The choice of natural stones and pillars used in each section of the promenade was based on the type of the buildings on the other side of the road. The walkway was designed as low-lying as is necessary to have a clear view of the beach from the road. A total of 428 octagonal poles with seagull-shaped light fittings and additional high-mast lamps have been erected.|$|E
500|$|The theater's sightlines and {{acoustics}} provide [...] "an unusually {{modern and}} <b>stainless-steel</b> bolstered environment" [...] for experiencing performances {{according to the}} Centerstage City Guide.|$|E
500|$|The [...] tall base corners were {{originally}} designed to gently slope upward, and have prismatic glass. The corners were later squared. In addition, the base's walls are now covered in [...] "hundreds of pairs of 13-foot vertical glass fins set against horizontal bands of eight-inch-wide <b>stainless-steel</b> slats." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Ken Paquette, a Wisconsin {{fan of the}} 1950s era, made a <b>stainless-steel</b> {{monument}} that {{depicts a}} guitar {{and a set of}} three records bearing the names of the three performers killed in the accident. The monument is on private farmland, about [...] west of the intersection of 315th Street and Gull Avenue, [...] north of Clear Lake.|$|E
500|$|According to John H. White, the Silver Slipper was a [...] "costly failure" [...] {{that was}} [...] "extremely embarrassing" [...] to the Budd Company and {{ultimately}} forced {{the company to}} abandon its ambitious rubber-tired rail car program altogether. However, Budd did not give up on building lightweight, <b>stainless-steel</b> trains: its very next project was the highly successful Pioneer Zephyr.|$|E
500|$|Completed {{in early}} 1932, {{the first of}} the Budd–Michelin collaborations was a 40-passenger, single-car {{demonstrator}} nicknamed the [...] "Green Goose", which rode on 12 wheels and was powered by an [...] Junker diesel engine. A second demonstrator, a smaller, 30-passenger car named La Fayette, was sent to France for testing. The two demonstrators were both built in the semi-streamlined, fluted <b>stainless-steel</b> style that would become the Budd Company's signature design.|$|E
500|$|The {{place where}} [...] "Mannenberg" [...] was {{recorded}} is commemorated with an abstract sculpture of seven <b>stainless-steel</b> pipes, mounted {{outside the building}} where the original studios were. Designed by electrical engineer Mark O'Donovan and performer Francois Venter, the pipes have been tuned to correspond to the first seven notes of the melody, and are inscribed with the instruction: [...] "Run a stick along these pipes to hear Mannenberg".|$|E
500|$|The Budd–Michelin rubber-tired {{rail cars}} were {{built by the}} Budd Company in the United States between 1931 and 1933 using French firm Michelin's [...] "Micheline" [...] rail car design. Michelin built its first rail car in 1929, and by 1932 had built a fleet of nine cars that all {{featured}} innovative and distinctive pneumatic tires. In September 1931, an agreement signed between the two companies allowed Budd {{to use the new}} rubber rail tires on its shot-welded, <b>stainless-steel</b> carbodies, {{and at the same time}} allowed Michelin to expand into the American market.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by Michelin's success, the Budd Company set its {{sights on}} marrying the new rubber rail tires with its shot-welded, <b>stainless-steel</b> carbodies; it had {{developed}} the shot welding process and utilized stainless steel to overcome frame failures that plagued the earlier streamlined McKeen cars, which Budd Company founder Edward G. Budd had helped design {{early in his}} career. Michelin likewise took interest in a potential collaboration, chiefly due to its desire to expand into the American market. In September 1931, Budd {{signed an agreement with}} Michelin that allowed it to develop and sell Michelin's [...] "Micheline" [...] rail car design in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Ralph Budd and the Burlington {{capitalized}} on the Zephyrs success. However, most passenger trains needed larger capacity. Thus, as the Burlington made {{a transition to}} larger diesel-electric locomotives pulling individual passenger cars, new streamlined cars of standard size were ordered, which quickly became the standard of many railroads. However, Burlington {{was determined to be}} the leader, and ordered its large [...] "E" [...] series passenger diesels to also be equipped with matching <b>stainless-steel</b> fluting. Many of the Burlington's long distance named passenger trains began operating under the Zephyr banner, including the Nebraska Zephyr, Twin Cities Zephyr, and perhaps the most famous of the namesake, the California Zephyr.|$|E
