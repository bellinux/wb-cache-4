In 1482-83, the last count sold Sargans to become a shared territory of the seven cantons of the Old Swiss Confederation. (Whilst there were eight cantons to <b>Switzerland,</b> <b>Berne</b> {{was not involved in}} this transaction.) The purchase of 1483 stood at the conclusion of a decades-long expansionist policy of the Confederation in the east of Switzerland.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, De Staebler {{traveled}} to Europe aboard the Greek freighter “The Atlantic Beacon.” Once in Europe, he visited cities across Italy (Genoa, Pisa, Sienna, Rome, Assisi, Padua, Venice, Ravenna, Florence, Milan), <b>Switzerland</b> (<b>Berne</b> and Basel), France (Paris, Chartres) and England (London) {{where he was}} exposed to canonical works of art and architecture, including Chartres Cathedral and iconic sculptures such as the Belvedere Torso in the Vatican Museums in Rome, Michelangelo's unfinished Captives at the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence, the Rondanini Pietà at the Castello Sforzesco in Milan, the Winged Victory of Samothrace at the Louvre in Paris, and the Three Goddesses from the Parthenon at the British Museum in London. Two years after this cultural pilgrimage, De Staebler graduated from Princeton magna cum laude {{with a degree in}} Religious Studies. His senior thesis, “St. Francis of Assisi and His Imitation of Christ,” explored the life and work of the much venerated founder of the Franciscan Order.|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{assessment}} of soil functions requires maps of basic soil properties. Unfortunately, these are either missing for many regions {{or are not}} available at the desired spatial resolution or down to the required soil depth. The field-based generation of large soil datasets and conventional soil maps remains costly. Meanwhile, legacy soil data and comprehensive sets of spatial environmental data are available for many regions. Digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches relating soil data (responses) to environmental data (covariates) {{face the challenge of}} building statistical models from large sets of covariates originating, for example, from airborne imaging spectroscopy or multi-scale terrain analysis. We evaluated six approaches for DSM in three study regions in <b>Switzerland</b> (<b>Berne,</b> Greifensee, ZH forest) by mapping the effective soil depth available to plants (SD), pH, soil organic matter (SOM), effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), clay, silt, gravel content and fine fraction bulk density for four soil depths (totalling 48 responses). Models were built from 300 – 500  environmental covariates by selecting linear models through (1)  grouped lasso and (2)  an ad hoc stepwise procedure for robust external-drift kriging (georob). For (3)  geoadditive models we selected penalized smoothing spline terms by component-wise gradient boosting (geoGAM). We further used two tree-based methods: (4)  boosted regression trees (BRTs) and (5)  random forest (RF). Lastly, we computed (6)  weighted model averages (MAs) from the predictions obtained from methods  1 – 5. Lasso, georob and geoGAM successfully selected strongly reduced sets of covariates (subsets of 3 – 6...|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the origin}} of conservation ethics’ knowledge among the employees of three national libraries (New Zealand, Wellington; France, Strasbourg; <b>Switzerland,</b> <b>Berne).</b> For each of these countries, one notices that the liveliest conservation ethics’ notions are related to contexts specific to each country. Assuming that knowledge based on an empirical or collective experience is firmly anchored in each individual, one can deduct that a conservation ethics’ education using this type of experience has more chances to come to fruition. In this present case, this would enable the libraries to better respond to the legal engagements they are tied to. These legal mandates ask them to preserve and conserve their collections for the posterity. An online survey allowed collecting information by the employees of those three institutions. Specific context could be localised for those countries. Using those specificities, it is suggested to adapt the conservation ethics’ education at professional level, to lead staff to take responsibility towards conservation issues {{as soon as they}} start to work for the institution and to maintain this knowledge up to date. A large part of the damages present within libraries’ collections are generated by handling. For this reason, it is important to optimise conservation ethics’ knowledge among libraries’ staff at all hierarchical levels. A survey within three national institutions: National Library of New Zealand, National and University Library of Strasbourg and Swiss National Library showed that specific fields exist in which employees of each institution recognise potential dangers for the future conservation of the collections. These sensitisations form a base on which it is possible to build a conservation ethics able to respond to the legal mandates attributed to the libraries by their governments. Sensitisation to a given problem allows understanding it almost to an instinctive level. This comprehension level is much deeper than the sole theoretical level. It allows developing a consciousness towards a problem. The gap between consciousness and responsibility towards a problem is very narrow. Accepting the legal collections’ conservation’s mandate from their governments, the institutions have to ensure the adequate response of the whole staff to it. To reach this goal, they have the ability to act at various levels: At the level of their own definition and evaluation of their conservation’s action, At the level of the various professional educations related to the library’s field, promoting a complete conservation ethics’ education, At the level of creating a responsibility feeling by all employees as soon as they start working for the library, encouraging them to consider conservation ethics as part of their professional duties, At the level of checking and maintaining conservation ethics’ level up to date among the staff, organising regular information meetings, workshops, forums or else on the topic of conservation ethics, Underlining the presence of conservation ethics at all levels and within all actions including collections’ objects, the library supports one of its main goals, which is to transmit the collections to the next generation in the best possible condition...|$|E
