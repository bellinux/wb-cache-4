500|$|Soundgarden {{has been}} praised for its {{technical}} musical ability, {{and the expansion}} of its sound as the band's career progressed. [...] "Heavy yet ethereal, powerful yet always-in-control, Soundgarden's music was a study in contrasts," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Henry</b> Wilson of Hit Parader. Wilson proclaimed the band's music as [...] "a brilliant display of technical proficiency tempered by heart-felt emotion". Soundgarden is one of the bands credited with the development of the genre of alternative metal, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stating that [...] "Soundgarden made a place for heavy metal in alternative rock." [...] Ben Ratliff of Rolling Stone defined Soundgarden as the [...] "standard-bearers" [...] of the rock riff during the 1990s. The band inspired and influenced a number of metalcore bands such as Between the Buried and Me and The Dillinger Escape Plan. In 2017, Metal Injection ranked Soundgarden at number three on their list of 10 Heaviest Grunge Bands.|$|E
500|$|The French team {{struggled}} {{during the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and {{finished second in}} their group behind Serbia. During the play-offs against the Republic of Ireland, Henry {{was involved in a}} controversy in the second leg of the game at the Stade de France on 18 November 2009. With the aggregate score tied at 1–1 and the game in extra time, he used his hand twice to control the ball before delivering a cross to William Gallas who scored the winner. This sparked a barrage of criticism against the Frenchman, while national team coach Raymond Domenech and Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger defended him. The Football Association of Ireland lodged a formal complaint with FIFA, seeking a replay of the game, which FIFA declined. Henry said that he contemplated retiring from international football after the reactions to the incident, but maintained that he was not a [...] "cheat"; hours after FIFA had ruled out a replay, he stated that [...] "the fairest solution would be to replay the game". FIFA President Sepp Blatter described the incident as [...] "blatant unfair play" [...] and announced an inquiry into how such incidents could be avoided in future, and added that the incident would be investigated by the Disciplinary Committee. Blatter also <b>said</b> <b>Henry</b> told him that his family had been threatened {{in the aftermath of the}} incident. In January 2010, FIFA announced that there was no legal basis to sanction Henry.|$|E

"He offered {{very good}} {{insights}} in the '60s and '70s when linkages between {{the financial markets}} and the economy were not as well understood as they are now," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Henry</b> Kaufman, a Wall Street money manager and economist. [...] "He showed us that financial markets could move frequently to excess. And he underscored {{the importance of the}} Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort." ...|$|E
2500|$|French {{newspaper}} L'Équipe {{greeted the}} incident with the headline 'Hand of God', while Le Parisien had [...] "Henry Saves France With His Hand.", and Le Figaro led with [...] "Henry: 'I Am Not the Referee'." [...] L'Equipe also wrote, [...] "France have {{qualified for the}} 2010 World Cup, that's for sure, but the result, the most essential thing in sport after all, {{is not enough to}} erase the uneasy feeling we had last night". Le Parisien also wrote [...] "The handball of Henry has brought a decisive contribution to the theme 'being French is being ashamed of one's national team'". Le Monde noted the lack of any calls for a replay following the controversial penalty for handball that went in Ireland's favour, during their previous Group 8 qualifying game against Georgia on 11 February 2009. Australia's Daily Telegraph <b>said</b> <b>Henry</b> would [...] "earn a place in infamy as one of the biggest cheats in world sport".|$|E
