In this paper, we compare curvature changes in Hack profiles of a series of rivers running through faults in the central and southwestern Foothills of Taiwan. Longitudinal profiles of these rivers were derived from two versions of topographic maps (1904 and 1985) and recent DTM data (2000). Prior to comparisons, we calibrated the 1904 topographic map, named “Taiwan Bautu”, by “offsetting” horizontal coordinates north and westward approximately 440 m and then “linear transforming ” the elevation values.

40|$|It is very {{important}} for meteorological radar observations to know the precipitation particle size distribution functions. In this paper, we report a very simple method to evaluate snow particle size distribution functions using snow particle VTR images, and show our results at Syowa Station, Antarctica. Snow particles on the ground were recorded by a VTR camera set, and the VTR image was digitized and stored on frame memories using a video digitizer board in a personal computer. To avoid the overlap of snow particles and to reduce background offset noise on images, we used subtraction processing between images at different recording times. Next, we obtained projections of this subtracted image in the x and y directions, and determined the position of each particle using back projection processing. Since radar echo from snow is usually analyzed on the assumption that snow particles are spherical, we measured the maximum radius (γ_max) and equivalent radius (γ_area) from the identified individual snow particle images. The former is defined as the maximum diameter through the center of gravity on the particle image, the latter is calculated from its area. In this study, we used two sets of VTR tapes which were recorded at Syowa Station on April 5 and October 1, 1988. Using a personal computer, we have counted more than 2500 particles. The obtained distributions, N (γ_max) and N (γ_area), are approximated as straight lines on <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>graph</b> paper, N (γ) ∿(10) ^. In April, radii of snow particles, which may be graupels, were mainly distributed between 0. 2 and 0. 6 mm, and the exponents (B) of γ_max and γ_area were 42 and 50,respectively. Otherwise, in October, most particles were distributed from 0. 1 to 0. 5 mm, and the exponents of γ_max and γ_area were 62 and 33. We believe that our method is a practical approach for obtaining snow particle size distribution functions...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Edward Greenfield, Erin Griner, The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology† ### Abstract The [Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology]([URL] {{seeks to}} address growing {{concerns}} about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of 50 {{papers in the}} field of cancer biology published between 2010 and 2012. This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from “Widespread potential for growth-factor-driven resistance to anticancer kinase inhibitors” by Wilson and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (Wilson et al., 2012). The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 2 B and C. In these experiments, Wilson and colleagues show that sensitivity to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors can be bypassed by various ligands through reactivation of downstream signaling pathways (Figure 2 A; Wilson et al, 2012), and that blocking the receptors for these bypassing ligands abrogates their ability to block sensitivity to the original RTK inhibitor (Figure 2 C; Wilson et al, 2012). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the [Center for Open Science]([URL] and [Science Exchange]([URL] and the results of the replications will be published by eLife. ### Introduction A recurring theme in treatment of cancer is the acquisition of drug resistance. The effectiveness of therapies targeting specific mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is limited by the acquisition of resistance to the drugs over the course of treatment (Camidge et al., 2014; Mok et al., 2009). Resistance can be acquired through new mutations that block the action of the RTK inhibitors or their uptake and/or genetic amplification of downstream target genes of the RTK (Chen and Fu, 2011; Gainor and Shaw, 2013; Garrett and Arteaga, 2011; Sequist et al., 2011; Yang, 2013). Several studies, including this work by Wilson and colleagues, elucidated another mechanism for this acquisition of resistance: the engagement of parallel RTK signaling pathways that converge on common downstream survival signals via signals from the tumor microenvironment. In this study, Wilson and colleagues examined several cancer cell lines for ligand-mediated drug resistance (Wilson et al., 2012). In Figure 2 B/C, Wilson and colleagues demonstrated that resistance to primary kinase inhibitor treatment can be induced by the addition of rescuing ligands that activate the PI(3) K-AKT and MAPK pro-survival signaling pathways. This resistance can be overcome with the addition of an appropriate secondary kinase inhibitor. Three different cancer cell line models were used to demonstrate this phenomenon. Treatment of A 204 (a PDGFR amplified rhabdomyosarcoma cell line) with the ligand FGF activated pFRS 2 and pERK, inducing resistance to Sunitinib. The addition of a secondary kinase inhibitor, PD 173074, blocked FGF-induced pFRS 2 and pERK activation, restoring sensitivity to Sunitinib. Treatment of M 14 (a BRAF mutated melanoma cell line) with the ligand NRG 1 activated pHER 3 and pAKT, inducing partial resistance to PLX 4032. The addition of a secondary kinase inhibitor, Lapatinib, blocked NRG 1 -induced pHER 3 and pAKT activation, restoring sensitivity to PLX 4032. Treatment of KHM- 3 S (a EGFR mutated small cell lung cancer cell line) with the ligand HGF activated pMET and pERK, inducing resistance to Erlotinib. The addition of a secondary kinase inhibitor, Crizotinib, blocked HGF-induced pMET and pERK activation, restoring sensitivity to Erlotinib. The cell viability assays examining drug sensitivity and the western blots examining levels of phosphorylated kinases in Figures 2 B and 2 C respectively, are the key experiments that demonstrate that growth factor ligands can reactivate downstream signaling components important for cancer cell survival, causing resistance to anticancer kinase inhibitors (Wilson et al., 2012). These experiments are replicated in Protocols 1 and 2. Two studies published around {{the same time as the}} work of Wilson and colleagues also support the proposed mechanism of acquired resistance to RTK inhibition by signaling from the tumor microenvironment. Straussman and colleagues demonstrated that HGF signaling derived from the tumor microenvironment could bypass EGFR inhibition by activation of MET signaling (Straussman et al., 2012), and Harbinski and colleagues, in an approach similar to Wilson and colleagues, showed multiple growth factor ligands could “bypass” inhibitor-targeted RTKs (Harbinski et al., 2012). Since the publication of Wilson and colleagues’ work, several publications have reported similar results to those being replicated in Protocols 1 and 2. Similar to the experiments with A 204 cells above, Welti and colleagues demonstrated that FGF ligands could induce resistance to Sunitinib, which could be reversed by the addition of PD 173074 (Welti et al., 2011). These experiments were performed in HUVEC cells, whereas A 204 cells were used in the study being replicated. Similar to the experiments on M 14 cells above, Montero-Conde and colleagues showed that NRG 1 ligand could activate pHER 3 and pAKT in the presence of PLX 4032, and this activation could be reversed by the addition of Lapatinib (Montero-Conde et al., 2013). These experiments were performed in 8505 C cells, whereas M 14 cells were used in the study being replicated. Similar to the experiments performed on KHM-S 3 cells above, several groups have demonstrated that HGF ligand can induce resistance to Erlotinib, and that this resistance can be reversed by the addition of Crizotinib (Nakade et al., 2014; Nakagawa et al., 2012). These experiments were performed in PC- 9 and HCC 827 cells, whereas KHM- 3 S cells were used in the study being replicated. ### Materials and Methods Unless otherwise noted, all protocol information was derived from the original paper, references from the original paper, or information obtained directly from the authors. An asterisk (*) indicates data or information provided by the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology core team. A hashtag (#) indicates information provided by the replicating lab. **Protocol 1 : Cell viability assays** This protocol describes cell viability assays to determine the IC 50 values of three cancer cell lines treated with primary kinase inhibitor alone, primary kinase inhibitor in combination with rescuing ligand, and primary kinase inhibitor in triple combination with rescuing ligand and a drug targeting the rescuing ligand’s receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (termed the secondary kinase inhibitor) (Figure 2 B). Sampling: -The original data presented is qualitative, and the authors were unable to share the raw data values with the RP:CB core team. This prevents power calculations being performed a priori to determine sample size (number of biological replicates). In order to determine an appropriate number of replicates to perform initially, we have estimated the sample sizes required based on a range of potential variance. We will also determine sample size post hoc as described in Power Calculations. - Please see Power Calculations for details. - Each experiment has three cohorts. In each cohort, a dilution series of the primary kinase inhibitor (10 e- 4, 10 e- 3, 10 e- 2, 10 e- 1, 10 e 0 and 10 e 1 µM) is run three times; once alone, once with the rescuing ligand, and once with both the rescuing ligand and the secondary kinase inhibitor. The effect of the secondary kinase inhibitor alone will also be assessed. Each condition will be run in triplicate. - Cohort 1 : A 204 cell line - Media only [additional] - Vehicle control - 0. 001 µM - 10 µM Sunitinib + no ligand - 0. 001 µM - 10 µM Sunitinib + 50 ng/ml FGF - 0. 001 µM - 10 µM Sunitinib + 50 ng/ml FGF + 0. 5 µM PD 173074 - 0. 5 µM PD 173074 + no ligand [additional] - Cohort 2 : M 14 cell line - Media only [additional] - Vehicle control - 0. 001 µM - 10 µM PLX 4032 + no ligand - 0. 001 µM - 10 µM PLX 4032 + 50 ng/ml NRG 1 - 0. 001 µM - 10 µM PLX 4032 + 50 ng/ml NRG 1 + 0. 5 µM Lapatinib - 0. 5 µM Lapatinib + no ligand [additional] - Cohort 3 : KHM- 3 S cell line - Media only [additional] - Vehicle control - 0. 001 µM - 10 µM Erlotinib + no ligand - 0. 001 µM - 10 µM Erlotinib + 50 ng/ml HGF - 0. 001 µM - 10 µM Erlotinib + 50 ng/ml HGF + 0. 5 µM Crizotinib - 0. 5 µM Crizotinib + no ligand [additional] *Materials and Reagents:* ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") ![Table 1 a]([URL] "Table 1 a") *Procedure:* Notes: - All cells will be sent for mycoplasma testing and STR profiling. - Medium for all cell lines: RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 µg/ml streptomycin. - Cells maintained at 37 ˚C in a humidified atmosphere at 5 % CO 2. 1.
