40|$|The Ehrenfest {{equation}} is derived rigorously {{for the case}} when an 'effective' volume V* = AV of the strained solids is a continuous function of the temperature. The Ehrenfest equation for strained solids is generalized to an arbitrary temperature. Far from 0 K (in contrast to the situation near 0 K) the phase transition temperature derivative with respect to uniaxial pressure depends on the temperature expansion coefficient of an ' effective' volume. For Rochelle salt strained by a uniaxial pressure at room temperature the predominant contribution into this dependence is made by the coefficient A. At the second order phase transition under uniaxial pressure the 'effective' (but not true) volume is the continuous function of the temperature. The Ehrenfest equation for solids strained by hydrostatic pressure can be presented as a sum of three linear parts proportional to the crystal linear thermal expansion coefficients along the axes a, b, c. These parts are equal to the <b>second</b> <b>order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> derivative with respect to hydrostatic (but not uniaxial) pressure,Comment: 7 pages, 2 table...|$|E

In addition to exploring such pressure-induced mesomorphism, we aimed to develop techniques for characterizing pressure-induced mesophases in polymer melts. These aims necessitated the development of a straightforward multifunctional pressure apparatus, based on a modified Instron capillary rheometer, capable of measuring the pressure-volume-temperature relationship, differential thermal analysis, rheological properties and thermal diffusivity of polymers at elevated pressures. The purpose of including the rheological experiment was to identify pressure-induced mesophases at elevated pressures. In the resulting apparatus, the maximum operating pressure is 6000 bars and the maximum temperature is approximately 380 ∘C. ^ During this study, three polymeric systems were examined: a semi-crystalline high density polyethylene, an amorphous polysulfone and a liquid crystalline polymer 2 ̆ 2 HIQ- 202 ̆ 2 copolyester.

40|$|Motivated by {{questions}} about the QCD deconfining phase transition, we studied in two previous papers Model A (Glauber) dynamics of 2 D and 3 D Potts models, focusing on structure factor evolution under heating (heating in the gauge theory notation, i. e., cooling of the spin systems). In the present paper we set for 3 D Potts models (Ising and 3 -state) {{the scale of the}} dynamical effects by comparing to equilibrium results at first and <b>second</b> <b>order</b> phase <b>transition</b> <b>temperatures,</b> obtained by re-weighting from a multicanonical ensemble. Our finding is that the dynamics entirely overwhelms the critical and non-critical equilibrium effects. In {{the second half of the}} paper we extend our results by investigating the Glauber dynamics of pure SU(3) lattice gauge on N_τ N_σ^ 3 lattices directly under heating quenches from the confined into the deconfined regime. The exponential growth factors of the initial response are calculated, which give Debye screening mass estimates. The quench leads to competing vacuum domains of distinct Z_ 3 triality, which delay equilibration of pure gauge theory forever, while their role in full QCD remains a subtle question. As in spin systems we find for pure SU(3) gauge theory a dynamical growth of structure factors, reaching maxima which scale approximately with the volume of the system, before settling down to equilibrium. Their influence on various observables is studied and different lattice sizes are simulated to illustrate an approach to a finite volume continuum limit. Strong correlations are found during the dynamical process, but not in the deconfined phase at equilibrium. Comment: 12 pages, 18 figure...|$|R

40|$|The liquid-glass {{transition}} is analyzed using {{a theory of}} Brownian motion in liquids recently developed by the author. It is shown that if a liquid could be cooled in quasi-static process and still avoids crystallization it would transform into a stable non-crystalline solid, {{which would be a}} normal thermodynamic phase. This hypothetical phase {{transition is}} neither first nor <b>second</b> <b>order.</b> At equilibrium <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> the free energy of the system and its first, second and third derivatives are all continuous functions, but its fourth derivative with respect to temperature is discontinuous. Therefore, the equilibrium liquid to non-crystalline solid transition may be considered a fourth <b>order</b> phase <b>transition.</b> The <b>temperature</b> of this phase transition, T-K, which coincides approximately with the Kauzmann temperature, is below the standard glass <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> T, (When the temperature decreases below T-g, the viscosity increases above 10 (13) dPa s.) When the temperature decreases below T-K, the system becomes an ideal solid because the molecular mobility becomes zero and the viscosity becomes infinite if we neglect vacancy-like mechanisms of mobility. This hypothetical quasi-static transition is physically unobservable because the real liquid-glass transition must be done at a cooling rate high enough to suppress the growth of nanocrystals, which makes the liquid-glass transformation a non-equilibrium complicated phenomenon. Understanding this ideal phase transition is a first step towards describing the real liquid-glass transition from first principles. Publisher's Versio...|$|R

Fine structure was observed in the magnetostriction measurement in single crystal and polycrystalline Gd 5 Si 1. 95 Ge 2. 05 samples but not on other compositions, which might be due to the presence of a secondary phase. It was demonstrated that a giant magnetostriction of the order of 1813 ppm could be obtained by varying the temperature using a Peltier cell and removing the requirement of bulky equipment such as Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS). Magnetoresistance was measured for various compositions and an irreversible increase in resistivity was observed which depended linearly on the number of thermal cycles passing through the first <b>order</b> phase <b>transition</b> <b>temperature.</b> The irreversibly increased resistivity was recovered by holding the samples at high temperature {{for a long period of}} time of up to 3 days.

In the second case, however, our results are different. While we obtain, as in the S = 1 case, a phase diagram presenting a multicritical point, the Mean Field approach predicts only a <b>second</b> <b>order</b> <b>transition</b> and a critical end point.

40|$|Recent {{study on}} doping {{effects in the}} heavy fermion {{superconductor}} CeCoIn$_ 5 $ has shown that {{a small amount of}} doping induces unexpectedly large broadening of the <b>second</b> <b>order</b> <b>transition</b> into the high field and low temperature (HFLT) phase of this material. Motivated by this observation, effects of quenched disorder on the <b>second</b> <b>order</b> <b>transition</b> into a longitudinal Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state are examined. The observed large broadening of the transition is naturally explained as a consequence of softness of each FFLO nodal plane. The present results strongly support the scenario identifying the HFLT phase of CeCoIn$_ 5 $ with a longitudinal FFLO vortex state.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of classical nucleation theory to <b>second</b> (and higher) <b>order</b> thermodynamic <b>transitions</b> in the Ehrenfest sense {{has been investigated}} and expressions have been derived upon which the qualitative and quantitative success of the basic approach must ultimately depend. The expressions describe the effect of temperature undercooling, hydrostatic pressure, and tensile stress upon the critical parameters, the critical nucleus size, and critical free energy barrier, for nucleation in a thermodynamic transition of any general order. These expressions are then specialized for the case of first and <b>second</b> <b>order</b> <b>transitions.</b> The expressions for the case of undercooling are then {{used in conjunction with}} literature data to estimate values for the critical quantities in a system undergoing a pseudo-second <b>order</b> <b>transition</b> (the glass transition in polystyrene). Methods of estimating the interfacial energy gamma in systems undergoing a first and <b>second</b> <b>order</b> <b>transition</b> are also discussed...|$|R
