5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot <b>say</b> <b>my</b> opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E

Right after {{coming back to}} Europe, the band presented a semi-acoustic Dutch theater tour in March 2012, called Sanctuary, much like their previous live album An Acoustic Night at the Theatre in which they played many songs never played before like <b>Say</b> <b>My</b> Name, The Last Dance, Overcome, Bittersweet and some that they don't play often like Restless, Sounds Of Freedom, The Swan Song and Our Farewell. Most of them were played in acoustic version. On the 8th of May, 2012 Sharon den Adel and Ruud Jolie appeared on DWDD Recordings to perform an acoustic cover of Nirvana's song Smells Like Teen Spirit. The band embarked on a second leg of festivals, headlining several of the biggest European 2012 Summer Festivals, such as Sonisphere, Masters of Rock, Rock Werchter, Summerbreeze and Gods of Metal. Later, the band officially announced a very special show called Elements. The sold out special show celebrated the band's 15 year anniversary at the Sportpaleis, Belgium, and the band was accompanied by the Il Novecentro Orchestra and other special guests, such as band's ex-members.|$|E

500|$|During one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, [...] "I <b>say</b> <b>my</b> {{prayers for}} you and when I thank the Lord for his tender mercies, you're {{at the head of}} the list." [...] Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of Romans 12, in which Paul the Apostle appeals to Christians to live out their lives in service to others [...] "through the mercies of God". Many of the {{elements}} of Mac's redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, [...] "This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans.... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible." [...] Jewett compares Mac's story to that of Abraham, because [...] "just like Sledge's story, [...] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God". As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife Sarah are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops the faith that God will provide them an heir, which is exactly what occurs, though—as Paul describes—Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: [...] "It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and to be grateful for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode an A– grade. In a season review, Michelle Kung from Entertainment Weekly called the episode [...] "worthy", but {{noted that it}} was overshadowed by the show's [...] "ludicrous {{conspiracy}} plots". Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that [...] "Release" [...] was a [...] "good episode" [...] because it [...] "presented conclusions to [...] long running stories in the series [...] featured the conclusion to John Doggett's personal trial, his quest for closure with his son's murder." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two argued that, because of the [...] "minimal emphasis" [...] Doggett's son's murder was given in the show, the episode [...] "packs [...] punch". Shearman and Pearson saw similarities between Doggett's trials and those of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). They noted that while [...] "Mulder was always identified by his quest for his sister [...] ", Doggett [...] "carried {{the loss of his}} son as a private grief." [...] They concluded that this structuring made the entry [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] and [...] "moving". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, complimented the [...] "lyrical style" [...] of the episode, calling it [...] "gorgeously shot" [...] and [...] "well acted". Other reviews were not as glowing. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode made about as much sense as 'Underneath' or 'Jump the Shark'. It was entirely inappropriate for John Doggett’s struggle to end with someone else’s actions. If this is the way the series is going to end, then I have to <b>say,</b> <b>my</b> hopes for a rousing finale are dwindling." ...|$|E
