5000|$|Article 5(1)a (2012 recast: Article 7(1)a) of the Regulation {{states that}} the {{plaintiff}} may sue the defendant, domiciled in another Member State, ‘in matters relating to a contract, in the courts for the place of {{performance of the obligation}} in question’. This provision is slightly problematic on a theoretical level in two ways. First, ‘matters relating to a contract‘ lacks, although the European Court of Justice (ECJ) considers it as an [...] "independent" [...] and thus 'European' concept, a clear or uniform definition. The only thing present are definitions given in ECJ case-law that are rather abstract, consequently leaving parties in unclear cases to wait until the ECJ decides the matter. Second, 'the place of performance' lacks an independent European concept as well. However, unlike 'matters relating to a contract', the Regulation does contain a harmonisation of 'the place of performance' for two categories of (common) contracts in Article 5(1)b of the Regulation: sale of goods and the provision of services. However, Article 5(1)c (2012 recast: Article 7(1)c) of the Regulation defines that if the conditions for Article 5(1)b (2012 recast: Article 7(1)b) are not fulfilled, the <b>standard</b> <b>provision</b> of Article 5(1)a is applicable again, making the national law for defining ‘the place for performance’, {{in the absence of a}} uniform concept, take over.|$|E

The main finding is that unforeseen differences in analysis procedure, criteria of acceptability and levels of detail can cause use-related difficulties for different professional groups when methods are used interchangeably...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK has {{recommended}} that the effectiveness of ongoing exercise referral schemes to promote physical activity should be examined in research trials. Recent empirical evidence {{in health care and}} physical activity promotion contexts provides a foundation for testing the feasibility and impact of a Self Determination Theory-based (SDT) exercise referral consultation. METHODS: An exploratory cluster randomised controlled trial comparing <b>standard</b> <b>provision</b> exercise referral with an exercise referral intervention grounded in Self Determination Theory. Individuals (N = 347) referred to an exercise referral scheme were recruited into the trial from 13 centres. Outcomes and processes of change measured at baseline, 3 and 6 -months: Minutes of self-reported moderate or vigorous physical activity (PA) per week (primary outcome), health status, positive and negative indicators of emotional well-being, anxiety, depression, quality of life (QOL), vitality, and perceptions of autonomy support from the advisor, need satisfaction (3 and 6 months only), intentions to be active, and motivational regulations for exercise. Blood pressure and weight were assessed at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS: Perceptions of the autonomy support provided by the health and fitness advisor (HFA) did not differ by arm. Between group changes over the 6 -months revealed significant differences for reported anxiety only. Within arm contrasts revealed significant improvements in anxiety and most of the Dartmouth CO-OP domains in the SDT arm at 6 months, which were not seen in the standard exercise referral group. A process model depicting hypothesized relationships between advisor autonomy support, need satisfaction and more autonomous motivation, enhanced well being and PA engagement at follow up was supported. CONCLUSIONS: Significant gains in physical activity and improvements in quality of life and well-being outcomes emerged in both the <b>standard</b> <b>provision</b> exercise referral and the SDT-based intervention at programme end. At 6 -months, observed between arm and within intervention arm differences for indicators of emotional health, and the results of the process model, were in line with SDT. The challenges in optimising recruitment and implementation of SDT-based training in the context of health and leisure services are discussed.

A clear pattern of findings emerged, which taken together demonstrate the efficacy of providing a telephone-based response to certain types of domestic abuse incidents. Specifically, a detailed and formalised operations protocol has been embedded into {{the work of the}} Resolution Centre and all evidence suggests this is leading to a higher quality response overall to grade- 3 domestics. The initial response provided by the Resolution Centre results in more crimes being recorded and more investigations that result in formal police action. The practice of risk assessment appears to be more comprehensive and detailed, generating a higher number of disclosures and more cases classified as ‘medium’ and ‘high’ risk. Due to the robust methodological approach of the research, these positive findings can be directly attributed to the setting where the police work was performed, rather than any differences in case characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Lightweight concrete, in {{the form}} of foamed concrete, is a {{versatile}} material that primarily consists of a cement based mortar, mixed with at least 20 % volume of air. Its dry density is typically below 1600 kg/m 3 with a maximum compressive strength of 15 MPa. The ASTM <b>standard</b> <b>provision</b> specifies a correction factor for concrete strength of between 14 and 42 Mpa, in order to compensate for a reduced strength, when the aspect height-to-diameter ratio of a specimen is less than 2. 0. However, the CEB-FIP provision specifically mentions a ratio of 150 mm dia. × 300 mm cylinder strength to 150 mm cube strength; though, both provision requirements do not specifically clarify the applicability and/or modification of the correction factors for the compressive strength to lightweight concrete (in this case, foamed concrete). The focus of this work is to study the effect of specimen size and shape on the axial compressive strength of concrete. Specimens of various sizes and shapes were cast with square and circular cross-sections i. e., cubes, prisms, and cylinders. Their compression strength behaviours at 7 and 28 days were investigated. The results indicate that, as the CEB-FIP provision specified, even for foamed concrete, 100 mm cubes (l/d = 1. 0) produce a comparable compressive strength with 100 mm dia. × 200 mm cylinders (l/d = 2. 0) ...|$|E

This proposed laboratory work is intended to study the effect of different dimensions and profiles on the axial compressive strength of concrete. Specimens of various dimensions and profiles are cast with square and circular cross-sections i. e., cubes, prisms and cylinders, and to investigate their behavior in compression strength at 7 and 28 days.
