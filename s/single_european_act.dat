5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange rates {{and in general}} does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the <b>Single</b> <b>European</b> <b>Act,</b> the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low {{interest rates}} and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners. However, in 2010, the euro started on a sharp decline. Starting at U.S$1.60 in 2008, and dropping to US$1.04 in 2015.In the following months € recovered till the value of 1.19 U.S.$.

But such a purpose requires a certain degree of harmonization in many fields, among them the economic field. First and foremost the adoption of a common policy in the sphere of transport as defined in the article 3 of the Treaty of ROME will be necessary. Because the task was so huge and difficult, the common policy for road transport of goods encountered real problems. But the European Communities soon realised that transport was the prime issue if they wanted to succeed in the establishment of a free trade area...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the process of}} formation of internal makret of 12 member states of the European Communities and analyses its implications for Poland. Attention was paid {{to the fact that}} European internal market is a consequence of economic integration within the Communities. In June 1985 the Commission prepared for the Council of Ministers the so-called White Paper on the implementation of internal market. Its content is very interesting, for it defines the features of internal market and contains about 300 proposals to implement internal market in various spheres. These proposals are accompanied by a detailed schedule of their realization. By the end of 1988 the Council of Ministers took about 90 decisions with respect to the internal market implementation; further steps are being discussed in working groups. The White Paper was later confirmed by <b>Single</b> <b>European</b> <b>Acts,</b> having the binding force of treaties. <b>Single</b> <b>European</b> <b>Acts</b> define the notion of internal market of member states of the Communities, proclaim the rule of qualified majority vote for decisions taken by the Council and set the deadline for a full realization of internal market for December 31, 1992. Various economic implications for Poland result from the above. It is indispensable for Polish economy to achieve a certain degree of convergence with the economies of member states of the Communities. In order to accomplish it, deep reforms of the structure of economy and management are necessary. The article indicates main directions of reforms and ways of carrying them out. It is a very demanding task for the Polish economic policy. Otherwise, Poland would find itself outside the economic relations with the Communities. Therefore, the article is against „emergency" reforms and instead postulates the realization of far-reaching reforms which would take into account the changes on the economic map of Europe.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to analyse how human temporality was {{expressed}} in the political party campaigns of the Conservative People’s Party (K), the Liberal Party (V), the Social-Liberal Party (RV) and the Social Democrates (S) on the Danish referendum on The <b>European</b> <b>Single</b> <b>Act</b> (1986). Besides the expression of human temporality, we investigate how the parties justify a voting recommendation by constructing a particular human temporality and we discuss whether the justification has {{had an impact on}} the electorate’s decisions. In order to make a qualitative jump from the historical sources to the political reality, we apply a critical discourse analysis as our methodological foundation. Theoretically, we use the concepts related to the research area of political memory, such as human temporality and imagined communities, and linguistic tools from communication and speech acts. We conclude that human temporality was widely used by K, V, and S, while RV tried to convince the electorate exclusively by referring to treaty amendments. The electorate did not have particular knowledge on the <b>European</b> <b>Single</b> <b>Act,</b> and thereby we find that the parties’ communication, including the use of human temporality, has played an essential role in order to convince the electorate...|$|R

For a long time, this had not been affirmed, but the European Court of Justice said in 1974 that the general rules of the treaty apply to the air transport sector and precised this decision in the "Nouvelles Frontieres" case of 1986. Those decisions were a first step towards liberalization and the Council and the Commission of the Community followed the court and adopted measures to liberalize the sector in the first air transport package in December 1987. These decisions and measures are problematic because there are quiet about the external relations of EEC member states with third countries. The "Saeed" case of 1989 brings a solution, but the second air transport package of July 1990 still stays too quiet about it whereas it liberalises the air transport further.

However, when necessary, the Heads of State or Government could also meet as the Council of Ministers and take formal decisions in that role.

In 1987, it was included in the treaties for the first time (the <b>Single</b> <b>European</b> <b>Act)</b> and had a defined role {{for the first time in}} the Maastricht Treaty. At first only a minimum of two meetings per year were required, which resulted in an average of three meetings per year being held for the 1975-1995 period. Since 1996, the number of meetings were required to be minimum four per year. For the latest 2008-2014 period, this minimum was well exceeded, by an average of seven meetings being held per year. The seat of the Council was formalised in 2002, basing it in Brussels. Three types of European Councils exist: Informal, Scheduled and Extraordinary. While the informal meetings are also scheduled 1½ years in advance, they differ from the scheduled ordinary meetings by not ending with official Council conclusions, as they instead end by more broad political Statements on some cherry picked policy matters. The extraordinary meetings always end with official Council conclusions - but differs from the scheduled meetings by not being scheduled more than a year in advance, as for example in 2001 when the European Council gathered to lead the European Union's response to the 11 September attacks.|$|E
