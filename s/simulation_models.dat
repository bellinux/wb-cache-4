25|$|Many species exhibit density-dependent {{dispersal}} {{and habitat}} selection. For species exhibiting this pattern, dispersal into what {{would otherwise be}} sub-optimal habitats can occur when local abundances are high in high quality habitats (see Source-sink dynamics, thus increasing {{the size of the}} species geographic range. An initial argument against this hypothesis is that when a species colonizes formerly empty habitats, the average abundance of that species across all occupied habitats drops, negating an O–A relationship. However, all species will occur at low densities in some occupied habitats, while only the abundant species will be able to reach high densities in some of their occupied habitats. Thus it is expected that both common and uncommon species will have similar minimum densities in occupied habitats, but that it is the maximum densities obtained by common species in some habitats that drive the positive relationship between mean densities and AOO. If density-dependent habitat selection were to determine positive O–A relationships, the distribution of a species would follow an Ideal Free Distribution (IFD). Gaston et al. cites Tyler and Hargrove who examined the IFD using <b>simulation</b> <b>models</b> and found several instances (e.g. when resources had a fractal distribution, or when the scale of resource distribution poorly matched the organisms dispersal capabilities) where IFDs poorly described species distributions.|$|E

They maintain that so-called [...] "natural analogues" [...] inhibit subterranean movement of radionuclides, making disposal of radioactive wastes in stable geologic formations unnecessary. However, existing models of these processes are empirically underdetermined: due to the subterranean nature of such processes in solid geologic formations, the accuracy of computer <b>simulation</b> <b>models</b> has not been verified by empirical observation, certainly not over periods of time equivalent to the lethal half-lives of high-level radioactive waste.

Normally, most shipbuilding processes are consisted of job shop production, and the <b>modeling</b> and <b>simulation</b> require professional skills and experience on shipbuilding. For these reasons, many shipbuilding companies have difficulties adapting simulation systems, regardless of the necessity for the technology. In this paper, the data model for shipyard production <b>simulation</b> <b>model</b> generation was defined by analyzing the iterative <b>simulation</b> <b>modeling</b> procedure. The shipyard production <b>simulation</b> data <b>model</b> defined in this study contains the information necessary for the conventional <b>simulation</b> <b>modeling</b> procedure and can serve as a basis for <b>simulation</b> <b>model</b> generation. The efficacy of the developed system was validated by applying it to the <b>simulation</b> <b>model</b> generation of the panel block production line. By implementing the initial <b>simulation</b> <b>model</b> generation process, which was performed in the past with a simulation modeler, the proposed system substantially reduced the modeling time.

The integration of metamodels as components of the <b>simulation</b> <b>model</b> simplifies the model and reduces the simulation time.

DoD has recommended to apply M&S method to evaluate the requirements of the proposed system during the development.
