In some instances, [...] "lesser" [...] gods wear crowns with only one pair of horns, {{but the number of}} horns is not {{generally}} a symbol of [...] "rank" [...] or importance. The form we <b>see</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> a style popular in Neo-Sumerian times and later; earlier representations show horns projecting out from a conical headpiece.|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} on the episode, investigative journalist Mark Ebner {{served as a}} consultant to Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Ebner had previously authored The New York Times best seller Hollywood, Interrupted, which includes an analysis of the Church of Scientology and its effects on the culture in Hollywood, and has a chapter on Tom Cruise and John Travolta's relationship to Scientology. On the official Comedy Central website for the South Park episode, it is asserted that the section of [...] "Trapped in the Closet" [...] that explains Scientology's portrayal and beliefs was not exaggerated: [...] "Nothing about what you <b>see</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> exaggerated in the slightest. Seriously." [...] The title is a reference to the R. Kelly song of the same name, and a depiction of R. Kelly appears in the episode to sing a parody of it.|$|E

[...] The map was a slightly modified copy of a [...] (and its text) by Oronce Fine. The double cordiform projection, {{may well have been}} chosen because of its relationship to aspects of Lutheran beliefs. A notice to the reader (...) {{at the top of the}} map says: [...] "Let America, Sarmatia and India bear witness, Dear Reader, that the image of the world you <b>see</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> newer and more correct than those that have been circulated hitherto. We propose with regard to the different parts of the world to treat, successively, particular regions more broadly, as we are already doing with Europe, and you may soon expect a universal map, which will not be inferior to that of Ptolemy.

2500|$|Cycle World and Motor Cycle News both {{commented on}} how Kawasaki had claimed {{the high end}} of the market with the H2, moving past a {{stagnant}} market (at least from the Japanese Big Four manufacturers) full of cookie-cutter sportbikes and low-priced entry level bikes, and had set up the H2 as a halo model for the entire brand. Cycle World's Kevin Cameron said [...] "When we look at the current crop of 1000s, all date from before our present [...] "recession," [...] and what little has come by way of new product has sought to please the mostly imaginary [...] "new buyer" [...] with low-tech delights." [...] Highlighting Kawasaki's ability to create a product leveraging aerodynamic, turbine and engine technology design expertise from across the large Kawasaki Heavy Industries conglomerate (called a [...] "vast industrial complex" [...] by Sport Rider), an unsigned Motor Cycle News piece said [...] "The H2R you <b>see</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the very pinnacle of what Kawasaki can do... This is the firm's halo product, and every element is Kawasaki at its very best, from the engine and aerodynamic development, through to the mirror-finish black chrome paint specially developed for this model." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is the Soviet Union {{that runs}} against {{the tide of}} history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in deep {{economic}} difficulty. The rate {{of growth in the}} national product has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than half of what it was then. The dimensions of this failure are astounding: A country which employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine.... Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year after year the Soviet system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we <b>see</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by political ones. ...In the Communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again. To be sure, there are grim reminders of how brutally the police state attempts to snuff out this quest for self-rule – 1953 in East Germany, 1956 in Hungary, 1968 in Czechoslovakia, 1981 in Poland. But the struggle continues in Poland. And {{we know that there are}} even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the Soviet Union itself. ...What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term – the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people. And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO even as we move forward with our Zero-Option initiative in the negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads." ...|$|E
