40|$|Abstract The Boston Schoolyard Initiative (BSI) is {{a policy}} effort to rebuild <b>school</b> <b>yards</b> in Boston through {{innovative}} citywide public-private partnerships. At the cen-ter of the initiative is a commitment to engage multiple stakeholders and utilize a bottom-up planning process to encourage meaningful change. Based on {{a case study of}} BSI, this article develops a framework to understand and analyze how different school and neighborhood sectors can partner to benefit neighborhood communities and utilize the built environment to encourage more active living and active learning. The article contributes to a literature that focuses on the effects of <b>school</b> <b>yards</b> and the role of physically active environments on learning. It expands on this literature by looking at the school-yard initiative as a way to build and expand relationships between teachers, parents, and the community at large. Finally, the study shows that even older schools in inner-city neighborhoods, previously considered blights, can be turned into community, educational, and political assets. This article is an assessment of the Boston Schoolyard Initiative (BSI) as an innovative policy effort aimed at rebuilding <b>school</b> <b>yards</b> in Boston through a citywide public-private partnership. Based on a case study of BSI, we develop a framework to understand and analyze how different school and neighborhood sectors can coalesce on behalf of the children and the neighborhood.
