500|$|... "There is {{something}} very moral about Lecter in this film," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Scott</b> in his audio commentary. [...] "The behaviour of Hannibal is never insane— didn't want to use that excuse. Is he insane? No, I think he's as sane as you or I. He just likes it." [...] Scott did say, however, [...] "In our normal terms, he's truly evil." [...] Scott also brings up the notion of absolution in reference to Lecter towards the film's end. Verger has one overriding objective in life: to capture Lecter and subject him to a slow, painful death.|$|E
500|$|According to Nielsen Media Research, [...] "The Master Plan" [...] {{was seen}} by 4.28 million {{household}} viewers, a five percent increase in viewership compared to the previous episode, [...] "Telethon". The episode received generally positive reviews, with several commentators praising the addition of Scott and Lowe to the cast, although some <b>said</b> <b>Scott</b> had more long-term potential as a character than Lowe. The episode is widely considered {{a turning point in}} the series. [...] "The Master Plan" [...] and the rest of the second season of Parks and Recreation was released on DVD in the United States on November 30, 2010, which included an extended 30-minute [...] "producer's cut" [...] of the episode.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, Scott and Charlene's son, Daniel Robinson (Tim Phillipps), was {{introduced}} to Neighbours. While Phillipps has yet to have any contact with Minogue, Daniel has been seen making several phone calls to Charlene on-screen. Phillipps also <b>said</b> <b>Scott</b> and Charlene were still together and had become [...] "really loving, supportive parents" [...] to Daniel and his sister, Madison (Sarah Ellen), who {{was introduced}} in 2016. In August 2014, a Network Ten spokeswoman told the Australian Associated Press that Minogue {{had been invited to}} return to Neighbours for the show's 30th anniversary celebrations in 2015, but she chose not to return.

500|$|In 2006, Scott {{was asked}} [...] "Who's the biggest {{pain in the}} arse you've ever worked with?", he replied: [...] "It's got to be Harrison... he'll forgive me because now I get on with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked {{together}} {{it was my first}} film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie." [...] Ford said of Scott in 2000: [...] "I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it." [...] In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: [...] "What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another." [...] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. [...] "Harrison's fully on board", <b>said</b> <b>Scott.</b>|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} clear that Foster would skip Hannibal, the {{production}} team considered several different actresses, including Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, Gillian Anderson, Hilary Swank, Ashley Judd, Helen Hunt and Julianne Moore. Hopkins asked his agent if he had any [...] "power" [...] over casting. He informed De Laurentiis that he knew Moore, with whom he had worked on Surviving Picasso, and thought her a [...] "terrific actress". Although Hopkins' agent told him he had no contractual influence on casting, Scott thought it correct to discuss who would be Hopkins' [...] "leading lady". Scott said he was [...] "really surprised to find that [...] had five of the top actresses in Hollywood wanting it." [...] Moore would eventually secure the part. Scott said his decision was swayed in favor of Moore because: [...] "She is a true chameleon. She can be a lunatic in Magnolia, a vamp in An Ideal Husband, a porn star in Boogie Nights and a romantic in The End of the Affair." [...] "Julianne Moore, once Jodie decided to pass, was always top of my list," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Scott</b> on his female lead. Moore talked about stepping into a role made famous by another actress: [...] "The new Clarice would be very different. Of course people are going to compare my interpretation with that of Jodie Foster's... but this film {{is going to be very}} different." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "There is the saying: 'How goes Nigeria, so {{goes the}} rest of Africa'. To have this {{widespread}} abuse of the democratic initiative certainly doesn't do Africa any good," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Scott</b> Baker, a professor at Champlain College in the US city of Burlington, Vermont.

2500|$|On 22 October 2012, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office {{announced}} {{the cause of}} death as [...] "multiple blunt force injuries."

2500|$|In 1989, The Today Show co-host Bryant Gumbel {{wrote an}} {{internal}} memo {{critical of the}} show's personalities, a memo that was later leaked to the media. In the memo, Gumbel <b>said</b> <b>Scott</b> [...] "holds the show hostage to his assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays and bad taste…This guy is killing us and no one's even trying to rein him in." [...] This garnered enough of a backlash {{that the next time}} they appeared on camera together Scott kissed Gumbel on the cheek to show he'd forgiven him, and also later said he hoped the whole thing would go away.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2006, Scott {{announced}} {{a remake of}} the action thriller The Warriors (1979). [...] "The original Warriors was New York in the 1970s, and everything went upwards, everything went vertically. And now I'm making it a contemporary thing and doing it in L.A., so everything is horizontal. So my vision of The Warriors is Los Angeles in 2007 and the gangs, instead of being 30, {{are going to be}} 3,000 or 5,000," [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>Scott</b> met with actual gang members for research: [...] "I've met all the heads of all the different gangs, so I've already educated myself. They all said, 'Listen dude, if you get this on we'll sign a treaty and we'll all stand on the Long Beach Bridge. There'll be 150,000 members there. It'll look like the L.A. Marathon. Scott was simultaneously developing a drama project titled Emma's War about British foreign aid worker Emma McCune. Scott said in October 2006, [...] "It's been a difficult piece to crack. We had one writer aboard who did a pass at the script and didn't get it, but we've got someone else onboard now who I'm going to make live down there and smell it, touch it, feel it. There's nothing that can compare to that kind of first-hand experience." ...|$|E

500|$|ESPN {{president}} John Skipper <b>said</b> <b>Scott's</b> flair and style, {{which he}} {{used to talk about}} the athletes he was covering, [...] "changed everything." [...] Fellow ESPN Anchor, Stan Verrett, said he was a trailblazer: [...] "not only because he was black – obviously black – but because of his style, his demeanor, his presentation. He did not shy away from {{the fact that he was}} a black man, and that allowed the rest of us who came along to just be ourselves." [...] He became a role model for African-American sports journalists.|$|R
5000|$|Luke Fraser (1736-1821) was {{a teacher}} of Sir Walter Scott at the Royal High School. Fraser <b>said</b> of <b>Scott</b> that he was [...] "a good Latin scholar, and very worthy man." ...|$|R

5000|$|Robert O'Shea, an {{accident}} reconstruction expert, {{testified that he}} estimated the Congressman's speed to be 63 or 64 miles per hour {{at the time of}} impact.

The State Highway Patrol had said in testimony that it estimated Janklow's speed as [...] "at least 70 mph". The State did not have the connector to read the data recorder. From his analysis, O'Shea <b>said</b> <b>Scott's</b> motorcycle's speed may have been as much as 65 mph; this was in contrast to the Highway Patrol's estimate of 59.|$|R

5000|$|Scott met Bill France for {{the first}} time in April 1954.

Even though France and the Raleigh promoter were friends, <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> France immediately pulled some money out of his pocket and assured Scott that NASCAR would never treat him with prejudice. [...] "He let me know my color didn't have anything to do with anything," [...] <b>Scott</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "He said, 'You're a NASCAR member, and as of now you will always be treated as a NASCAR member.'
