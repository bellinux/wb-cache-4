5|$|Due to {{the heavy}} {{forestation}} in the area, <b>sawmilling</b> was an important and early industry, starting in the 1830s. In the early 20th century, there were around 20 sawmills in Meander and the surrounding localities. Due to a move towards closer settlement—smaller land plots and resulting greater population density—demand for timber in Meander increased and new sawmills were built in Meander in the 1910s and 1920s. Some of these mills continued into the late 20th century. <b>Sawmilling</b> later declined, partly {{due to lack of}} timber. Timberworld is the only remaining sawmill, though this is not its only business. It opened in 1985 as a sawmill supplying local Australian blackwood, myrtle beach and Blackheart Sassafras, originally operating from the former Baptist Church building. From 1990 it was owned and run by Kerin Booth and Kim Booth and it relocated to the former site of the Cummings Bros sawmill. Kim Booth, leader of the Tasmanian Greens, later passed management of the company to his son, Bronte. At one time Timberworld employed 30 people. The company now focuses on supply of prefabricated homes.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{industrial}} development in Minneapolis was tied to St. Anthony Falls and the power it provided. Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis {{led the nation in}} <b>sawmilling.</b> In 1856, the mills produced 12 million board feet (28,000 m³) of lumber. That total had risen to about 91,000,000 board feet (215,000 m³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 board feet (2,270,000 m³) in 1899. During the peak of this activity, at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls. The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and smoothed the lumber; factories that built sashes, doors, and windows; and manufacturers of shingles and wooden buckets.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{economy of}} the Catlins during the 1830s and 1840s centred on whaling and sealing. The {{exploitation}} of the forests for timber started in the 1860s with {{the rapid growth of}} the city of Dunedin {{as a result of the}} goldrush of 1861–62. In the early 1870s more timber cargo was loaded at Owaka than at any other New Zealand port. Forestry and <b>sawmilling</b> declined in the late 1880s once the easily accessible timber had been removed. The extension of the railway beyond Owaka breathed new life into these industries, however, with activity peaking during the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} no records as to the designs of the early steam engines {{produced}} by the Mars Works, Evans's most famous engine design appeared around 1812. Called the Columbian Engine as a patriotic gesture, it {{would prove to be}} the most advanced and successful steam engine design created by Evans—he brought to bear his now extensive experience in designing and building high-pressure steam engines. This horizontally oriented engine allowed the crankshaft and piston rod to work closely together {{at one end of the}} machine, thus reducing the need for a heavy working beam like those required for conventional engines. The piston rod itself was kept working to a straight line while by a new type of linkage wherein two sets of pivoted bars guided the movements of the working bar. This linkage is still known as the Evans straight-line linkage, though it was superseded within a few years by more precise straight line mechanisms. The Columbian was also the culmination of the grasshopper-style of steam engine. Perfected designs like the Columbian saw a popularization of the grasshopper-style and its wide use in a range of applications. In 1813 he made the decision to introduce a condenser to the Columbian design. This significantly cut the running cost to the engine, and at this point his engines were as efficient and powerful as low-pressure Watt-Boulton designs, yet far cheaper to build and smaller in size. Within a year 27 Columbian engines were operating or under construction in applications ranging from <b>sawmilling</b> and grain milling to the manufacturing of paper, wire and wool.|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} sawn timber and wood-based {{products}} is rising steadily with new developments {{and the growing}} domestic consumption in Sri Lanka. Therefore, {{it is important to}} strike a balance between the increasing demand and consumption of forest resources. Thus, the key objective of this study was to investigate the effects of <b>sawmill</b> management and technological parameters on loss in conversion from logs to sawn timber and to compare the <b>sawmill</b> efficiency in private <b>sawmills</b> with the state timber corporation <b>sawmill.</b> <b>Sawmill</b> management and technological parameters were studied in 21 private <b>sawmills</b> and State Timber Corporation <b>sawmill</b> in Kaldemulla to evaluate the effects on loss in conversion. The selected <b>sawmills</b> represent all types available in Sri Lanka, i. e., frame saw, circular saw and band saw mills. Based on the results, mean percentage loss in conversion of teak and mahogany timber for all <b>sawmills</b> (private and State Timber Corporation) in Moratuwa found to be 53. 10 %. Significant differences were observed in loss in conversion values between the three categories of private <b>sawmills</b> as well as within <b>sawmills</b> of the same category. It was shown that loss in conversion values also varied with <b>sawmill</b> management and technological parameters such as type of machinery employed, sharpening frequency and sawyer’s experience, saw setting, availability of log alignment equipment and saw guards, oversizing and sawn timber sizes...|$|R
25|$|Early Palmerston North {{relied on}} public works and <b>sawmilling.</b> The west coast railway {{was built in}} 1886, linking the town to Wellington, and Palmerston North benefited from a booming {{pastoral}} farming industry.

25|$|A {{previous}} settlement, Port Pegasus, once boasted several {{stores and}} a post office, and was {{located on the}} southern coast of the island.

Another site of former settlement is at Port William, a four-hour walk around the north coast from Oban, where immigrants from the Shetland Islands settled in the early 1870s. This was unsuccessful, and the settlers left within one to two years, most for <b>sawmilling</b> villages elsewhere on the island.|$|E
25|$|The {{loss of the}} orange's {{competitiveness}} in the Azores (due to falling {{prices in}} England) and the concordant appearance of citrus diseases, forced {{the end of the}} lucrative business, causing most orchards to begin cultivating other fruits, <b>sawmilling</b> or reverting to the production of low-grade vineyards for public consumption. By the middle of the 19th century, the orange business had almost completely disappeared. The appearance of a chestnut industry then influenced the economy of Terra Chã, with the cultivation of extensive pasturelands with Viana Chestnut, which transformed itself into an emblem of the region, even to this day.|$|E
