40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{characteristics}} of psychotic patients with <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in a Chinese rural community. Method: An epidemiological investigation of psychotic patients with <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> among 123 572 population (over 15 years of age) was conducted in Xinjin County, Chengdu. Results: The rate of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> {{was found to be}} 8. 17 % among all the psychotic patients (906 cases). Patients with affective psychosis showed a significantly higher rate of suicidal attempts (15. 3 %) than those with schizophrenia (7. 5 %) (P < 0. 005). <b>Suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> were significantly associated with depression and hopelessness in both schizophrenia and affective psychosis (P < 0. 001). Patients with <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> were younger and had an earlier age of onset than those without <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> (P < 0. 05). Patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders were the major patients with <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts.</b> Conclusion: The rate of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in psychotic patients may be largely influenced by the illness itself.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} the suicidal behaviour and related measures of adolescents {{in high school}} in Germany (N= 318) and South Africa (N= 299). Participants completed a series of self-report measures of the SPS (Suicide Probability Scale), PSS-Fa (Perceived Social Support From Family Scale), PSS-Fr (Perceived Social Support From Friends Scale), SIB (Scale Of Interpersonal Behaviour) and a number of demographic questions. Analyses were conducted using content analysis, correlation coefficients and logistic regression to determine variables related to previous <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts,</b> stepwise multiple regression to account for variables predicting currents suicidal risk; and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to examine differences among the groups and among suicide attempters and non-attempters. 36 German (11. 3 %) and 48 South African (16. 1 %) adolescents reported that they had made previous <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts.</b> German adolescents reported 45 (14. 2 %) <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in the family and 82 (25. 8 %) <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> by friends. South African adolescents reported 43 (14. 4 %) <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in the family and 92 (30. 7 %) <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> by friends. The following variables were associated with previous <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in the German sample: <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> by friends, a life-threatening event, previous psychiatric contact, the death of a friend, low perceived family support, female gender, <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> in the family, suicide of a friend, and low perceived friend support. The following variables were associated with previous <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in the South African sample: low perceived family support, death of a friend, <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> by friends, female gender, a life-threatening event, previous psychiatric contact, suicide of friends, and <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> in the family. The following variables for the German sample were found to be significant predictors of current suicidal risk: low perceived family and friend support, previous <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts,</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in the family, a life-threatening event, <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> of friends, <b>suicide</b> of friends, female gender, and previous psychiatric contact. The following variables for the South African sample were found to be significant predictors of current suicidal risk: previous <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts,</b> low perceived family and friend support, death of a friend, a life-threatening event, previous psychiatric contact, <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in the family, suicide of friends, and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> of friends.

However, alcohol has not been consistently implicated. We {{examined the relationship between}} substance use disorders and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in schizophrenia. Methods: We recruited a schizophrenia sample in Australia (n = 821) for genetic analyses. We analysed demographic and clinical variables, including substance use disorders, and their relationship to <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> using generalised equation modelling. Results: A significant association was identified between lifetime alcohol abuse/dependence and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> (OR = 1. 66; 95 % CI, 1. 23 to 2. 24; p= 0. 001) after adjustment for potential confounders, but not between cannabis abuse/dependence and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts,</b> nor between other illicit drug abuse/dependence and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts.</b> Polysubstance abuse/dependence was also not implicated. Conclusions: These results suggest that the presence of alcohol abuse/dependence may be a risk factor for <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in individuals with schizophrenia, independent of comorbid substance abuse/dependence...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Self-control/self-regulation has {{received}} increased attention in health research. <b>Suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> index severe dysregulation in emotional, behavioral, and/or physiological domains. The current study tested whether own and/or others' <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> {{during the early}} life course predicted cardiovascular risk by young adulthood and whether developmental timing of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts,</b> sex of the person, and source of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> exposure modified these associations. METHOD: Data came from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). At each assessment during Waves I-IV (covering approximately ages 12 - 32 years), participants reported whether they and/or a friend/family member had <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide.</b> At Wave IV, trained interviewers assessed participants' obesity and hypertension and collected bloodspots from which high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was assayed. Sample sizes in the present analyses ranged from n = 7, 884 to n = 8, 474. RESULTS: Exposure to own and others' <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> during adolescence was relatively common. In males, <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> during adolescence (âˆ¼age 15 years) were associated with hypertension and elevated inflammation more than 1 decade later. Associations among <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> by others and cardiovascular risk also emerged. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to one's own or others' severe dysregulation {{in the form of}} <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> during the early life course signals risk for cardiovascular health problems by the late twenties.

Method: Baseline and 4 -year follow-up data were used from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology study, a prospective, longitudinal community study of adolescents and young adults. Results are based on 933 adolescents who completed follow-up and for whom direct diagnostic information for the biological mother was available. Suicidal ideation and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> were assessed in adolescents and mothers with the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: Compared to offspring of mothers without suicidality, offspring of mothers reporting <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> showed a remarkably higher risk for suicidal thoughts and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> and a tendency toward <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> at an earlier age. Associations were comparable {{for male and female}} offspring. Transmission of maternal suicidality was roughly stable with control for maternal comorbid psychopathology. Conclusions: The offspring of mothers with <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> are at a markedly increased risk for suicidality themselves and tend to manifest <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> earlier than offspring of mothers without suicidality.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether the information from multiple clinical scales has classification power for identifying actual <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts.</b> Patients with depression and anxiety disorders (N[*]=[*] 573) were included, and each participant completed 31 self-report psychiatric scales and questionnaires about their history of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts.</b> We then trained an artificial neural network classifier with 41 variables (31 psychiatric scales and 10 sociodemographic elements) and ranked the contribution of each variable for the classification of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts.</b> To evaluate the clinical applicability of our model, we measured classification performance with top-ranked predictors. Our model had an overall accuracy of 93. 7 % in 1 -month, 90. 8 % in 1 -year, and 87. 4 % in lifetime <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> detection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was the highest for 1 -month <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> detection (0. 93), followed by lifetime (0. 89), and 1 -year detection (0. 87). Among all variables, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire had the highest contribution, and the positive and negative characteristics of the scales similarly contributed to classification performance. Performance on <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> classification was largely maintained when we only used the top five ranked variables for training (AUROC; 1 -month, 0. 75, 1 -year, 0. 85, lifetime <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> detection, 0. 87).

40|$|Introduction: Alcohol {{dependence}} is {{an important}} risk factor for suicidal behaviours. Current data show that between 14 and 43 % of alcohol-dependent patients <b>attempt</b> <b>suicide.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyse the risk factors for <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> among patients treated for alcohol dependence. Methods: Medical data of 994 patients hospitalised in Alcohol Detoxification and Rehabilitation Units of Nowowiejski Hospital in Warsaw were analysed. The relationships between variables that are thought to be related to the prevalence of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in this population were evaluated. The relevant psycho-social and demographic data as well as information on alcohol use and treatment history were included. Results: 292 (29 %) patients confirmed <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> in the past. Among the variables included in the logistic regression model, previous episodes of delirium tremens, earlier onset of alcohol dependence, comorbidity of somatic disorders, and unemployment proved to be significant risk factors for previous <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts.</b> Discussion: The higher prevalence of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> among patients with previous episodes of delirium tremens and earlier onset of alcohol dependence confirms the relationship between the severity of alcohol dependence and <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts.</b> The effect of unemployment and comorbidity of somatic disorders on incidence of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> might presumably be mediated by co-occurring pain, depression, and poorer social functioning. Conclusions: Earlier onset of alcohol dependence and previous episodes of delirium tremens are the risk factors of <b>suicide</b> <b>attempts</b> attributable to the severity of alcohol dependence. The other risk factors (unemployment and somatic disorders) are nonspecific to alcohol dependence, and were previously found to increase the risk in various psychiatric populations...|$|R
