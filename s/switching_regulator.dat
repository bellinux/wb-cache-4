40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discusses}} {{the characteristics of}} powerfactor-correction (PFC) <b>switching</b> <b>regulators</b> of non-cascading structures in terms of efficiency, input current harmonic distortion, and load transient response. The discussion begins with simplified power flow diagrams of the non-cascading PFC <b>switching</b> <b>regulators</b> and describes their essential features for achieving power factor correction and tight voltage regulation. Based on these diagrams, the various configurations of <b>switching</b> <b>regulators</b> can be classified into three categories, each offering a different possibility of performance tradeoffs.

40|$|It is {{generally}} known that DC-DC <b>switching</b> <b>regulators</b> are highly nonlinear systems which {{are subjected to}} significant variation in the line voltage and load, uncertainty in the circuit parameters and perturbations in switching times. To assure stable operation and acceptable performance despite the disturbances and inevitable uncertainty associated with such systems, highly accurate regulation schemes must be devised. Indeed the routine application of most classical compensation techniques are severely limited when tight regulation measures have to be achieved. These considerations in conjunction with increasing demand for high quality DC-DC <b>switching</b> <b>regulators</b> has necessitated more systematic and precise methodologies in modeling and control design for such systems. The {{first step in the}} present thesis is to introduce various techniques for modeling <b>switching</b> <b>regulators</b> specifically models which account for parametric uncertainty and the nonlinear switching effects are intended. Using the models obtained in this fashion, the next step will be to apply nonlinear (input-output feedback linearization) and robust control (Mu-synthesis, Hinf and Kharitonov theorems) techniques to obtain controllers which guarantee satisfactory operation of the system under realistic operating conditions. The resulting controllers are shown to minimize the effect of disturbances and achieve acceptable regulation. The potential superiorities of these methods over classical methodologies are also discussed. At least, two approaches based on Mu-analysis and Kharitonov’s theorem are proposed for the analysis of <b>switching</b> <b>regulators.</b> Applications to practical circuits with buck and cuk converters are illustrated as case studies...|$|R
50|$|Most DC-to-DC {{converters}} {{are designed}} to move power in only one direction, from dedicated input to output. However, all <b>switching</b> <b>regulator</b> topologies can be made bidirectional and able to move power in either direction by replacing all diodes with independently controlled active rectification. A bidirectional converter is useful, for example, in applications requiring regenerative braking of vehicles, where power is supplied to the wheels while driving, but supplied by the wheels when braking.|$|E
50|$|The DC-DC {{converters}} {{under study}} {{in this work}} had a similar form as a DC chopper or <b>switching</b> <b>regulator.</b> A bipolar transistor switches current flowing into an L-C network of an inductor and capacitor. To reduce switching losses, the transistor is always turned either fully off or fully on. Control of this transistor is derived from a control circuit that supplies a series of pulses. In the circuits studied here, the pulses are all of equal length. The overall ON time or mark/space ratio of the pulse train (and thus the output power delivered) is controlled by varying the interval between pulses. Closely spaced pulses increase output. This control signal is derived by use of an ASDTIC circuit.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} twenty-first century, {{switched-mode}} power supplies (SMPSs) became almost ubiquitous for this purpose. Mains voltage is rectified to a high direct voltage driving a switching circuit, which contains a transformer operating at a high frequency and outputs direct current at the desired voltage. The high-frequency ripple is more easily filtered out than mains-frequency. The high frequency allows the transformer to be small, which reduces its losses; and the <b>switching</b> <b>regulator</b> can be much more efficient than a linear regulator. The result {{is a much more}} efficient, smaller, and lighter device. Safety is ensured, as in the older linear circuit, because there is still a transformer which electrically isolates the output from the mains.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the application of}} artificial neural networks in control design of DC-DC <b>switching</b> <b>regulators.</b> These regulators are highly nonlinear and time variable. Any small change in operating point as well as changes in line voltage and load causes larger changes in dynamic model, so that the system performance and even stability can be affected. Flexibility of neural networks (NN) during learning process provides a suitable tool for controlling of complex nonlinear systems such as <b>switching</b> <b>regulators.</b> The present paper attempts to show this claim by comparing the performance of closed loop system (using NN-based controller) with the classical design methods. The results have been supplemented by nonlinear simulations...|$|R

50|$|<b>Switching</b> <b>regulators</b> {{are used}} as {{replacements}} for linear regulators when higher efficiency, smaller size or lighter weight are required.
