5|$|In graph algorithms, {{the widest}} path {{problem is the}} problem of finding a path between two {{designated}} vertices in a weighted graph, maximizing the weight of the minimum-weight edge in the path. The widest path problem is also known as the bottleneck <b>shortest</b> path problem or the maximum capacity path problem. It is possible to adapt most <b>shortest</b> path algorithms to compute widest paths, by modifying them to use the bottleneck distance instead of path length. However, in many cases even faster algorithms are possible.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scholarly}} reception {{has considered}} The <b>Shortest</b> Way in negative terms, as a failed satire, or as using irony so slight {{as to be}} undetectable. Such a conclusion cites the contemporary reaction to the work, how it failed to deliver its objectives and also caused its author such problems. If critics have offered praise, it {{is the extent to}} which Defoe managed to impersonate the style of his subjects, so as to be indistinguishable from them. The <b>Shortest</b> Way is frequently contrasted with another work of irony in the eighteenth century, which is considered to have succeeded in its use of the device, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E
5|$|Some {{algorithms}} become simpler {{when used}} on DAGs instead of general graphs, {{based on the}} principle of topological ordering. For example, it is possible to find <b>shortest</b> paths and longest paths from a given starting vertex in DAGs in linear time by processing the vertices in a topological order, and calculating the path length for each vertex to be the minimum or maximum length obtained via any of its incoming edges. In contrast, for arbitrary graphs the <b>shortest</b> path may require slower algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman–Ford algorithm, and longest paths in arbitrary graphs are NP-hard to find.|$|E
