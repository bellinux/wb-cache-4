40|$|If {{a pair of}} MEMS {{resonators}} are electrostatically coupled together, {{the vibration}} amplitude ratios at the resonant frequencies of the resulting coupled system are sensitive to stiffness perturbation. An imbalance between the two resonators causes the confinement of vibration energy when the system is resonating, an effect known as mode-localization. The degree of localization can be determined by extracting the amplitude ratio of the resonators through capacitive transduction. In this paper, we have fabricated MEMS devices, using a dicing-free <b>silicon-on-insulator</b> <b>process,</b> consisting of pairs of closely spaced microresonators. Each resonator consists of a clamped-clamped beam with a wider section in the middle, which is {{the location of the}} electrostatic coupling, instituted through the DC biasing of the resonators. Several devices have been fabricated, with the length of the anchor beams being varied, which influences the frequency of resonance. Stiffness imbalance between the resonators has been introduced through electrostatic spring softening, with the sensitivity of the amplitude ratio of the resonant mode shape being greater for the higher frequency, shorter anchor devices.

An in-plane movable structure {{with a single}} layer is made using a simple standard <b>silicon-on-insulator</b> <b>process,</b> which greatly reduces the micro-fabrication complexity and cost compared with the previously reported multi-contact switches with out-of-plane movable structures. The SPST switch achieves a uniform current distribution through each contact, thereby increasing the power handling capability of the switch. The SP 3 T switch is a derivative of the SPST switch with separate individual actuations. The experimental results demonstrate that the fabricated switches have superior RF performances: insertion losses are - 0. 9 and - 1. 3 dB at 6 GHz for SPST and SP 3 T switches, respectively, whereas isolations are better than - 29 and - 37 dB from dc to 6 GHz for SPST and SP 3 T switches, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{fundamental}} sensitivity of oscillator-based reactance sensors, which {{are widely used}} in numerous types of biomedical sensing applications. We first show that the intrinsic sensitivity {{is limited by the}} 1 /ƒ^ 3 phase noise of the sensing oscillators. To achieve sensor detection sensitivity below this limit, a correlated double counting (CDC) noise suppression scheme is proposed to cancel the correlated 1 /ƒ^ 3 phase noise in differential frequency detections. The suppression effect of the CDC scheme is thoroughly modeled. Moreover, the CDC scheme is extended to a high-order configuration, called the Interleaving-N CDC, to further improve the frequency resolution. In addition, we show that the weighting sequence on the Interleaving-N CDC data can be optimized as a digital noise filter to maximize the noise suppression. Given a sensing oscillator with any phase-noise profile, a general weighting optimization method is proposed based on the minimum variance distortion less response. As an example, an oscillator-based inductive magnetic sensor array in a 45 -nm CMOS <b>silicon-on-insulator</b> <b>process</b> is implemented with the proposed CDC scheme.

Using a 200 Vp-p signal, the electrostatic comb-drive was actuated to generate a torsional resonant mode of the 0. 7 mm-diameter silicon micromirror. A maximum full optical scan angle of 39 ° was measured at a frequency of 8. 82 kHz. A 500 nm thick gold coating was deposited on the silicon micromirror surface resulting in a measured reflectivity of 87 % at 1064 nm, therefore enabling intra-cavity laser use.

40|$|This thesis work {{provides}} {{an insight into}} the design of Force-amplifying Compliant Mechanisms (FaCMs) that are integrated with micromachined resonant accelerometers to increase their sensitivity. An FaCM, by mechanically amplifying the inertial force, enhances the shift in the resonance frequency of the beams used for sensing the acceleration whose effect causes an axial force on the beams. An extensive study on different configurations of resonators namely, single beam resonator, single-ended tuning fork (SETF), and double-ended tuning fork (DETF), is carried out to gain insights about their resonant behavior. The influence of the boundary conditions on the sensor’s sensitivity emerged from the study. We found that not only the force-amplification factor but also the multi-axial stiffness of the FaCM and proof-mass influence the resonance frequency of the resonator {{as well as the}} bandwidth of the modified sensor for certain configurations but not all. Thus, four lumped parameters were identified to quantify the effectiveness of an FaCM. These parameters determine the boundary condition of the sensing beams and also the forces and the moment transmitted to them. Also presented in this work is a computationally efficient model, called the Lumped Parameter Model (LPM) for evaluation of the sensitivity. An analytical expression for the frequency-shift of the sensing resonator beams is obtained by considering the FaCM stiffness parameters as well as the lumped stiffness of the suspension of the inertial mass. Various FaCMs are evaluated and compared to understand how the four lumped parameters influence the sensor’s sensitivity. The FaCMs are synthesized using topology optimization to maximize the net amplification factor with the volume constraint. One of the FaCMs outperforms the lever by a factor of six.

40|$|The {{development}} and fabrication of silicon-based phononic band gap crystals {{has been gaining}} interest since phononic band gap crystals have implications in fundamental science and display the potential for application in engineering by providing a relatively new platform for the realization of sensors and signal processing elements. The seminal study of phononic band gap phenomenon for classical elastic wave localization in structures with periodicity in two- or three-physical dimensions occurred in the early 1990 ’s. Micro-integration of silicon devices that leverage this phenomenon followed from the mid- 2000 ’s until the present. The reported micro-integration relies on exotic piezoelectric transduction, phononic band gap crystals that are etched into semi-infinite or finite-thickness slabs which support surface or slab waves, phononic band gap crystals of numerous lattice constants in dimension and phononic band gap crystal truncation by homogeneous mediums or piezoelectric transducers. The thesis reports, {{to the best of}} the author's knowledge, for the first time, the theory, design methodology and experiment of an electrostatically actuated silicon-plate phononic band gap quasi-crystal architecture, which may serve as a platform {{for the development of a}} new generation of silicon-integrated sensors, signal processing elements and improved mechanical systems. Electrostatic actuation mitigates the utilization of piezoelectric transducers and provides action at a distance type forces so that the phononic band gap quasi-crystal edges may be free standing for potentially reduced anchor and substrate mode loss and improved energy confinement compared with traditional surface and slab wave phononic band gap crystals.
