Newspaper headlines made statements such as [...] "I <b>Saw</b> <b>Slit</b> Throats", implying that prisoners had cut the hostages' throats when the armed raid occurred. These reports {{set the stage for}} reprisals by troopers and prison officers. Inmates were made to strip and crawl through the mud and then some were made to run naked between lines of enraged officers, who beat the inmates. Several days after the riot's end, prison doctors reported evidence of more beatings. The Special Commission found that state officials failed to quickly refute those rumors and false reports.|$|R
5|$|Flying at Benalla was {{hampered}} by bad weather, and the runway was unusable from September to November 1941, necessitating the detachment of over 250 personnel to Essendon, home of No.3 EFTS, {{to continue their}} training. In October 1941, six airmen of No.11 EFTS were court-martialled for mutiny. Their main grievance was having to undertake guard duty at night and attend parades at 7:15am {{in addition to their}} regular ground support work. One of the men was found guilty of incitement and the other five for failing to report their knowledge of the matter to the commanding officer. The former was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and the others to between five and six months detention; all were discharged from the Air Force. On 11December 1941, one of the school's Tiger Moths made a crash landing in a field and struck four people on the ground, killing two and injuring the others; the two pilots were uninjured.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringTension or {{compression}} fracture behavior {{studies are}} normally initiated with open hole tension or compression tests {{performed at the}} laminate level. While these test data serve as an excellent starting point in residual strength studies in small notch sizes, the need to evaluate and verify the residual strength for larger structures and at larger notch sizes region is still there. An experimental study was performed with the focus on large notch sizes of circular hole and narrow slit flaw configurations on laminates fabricated with a carbon/epoxy oven-cure capable prepreg material system. The current {{part of the study}} focused on uniaxial tension loading with a constant width and height to flaw dimension ratio. Experimental test data were then combined with lamina and laminate level data for residual strength curves generation and the curves were validated against Whitney-Nuismer and Mar-Lin fracture mechanics models. The effects of flaw sizes and the flaw type towards the residual strength capability of a laminate turn out to be substantial as the notch size gets larger than one inch. Test results showed that a narrow <b>slit</b> or <b>saw</b> cut damage is far more critical than a circular hole cut-out. The notch sensitivity order of a saw cut flaw is also roughly three times more than that of a circular hole. Analytical studies were also performed to evaluate several finite element method variable effects on residual strength prediction and to discover the best practice in stress analyses of notched composite laminates. Point Stress failure criterion was used in the analyses and predicted failure loads were compared to the experimental data. Good agreements and correlations were found between the analytical predictions and the experimental data. It can be concluded that the residual strength of a notched laminated composite can be reasonably predicted from finite element analyses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this study, eight {{techniques}} including coping saw, metal <b>slitting</b> <b>saw,</b> razor blade, cubic {{boron nitride}} (CBN) disc, scoring, die-cutting and guillotining, diamond disc, and laser cutting methods {{were used to}} produce pre-cracked fracture toughness (Kc) test specimens made of poly(methyl methacrylate) /graft-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene blends. The influences of notch shape (radial, rectangular, or angular-shaped and variety of thicknesses), pre-cracking method, chip removing or non-chip removing, and the contact or non-contact methods on the results obtained in fracture toughness tests were investigated. The results were analyzed by two methods, quantitatively and qualitatively, by comparing the obtained Kc results and studying the SEM and optical microscopy images, respectively. The {{results indicated that the}} different conditions of a produced pre-crack including; geometry of pre-crack due to geometry of tools, residual stress due to pre-crack creation, heat affected zone, damage of crack tip, and producing crazing around the crack tip could affect the fracture toughness. The maximum difference resulted from different pre-cracking methods was equal to 0. 24 MPa. m 0. 5 and the lowest value of fracture toughness Kc, 2. 53 MPa. m 0. 5, belonged to the scoring method but the highest value, 2. 77 MPa. m 0. 5, belonged to the metal <b>slitting</b> <b>saw</b> method. Also, the results indicated that the effects of notching on toughness of RT-PMMA had a low notch sensitivity and the differences between minimum and maximum Kc values was found about 9 %...|$|E
40|$|Carbon fiber {{composites}} {{are continually}} seeing increased use in aerospace applications. It {{is necessary to}} understand their failure modes in order to properly design and perform analysis on structures constructed primarily from them. This thesis studies woven carbon fiber composites with and without double-edge notches {{in a series of}} static and fatigue tests performed on an Instron 8801 servo-hydraulic testing system. Specimens were constructed of Advanced Composites Group product # LTM 45 EL woven carbon fiber pre-preg/epoxy and were cut to approximately 9 -inch in length and 1 -inch in width. Notches were cut into some of the specimens using a <b>slitting</b> <b>saw</b> blade of 0. 006 -in. thickness. Ultimate strength, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for specimens were determined to be 119, 418 psi, 7, 149, 000 psi and 0. 05, respeictively. Fracture stress for specimens with notch depths of 0. 10, 0. 15, 0. 20, 0. 25, 0. 30 and 0. 35 was determined to be 93, 481 psi, 88, 193 psi, 86, 968 psi, 81, 112 psi, 84, 197 psi and 81, 955 psi, respectively. The results from these tests showed that the specimens followed Griffith’s model for brittle failure. Average number of cycles to failure was determined to be 6, 600, 37, 200, 94, 300 and 293, 400 for fatigue tests with maximum stresses of 72. 5 %, 75 %, 77. 5 % and 80 % of the ultimate strength. Fatigue tests performed on notched specimens produced data that was too scattered from which to draw a statistically significant result. Numerical modeling in Abacus showed comparable results to experimental tests for stress and strain...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Adie’s (tonic) pupil is a neuro-ophthalmological {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} a tonically dilated pupil, which is unresponsive to light. It is caused by damage to postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic innervation of the eye, usually by a viral or bacterial infection. Adie’s syndrome includes diminished deep tendon reflexes. Outline of Cases. We report data of a 59 -year-old female with unequal pupil sizes. She complained of blurred vision and headache mainly while reading. She had a 35 -year history of hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis. On exam, left pupil was mydriatic {{and there was no}} response to light and at <b>slit</b> lamp we <b>saw</b> segments of the sphincter constrict. We performed 0. 125 % pilocarpine test and there was a remarkable reduction of size in the left pupil. The second case is a 55 -year-old female who was referred to the University Eye Clinic because of a headache and mydriatic left pupil. She had diabetes mellitus type 2, as well as hepatitis A virus 20 years earlier. On exam, the left pupil was mydriatic, with no response to light. Test with diluted pilocarpine was positive. Neurological examinations revealed no abnormality in either case so we excluded Adie’s syndrome. Conclusion. Adie’s tonic pupil is benign neuro-ophthalmological disorder of unknown etiology. Most patients commonly present no symptoms and anisocoria is noticed accidentally. Although the etiology is unknown, there are some conditions that cause tonic pupil. It may {{be a part of a}} syndrome in which tonic pupil is associated with absent deep tendon reflexes...|$|R
