5|$|In the 1970s, while Los Angeles {{was known}} for locking and Fresno {{was known for}} popping, several other cities in Northern California had their own local funk styles. Sacramento was known for a style called sac-ing, San Jose for dime stopping, and Oakland for snake hitting. The San Francisco crew Granny and Robotroid {{incorporated}} stepping moves and JROTC rifle drill movements in their dancing to make a unique funk style called Fillmore <b>strutting.</b> This dance was named after the Fillmore district in San Francisco where Granny and Robotroid were from. Granny and Robotroid performed on the Gong Show in 1976. Although <b>strutting</b> had exposure on national television, it (and {{the rest of the}} localized funk styles) faded and never became mainstream.|$|E
5|$|Tatiana Thumbtzen, who {{appeared}} in the short film for The Way You Make Me Feel, joined Jackson in some concerts of his Bad World Tour, and performed the song with him, <b>strutting</b> across the stage whilst he pursued her. However, she was fired from the tour by Jackson's manager after an incident {{during one of the}} performances in which she approached Jackson and kissed him onstage.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the air with outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, <b>strutting</b> around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes {{a whole group of}} about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E

50|$|A <b>strut</b> bar, <b>strut</b> brace, or <b>strut</b> tower brace (STB) is an {{automotive}} suspension accessory usually used {{in conjunction}} with MacPherson <b>struts</b> on monocoque or unibody chassis to provide extra stiffness between the <b>strut</b> towers.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of wind tunnel tests made to determine the interference drag arising from various arrangements of streamline <b>struts</b> and round <b>struts,</b> or cylinders. Determinations were made of the interference drag of <b>struts</b> spaced side by side, <b>struts</b> in tandem, tandem <b>struts</b> encased in a single fairing, a <b>strut</b> intersecting a plane, and <b>struts</b> intersecting to form a v. Three sizes of <b>struts</b> were used for most of the tests. These tests show that the interference drag arising from <b>struts</b> in close proximity may be of considerable magnitude, in some instances amounting to more than the drag of the <b>struts</b> themselves...|$|R

25|$|Breeding {{takes place}} on {{isolated}} islands: over 25,000 pairs have been recorded in a single colony {{off the coast of}} British Columbia. The nest is usually a simple burrow dug with the bill and feet, but sometimes a crevice between rocks is used instead. It is well-lined with vegetation and feathers. Courtship occurs through skypointing, <b>strutting,</b> and billing. A single egg is laid, usually in June, and incubated by both parents for about 45 days. Fledglings leave the nest at between 40 and 55 days.|$|E
50|$|Jury <b>struts</b> come in many configurations. On monoplanes {{with one}} main <b>strut,</b> {{there may be}} just a single jury <b>strut</b> {{connecting}} the main <b>strut</b> to an intermediate point on the wing.

25|$|The {{counterpart}} to the slave was the dandy, a common {{character in the}} afterpiece. He was a northern urban black man trying to live above his station by mimicking white, upper-class speech and dress—usually to no good effect. Dandy characters often went by Zip Coon, after the song popularized by George Washington Dixon, although others had pretentious names like Count Julius Caesar Mars Napoleon Sinclair Brown. Their clothing was a ludicrous parody of upper-class dress: coats with tails and padded shoulders, white gloves, monocles, fake mustaches, and gaudy watch chains. They spent their time primping and preening, going to parties, dancing and <b>strutting,</b> and wooing women.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} had {{a square}} cross-section, parallel {{in the passenger}} cabin area and narrowing towards the tail. The passenger compartment had six rectangular windows on each side and the crew had an enclosed cabin forward of the wings. Each wing was braced to the lower fuselage with a parallel pair of struts; the forward of these was used to carry a main undercarriage leg {{with the help of}} further robust <b>strutting.</b> The two and three-engined Viastras had their outer engines mounted just below the wings. The outer engines were enclosed by a narrow chord Townend ring, but the central engines of the tri-motored and single-engined Viastras were uncowled.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} season is December to September but {{varies according to}} region and usually begins with the first rains. Peak breeding in northern India is in June and is earlier in Southern India. In Sri Lanka it breeds in March to June and August to September. Males sing during this season and display by lowering and spreading their tail feathers and <b>strutting</b> around the female, displaying their sides and fluffing their undertail coverts. The songs of males have variants for inviting mates and for deterring other males. Males will drive away other males and patrol their territory by flying with slow wing-beats from perch to perch. They may sometimes peck at their reflections. An aggressive display involves fluffing up the feathers and holding the bill high.|$|E
25|$|He {{pioneered the}} use of <b>struts</b> as a rear {{suspension}} device. Even today, <b>struts</b> used {{in the rear of}} a vehicle are known as Chapman <b>struts,</b> while virtually identical suspension <b>struts</b> for the front are known as MacPherson <b>struts</b> that were invented 10 years earlier in 1949.|$|R
40|$|Open cell foams {{are formed}} by an {{interconnected}} network of <b>struts</b> whose thickness varies locally. These variations {{are known to}} have an impact on the elastic and thermal properties of the foam. In this paper we quantify the local <b>strut</b> thickness by means of micro computed tomography (µCT) imaging. We develop a fully automatic algorithm to extract the foam’s skeleton from a binary image and its topological decomposition into vertices and <b>struts.</b> This allows to estimate the thickness of individual <b>strut</b> segments by the Euclidean distance transform, where an appropriate correction for <b>struts</b> with nonspherical cross-sectional shape is applied. Conflating these estimates based on the <b>strut</b> lengths results in a <b>strut</b> thickness profile for the entire foam. Based on this profile we give a statistical justification that a <b>strut</b> thickness model should depend on the <b>strut</b> length. Furthermore, the investigation of polynomial models for the <b>strut</b> thickness profile by means of regression analysis leads to a new three-parameter <b>strut</b> thickness model...|$|R
50|$|Consider a cube of side length 2d, {{centered}} at the origin. Place a <b>strut</b> {{of length}} 2l {{in the plane}} of each cube face, such that each <b>strut</b> is parallel to one edge of the face and is centered on the face. Moreover, each <b>strut</b> should be parallel to the <b>strut</b> on the opposite face of the cube, but orthogonal to all other <b>struts.</b> If the Cartesian coordinates of one <b>strut</b> are (0,d,l) and (0,d,-l), those of its parallel <b>strut</b> will be, respectively, (0,-d,-l) and (0,-d,l). The coordinates of the other <b>strut</b> ends (vertices) are obtained by permuting the coordinates, e.g., (0,d,l)→(d,l,0)→(l,0,d) (rotational symmetry in the main diagonal of the cube).|$|R

50|$|A <b>strut</b> bar is {{designed}} to reduce this <b>strut</b> tower flex by tying the two <b>strut</b> towers together. This transmits the load off each <b>strut</b> tower during cornering which ties the two towers together and reduces chassis flex. To accomplish this effectively (especially on MacPherson <b>strut</b> suspensions), the bar must be rigid throughout its length.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A twin-gas-chamber {{hydropneumatic}} suspension <b>strut</b> concept is proposed to achieve enhanced bounce and pitch ride, and pitch attitude control. The response char-acteristics of the twin-gas-chamber <b>strut</b> suspension are {{compared with those}} of a single-gas-chamber <b>strut</b> suspension to demonstrate not only superior performance potentials but also the added design flexibility offered by the twin-gas-chamber <b>struts.</b> The relative responses of both <b>strut</b> suspensions are evaluated through analysis of a pitch plane vehicle model, subject to straight-line braking inputs and excitations arising from randomly distributed road elevations. A generalized formulation for the <b>strut</b> forces is presented to derive the bounce and pitch rates of the proposed <b>strut</b> suspensions. The results reveal that the twin-gas-chamber <b>strut</b> suspension exhibits a slightly lower pitch stiffness in the vicinity of design ride height, but progressively hardening effects with increasing pitch deflections. Moreover, the twin-gas-chamber <b>strut</b> suspension exhibits considerably fewer hardening–softening effects in suspension rate compared with the suspension involving the single-gas-chamber <b>struts.</b> The results attained from the parametric studies are also discussed to demonstrate superior design flexibility of the twin-gas-chamber <b>struts</b> for tuning of the suspension bounce and pitc...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the phenomenon of buckling using simple <b>struts.</b> These results were then compared with the theoretical predictions. Three steel <b>struts</b> of different length {{were used in the}} experiment; one of them had fix/pinned-end all the others had pin/pin-end joint. The applied load was placed at different eccentricities for each <b>strut.</b> Six aluminium pin-end <b>struts</b> of varying length were also tested. The measured critical load for each <b>strut</b> was compared against the corresponding Euler and Southwell predictions. For a steel <b>strut,</b> it would be expected that buckling would be symmetrical for left and right eccentricities. However, {{this was not the case}} due to imperfections in the <b>struts.</b> The <b>struts</b> buckled with half sine-wave and if one end of the <b>strut</b> was fixed the effective length was reduced and the critical load was increased. In the case of the aluminium <b>struts,</b> due to plastic behaviour in the deformation it was much harder to find the critical load. For steel <b>struts</b> both Euler and Southwell predictions were close to initial estimates of critical load...|$|R
500|$|Breeding begins {{around the}} third or fourth year. Arctic terns mate for life and, in most cases, return to the same colony each year. Courtship is elaborate, {{especially}} in birds nesting for the first time. Courtship begins with a so-called [...] "high flight", where a female will chase the male to a high altitude and then slowly descend. This display is followed by [...] "fish flights", where the male will offer fish to the female. Courtship on the ground involves <b>strutting</b> with a raised tail and lowered wings. After this, both birds will usually fly and circle each other.|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} efficiency of carbon-epoxy tapered <b>struts</b> is considered through trade studies, detailed analysis, manufacturing and experimentation. Since {{some of the}} lunar lander <b>struts</b> are more highly loaded than <b>struts</b> used in applications such as satellites and telescopes, {{the primary focus of}} the effort is on these highly loaded <b>struts.</b> Lunar lander requirements include that the <b>strut</b> has to be tapered on both ends, complicating the design and limiting the manufacturing process. Optimal stacking sequences, geometries, and materials are determined and the sensitivity of the <b>strut</b> weight to each parameter is evaluated. The trade study results indicate that the most efficient carbon-epoxy <b>struts</b> are 30 percent lighter than the most efficient aluminum-lithium <b>struts.</b> Structurally efficient, highly loaded <b>struts</b> were fabricated and loaded in tension and compression to determine if they met the design requirements and to verify the accuracy of the analyses. Experimental evaluation of some of these <b>struts</b> demonstrated that they could meet the greatest Altair loading requirements in both tension and compression.
