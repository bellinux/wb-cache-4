40|$|Using {{the import}} data {{compiled}} by the Philippines and comparing these with data {{as reported by the}} exporting countries, this study aims to determine the disparity of the statistics from the two sources on the quantity and value of selected agricultural commodities for the years 2000 to 2005. The products covered by this study consist of wholly or <b>semi-milled</b> <b>rice,</b> maize (corn), live poultry, domestic fowls, ducks, geese, frozen meat of bovine animals, apples, oranges, onions and shallots, and garlic. The differences in statistics on the bilateral transactionsâ”€in terms of FOB values, quantities, and derived unit pricesâ”€are examined by using percentage differences, the implicit minimal measurement error (IMME), and the Wilcoxon Matched-Pair Signed-Ranks (Wilcoxon-MPSR) test. Results show that considerable discrepancies between import and export statistics do exist. The discrepancy may reflect both legitimate conceptual differences between Philippine imports and exports statistics of the exporting countries, as well as errors in reporting. The discrepancy is further substantiated by the results of the Wilcoxon-MPSR test, which show that these differences are significant. ...|$|E
40|$|Although the EU imports raw {{materials}} from developing countries with zero or low tariffs, tariffs increase {{going up the}} value chain, according to a USDA GAIN Report. The reality of this tariff escalation, it maintains, citing the cases of rice and cocoa, is not compatible with the EU's proclaimed development objectives. Taking the example of rice, which is only included in the EBA to a limited degree until 2009, there is a 21 % increase in tariffs for husked rice versus paddy (rough) rice, and a 57 % increase if the rice is milled or semi-milled. This regime effectively limits <b>semi-milled</b> and milled <b>rice</b> imports into the EU to less than 20 % of total rice imports. The paper {{points out that in}} terms of rice imports from ACP countries the EU earns over € 10 million per annum in tariffs. What is more important is that it thereby inhibits the development of rice processing in ACP countries, with EU firms capturing the marketing margins on rice processing. 96 % of EU rice exports are of <b>semi-milled</b> or milled <b>rice,</b> and 45 % of the total go back to developing countries with the benefit of export refunds. With regard to cocoa the report notes a particular tariff peak on chocolate, arising partly from tariff escalation and partly from the supplementary duty charged, which is based on the sugar content of the chocolate. EBA countries (39 of which are also ACP) face no tariff escalation, but non-LDC ACP countries face a 12. 9 % duty, plus this supplementary sugar duty. The preferences extended to ACP countries have however encouraged more exports of cocoa paste and cocoa fat, butter and oil. Comment: The analysis contained in this report is based on the EU's standard GSP regime and {{does not take into account}} the EBA initiative established for least developed countries or the trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. It notes that duty-free access for rice is to be granted to LDC exporters by 2009, ending tariff escalation for these countries. However by that time, as a result of the implementation of rice-sector reforms, it is estimated that the European market price for rice will be 41 % below current levels. Such a market development would greatly undermine the value of the removal of tariff escalation. Although the EU imports {{raw materials}} from developing countries with zero or [...] ...|$|R
