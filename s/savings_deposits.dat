In modern economies, relatively little of the money supply is in physical currency. For example, in December 2010 in the U.S., of the $8853.4 billion in broad money supply (M2), only $915.7 billion (about 10%) consisted of physical coins and paper money.|$|E

According to the CBI, the country's liquidity amounted to some $174 billion by April 2008, $197 billion by October 2009. and over $300 billion in 2011.

In turn, each village bank is managed by its elected officers—a president (who leads the bank’s democratic decision-making process), secretary (who takes attendance and keeps minutes) and a treasurer (responsible for accurately handling all cash transactions). Finally, each village banker has her own passbook, and her recorded balances of loan payments and <b>savings</b> <b>deposits</b> must always be the same as those recorded in the treasurer’s record for each client.|$|E
25|$|Reform of {{the economy}} was {{the goal of the}} National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. It sought to end {{cutthroat}} competition by forcing industries to come up with codes that established the rules of operation for all firms within specific industries, such as minimum prices, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Industry leaders negotiated the codes which were approved by NIRA officials. Industry needed to raise wages as a condition for approval. Provisions encouraged unions and suspended antitrust laws. NIRA was found to be unconstitutional by unanimous decision of the US Supreme Court in May 1935; Roosevelt strongly protested. Roosevelt reformed the financial regulatory structure of the nation with the Glass–Steagall Act, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to underwrite <b>savings</b> <b>deposits.</b> The act also sought to curb speculation by limiting affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms. In 1934, the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to regulate the trading of securities, while the Federal Communications Commission was established to regulate telecommunications.|$|E

[...] On 22 March 1956, he submitted a set of regulations specifying that the organisation and business activities of the proposed bank were not to compete with the Landesbank. In response, the government ultimately granted the concession on 4 April 1956, whereby those regulations were deemed {{an integral part of the}} approval. They were binding on Guido Feger as a person and dictated that the bank may accept no <b>savings</b> <b>deposits,</b> conduct no foreign currency exchange and not grant loans (including mortgage lending). Thus in the early years, the bank had to concentrate almost entirely on non-domestic activities. However, in building up its business, VP Bank was able to benefit from the relationships that ATU had already fostered since 1929 with banks, financial intermediaries and private clients in Switzerland and elsewhere abroad.|$|E

40|$|There are {{a number}} of studies that have {{explained}} why China should transit to a consumption-driven growth model or achieve a more rebalanced growth model. But there are few studies to test the relationship between saving, consumption and economic development in the Chinese economy. Thus, this study conducted two panel data analysis to test the relationship between saving, consumption and economic development in China. Since the area of research by the previous studies focused on urban-rural, provincial level, and national level, regional variations of saving have not been widely researched upon. Therefore, this study would try to reveal the regional saving variations and used the regional’s context to explain the phenomenon. The method of Ordinary least square (OLS) regression has been used for the two regression models and the data is obtained from the CEIC China Premium Database. The time period for the prefecture level panel data analysis is from 2003 to 2013, while the provincial level panel data analysis is from 1989 to 2014. The regression results showed that the real <b>saving</b> <b>deposit</b> in the eastern prefecture level cities are determined by most factors in the regression model. The central prefecture level cities’ real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits</b> are influenced by fewer factors while the western prefecture level cities are affected by the fewest factors in the regression model. There are six main findings for regional variations of saving. First, the higher the cost of living and the price of fixed asset, the lower the real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits.</b> Second, as real average wage increase, real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits</b> would also increase. Third, government social expenditure does not necessarily reduce real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits.</b> Fourth, an increase in population does not automatically increase real <b>saving</b> <b>deposit</b> as real <b>saving</b> <b>deposit</b> depends on the capacity of land. Fifth, urbanization affects regions’ real saving differently as it hinges on regional characteristics and development. Besides, the study found that there exists a positive relationship between China’s saving, consumption and economic development and Keynes’ paradox of thrift is inapplicable in China’s case. Keynes’ paradox of thrift is inapplicable to China as it incorrectly defined saving as hoarding of cash, assumed investments are based on interest rates and failed to incorporate the differences between the West and China. published_or_final_versionChina Development StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in China Development Studie...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of monetary policy rate, interbank rate and <b>savings</b> <b>deposit</b> on inflation rate in Nigeria over the period of January, 2006 – November, 2014. To achieve the objective, an autoregressive distributed lag model was employed to estimate both the long-run and short-run models. The result of the long-run model reveals that monetary policy rate, interbank rate and <b>savings</b> <b>deposit</b> were all negatively and significantly affecting inflation rate within the studied period. In similar vein, in the short-run, monetary policy rate and interbank rates were negative and significant in determining inflation fluctuations. Though <b>savings</b> <b>deposit</b> depicts positive sign but {{was found to be}} insignificant in the short-run. As such, both long-and short-run findings were in conformity with the theoretical expectations. Therefore, the policy suggestion is that the central bank of Nigeria (CBN) should consider strengthening the use these policy instruments in controlling inflation shocks in Nigeria.
