40|$|ABSTRACT⎯One of the {{drawbacks}} in an OFDM {{system is the}} high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Among a number of techniques to reduce the high PAPR, <b>simple</b> <b>amplitude</b> predistortion (SAP), a form of active constellation extension, has been proposed to effectively achieve the desired PAPR. In this letter, a novel scheme, <b>simple</b> <b>amplitude</b> and phase predistortion (SAPP), is proposed. In SAP the carriers’ amplitude is utilized to combat the peak signal. Each amplitude is amplified according to its degree of contribution as a metric. In addition to amplitude, SAPP also utilizes the phase.

40|$|A model {{field theory}} is invented in the {{following}} way: Dispersion relations in the energy are assumed to hold for all amplitudes. Unitarity gives the absorptive parts in the "physical" regions. If {{it is assumed that}} the absorptive parts are otherwise zero (in violation of crossing symmetry and the Mandelstam representation), then the dispersion relations and unitarity form an infinite set of coupled integral equations for all amplitudes. An exact solution (at least for the <b>simplest</b> <b>amplitudes)</b> to this set of equations can be found, in which all self-masses, etc., are finite.

40|$|Chiral {{perturbation}} theory {{is applied to}} the decay K→ 2 π.

One may then hope to calculate these two <b>simpler</b> <b>amplitudes</b> with lattice Monte Carlo techniques, and thereby gain understanding of the ΔI= 1 / 2 rule in K decay. The reason for the presence of the K→ 0 amplitude is explained: it serves to cancel off unwanted renormalization contributions to K→π.

40|$|Ambitwistor strings are chiral, {{infinite}} tension analogues {{of conventional}} string theory whose target space is {{the space of}} complex null geodesics and whose spectrum consists exclusively of massless states. At genus zero, these strings underpin the Cachazo-He-Yuan formulae for tree level scattering of gravitons, gluons and scalars. In this paper we extend these formulae {{in a number of}} directions. Firstly, we consider Ramond sector vertex operators and construct <b>simple</b> <b>amplitudes</b> involving space-time fermions. These agree with tree amplitudes in ten dimensional supergravity and super Yang [...] Mills. We then show that, after the usual GSO projections, the ambitwistor string partition function is modular invariant. We consider the scattering equations at genus one, and calculate one loop scattering amplitudes for NS-NS external states in the Type II ambitwistor string. We conjecture that these give new representations of (the integrand of) one loop supergravity amplitudes and we show that they have the expected behaviour under factorization of the worldsheet in both non [...] separating and separating degenerations.

40|$|Abstract The amplitudes of {{radiated}} seismic waves contain {{far more}} information about earthquake source mechanisms than do first-motion polarities, but amplitudes are severely distorted by the effects of heterogeneity n the Earth. This distortion can be reduced greatly by using the ratios of amplitudes of appropriately chosen seismic phases, rather than <b>simple</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> but existing methods for inverting amplitude ratios are severely nonlinear and require computationally intensive searching methods to ensure that solutions are globally optimal. Searching methods are particularly costly if general (moment tensor) mechanisms are allowed. Efficient linear-program-ming methods, which do not suffer from these problems, have previously been ap-plied to inverting polarities and wave amplitudes. We extend these methods to am-plitude ratios, in which formulation on inequality constraint for an amplitude ratio takes the same mathematical form as a polarity observation. Three-component digital data for an earthquake at the Hengill-Grensdalur geothermal rea in southwestern Iceland illustrate {{the power of the}} method. Polarities of P, SH, and SV waves, unu-sually well distributed on the focal sphere, cannot distinguish between diverse mech-anisms, including a double couple. Amplitude ratios, on the other hand, clearly rule out the double-couple solution and require a large explosive isotropic omponent...|$|R
