5|$|Banksia ericifolia has {{traditionally}} been described as lying within series Spicigerae of Banksia, together with Banksia spinulosa and various western Hairpin-like Banksias such as B.seminuda and B.brownii. This series is placed in Banksia sect. Oncostylis according to Alex George's taxonomy of Banksia, but directly into Banksia subg. Banksia in Thiele's arrangement based on cladistic analysis. Kevin Thiele additionally placed it in a <b>subseries</b> Ericifoliae, {{but this was not}} supported by George.|$|E
5|$|Critics praised Mega Man for {{its overall}} design, though {{the game was}} not a {{commercial}} success. Mega Man established many of the gameplay, story, and graphical conventions that define the ensuing sequels, <b>subseries,</b> and spin-offs. The game has since been included in game compilations and rereleased on mobile phones, console emulation services. It received a full 3D remake titled Mega Man Powered Up in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, a {{molecular}} study by Austin Mast showed Banksia sceptrum and B.ashbyi to be each other's closest relatives, the two {{lying in a}} larger group {{made up of the}} members of the <b>subseries</b> Cratistylis plus Banksia lindleyana. This was reinforced in a 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast DNA and combining it with earlier results.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 and 2007, {{four more}} games were {{released}} {{as part of}} the World of Mana <b>subseries,</b> an attempt by Square Enix to release games in a series over a variety of genres and consoles. These were Children of Mana (2006), an action-oriented dungeon crawler game for the Nintendo DS; Dawn of Mana (2006), a 3D action-adventure game for the PlayStation 2; Friends of Mana (2006), a Japan-only multiplayer role-playing game for mobile phones; and Heroes of Mana (2007), a real-time strategy game for the DS. Children was developed by Nex Entertainment and Heroes by Brownie Brown, founded by several developers of Legends, though Ishii oversaw development of all four games. Three more games have been released since the World of Mana <b>subseries</b> ended: Circle of Mana (2013), a Japan-only card battle game for the GREE mobile platform, Rise of Mana (2014), a Japan-only free-to-play action role-playing game for iOS, Android, and PlayStation Vita, and Adventures of Mana (2016), a 3D remake of Final Fantasy Adventure for the PlayStation Vita, iOS, and Android. In addition to the games, four manga series and one novelization have been released in the Mana franchise.|$|E
5|$|Outside its {{immediate}} reception, Before Crisis {{had an effect}} on other projects within the Final Fantasy series. After the positive reception of Madhouse's animated commercial, they were chosen by Square Enix to animate Last Order. The high popularity of Before Crisis in Japan led indirectly to the creation of Type-0, part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy <b>subseries</b> and then a title for mobiles.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Atlus. Forming part of the Megami Tensei series, {{it is the first}} title in the Devil Summoner <b>subseries.</b> It was first released for the Sega Saturn in December 1995, and received a port to the PlayStation Portable in December 2005. Despite reports of it being planned for localization, neither version has been released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.integrifolia is placed in Banksia subg. Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes; Banksia sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and Banksia ser. Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele additionally placed it in a <b>subseries</b> Integrifoliae, but this was not supported by George.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.canei is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes; section Banksia because of its straight styles; and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele placed it in a <b>subseries</b> Integrifoliae, where he found strong support for it and B.saxicola to be each other's closest relative. The two were a sister group (i.e. next closest relative) to the four then-recognised subspecies of B.integrifolia. The <b>subseries</b> all bear whorled leaves apart from B.canei and B.aquilonia. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. He did place the two subalpine taxa (B.canei and B.saxicola) {{at the end of the}} sequence as he thought they were the most recently evolved species, since he considered the group to have a tropical origin and B.dentata to be the oldest lineage.|$|E
5|$|The first {{installment}} in the franchise, , {{was released on}} September 11, 1987. The following entries have nearly always been unrelated to each other except in carrying over thematic and gameplay elements. The Megami Tensei games, and the later Shin Megami Tensei titles form {{the core of the}} series, while other <b>subseries</b> such as Persona and Devil Summoner are spin-offs marketed as part of the franchise. There are also stand-alone spin-off titles.|$|E
5|$|Thiele and Ladiges' {{arrangement}} was not accepted by George, and was largely discarded by {{him in his}} 1999 arrangement. B.ser. Abietinae was restored to George's 1981 circumscription, and all of Thiele and Ladiges' <b>subseries</b> were abandoned. However, B.telmatiaea was moved in the phyletic order to between B.grossa (Coarse Banksia) and B.leptophylla, thus better according with the affinity with B.leptophylla claimed by George in 1981.|$|E
5|$|A mobile racing game {{based on}} a mini game from VII, Final Fantasy VII G-Bike, was {{released}} on October 30, 2014, for iOS and Android. A western release for the title was planned. It was developed by Japan-based developer CyberConnect2 {{as part of a}} planned <b>subseries</b> of mobile games based on VIIs mini games. While related to VII and the Compilation due to its nature, the developers confirmed that it was not related to nor affected the Compilation itself. Due to difficulties delivering continual satisfactory service, G-Bike was shut down in 2015 without seeing a Western release.|$|E
5|$|Children of Mana, {{originally}} {{released in}} Japan as Seiken Densetsu DS: Children of Mana, is a 2006 action role-playing {{game for the}} Nintendo DS handheld console. It was developed by Square Enix and Nex Entertainment, and published by Square Enix and Nintendo. It is the sixth game of the Mana series—following 2003's Sword of Mana—and the first entry in the World of Mana <b>subseries.</b> Set in a high fantasy universe, Children of Mana follows one of four young heroes as they combat an invasion of monsters and learn about the cataclysmic event that killed their families.|$|E
5|$|Dawn of Mana, {{originally}} {{released in}} Japan as Seiken Densetsu 4, is a 2006 action-adventure {{game for the}} PlayStation 2. It was developed and published by Square Enix. It is the eighth game of the Mana series and the third entry in the World of Mana <b>subseries,</b> following the release of Children of Mana nine months prior and Friends of Mana two months prior. Set in a high fantasy universe, Dawn of Mana follows a young hero, Keldric, as he journeys to close a portal to a land of darkness that has been opened {{in the base of}} the Tree of Mana and is corrupting the world.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XV (originally {{known as}} Final Fantasy Versus XIII), the fifteenth core Final Fantasy title {{and the third}} main title in the <b>subseries,</b> was {{announced}} {{in the same year}} as XIII and Type-0, and was released worldwide on November 29, 2016. The game is an action role-playing game with a battle system similar to those from the Kingdom Hearts series and Type-0. The game uses open world exploration using both a vehicle and chocobos, along with a camping mechanic linked to gaining experience levels. Its development cycle, beginning in 2006, lasted ten years.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the game, Atlus decided to create a sequel, but instead of {{continuing}} to adapt Nishitani's work, they created an original story with an expanded narrative and refined gameplay. Titled , the game was released for the Famicom in 1990. Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei was the first game in the Megami Tensei series, with Atlus eventually buying the rights to the franchise and turning the series into their most famous intellectual property. Megami Tensei has been called the third most popular RPG series in Japan after Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, and gone on to include multiple <b>subseries</b> and expansions into other media.|$|E
5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 1996, when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published an}} arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics. They retained George's subgenera {{and many of}} his series, but discarded his sections. Banksia ser. Abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four <b>subseries.</b> Banksia sphaerocarpa appeared in the second of these, initially called the ' grossa clade' for its most basal member. As with George's classification, B.grossa and B.micrantha emerged as close relatives of B.sphaerocarpa.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana, {{originally}} {{released in}} Japan as Seiken Densetsu: Heroes of Mana, is a 2007 real-time strategy {{game for the}} Nintendo DS. It was developed by Brownie Brown and Square Enix and published by Square Enix. It is the ninth game of the Mana series and the fourth entry in the World of Mana <b>subseries,</b> following the release of Dawn of Mana three months prior. Set in a high fantasy universe, Heroes of Mana follows a young soldier, Roget, as he journeys to defend several nations from the ruthless aggression of his own country {{in a series of}} battles.|$|E
5|$|Megami Tensei, marketed {{overseas}} as Shin Megami Tensei (originally Revelations), is a Japanese media franchise {{created by}} Kouji Okada (credited as Cozy Okada in English), Ginichiro Suzuki, and Kazunari Suzuki. Primarily developed by Atlus and currently owned by Sega, the franchise consists of multiple <b>subseries</b> and covers multiple role-playing genres including tactical role-playing, action role-playing, and massively multiplayer online role-playing. The first two {{titles in the}} series were published by Bandai Namco (then Namco), but have been almost always published by Atlus in Japan and North America since the release of Shin Megami Tensei. For Europe, Atlus publishes the games through third-party companies.|$|E
5|$|Revelations: Persona is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Atlus. It is the first entry in the Persona series, itself a <b>subseries</b> of the Megami Tensei franchise, and the first role-playing entry in the series {{to be released in}} the west. Originally released for the PlayStation in 1996 in Japan and North America, the title was ported to Microsoft Windows in 1999. A port to the PlayStation Portable retitled Shin Megami Tensei: Persona was released in North America and Japan in 2009, and the following year in Europe. This port featured new cutscenes and a reworked English localization.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, an American botanist, Austin Mast, {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's arrangement, and somewhat different from Thiele and Ladiges'. With respect to B.violacea, Mast's results agree with its placement near B.laricina and B.incana, placing it in a clade with these two species and B.sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla (treated at species rank as B.dolichostyla). However, Thiele's B. <b>subseries</b> Longistyles appears to be polyphyletic, as do both definitions of B.ser. Abietinae—that is, none form a natural grouping.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.oblongifolia is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described <b>subseries</b> Acclives along with B.plagiocarpa, B.robur and B.dentata within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George.|$|E
5|$|Assisted {{by a large}} pre-release promotional campaign, Final Fantasy VII {{received}} widespread {{commercial and}} critical success upon release, and is still widely regarded as a landmark title {{and one of the}} greatest games of all time. It was acknowledged for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing Japanese role-playing games worldwide, with praise being given to its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its English localization. The game won numerous Game of the Year awards, among other accolades. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a <b>subseries</b> companion of media called the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, and a high-definition remake for the PlayStation 4.|$|E
5|$|Persona began {{development}} {{after the release}} of Shin Megami Tensei If..., with the idea of creating a <b>subseries</b> around the positively received high school setting of If.... Multiple staff members from previous Megami Tensei titles were involved in development, including character designer Kazuma Kaneko, and director Kouji Okada. Multiple aspects of the story, including Personas and the character Philemon, were taken from Jungian psychology, while Kaneko's character designs were based on both staff members, and celebrities and fictional characters of the time. Reception to the game has generally been positive, with most praising its approach to the genre, while its navigation and localization were criticized. Its PSP port shared most points of praise with the original, along with the improved localization, but also drew negative comments for its by-then dated mechanics and graphics.|$|E
5|$|The concept, {{which was}} set within the mythos of the Fabula Nova Crystallis <b>subseries,</b> {{was for a}} much darker {{scenario}} than other Final Fantasy games. The main cast were designed by Nomura and Naora, while side characters were handled by Nakaaki. Multiple pieces of merchandise and additional media have been created around the characters, including trading cards and multiple manga. They {{have been the subject}} of positive reviews in Japan and import reviews: the main praise has gone to their interactions and writing, while the main criticism was difficulties arising from handling the large cast. Western reviews were also generally positive about the character portrayals, but there were criticisms about dialogue, character interactions, and the quality of the localization.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.marginata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it as the most basal member of a newly described <b>subseries</b> Integrifoliae, within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. George did concede that major work is needed on Banksia marginata, which shows such a high degree of variability over its range.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} thought behind the Compilation would later inspire the {{creation}} of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a <b>subseries</b> of games linked by a common mythos, and would use {{lessons learned from the}} Compilation production process. On an individual level, Before Crisiss popularity would inspire {{the creation of}} another mobile title within the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries: originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, it would later change platforms and be renamed Final Fantasy Type-0. The battle sequences in Advent Children also served as inspiration for Motomu Toriyama when creating the battle system for Final Fantasy XIII. Former staff members have blamed the Compilation, in conjunction with other extensions of titles like Final Fantasy X, for undermining the series' market presence and fan trust in the West.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} Final Fantasy Adventure was {{composed}} by Kenji Ito, while Hiroki Kikuta composed Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 and Yoko Shimomura wrote the score to Legend of Mana. The {{music of the}} World of Mana <b>subseries,</b> composed of Children, Dawn, Friends, and Heroes of Mana, was composed by many different composers, with Ito, Kikuta, Shimomura, Tsuyoshi Sekito, Masayoshi Soken, and Ryuichi Sakamoto composing Dawn, Ito, Masaharu Iwata, and Takayuki Aihara writing Children, and Shimomura composing the music of Friends and Heroes. Rise of Mana was composed by an ensemble group including Ito, Kikuta, Shimomura, Sekito, Yasuhiro Yamanaka, and Kokia. Music from the series has been performed in live concerts such as the Orchestral Game Concerts and the Symphonic Game Music Concerts, and made up one fourth of the Symphonic Fantasies concert in Cologne, Germany. Music from the Mana series has also been arranged for the piano and published as sheet music books.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.dentata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. There has been debate on which species it is most closely related to. Alf Salkin had noted that B.dentata displays characteristics which are primitive within the genus. Unlike southern banksias, it has small juvenile leaves and broad dentate adult leaves. Alex George concluded initially that its affinities lay with Banksia integrifolia on account of their similar inflorescences. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described <b>subseries</b> Acclives along with B.plagiocarpa, B.robur and B.oblongifolia within the series Salicinae. These four species all have follicles which point slightly upwards towards the apex of the flower spike. It was held to be most closely related to B.robur on account of its large undulate leaves. Salkin had also noted that the seedling leaves of B.dentata, B.robur and B.oblongifolia were all similar and roughly linear, suggesting a close relationship. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George; he discounted a close relationship with B.robur, which he felt was too distinctive.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} {{directors are}} allowed to freely interpret the base mythology when they create their games. When referring to this freedom, Tabata has compared the mythos and the concept behind it to Greek mythology; a mythology with common themes and deities, but featuring a large variety of unrelated stories. Toriyama conceived a story for Final Fantasy XIII set primarily around the mythos' deities and their direct relations to the world. Tabata and Nomura both focused more on the human side of the story. Tabata chose to portray the divine elements from a historical standpoint in Type-0, while Nomura created a modern-day setting similar to contemporary Earth in XV, referring far less to the mythos' terminology. Nomura was also appointed as the main character designer for all entries in the <b>subseries.</b> In a 2007 interview, Hashimoto compared the planning of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series to film franchises such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: an expansive brand {{on which to build}} multiple Final Fantasy titles planned in advance. The development of all games connected to the mythos was handled by Square Enix 1st Production Department. A trademark for Final Fantasy Haeresis XIII hinted at another entry, but the trademark expired in 2011 and the company did not renew.|$|E
25|$|By {{contrast}} {{another study}} {{performed at the}} same time, using both nuclear and chloroplast DNA but limited to the 14 species found in Turkey, largely confirmed Davis' series and <b>subseries,</b> and with biogeographical correlation. Series Galanthus in this study corresponded to clade nivalis, <b>subseries</b> Glaucaefolii with clade Elwesii and <b>subseries</b> Viridifolii with clades Woronowii and Alpinus. However, the model did not provide complete resolution.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} series of screeves in Georgian: first, {{second and third}} series. The first series has two <b>subseries,</b> which are called {{the present and the}} future <b>subseries.</b> The second series is also called the aorist series, and the third series is called the {{perfective}} series. There are a total of eleven screeves.|$|E
25|$|Banksia subser. Cratistylis {{is a valid}} botanic {{name for}} a <b>subseries</b> of Banksia. It was first {{published}} by Kevin Thiele in 1996, but discarded by Alex George in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2010, a {{separate}} <b>subseries</b> titled Lara Croft was in development, offering experiences {{separate from the}} development of the main series and existing in its own continuity. The first game in this <b>subseries,</b> Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, released in 2010 as a downloadable title for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360. The next game in the series, Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris, released for both retail and download in 2014 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One. Another entry for mobile devices, an endless runner platformer titled , was released in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Banksia subser. Banksia {{is a valid}} botanic {{name for}} a <b>subseries</b> of Banksia. It was first used by Kevin Thiele in 1996, {{although}} as an autonym it is not considered to have been published per se. It was discarded by Alex George in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The New Order Series (gamebooks 21 to 32) is {{intended}} to be 12 books long, although only the first eight books were originally released before the cancellation of the series in 1998. It took 18 years before the next book in this <b>subseries</b> got published.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of this clade, Thiele and Ladiges {{abandoned}} B.ser. Crocinae, transferring its four taxa into B.ser. Banksia. They then divided the series into two <b>subseries,</b> placing B.ornata (Desert Banksia), B.serrata and B.aemula in B.subser. Banksia, and all other species in B.subser. Cratistylis.|$|E
