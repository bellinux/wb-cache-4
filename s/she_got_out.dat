5|$|Falle's pimp {{kept her}} falsely imprisoned and trafficked {{her across the}} country. He married her and {{tortured}} her, breaking several of her bones and burning her body. In order {{to cope with the}} trauma of prostitution and violence, Falle became dependent on cocaine and almost died. Eventually, <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of prostitution and, with her mother's support, went through drug rehabilitation, finished high school, and eventually received a diploma in Wife Assault and Child Advocacy from George Brown College.|$|E

25|$|On Biryukova's 29th birthday, {{in early}} 2010, she was briefly {{committed}} to a mental hospital {{for the first of}} three times, after telling Solomon she had dreamed of killing the children.

25|$|Dissension {{within the}} South Bend team peaked {{just before the}} season ended, when infielder Charlene Pryer was disciplined {{following}} a dispute with Winsch. The incident occurred when he suspended Pryer from the team after she responded slowly to his order to pinch-run late in a game. In protest, five South Bend teammates joined Pryer in a walkout, leaving Winsch's team short-handed for the playoffs. Pryer was reinstated at the club, but she decided to retire for good. South Bend finished with a league-best record of 76–36, then eliminated Grand Rapids in the best-of-three series (2–0). Faut was the winning pitcher in the first contest in a 2–1 complete game, in which <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of a no-outs, bases-loaded jam in the ninth inning, surrendering just one unearned run. South Bend handily defeated the Chicks in the second game, 6–1, with Faut delivering two RBI and relieving in the ninth to seal the victory. Rockford disposed of Fort Wayne in the other series, two games to one.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for the Los Angeles Times, Judy Berman {{addressed}} Safran's description of Blair during the scene. [...] "Considering how terrified Blair {{looked at the}} end of their encounter, and how quickly <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of there, the show is sending a mixed message at best." [...] She went on to state, [...] "We have no right to expect Gossip Girl to be a paragon of morality, or even realism, but the idea that true love requires taking a shard of glass to the face is disturbing even in this alternate, soap-opera dimension." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{behind a}} giant, green, laser lit video screen {{featuring}} scrim lights, Gaga {{appeared in a}} bulb-covered futuristic silver jeweled jumpsuit with matching eye makeup and mask and sang [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] as dancers, dressed in white balaclavas and white jumpsuits, moved around her. The video screen, resembling an electric mathematical grid, was eventually lifted during the performance. After the song, Gaga strapped a portable silver jeweled keyboard to herself and began to perform [...] "Just Dance" [...] while emerging {{from the inside of}} a white cube on a platform. This was followed by a brief video intermission and Gaga returned onstage in an off-white costume, that resembled an alien ecto-skeleton, while the dancers wore skeletal headgear. She started performing [...] "LoveGame", which ended with Gaga pointing towards her groin. Flames appeared on the video screens, as <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of her ecto-skeleton outfit. After stripping down to a silver bodysuit she performed [...] "Alejandro", and was carried by her [...] crotch by one of her male dancers, and later lowered onto another one of them.|$|E

500|$|The rising {{popularity}} of low-rise jeans led to increased exposure of thong tops {{in the early}} 2000s, which quickly became mainstream as a Gucci model revealed one on the catwalk, Melanie Blatt of All Saints was photographed showing her thong as <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of a taxi, and Victoria Beckham suggested that her husband enjoyed her wearing her G-strings around the home. Britney Spears has been portrayed as {{a major contributor to}} the whale tail's popularity. Her whale tail display has been referred to in such creative literature books as Married to a Rock Star by Shemane Nugent, Thong on Fire by Noire, [...] The Magical Breasts of Britney Spears by Ryan G. Van Cleave, and Off-Color by Janet McDonald. The Oregonian, a Portland, Oregon, newspaper, wrote in 2004 that an abundance of whale tails had become a distraction on the campus. Social commentator Ann C. Hall identified this campus trend as an [...] "apparent intersection between everyday campus fashion and soft porn". The layered clothing trend of the early 2000s was partly led by the whale tail style that incorporates hip-hugger jeans, crop tops and high riding thongs popularized by celebrities.|$|E
500|$|Lloyd's biographer Midge Gillies defines 1891 {{as being}} the year that she officially [...] "made it" [...] thanks to a {{catalogue}} of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; The Era called her [...] "the favourite of the hour". During the summer months, she toured North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. [...] At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris. [...] The 1892 pantomime was Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb, in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. [...] The production was five hours long and culminated with the show's harlequinade. During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of bed to pray, but instead reached for a chamber pot. The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her {{not to do it}} again or risk immediate dismissal. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later audience, said [...] "Isn't Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? [...] I think of little besides her." [...] On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of Little Bo-Peep. [...] Courtenay pulled a decorative sword off the wall and threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the Bow Street police station. In early 1893, she travelled to Wolverhampton where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous, which, according to MacQueen-Pope, [...] "ended the Queen of Comedy's career as an actress".|$|E
2500|$|Martin auditioned so {{well that}} her parents soon allowed her to attend them by herself. Her mother recalled, [...] "I'll never forget the first {{interview}} she went on. It was for a Chrysler commercial, and my car broke down about six blocks from the studio. I had {{to stay with the}} car, but Lori was all for going on in herself. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the car, walked six blocks, found the right office, told the receptionist who she was, went in for her interview and got the job. Since then I've usually waited outside in the car and she's handled everything herself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Diane Settegast and Eunice Woolen, {{who stayed}} with the Hills as house guests a week before Joan's death, would later {{describe}} how Hill brought home pastries, but insisted on choosing which ones each of them would eat. Hill would return home with the pastries in the evenings after being called away by a message on his pager. On Friday, March 14, the Hills attended Houston's annual wild game dinner, where John played a concert with the Heartbeats. They left early, {{and on the way}} home Joan asked her husband if he would be staying out all night again. When he said that he probably would, she reminded him that he had done this on two previous occasions that week. The conversation quickly descended into an argument in which she told him that if he did stay out, he should not bother to come back. When they arrived home, <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the car, and he began to drive away, at which point she became angry and shouted [...] "You've blown it, John! You've just lost your wife, your son and your god damn music room." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elle {{heads to}} the Hair Affair {{to say goodbye to}} Paulette, but before she can leave, Vivienne and Enid {{convince}} Elle otherwise. Elle discards her lawyerly navy suits, dons a pink dress and leads a parade back to the courtroom. They meet Kyle on the way, who takes a liking to Paulette, and reveals himself to be the Irish man of her dreams, prompting to Irish Dance among the ensemble. Back at the trial, Brooke fires Callahan and hires Elle ("Legally Blonde Remix"). Brooke's stepdaughter Chutney goes to the witness stand and her testimony is damning, stating after <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the shower she saw Brooke covered in her father's blood. After Chutney states she received a perm the day of the murder, Elle realizes a flaw in Chutney's alibi and suggests that the entire court should be moved {{to the scene of the}} crime - the bathroom where the murder took place ("Scene of the Crime"). As a demonstration, Elle asks Paulette to give Enid a perm, and asks Enid to step into the shower upon entering the crime scene. Relying on her knowledge of hair maintenance, Elle's demonstration is successful as Enid walks out of the shower with completely flattened hair—revealing that Chutney could not have possibly showered immediately after getting a perm because her perm was still intact. Under Elle's intense questioning, Chutney accidentally confesses that she killed her father, thinking that it was Brooke ("Omigod You Guys (Reprise)"). Chutney is arrested and Brooke is set free.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his release}} from San Quentin in 1960, Haggard started digging ditches for his brother's {{electrical}} contracting company. Soon, he was performing again, and later began recording with Tally Records. The Bakersfield sound was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced honky tonk of the Nashville sound. Haggard's first record for Tally was [...] "Singing My Heart Out" [...] backed by [...] "Skid Row"; {{it was not a}} success, and only 200 copies were pressed. In 1962, Haggard wound up performing at a Wynn Stewart show in Las Vegas and heard Wynn's [...] "Sing a Sad Song." [...] He asked for permission to record it, and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964. The following year, he had his first national top-10 record with [...] "(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers," [...] written by Liz Anderson, mother of country singer Lynn Anderson, and his career was off and running. Haggard recalls having been talked into visiting Anderson—a woman he did not know—at her house to hear her sing some songs she had written. [...] "If there was anything I didn't wanna do, it was sit around some danged woman's house and listen to her cute little songs. But I went anyway. She was a pleasant enough lady, pretty, with a nice smile, but I was all set to be bored to death, even more so when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> a whole bunch of songs and went over to an old pump organ.... There they were. My God, one hit right after another. There must have been four or five number one songs there...." ...|$|E
