Fragmentation the longitudinal connectivity of watercourses caused by dams or other hydrotechnical constructions represent a major impact on sediment transport, hydrological regime, downstream moving and biota migration. The hydromorphological elements (river continuity), as well as chemical, biological, physicochemical elements characterize the ecological status of rivers. Migratory fish species: nase (Chondrostoma nasus - protected by Bern Convention - Appendix III) and barbel (Barbus barbus - rare species, protected Habitats Directive (Annex V), annex 4 A of Low nr. 462 and Red List of RBDD) are blocked but the Hydrotechnical constructions (discharge <b>sills,</b> <b>dams</b> etc) located across the watercourse Somes Mic River. One of the important think of this system is the gravitational fall of water. This solution will lead to the restoration of the longitudinal connection of the Someşul Mic River in the Manastur neighborhood.

40|$|Modelling {{the flow}} {{propagation}} in shallow-water bodies with movable bed is a challenging task. Due {{to the existence}} of sediment transport, bottom discontinuities and sudden bed elevation changes can be developed, for example at the end of stilling basin aprons; moreover, it is common to find structures as drop structures, check <b>dams,</b> <b>sills,</b> which promote the formation of local bed discontinuities. Here, following the theory by Dal Maso, LeFloch and Murat, a numerical scheme is presented, which is well balanced and able to capture contact discontinuities in flows characterized by movable bed: in particular, the bed geometry non-conservative products are defined in order to ensure a hydrostatic pressure distribution onto the bed step. Finally, numerical tests are presented in order to demonstrate the viability of the metho...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} numerical {{simulations of}} free surface flows induced by a dam break comparing the shal-low water approach to fully three-dimensional simulations. The latter {{are based on}} the solution of the complete set of Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations cou-pled to the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. The methods assessment and comparison are carried out on a dam break over a flat bed without friction, a dam break over a triangular bottom <b>sill</b> and a <b>dam</b> break flow over a 90 ◦ bend. Experimental and numerical literature data are com-pared to present results. The results demonstrate that the shallow water approach, even if able to sufficiently reproduce the main aspects of the fluid flows, loses some three-dimensional phenomena, due to the incorrect shallow water idealization that neglects the three-dimensional aspects related to the gravity force. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{geologic}} literature shows many important relationships be-tween ore deposits and associated ikes and sills. Most significant are the structural controls by pre-ore dikes on ore localization. Dikes and sills commonly are competent, brecciated bodies {{that act as}} host rocks or as channelways for ore solutions. Incompetent dikes and <b>sills</b> serve as <b>dams,</b> ponding ore solutions at their contacts. Fracturing at dike contacts also creates channelways and loci for deposition; {{the nature of this}} fracturing is variable, and depends on relative competency and on the nature and di-rection of differential stress at the contact. Intersections of dikes and sfils with fault zones, formation contacts, and other planar structures provide excellent sites for ore deposition. Primary features of dikes and sills, such as permeability, width, and configuration are sometimes important in localizing ore. Contemporaneous and post-ore dikes and sills in a few cases are im-portant as indicators of the factors controlling movements of ore solutions. Post-ore injections may seriously dilute ore deposits, or may by heat action effect changes in mineral composition and distribution. Genetic relationships between dikes, sills, and ore are not well under-stood. Magmatic segregations commonly take the form of dikes and sills, and other gradational relationships between ore and igneous rock are occa-sionally noted. Dike injection is predominantly pre-ore, with lampro-phyres and diabase apparently closely related in time to mineralization. Most dikes and sills associated with ore are of intermediate composition...|$|R
40|$|We present here {{our initial}} {{endeavor}} to categorize dam removal efforts based on past experience {{in order to}} better predict the outcomes and potential impacts of dam removal projects, as well as start to develop conceptual models for dam removal. The Broad Level Classification System for Dam Removals, developed by MacBroom and Wildman in 2010, divides dam removal projects into twelve categories. The categories were determined based on sediment quantity, sediment characteristics, impoundment width, the existence of a legacy channel, and certain limiting factors such as the presence of contaminants, downstream channel bed degradation, and if a portion of the dam w-as left in place. The upstreamchannel and sediment responses, overall systemresponse, and relative recovery times are then summariesby category. Multiple examples of each category are given, from completed dam removal projects across thenation. The classification system is backed by extensive expertise on over 100 dam removal projects, which lead to the determination that obvious patterns and similarities in response exist between specific “categories” of dam removals. Wide impoundments with fine grained sediments respond very different than steep narrow impoundmentswith coarse grained sediments. Some dams have noimpounded sediment stored behind them at all, whileothers have a century or more of accumulated sedimentwithin the impoundment. The system response to a removal differs greatly if the downstream channel issignificantly degraded or if the <b>sill</b> of a <b>dam</b> is left in place during the removal. The results and complexity of a dam removal project will vary depending on these factors and others. The classification system allows us to learn from cumulative project experience by comparing projects that will likely respond in a similar manner...|$|R
40|$|South Korea is {{reclaiming}} land by constructing {{dams and}} polders. The large tidal differences along the Korean coast make building these dams a challenging job. One of the solutions in South Korea {{to cope with}} the high flow velocities in closure projects is to apply sack gabions. These are steel nets with rocks inside them that weigh up to 3 tons. It is not clear how stable these sack gabions are exactly. The objective of this report is to make a preliminary study on the stability of sack gabions. In 2006, the Saemangeum estuary in South Korea was closed with a dam. During the closure sack gabions were used in the bed protection, <b>sill</b> construction and <b>dam</b> heads. In a field trip to the Saemangeum project useful data was collected on the stability of gabions. Experimental data of RRI on model tests on the stability of gabions was also obtained. In addition model tests were done in Delft. All data are compared {{to come up with an}} advice for calculating the stability of gabions. To calculate the depth averaged critical velocity for 3 t - 5 t rock with 3 t sack gabions mixtures, formula [15] proves to be useful. ucM = 2. 513 *x+ 5. 4 [15 Where: ucM = critical velocity of a mixture of 50 % rocks of 3. 0 to 5. 0 t and 50 % 3. 0 gabions x = the proportion of gabions in the mixture 0. 2 < x < 0. 5 For the calculation of the local critical velocity for a bed of sack gabions, it is advised to use Izbash' formula with a gabion stability factor (Gamma in formula [10]) while calculating the nominal diameter of a sack gabion as in formula [1] (a mass based approach) : Delta Dn = (Beta*Uc 2) /(Gamma* 2 *g) [10] Dn = (M/Rs) ^ 1 / 3 [1] Where Gamma = 1. 26 for sack gabions (while for loose rocks Gamma = 1) Also a qualitative analysis of the Delft model tests is made that leads to several considerations for the design of gabion bed protections: When applying gabions one has to take into account the difference in behavior between gabions and loose rocks. Another behavior that needs to be investigated further is the effect of applied pressure on a gabion bed. There is still much unknown about the stability of gabions and the report mentions several things that should be further investigated. Also it is advised to use sluices in the Netherlands or in South Korea as flumes for extensive prototype tests on the stability of gabions. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
