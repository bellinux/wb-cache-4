40|$|Contributor: Francisco ReyThe Working Group on Phytoplankton Ecology (WGPE) met in Oldenburg, Germany, from 16 to 18 March 2005. Six {{scientists}} from different countries participated. WGPE started its annual {{meeting with a}} long discussion about the group activities {{in relation to the}} ICES Action Plan. The discussion on this matter started already in 2004 but no specific priorities were given at that time. WGPE has prepared two tables that summarize the group’s points of view about future activities in the frame of the Action Plan. Lack of time hindered a more detailed presentation, and it was agreed that a set of guidelines should be prepared for next year’s meeting after consulting with other working groups. An assesment of the application of remote sensing and numerical modelling for phytoplankton dynamics studies had started. The first step in this work was to review {{the state of the art}} situation with examples. Although WGPE recognized that these techniques have seen significant improvement, still they are of only a semi-quantitative character and further work is needed before they can be applied without restriction. However, the examples showed confirmed the value of these techniques. They are quite useful to provide information and resolve issues where full quantitative data are not completely necessary. WGPE has for a long time being been concerned about the possible impacts of climate change on phytoplankton dynamics. The prevailing view that emerged from the discussion was that this problem is very difficult to resolve without long-term data series. The continuous decline of this kind of data is a threat to properly assessing climate change impact, and WGPE expressed its concern about replacing real data with, i. e., models, when dealing with this question. WGPE agreed on starting a series of presentations at next year’s meeting with examples from different regions and ecosystems where long-term observation programs are still being carried out. Contributions to the Annual Phytoplankton Summary were presented by four countries. Although WGPE has prepared a <b>standard</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>form</b> there is still the problem of the variability in the reporting countries. Unfortunately only countries attending the meeting reported. Countries like Sweden and The Netherlands that have previously presented detailed reports did not attend this year’s meeting. WGPE will contact all its members once again and ask them to present their contributions for the 2006 meeting, wh either they attend it or not. The first draft of the ICES phytoplankton list was presented. WGPE reccomends to name it the ICES Phytoplankton Name List in order to avoid conflicts with taxonomists. The list, containing more than 1300 species names, will be further completed during the intersessional period by adding corrected names already submitted as well as new names from other not yet delivered lists. WGPE found that the time is still not ripe to hold a Workshop on new methods for measuring Primary Production. This is due to the fact that the newest techniques are still i. in a developing phase, a phase that had taken longer time than previously expected. At the same time WGPE agreed on at if there is the need of a Primary Production database at ICES this should only include data from standarized methods as the one proposed several years ago by WGPE. WGPE recommends, after revision, the publication of the documents describing the ICES incubator. WGPE regrets that no contribution was prepared for the May 2005 REGNS meeting. However, a new effort will be carried out during the intersessional period to comply with this ICES request. WGPE will meet again from 29 – 31 March 2006 at Brorfelde, Denmark...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Burn {{injury is}} often a devastating event with {{long-term}} physical and psychosocial effects. Burn scars, meanly if hypertrophic or keloid, are cosmetically disfiguring and force the scarred person {{to deal with an}} alteration in body appearance, cosmetic deformities, discomfort, psychological stress (1). The exact mechanisms of normal and abnormal scar formation have long remained a mystery despite the extensive literature regarding wound healing. Recently researchers have begun to delineate the complex biochemical signalling pathways that regulate these processes (2). At same way it is important for clinicians to understand what are the clinical signs, the patient characteristics and the procedures that are mainly related with the occurrence of pathological scarring, to carry out a possible prognostic assessment of the scar. The aim of the present study, including a large sample of burns scars, is to evaluate the factors associated with an increased risk of the development of pathological burn scars, and to provide by means of Bayesian Network a model displaying all relations between demographic, clinical and treatment variables each others and with the final clinical outcome, the type of scar. Methods: From January 1994 at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery – Burn Center of Traumatological Hospital in Turin a <b>standard</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>form</b> for collecting data referred to scar process has been used. The cohort consists of 703 patients and 2440 anatomical burn sites. Particularly in this study cohort the scar type was defined {{on the basis of the}} morphologic classification described in (6) and the scar evolution, calculated in days from the manifestation until its complete remission, was assessed according to the classification groups described in (7). A Bayesian Network (BN) is a graphical representation of the joint probability distributions over a set of random variables. Each node in a Bayesian network is associated with a set of probability tables. For those nodes without ingoing arcs, the probability distribution is a prior distribution which requires supplying a set of initial values. Following both the structure and the numerical parameters can be learned from data, since the structure of a BN is a representation of conditional independencies in the data, and the numerical parameters are a representation of the joint probability distributions. The second strategy based was chosen. There are a great number of algorithms for learning the structure of Bayesian networks from data. The well-known K 2 algorithm (8) which is based on a scoring function and a search procedure was chosen. The algorithms based on a scoring function try to find a graph that best represents the data, according to a specific criterion. They use a scoring function in combination with a search method to measure the goodness of each explored structure from the space of feasible solutions. During the exploring process, the scoring function is applied to evaluate the fitness of each candidate structure to the data. With respect to parameter learning, continuous variables were discretized and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm was chosen to estimate the required conditional probabilities (9). A 10 -fold cross validation was performed in order to evaluate the performance of the BN. A sensitivity analysis was carried out for hospitalization and complications nodes in order to identifying the most influential variables on injury severity. With categorical states, sensitivity is calculated as the degree of entropy reduction or mutual information, which measures how much uncertainty about a specific event is expected to decrease when a new finding is available (10), and the expected reduction of real variance. The Bayesian Network was implemented using GeNie to develop the structure (11) and Netica for the learning parameters and the validation phase. Results: Figure 1 depicted the Bayesian network along with the conditional probability tables learned by EM algorithm the Bayesian network which was built up using a subset of data without missing values. Discussion: Any expert that prospect to a patient a prognosis must take these factors into account. In medicine such Bayesian network systems are used for aiding in prognosis decisional process : inferring the most probable outcome of an observed problem given a set of symptoms, patient history, physical signs and applied treatment. They are especially useful in the medical domain because they allow the creation of a probabilistic network of causal dependencies in a given domain but can then be used for diagnostic inference (predicting probabilities in the reverse direction from effect to cause) ...|$|E

Main outcome measure was incidence of error reporting, including pre- and post-interventions.  RESULTS—Medication errors occurred in 0. 15 % of admissions (195 errors; one per 662 admissions). While the highest rate occurred in neonatal intensive care (0. 98 %), most errors occurred in medical wards. Nurses were responsible for most reported errors (59 %). Errors involving the intravenous route were commonest (56 %), with antibiotics being the most frequent drug involved (44 %). Fifteen (8 %) involved a tenfold medication error. Although 18 (9. 2 %) required active patient intervention, 96 % of errors were classified as minor at the time of reporting. Forty eight per cent of parents were not told an error had occurred. The introduction of a policy of double checking all drugs dispensed by pharmacy staff led to a reduction in errors from 9. 8 to 6 per year. Changing the error <b>reporting</b> <b>form</b> to make it less punitive increased the error reporting rate from 32. 7 to 38 per year.  CONCLUSION—The overall medication error rate was low.

DESIGN [...] Study of all such attempts at resuscitation over 32 months, based on the <b>standard</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> for each call made by the ambulance staff and the electrocardiogram that showed the initial rhythm in each patient. SETTING [...] Area covered by West Yorkshire ambulance service. SUBJECTS [...] 1196 Patients with cardiac arrests attended by 29 ambulance staff with extended training. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Result of resuscitation. RESULTS [...] The initial rhythm was asystole or electromechanical dissociation in 740 patients and ventricular fibrillation in 456 patients; overall 65 patients survived to be discharged from hospital. Sixty four of the 456 patients in whom ventricular fibrillation was the initial rhythm recorded, and 46 in whom ventricular fibrillation persisted after the ambulance staff arrived, survived. Only one of the 740 patients who initially had asystole or electromechanical dissociation survived. Factors associated with a greater chance of ventricular fibrillation occurring were: age less than 71, the arrest being witnessed by a bystander, resuscitation by a bystander, the arrest occurring in a public place, and a response time by the ambulance staff of less than six minutes. For patients found in ventricular fibrillation a shorter response time was associated with improved survival but resuscitation by a bystander was not. Additional skills learnt during extended training were used for 51 of the 65 patients who survived. CONCLUSIONS [...] Ambulance staff with extended training can {{save the lives of}} patients with cardiac arrest due to fibrillation, though asystole and electromechanical dissociation have a poor prognosis and should perhaps receive little attention during extended training...|$|R

Although {{digital and}} videotaped images {{are known to}} be {{comparable}} for the evaluation of left ventricular function, their relative accuracy for assessment of more complex anatomy is unclear. We sought to compare reading time, storage costs, and concordance of video and digital interpretations across multiple observers and sites. Methods. One hundred one patients with valvular (90 mitral, 48 aortic, 80 tricuspid) disease were selected prospectively, and studies were stored according to video and standardized digital protocols. The same reviewer interpreted video and digital images independently and at different times {{with the use of a}} <b>standard</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> to evaluate 40 items (eg, severity of stenosis or regurgitation, leaflet thickening, and calcification) as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal Concordance between modalities was expressed at kappa Major discordance (difference of > 1 level of severity) was ascribed to the modality that gave the lesser severity. CD-ROM was used to store digital data (20 : 1 lossy compression), and super-VHS video-tape was used to store video data The reading time and storage costs for each modality were compared Results. Measured parameters were highly concordant (ejection fraction was 52 % +/- 13 % by both). Major discordance was rare, and lesser values were reported with digital rather than video interpretation in the categories of aortic and mitral valve thicken ing (1 % to 2 %) and severity of mitral regurgitation (2 %). Digital reading time was 6. 8 +/- 2. 4 minutes, 38 % shorter than with video (11. 0 +/- 3. 0, range 8 to 22 minutes, P 14 megabytes (range 26 to 96 megabytes). Storage cost for video was A$ 0. 62 per patient (18 studies per tape, total cost A$ 11. 20), compared with A$ 0. 31 per patient for digital storage (8 studies per CD-ROM, total cost A$ 2. 50). Conclusion. Digital and video interpretation were highly concordant; in the few cases of major discordance, the digital scores were lower, perhaps reflecting undersampling. Use of additional views and longer clips may be indicated to minimize discordance with video in patients with complex problems. Digital interpretation offers a significant reduction in reading times and the cost of archiving...|$|R
40|$|Surveillance system overview: {{national}} typhoid and paratyphoid fever surveillance. Infection with Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (the causative {{agent of}} typhoid fever) causes an estimated 20 million cases of typhoid fever and 200, 000 deaths annually worldwide. In the United States, typhoid fever {{is now a}} rare disease, with about 400 laboratory- confirmed cases reported per year. Not all cases are diagnosed; however, the total annual number of Salmonella serotype Typhi infections is estimated at 5, 750 cases per year, 1, 900 of them acquired in the United States. Dramatic declines in incidence of and mortality from typhoid fever occurred in the United States after widespread implementation of municipal water and sewage treatment systems {{in the first half}} of the 20 th century. In recent years, most cases in the United States have been associated with foreign travel. Since 1975, using a <b>standard</b> <b>report</b> <b>form,</b> state and local health officials have reported detailed epidemiologic information, including patient demographic and clinical information, typhoid vaccination status, and travel history, on laboratory-confirmed cases of typhoid fever to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A case of typhoid fever is defined as an acute illness compatible with typhoid fever in which Salmonella serotype Typhi is isolated from a normally sterile site or from stool or urine. Travel-associated typhoid fever is defined as illness in a person who traveled outside of the United States in the 30 days before illness onset, and domestically acquired typhoid fever is defined as illness in a person without such a travel history. Paratyphoid fever, which is caused by Salmonella serotypes Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B 1, and Paratyphi C, is not nationally notifiable. However, in 2008 the surveillance system was expanded, becoming National Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever Surveillance, to allow state and local health departments to also report information on cases of paratyphoid fever. The national typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever surveillance data are dynamic; data from previous years may change as surveillance case reports are added or corrected.

40|$|User Manual Version 1. 0 Each {{year in the}} United States, {{more than}} 4, 500 infants die {{suddenly}} of no obvious cause. Half of these sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID) are due to {{sudden infant death syndrome}} (SIDS), the leading cause of SUID and of all deaths among infants aged 122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 12 months. The SIDS rate has been declining significantly since the early 1990 s. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) research has found that some deaths that would have been classified as SIDS before 1999 are now being classified as accidental suffocation or unknown/unspecified cause, suggesting that diagnostic and reporting practices have changed. This trend information concerned the CDC because inaccurate or inconsistent cause-of-death determination and reporting hamper the ability to monitor national trends, ascertain risk factors, and design and evaluate programs to prevent these deaths. Many SUID cases are not investigated, and when they are, cause-of-death data are not collected and reported consistently. Inaccurate classification of cause and manner of death hampers prevention efforts and researchers are unable to adequately monitor national trends, identify risk factors, or evaluate intervention programs. We need valid and reliable data to support research and prevention efforts if we want to reduce these infant deaths. In 2003, CDC began leading the effort to revise the 1996 Sudden Unexplained Infant Death Investigation (SUIDI) <b>Reporting</b> <b>Form</b> and Guidelines for the scene investigation, as well as actively educating and disseminating training materials on infant death scene investigations to improve inaccurate classification of SUID in the United States. In 2004, CDC's Division of Reproductive Health (DRH) and its partners implemented additional activities aimed at improving the accuracy and consistency of the reporting and classification of SUID deaths. These activities included {{the development of a new}} <b>standard</b> investigation <b>reporting</b> <b>form,</b> training curriculum materials for conducting a thorough SUID death scene investigation, a planned effort to disseminate and promote the use of these SUID investigations tools and materials, and the development of a SUID case registry. The new Sudden Unexplained Infant Death Investigation (SUIDI) <b>Reporting</b> <b>Form,</b> including the electronic version (EV), was developed to standardize and improve data collected at infant death scenes. This new <b>reporting</b> <b>form</b> replaces the 1996 Guidelines for the Death Scene Investigation of Sudden Unexplained Infant Death and the Investigation <b>Report</b> <b>Form</b> (SUIDIRF) ...|$|R
30|$|The TSCT were {{constructed}} based on Swartz’s thinking framework. The TSCT consisted of 55 multiple-choice items with four options measuring critical thinking skill constructs of comparing and contrasting (20 items), sequencing (20 items) and identifying {{cause and effect}} (15 items). These items {{were constructed}} based on the contents of Year Five Science Curriculum and Assessment Standard Document (Curriculum Development Centre 2013). The contents of the Malaysian syllabus are documented in the Standard Curriculum and Assessment Document. The Year Five Science Curriculum contents are divided into six themes, namely Introduction to the Science, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Material Science, Earth and Space Science and Technology and Sustainable Living. Teachers record student achievement for each topic thematically in a document called a Year Five Science <b>Standard</b> Performance <b>Reporting</b> <b>Form</b> (SSPRF) issued by the Ministry of Education. Results from analysis of the SSPRF document in 2014 found that Physical Science as a theme was less mastered by students (Ministry of Education 2014). Therefore, the TSCT items {{were taken from the}} Physical Sciences theme, which mostly related to technological products. All these items were reviewed by a group of experts before final versions were designed. The TSCT was presented in the Malay language to ensure that the sample population understood each item before responding. An expert in Malay language proof read the TSCT items. The details of the review of the TSCT items will be further discussed in “Data analysis” section.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Postherpetic {{neuralgia}} (PHN) is {{a common}} ailment that pain specialists must often cope with. The goal of the present survey is to investigate the pain characteristics of 119 PHN patients with persistent pain seen at different pain clinics. Methods information on demographic features, pain characteristics (MPQ-SV, VAS, VRS), and treatment was recorded {{by means of a}} <b>standard</b> case <b>report</b> <b>form.</b> Results: Gender, age, location, and treatment were consistent with previous reports. Antidepressant, antiepileptic, and analgesic drugs were the most commonly used by patients. The patients seen in pain clinics are probably a subset of severe cases of PHN, where delayed referral to these units plays an important role. The most frequent qualitative features of the disease were the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Spanish Version (MPQ-SV). These features may change in relation to illness evolution; electric shocklike pain and emotional distress were significantly higher after 6 months of evolution and age (those younger than 70 were more able to locate painful areas and to feel pain as pricking or sharp), and gender (men selected spatial pressure and traction pressure more frequently). None of the explored variables was relevant to predicting pain intensity. Conclusions: This study reveals a subset of patients, mostly suffering from long-term PHN, where pain persists. The most frequent qualitative traits of PHN patients are described. Some variables were involved in modulation of pain characteristics in these patients. The effect of study design in interpretation of results is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeAtherothrombosis is a {{generalized}} disease affecting different vascular beds, {{making it the}} leading cause of death worldwide. To evaluate the long-term risk of atherothrombotic risk factors and determine the predictors for atherothrombotic events, an international, prospective, observational study was initiated, in which Taiwan was involved. MethodsThe REduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry recruited outpatients with either symptomatic atherothrombotic diseases or multiple risk factors. Baseline data were collected using a universal <b>standard</b> case <b>report</b> <b>form.</b> All subjects were followed to document future outcomes. In this paper, we analyzed the baseline data of the participants from Taiwan. ResultsIn the REACH Registry, a total of 67, 888 subjects from 44 countries were recruited. Among the 1062 Taiwanese participants, 971 were symptomatic subjects and 91 subjects were with risk factors only (RFO). In comparison with the global participants, the Taiwan patients were younger, with a higher prevalence of males, lower prevalence of hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, former smokers, and a greater prevalence of non-smokers. The baseline prevalence rates were: hypertension, 46. 5 %; fasting hyperglycemia, 38. 4 %; hypercholesterolemia, 45. 8 %; and hypertriglyceridemia, 42. 8 %. All these prevalence were higher than the global data, indicating an undertreatment status for the Taiwanese patients. Only 29 (2. 7 %) peripheral arterial disease (PAD) subjects were recruited in Taiwan, suggesting underrecognition of this disease. The RFO Taiwanese patients had fewer former smokers and more non-smokers than the symptomatic patients, suggesting that smoking may be an important factor contributing to atherothrombotic diseases. ConclusionIn Taiwan, atherothrombotic outpatients were generally undertreated and PAD was under-diagnosed...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{measure the}} {{prevalence}} of assessment and management practices for analgesia, sedation and delirium in patients in Australian and New Zealand intensive care units. Materials and methods: We developed survey items from a modified Delphi panel and included them in a binational, point prevalence study. We used a <b>standard</b> case <b>report</b> <b>form</b> to capture retrospective patient data on management of analgesia, sedation and delirium {{at the end of}} a 4 -hour period on the study day. Other data were collected during independent assessment of patient status and medication requirements. Results: Data were collected on 569 patients in 41 ICUs. Pain assessment was documented in the 4 hours before study observation in 46 % of patients. Of 319 assessable patients, 16 % had moderate pain and 6 % had severe pain. Routine sedation assessment using a scale was recorded in 63 % of intubated and ventilated patients. When assessed, 38 % were alert and calm, or drowsy and rousable, 22 % were lightly to moderately sedated, 31 % were deeply sedated (66 % of these had a documented indication), and 9 % were agitated or restless. Sedatives were titrated to a target level in 42 % of patients. Routine assessment of delirium occurred in 3 %, and at study assessment 9 % had delirium. Wrist or arm restraints were used for 7 % of patients. Conclusions: Only two-thirds of sedated patients had their sedation levels formally assessed, half had pain assessed and very few had formal assessment of delirium. Our description of current practices, and other observational data, may help in planning further research in this area. 7 page(s...|$|R
