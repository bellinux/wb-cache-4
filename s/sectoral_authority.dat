40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the recent financial crisis, the European legislator has strictly recommended the introduction of deeper forms of intervention to the European Authorities, also re-distribuiting the relations between the latter and the national <b>sectoral</b> <b>authorities.</b> In this renewed context, there is also a significant change {{in the way in which}} domestic control bodies - now linked to the inputs of the European Authorities in terms of modus operandi - intervene in the market in order to ensure their stability and equilibrium. However, significant differences in the relationships between the various national market-specific Authorities in the market and the corresponding European Authorities are still alive; in this respect, it is worth mentioning that Europan Authorities do not actually reflect a uniform disciplinary framework (with obvious consequences on the content and the modalities of the actions that can be take into account). There is therefore a difference in the relationship between the national authorities and the intermediaries involved in the their sphere of action. Moreover, if it is true that in the medium to long-term perspective, a broader transfer of powers from the national authorities to the European ones (in view of a more complete definition / determination of the supervisory policies) will take place it is very likely that this event will occur only after the definition of the single rule book, which presumably will be followed by a strengthening of the supervisory convergence and a stronger role of ESMA, as suggested by its recent documents...|$|R

The findings conclude: First, the factors used in the development policy model by the government is less relevant with the area characteristics, including bureaucracy culture which is still <b>sectoral,</b> weak <b>authority</b> of border management board, inconsistency between technical policy and the border development paradigm, and isolated geographical condition which needs extra-ordinary treatment. Second, cross border approach is quite strategic to be policy model alternative for border development with some of its strength, among many, the program discussed is beneficial for both parties, the program is interest-based and the implementation is responded quickly by the government without undergoing complicated sectoral level...|$|R
50|$|Some social {{scientists}} {{have criticized the}} approach of Carl Joachim Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski, arguing that the Soviet system, both as a political and as a social entity, was in fact better {{understood in terms of}} interest groups, competing elites, or even in class terms (using the concept of the nomenklatura as a vehicle for a new ruling class). These critics pointed to evidence of popular support for the regime and widespread dispersion of power, at least in the implementation of policy, among <b>sectoral</b> and regional <b>authorities.</b> For some followers of this 'pluralist' approach, this was evidence of the ability of the regime to adapt to include new demands. However, proponents of the totalitarian model claimed that the failure of the system to survive showed not only its inability to adapt but the mere formality of supposed popular participation.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. This {{study was}} driven by a need that was {{identified}} within a <b>sectoral</b> training <b>authority</b> in South Africa to modify its talent management strategy {{in order to better}} deliver on its mandate. The need to modify its talent management strategy was identified {{as a result of a}} review of the Sector Education and Training Authorities (Setas) on their functioning and management commissioned by The National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac). The aim was to identify critical challenges affecting their ability to deliver on their mandate and to develop recommendations to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness The review exercise was completed and report submitted to the office of the presidency. The report notes that due to the largely negative publicity Setas have received, their ability to source, attract and retain talent for effective and efficient functioning is severely restricted. It also highlights the fact that high attrition rates have resulted in a lack of institutional knowledge and understanding of the purpose of the skills development legislation and policies. It further recommends that an audit of current Seta human resources procedures be conducted, as well as the development of standard competency profiles for senior managers to inform recruitment, performance management, training and development, assessment of current capacity and the development of a generic induction programme. It concludes by recommending the implementation of various interventions to support Seta management, including executive coaching, mentoring and other organisational development support. This study was therefore focused on two parts: the development of a broad talent framework based on the latest literature on the subject of talent management, and secondly, the evaluation of the training authority's current talent management practice based on employee perceptions. The initial part of this study describes the development of a talent management evaluation with a broad talent management framework addressing the themes of planning, development and training, performance management, reward management as well as the related sub- themes. This objective was achieved by means of a literature search supported by input from industry practitioners. The questionnaire consists of 35 statements subdivided into eight categories contextualised under different talent management sub themes. The sample consisted of 44 employees, six of which were at management level and 38 were at non managerial level. Thirty-five questionnaires were returned of which three could not be used. The questionnaire was then administered to examine the perceptions of the 35 employees who provided usable feedback on the training authority‟s performance, based on eight themes of talent management practices. The empirical results revealed that the training authority did not have strategies to ensure that there is a pool of talent to draw from in order to meet current and future needs. Concerns were raised on the training authority's ability to retain talented employees within the organisation. Issues relating to the creation and modification of roles and job descriptions to help individuals realise their career aspirations were raised. Employees were also concerned about the training authority's inability to provide resources for the support of individuals' career plans. Employees further raised transparency issues on expected behaviour, development and factors identifying individual's potential as major concerns. Reward and compensation were found to have a weak link to performance and market offering. Managers were found to have limited flexibility in distributing their pay budget...|$|R
40|$|There is {{the need}} for a legal {{instrument}} that would first and foremost establish the executive powers of a new entity with overarching responsibilities and powers over all the <b>authorities</b> that have <b>sectoral</b> responsibilities for climate change. Such a legal instrument should also identify these <b>sectoral</b> <b>authorities</b> and their responsibilities, preferably within an Annex which could be amended and adjusted in a flexible manner. This instrument should be managed by a new unit on climate change within MRA and it should ensure integration without causing fragmentation between the sectors. At the same time, retaining the sectoral input would ensure that there is no duplication of roles, that the institutions are specialised within their own field and that the overarching institution does not becomes a bottle neck. In other words, different competent authorities responsible for the different sectoral policies and obligations should remain, but these must be answerable to an institution that has executive powers to ensure compliance and to coordinate long and short term planning with respect to climate change targets and impacts. By way of recommendation therefore, a legal instrument of this sort should seek to intervene as little as possible in the daily running of the sectoral policies and only apply its powers in situations of emergency when non compliance by the different sectors stalls the fulfilment of Malta’s obligations. Its main role should be to ensure implementation of a National Strategy on Mitigation and Adaptation. This legal instrument would not duplicate the role of public institutions that are already regulators for various sectors on climate change. It would however empower the new entity to take enforcement measures against the said institutions if they fail to do so. It would also ensure the implementation and enforcement of existing legislation that regulates the various sectors in order to rationalize their sustainable use and provide for conservation measures. This would benefit both the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures. An entity entrusted with the overall responsibility for climate change law and policy must be legally empowered to ensure the implementation of national adaptation programmes. It must also coordinate the various sectors to carry out the necessary research to adopt and implement mitigation and adaptation measures. It must necessarily be supported by a parallel capacity building process in the various entities that run the day-to- day implementation functions. On an administrative level, without necessarily being included in a legal instrument, memoranda of understanding and stakeholder dialogue are indispensable tools to ensure cooperation. This will facilitate reaching mitigation and adaptation targets within the stipulated time frames. The mainstreaming of climate change impacts in national policies ensures the adoption of mitigation and adaptation measures and guarantees synergy and linkages amongst various public plans and programmes. Response to climate change should take place at a strategic level to assess beforehand the socio-economic impacts of any mitigation and adaptation measures adopted as a consequence prior to mainstreaming into national policy making. The existing Regulations on the Strategic Environment Assessment already include climate change impacts as {{one of the issues that}} needs to be taken into consideration in an SEA. Furthermore, for all those situations where an SEA is not required, Maltese authorities should promote pro-active adaptation measures such as, for example, in development planning, rather than take reactive adaptation measures. The new climate change legal instrument must ensure effective monitoring and stakeholder engagement, particularly the involvement of NGOS and Local Councils which increases public awareness on climate change issues. The new law should also take into consideration national security issues relating to climate change when formulating mitigation and adaptation strategies. The new law should also target the development of a research programme for climate change, including access to funding programmes. It is vital that Investment in research and development in all sectors should not remain on a voluntary basis. It will provide local industry with the necessary technology and it will generate specialised local expertise in a rapidly growing sector that is assuming a tremendous economic potential. Procrastination is detrimental on two main fronts. First because Malta will miss out in securing a place in this niche-market and second because we will keep relying upon foreign technology and expertise. Since Malta can rely on and pool from the scientific and technical advice of the European Environmental agency, it is best to concentrate on investing in scientific and technical research that addresses the local scenario. This should be earmarked as a priority for EU funded projects and care should be taken not to duplicate research conducted by EU agencies to which Malta has access, but rather to build upon it and apply it at the local level. It is also essential to include as a legal obligation the publication to civil society of information acquired as a result of research conducted at the EU level or carried out locally. It must be ensured that all sectors surmount the constraints due to the lack of a sound knowledge base on local ecosystem dynamics. Filling such a gap would serve to build local scientific evidence that would identify to what extent marine, terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna groups are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Emphasis should be placed on minor and already vulnerable groups. All sectors should be legally bound to maintain a Geographic Information System to integrate data related to climate change, and any other data required apart from spatial information. Adopting and implementing the recommendations suggested by the National Sustainable Development Strategy for Malta would greatly enhance the implementation of adaptation measures relating to climate change, both on a cross-sectoral and sectoral level. At present it is envisaged that the government is currently preparing a new Bill on sustainable development, in the meantime the applicable provisions of the EPA by virtue of which the sustainable development strategy was published should continue to apply. Malta should also endeavour to promote more regional cooperation in the Mediterranean under the Barcelona Convention framework and Euro Med, to identify the adaptation needs of the Mediterranean littoral to the impacts of climate change. Authorities should initiate immediately, even at the regional Mediterranean level, studies to assess vulnerability due to climate change, how new opportunities may be tapped, how to meet with the negative consequences of climate change in the sector, how to ensure that local operators adapt to the shift in tourism trends as a result of climate change. There {{is the need}} of systematic and sustained awareness building programmes to educate all. This will intensify awareness and promote a change in behavioural patterns to improve adaptation to climate change. Increasing awareness of climate change impacts within the government, industry, and community sectors will support cultural change transitions that are required for the adoption of more climate change friendly technologies, designs, and operations by public and private operators. The new climate change law should also obligate the various sectors to formulate contingency plans. This serves to: address the negative impacts envisaged as a result of climate change particularly upon vulnerable groups. assess socio-economic implications, with increased insurance covers for risks resulting from the likely impacts of climate change. identify financial guarantees and incentives amongst the various stakeholders in all sectors. peer-reviewe...|$|R
