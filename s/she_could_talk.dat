25|$|She {{attended}} the municipal school {{as soon as}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk.</b> The curriculum was basic and mainly religious; discipline was harsh. Outside she and the other children sang revolutionary ditties, played pranks and took part in rival gang fights. A willful child, she was taken {{at the age of}} ten by her mother to the Church of San Felicisimo in Deusto to be exorcized.|$|E

Og meets with Susan on the bridge under which the gold is hidden and wishes <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk.</b> When she begins to speak, Og realizes they are standing above the gold.|$|E
25|$|Scipione {{followed}} his father shortly afterwards and the eldest sibling Marcantonio then took over power in Favale. Isabella {{grew up in}} a hostile family environment, with a helpless mother and brothers who were uncouth, unruly and brutish. She was deeply affected by the sudden departure of her father, which tormented her {{for the rest of her}} life. She was given a tutor who guided her in the study of Petrarch and Latin poets, and was probably the only person with whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about literature.|$|E

25|$|In all, Binchy {{published}} 16 novels, four short-story collections, a {{play and}} a novella. A 17th novel, A Week in Winter, was published posthumously. Her literary career began with two books of short stories: Central Line (1978) and Victoria Line (1980). She published her debut novel Light a Penny Candle in 1982. In 1983, {{it sold for}} the largest sum ever paid for a first novel: £52,000. The timing was fortuitous, as Binchy {{and her husband were}} two months behind with the mortgage at the time. However, the prolific Binchy – who joked that she could write as fast as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> – ultimately became one of Ireland's richest women.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, Higgins {{began writing}} {{editorial}} columns for the Wall Street Journal. During this time, she also became an assistant editor at Irving Kristol's now-defunct quarterly, The Public Interest. Higgins' editorial writing and policy work {{have led to}} appearances {{on a variety of}} news/commentary programs, including Hardball with Chris Matthews, Politically Incorrect, Real Time with Bill Maher, Crossfire, Equal Time and Good Morning America. With Newt Gingrich, she co-hosted The Progress Report on the now-defunct National Empowerment Television. [...] When asked about Higgins' television appearances, Bill Maher said, [...] "Oh God, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about anything." ...|$|E
500|$|At the age {{of sixteen}} months, Randles enjoyed {{pressing}} keys on the piano and attempting to [...] "pick out a melody". One day, while Randles was ill, he noticed someone attempting to play Blue Bells of Scotland on the nearby piano. Assuming {{it was one of}} his older children, he requested they stopped and was surprised to find it was Randles who was playing. Due to her age, she needed to hit each key with the side of the hand. He discovered that she could play the basic melody for both the Blue Bells of Scotland and Charley over the water. Her father decided to start teaching her some other simple tunes and the musical notes. Before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk,</b> she had the ability to recognise notes and press the piano keys which related to them. Her father went on to teach Randles the melody to the Welsh folk song, Ar hyd y nos. Randles also attempted to play the chords so her father ended up teaching her the full piece.|$|E

500|$|The {{repercussions of}} the {{euthanasia}} for Dot's character {{have been described}} as [...] "extremely serious" [...] as she suffered from [...] "untold guilt and felt that she needed to be punished for the action." [...] The Executive Producer overseeing this storyline, John Yorke, has discussed the storyline in a speech given at the Bishops' Conference for clergy and other ministers in the Diocese of St Albans: [...] "Dot, as a good Christian, refused to help, until her love for her friend overcame her own fear of damnation. Riddled with an intolerable burden of guilt, she felt there was only one person <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to [...] The Dot and Ethel storyline played out in over four months with many similar scenes, to an average audience of 16 million viewers. Dot [...] explored the full panoply of religious belief before coming back to terms with her maker. When Alan Bookbinder took over as head of religious broadcasting at the BBC he described EastEnders for the weeks the Dot and Ethel story ran as 'the best religious programme on television' and compared [...] to Graham Greene. While we felt a little uncomfortable in such exalted company, what it did show is that handled properly an audience is able to engage in, and relate to profound ethical debate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The affair led to {{pop culture}} celebrity for Lewinsky, {{as she had}} {{become the focus of}} a {{political}} storm. Her immunity agreement restricted what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about publicly, but she was able to cooperate with Andrew Morton in his writing of Monica's Story, her biography which included her side of the Clinton affair. The book was published in March 1999; it was also excerpted as a cover story in TIME magazine. [...] On March 3, 1999, Barbara Walters interviewed Lewinsky on ABC's 20/20. The program was watched by 70 million Americans, which ABC said was a record for a news show. Lewinsky made about $500,000 from her participation in the book and another $1 million from international rights to the Walters interview, but was still beset by high legal bills and living costs.|$|E
2500|$|He {{constantly}} avoids {{talking to}} his mother (Clare Coulter) who keeps calling him at work. Telling people to tell her {{he is in a}} meeting or on vacation, he {{even went so far as}} to have an intern get the telephone number to the show changed. When asked why he refused to talk to her he replies, [...] "Talk to her? You're missing the point. The point is, this place is too cheap to get me an assistant. If I had an assistant, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to my mother. But because this place is so goddamn cheap, my mother has no one to talk to." [...] Findlay does, however, have a close relationship with his BMW dealer, often calling him about small problems with his [...] "$40,000 German car." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{time during}} early to mid-1972 the Riglers overheard Genie saying, [...] "Father hit big stick. Father is angry." [...] to herself, demonstrating that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> {{about her life}} before she had started to learn language. During {{the rest of her}} stay with the Riglers she would {{constantly}} repeat, [...] "Father hit" [...] to herself, and before the Riglers worked with Genie to understand the concept of death she often asked them where her father was, afraid that he would come to get her. Although she did not speak to others about her childhood often she gave researchers valuable new information when she did, and the scientists tried to get Genie to tell them as much as possible. As she learned more language, she gradually began to speak about her father and his treatment of her in greater detail.|$|E
2500|$|Ben Travers of IndieWire {{discussed}} the episode's approach to technology through Gloria's. He felt {{that while the}} episode made the viewer relate to Gloria's views on technology, showing Officer Hunt's obsession with Facebook as shallow, or with Unit MNSKY being deemed obsolete {{at the end of}} his journey just like Gloria's new chief makes her feel like; however, it also [...] "supported the advancement of society, to an admittedly lesser degree", with the absence of cell phones for Gloria and her son Nathan forcing her partner Donny to stop the school bus so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to her son, or the fact that the WGA's records not being electronic forcing Gloria to wait a long time for the results. Questioning the symbolism of the mysterious useless box Gloria finds, he felt that it [...] "felt targeted: Who would build such a useless machine? Every time you turn it on, it turns itself off. Does it represent Gloria’s feelings toward technology? That it’s more trouble than it’s worth? Is it a message left for her by someone — Ray Wise’s omnipresent frequent flier, Paul Marrane? Is it a reverse macguffin, a literal object meant to mean more to the show’s themes than the plot itself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was sure}} of you!" [...] Mrs. Gereth returned. But this didn't {{diminish}} the satisfaction taken by Fleda in showing how serenely and lucidly <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk.</b>|$|E
60|$|The grass, {{crushed and}} trampled and {{littered}} with paper, and orange peel, gave out a fresh farm-like odor, that {{helped her to}} recover herself. She would not <b>talk,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> yet. <b>She</b> only urged them to go home. She wanted {{to get home to}} think.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, thank you, let Charlotte;' {{for with}} her troubled feelings, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> better answer <b>talking</b> girls than parry the remarks of her shrewd, observant brother.|$|R
60|$|Calthea Rose did {{not like}} to hear herself speak in a voice which might show how she was feeling, and as there was no use of staying there if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk,</b> <b>she</b> rose to leave, and, in spite of Mrs. Petter's hospitable entreaty to make a longer stay, she departed.|$|R
60|$|He {{got what}} he wanted, paid for it, and nodded a good evening to the grocer and his wife (she {{was a woman who}} could do more than nod; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk).</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure I know. Many's {{the time}} I tould her so. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> the birds off the bushes, and it wint to me heart to refuse her. God send her {{well out of}} her throuble!" ...|$|E
60|$|It lasted {{through the}} day, {{and she could}} see that he was troubled. It had not {{followed}} upon any imprudeuce, as Mrs. Lander pathetically called Clementina to witness when her pain had been so far quelled that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> of her seizure.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Thomas Ryder {{went out}} of the room, and Mr. Warren went with him. They left the door ajar, so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hear them <b>talking</b> in the hall. Mr. Warren said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Magdalen, rousing herself. [...] "It {{has made}} her look ten years older, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> it over or let a word be said to comfort her. She says it was all her fault, and I should {{have thought it was}} that silly little Sister Mena's, if that is her name.|$|R
60|$|He {{was moved}} by the {{vibrating}} quality of the last words. She seemed to be talking low of some wonderful enchantment, in mysterious terms of special significance. He thought that if <b>she</b> only <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to him in some unknown tongue, she would enslave him altogether by the sheer beauty of the sound, suggesting infinite depths of wisdom and feeling.|$|R
60|$|Miss Panney {{did not let}} her steak get cold, for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> and eat at {{the same}} time, {{and the founder of}} Methodism never {{delivered}} so scorching a tirade against pomp and show in professors of religion as she gave forth in his name.|$|E
60|$|Lady Underhill, {{having said}} {{all she had}} to say, {{recovered}} her breath and began to say it again. Frequent iteration was one of her strongest weapons. As her brother Edwin, who was fond of homely imagery, had often observed, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> the hind-leg off a donkey.|$|E
60|$|As {{they sat}} sewing together, Jo {{discovered}} how much improved her sister Meg was, how well <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk,</b> {{how much she}} knew about good, womanly impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was in husband and children, {{and how much they}} were all doing for each other.|$|E
60|$|So the Princess prattled {{on without}} needing much reply, until her namesake had {{finished}} her work, {{with which she}} was well pleased, and promised to remember her. To Anne it was an absolute marvel how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> thus <b>talk</b> when <b>she</b> knew {{that her husband had}} deserted her father in his need, and that things were in a most critical position.|$|R
60|$|On {{this subject}} Mary found her tongue loosened. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> about Frank Gresham, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> speak with hope {{to the mother}} of her only son. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> say that Sir Louis was still very young; that there was reason to trust that he might now reform; that his present conduct was {{apparently}} good; and that he appeared capable of better things. So much she did say; and the mother took her sympathy for more than it was worth.|$|R
60|$|Every one felt dizzy, {{and there}} was no space for aught but action. Perhaps Albinia was glad of the hurry, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> to Gilbert till she had learnt to put faith in him, and she would rather do him {{substantial}} kindnesses than be made the sharer of feelings that had too often proved like the growth of the seed which found no depth of earth.|$|R
