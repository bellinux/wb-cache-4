5|$|At {{the time}} it was thought that Alpha was the twenty-second storm of the season, and <b>so</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> storm which broke the 1933 season's record for most storms in a single season. However post-season {{analysis}} revealed that there was also a previously unnoticed subtropical storm on October4, which made Alpha the twenty-third storm of the season. Alpha was the first tropical storm to be assigned a Greek-alphabet name after the list of hurricane names was exhausted.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and <b>so</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Cyclones' ninth-place {{finish in}} the Big 12 with a 3–6 conference record, their record made them the Big 12's last bowl {{eligible}} team (the only team in the conference not to do <b>so</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Kansas Jayhawks). They won three of their first four games in September beating Tulsa, Western Illinois, and Iowa. They lost on September 29 to conference foe Texas Tech. In October, the Cyclones went 2–2. They defeated #13 ranked TCU and Baylor, but lost to Kansas State and Oklahoma State. They lost three of their four games in November, but did manage to defeat Kansas, who were the only Big 12 team to finish with a worse in-conference record than Iowa State. 2012 was the Cyclones' second Liberty Bowl, following the 1972 game in which they lost to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets by a score of 31–30.|$|E
5|$|McCann {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 24 August 1914 at Morphettville, South Australia. He was allotted to the South Australian-raised 10th Battalion, part of the 3rd Brigade, as a private with the regimental number 405. Within a week he had been {{promoted}} to sergeant. The battalion embarked for overseas in October, and sailed via Albany, Western Australia, to Egypt, arriving in early December. While the force was training in Egypt he was appointed as a platoon sergeant in the battalion's D Company. After completing training, the 3rd Brigade was designated as the covering force for the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April 1915, and <b>so</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first brigade ashore about 4:30 am. Four days later McCann was appointed as company sergeant major. During that period, the 10th Battalion suffered casualties of 13 officers and 453 men. On 19 May the battalion helped fight off a concerted Turkish counter-attack against the landing force, after which it settled into a routine of rotating through various positions in the line. Due to his outstanding service during the period 6 May to 28 June McCann was mentioned several times in Australian and New Zealand Army Corps routine orders. In July, McCann {{and most of the}} battalion had a three day rest on the island of Imbros, but were quickly back in the trenches at Anzac. McCann was commissioned in the rank of second lieutenant on 4 August, by which time nearly half of the battalion had been evacuated sick with dysentery. He was promoted to lieutenant on 14 November. McCann remained at Anzac, serving as battalion intelligence and signalling officer, until the unit was withdrawn to the island of Lemnos in late November, followed by evacuation to Egypt the following month.|$|E

25|$|The {{downfall}} {{of the orchestra}} occurred in 1990. Due to the civil wars in Yugoslavia the Belgrade Philharmonic was banned from playing internationally for some time.

As industrial capitalism and wage labour began to expand, eliminating the competition from slavery became economically advantageous.|$|E

25|$|In 1868 Huxley became Principal of the South London Working Men's College in Blackfriars Road. The moving {{spirit was}} a {{portmanteau}} worker, Wm.

At sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by Huxley, this was some bargain; and <b>so</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> free library organised by the college, an idea which was widely copied. Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were as good as any country squire.|$|E

Maurice had already visited Anchialos and other cities in Thrace personally in 590, to oversee reconstruction and to boost the morale of his troops and the local population. After making peace with Persia, he sped up this development by redeploying troops to the Balkans.|$|E
