5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E
5|$|As {{an adult}} Reich wrote extensively, in his diary, about his sexual precocity. He {{maintained}} {{that his first}} <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> was {{at the age of}} four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a bed), that he would regularly watch the farm animals have sex, that he used a whip handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that he had almost daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of the servants. He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E
5|$|Crowley had {{his first}} {{significant}} mystical experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896. Several biographers, including Lawrence Sutin, Richard Kaczynski, and Tobias Churton, believed {{that this was the}} result of Crowley's first same-sex <b>sexual</b> <b>experience,</b> which enabled him to recognise his bisexuality. At Cambridge, Crowley maintained a vigorous sex life with women—largely with female prostitutes, from one of whom he caught syphilis—but eventually he took part in same-sex activities, despite their illegality. In October 1897, Crowley met Herbert Charles Pollitt, president of the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club, and the two entered into a relationship. They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley's increasing interest in Western esotericism, a break-up that Crowley would regret for many years.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> are an {{important}} part of everyday life, yet little research has taken place to understand it’s implication in the leisure realm. As leisure scholars adopt a holistic view of the individual, one’s <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> remain a critical element devoid of empirical research. The current study examined the linkages between leisure and <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> for six couples in the life stage of early adulthood. Findings revealed that relationally, couples conceptualized <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> as a means to express love. At an individual level, it was clear that leisurely dimensions including intrinsic motivation, perceived freedom, involvement, arousal, mastery and spontaneity were present in some <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> This research provides support that <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> can be plotted on Neulinger’s (1981) Leisure Continuum highlighting the work-like and/or leisurely aspects of relational <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of peers regarding adolescent <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> among Dutch adolescents. Following the Social Norm Theory, three peer norms were tested independently: peer <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences,</b> peer <b>sexual</b> attitudes and peer pressure. In addition, a fourth peer norm – communication with peers – was tested. Also it was examined whether the relationships were moderated by age. Adolescents (n = 1132) aged 10 to 18 filled out online questionnaires about their <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> As expected, results showed {{a positive relationship between}} all four peer norms and adolescent <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> Expected was that these relationships would be stronger for younger adolescents, but this was only confirmed for peer pressure.

5|$|In 2008 The Scientific World Journal {{published}} research {{in which women}} with long-term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson. They said the Magic Wand's large head effectively created a vibrating sensation {{in the area of}} the clitoris and vulva without superficial discomfort. Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 500 chronically anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The Scientific World Journal research was subsequently discussed in a literature review published in 2010 by The Journal of Sexual Medicine. Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' levels of <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> and assess changes in their sexual expectations.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E
5|$|When God Writes Your Love Story was {{received}} positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story {{in his book}} If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing {{about the importance of}} listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> is attractive.|$|E
40|$|Given {{the large}} sociocultural {{emphasis}} on appearance and the widespread incidence {{of a negative}} body image in current society, scientific understanding of its potential psychological and physical health consequences, including sexual problems, is now of particular importance. The value of understanding the way body image and <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> are linked lies eventually in using that knowledge to improve mental {{health care in the}} context of sexual problems. The aim of this thesis was to answer the following questions: Which aspects of body image are most relevant in the context of <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences?</b> And what are important mechanisms or mediating variables by which body image affects <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences?</b> To answer these questions, a literature review was conducted first. The resultsindicated that women’s body concerns are related to decreased sexual functioning and may interfere with sexual pleasure, sexual satisfaction, and sexual behavior. Negative cognitions about one’s physical appearance and self-consciousness during sexual activity seem to be key factors in understanding the relationships between body image and <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> The existing research, however, turned out to be limited in terms of attention to positive aspects of body image and <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences,</b> distinguishing general body image (i. e., one’s general feelings and evaluations about one’s body without specifying a particular situational context) from body image in a sexual context, research in males, and incorporating partner-related cognitions and evaluations. These gaps in the existing literature were addressed in five online survey studies in samples of Dutch college students. The results indicated that a positive general body image may prevent exaggerated self-consciousness of one’s body in a sexual context, which in turn facilitates positive <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> Furthermore, (positive) body image was found to be equally strongly associated with <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> in men as in women. Lastly, romantic attachment and perceived relationship quality were found to be meaningfully related to positive body image and <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> With respect to the main questions of this thesis, it can be concluded that body-related cognitions and evaluations are the most relevant body features in the context of <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> Whereas negative body cognitions and evaluations are related to sexual problems and dissatisfying <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences,</b> positive body cognitions and evaluations are uniquely related to positive and satisfying <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> Cognitions and self-consciousness of one’s body during sexual activity serve as an important mechanism by which body image affects <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> Negative body evaluations may result in exaggerated self-consciousness of one’s body in a sexual context which may be distracting, thereby interfering with pleasure of the <b>experience</b> and <b>sexual</b> satisfaction. On the other hand, positive body evaluations may prevent distraction by negative appearance-related thoughts during sexual activity, which in turn facilitates focusing on sexual pleasure and positive <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> Besides, partner-related cognitions and evaluations, such as romantic attachment and perceived relationship quality, are meaningfully related to positive body image and <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> The findings of this thesis show the importance of specific attention for positive body image with potentially fruitful practical implications in the context of clinical treatment of sexual problems...|$|R

40|$|Unwanted <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> {{are most}} {{frequently}} examined from the woman's perspective, yet these experiences happen to men as well. Part {{of the reason for}} the paucity of studies on coerced <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> among men is the difficulty in gathering information about such experiences. This study examines the prevalence of unwanted <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> at <b>sexual</b> debut as well as ever among young men aged 12 – 19 years old in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi and Uganda. The data come from nationally-representative surveys and in-depth interviews with approximately 50 young men in each country gathered around 2004. Between 4 and 12 % of young men stated that they were ‘not willing at all’ at sexual debut and between 3 and 6 % said that they had ever experienced unwanted sex. Narratives from in-depth interviews give insights into the context surrounding men's unwanted <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> The sometimes conflicting information provided by the respondents serve to confound rather than illuminate the contexts within which these unwanted <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> occurred, demonstrating that coercion for young men looks extremely different than coercion for young women, spurring us to improve our measures of sexual coercion among men. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify the contributors to optimal <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> At present, {{there is a lack of}} clinical knowledge, research knowledge and in-depth public discourse concerning the nature of healthy sexuality. The theoretical and research literature in this area has focused almost exclusively on defining and conceptualizing sexual dysfunctions with little attention paid to either normal or satisfactory experiences. Very little theory exists on the nature and components of optimal sexuality. To date, no empirical investigations have been done to determine the contributors to optimal <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> In order to identify the contributors to optimal <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences,</b> semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 individuals who reported having experienced “great sex”. A phenomenologically-oriented content analysis was performed on interview transcripts to determine the contributors to optimal <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> Analysis led to the identification of seven major contributors, two pathways towards optimal <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> and two minor contributors. The major contributors included developmental contributors, individual qualities overall, individual qualities in-the moment, skills, relationship qualities overall, relationship qualities in-the-moment and environmental, situational and preparatory contributors. Each of these larger themes was also characterized by a variety of more specific themes. The two pathways that led to optimal <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> included individual qualities that facilitated relationship qualities and relationship qualities that facilitated individual qualities. Finally, the minor contributors consisted of personal proclivities and miscellaneous contributors. Noteworthy findings of this investigation are discussed and then compared and contrasted with existing research and theory.

40|$|This study explores women’s {{experiences}} of sex with men. It {{is based on}} qualitative data collected from eighteen life history interviews. Such an approach provides means for examining women’s <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> over time. The study finds that women give meaning to their <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> through two main discursive representations: the passive, “proper” and sexually obliging girlfriend or wife, and the active and “sexually equal” woman. However, these representations do not capture the entirety of women’s <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> The life history analysis demonstrates that women are not simply inscribed by discourse. Rather, they are embodied beings actively engaged in pursuing sexual identities. Central to the process is {{a relationship between the}} practice of sex and self-reflexivity over time. Finally, the study demonstrates how the process of gaining sexual subjectivity is shaped by the material conditions of women’s lives. For instance, the praxeological circumstances of women’s class or race are powerful in recasting discourses of feminine sexuality, the meanings women ascribe to them, their access to broader <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences,</b> and the kinds of relationships they have with their male partners...|$|R
