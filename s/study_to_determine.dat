5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of UTIs in those with frequent infections. A Cochrane review concluded that the benefit, if it exists, is small. Long-term tolerance is also an issue with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30%. Cranberry juice is thus not currently recommended for this indication. As of 2015, probiotics require further <b>study</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if they are beneficial.|$|E

5|$|As a result, the Army Material Command (AMC) {{conducted}} a <b>study</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if the development objectives were feasible and also established a program {{office for the}} Fire-support Aerial System (FAS). AMC recommended to narrow the competition to compound helicopters, as they were considered the only helicopter configuration at the time capable of being developed to meet the objectives. In March 1964, the Secretary of the Army advised DDRE that modification of existing aircraft would not approach the required performance of the FAS program; the Army would continue using the armed UH-1B until development of the FAS could proceed.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a {{new design}} to replace the RAN's Oberon-class {{submarines}} {{began in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s. Proposals were received from seven companies; two were selected for a funded <b>study</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the winning design, which was announced in mid-1987. The submarines, enlarged versions of Swedish shipbuilder Kockums' Västergötland class and originally referred to as the Type 471, were constructed between 1990 and 2003 in South Australia by the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC).|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the submarine commenced in May 1983, when the government released a request for tender and approached seven of the world's nine diesel-electric submarine manufacturers for submissions. The submissions would be narrowed down to two based on the provided information, with these undergoing a funded <b>study</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the winning design. Tendering companies had to demonstrate how Australian industries would {{be incorporated into the}} project, and that they were willing to establish an Australia-based consortium to construct the submarines. All seven companies responded {{by the end of the}} year: the combined submissions totalling four tonnes (9,000lb) of paper.|$|E

5|$|The third project {{topic was}} disk mass potential. This topic was {{designed}} to make measurements of the distances to disk stars {{as well as their}} proper motions. The results of the third topic of study were to be combined with the results of the fundamental galactic parameters portion of the <b>study</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the Solar System's position and velocity in the galaxy. The final topic dealt with dark matter distribution in the Milky Way. SIM data was to be used to create a three-dimensional model of mass distribution in the Galaxy, out to a radius of 270 kiloparsecs (kps). They were to then use two different tests to determine the galactic potential at large radii.|$|E
5|$|The tribe {{resolved}} {{to place the}} site on the National Historic Registry. In 1976, the National Park Service designated the site as a National Historic Site. By 1993, the tribe had adopted a master plan to try to preserve the buildings and commissioned a <b>study</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> what the cost would be to restore the property. The U.S. government acknowledged {{that some of the}} thirty-five buildings were in poor shape, but maintained that the rest were properly maintained. In 1998, the site was designated by the World Monuments Fund as one of the 100 most endangered sites.|$|E
5|$|When an {{outbreak}} of noma (a gangrenous bacterial disease of the mouth and face) struck the Romani camp in 1943, Mengele initiated a <b>study</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> {{the cause of the}} disease and develop a treatment. He enlisted the aid of prisoner Dr. Berthold Epstein, a Jewish pediatrician and professor at Prague University. Mengele isolated the patients in a separate barrack and had several afflicted children killed so that their preserved heads and organs could be sent to the SS Medical Academy in Graz and other facilities for study. The research was still ongoing when the Romani camp was liquidated and its remaining occupants killed in 1944.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to studies and accounts {{that showed the}} bad condition of the lake, the state restored the fish population of the lake in 1978. In 1985, a study recommended ecological restoration {{of the lake and}} forest, which had been overtaken by invasive species introduced during highway construction. Since then, there have been seven plans for restoring natural elements of the park, as well as three plans for park restoration. Gradual improvements began taking place in the late 1980s, including the addition of new pathways, signage, and security, as well as the restoration of playgrounds and other recreational facilities. In January 1988, NYC Parks conducted a <b>study</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the specific elements of the park that needed restoration. Highway structures were also reconfigured to clean runoff from these structures. An excavation in the 1990s yielded over 2,500 artifacts.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 2008, {{a seven-year-old}} boy accidentally started {{a fire in}} a nearby {{campground}} while playing with matches. The fire moved up the riverbank and destroyed the bridge's wooden deck and rails. The county funded a <b>study</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the feasibility and cost of reconstructing the bridge. The engineers determined that the steel cables and towers most likely did not suffer structural damage and could be reused. The study estimated reconstruction costs at $850,000. The engineers determined the original blueprints, preserved in a museum, were of sufficient quality that only minimal engineering work would be required. The county agreed to direct the effort, but will not fund it with taxpayer money. As replicas do not qualify for historical status, historians are debating if using the original towers and cable is enough for the structure to qualify as historical. Grand County has set up an account for interested parties to donate to the reconstruction effort.|$|E
