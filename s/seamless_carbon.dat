30|$|Upon relaxation, the {{nanotube}} {{segment is}} bent around the defect site {{in order to}} release the strain energy induced by the pentagons and heptagons. The pentagon (heptagon) pair locates in the convex (concave) part of the segment (see Fig. 1 b), passing through a bisector after we adjust the number of carbon atoms on the two ends to make the segment symmetric. Depending on how these basic structural segments are connected, either a nanocoil or a nanotori [9, 29, 30] is formed. As shown in Fig. 1 c, two segments are connected with a certain rotating angle to make the combined structure spiral and to form a <b>seamless</b> hexagonal <b>carbon</b> network.|$|R

40|$|Biaxial {{loading and}} reverse loading tests were {{performed}} using <b>seamless</b> <b>carbon</b> steel tubes. Biaxial stress {{components in the}} axial and circumferential directions were applied to the tubular specimens using a servo-controlled multiaxial tube expansion testing machine developed by Kuwabara and Sugawara (2013). The tubular specimens were loaded under linear tensile stress paths. Contours of plastic work were measured in the principal stress space, and the differential hardening (DH) behavior was observed; {{the shapes of the}} contours of plastic work changed with an increase in plastic work. In addition, small uniaxial tensile specimens were fabricated from the mother tube wall in axial and hoop directions, and tension–compression reverse loading tests were performed to quantitatively evaluate the Bauschinger effect of the test material. Moreover, bilinear stress path experiments were performed to investigate the effects of axial prestraining on the change in the Bauschinger effect; compressive preloading in the axial direction (first loading) was followed by the application of linear stress paths in the first quadrant of the principal stress space (second loading). The measured Bauschinger effect in the second loading was different from those measured in the uniaxial reverse loading tests for the as-received material. The material model will be utilized to improve the accuracy in the numerical analyses of the cold working processes for fabricating steel tubes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{demonstrate}} the tailoring of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) to obtain uniformly sized islands {{of up to}} several microns in size. There has already been some research on manipulating individual sheets on HOPG surfaces with scanning probe microscope tips; such sheets were obtained either accidentally or with a less controllable indenting technique. Here we present a different approach, which is more reliable and controllable. The HOPG surface was first patterned to create an array of small graphite islands by reactive ion etching of the HOPG surface with an oxygen plasma. These islands were then manipulated with an atomic force microscope tip. Carbon nanotubes represent a promising material for nanotechnology and {{can be considered as}} a graphene sheet rolled into a <b>seamless</b> cylinder. While <b>carbon</b> nanotubes are synthesized successfully with laser ablation, carbon arc, or chemical vapour deposition techniques, we speculate that it might be possible, by the controlled fabrication of graphene sheets, to form nanotubes or other novel motifs of use for nanotechnology. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{properties of}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{make them a}} compelling material for use in applications including nanoscale circuits, flexible conductors, battery electrodes, and reinforced composites; and their combination of attractive mechanical, thermal and electrical properties makes CNTs truly unique. However, as with any new material, practical use of CNTs requires efficient and scalable processing methods, and commercial development requires these methods to be compatible with existing manufacturing platforms such as semiconductor processing. This chapter presents a thorough review of methods for integrating CNTs in micro- and nano- devices and systems, focusing on challenges of: controlling CNT size and structure; precisely placing and packing CNTs; and achieving device-compatible growth and processing methods. Examples are selected across the spectrum from early-stage research to present commercialization. Overall, while we are far from meeting the aforementioned challenges, near-term uses of CNTs will include interconnects, non-volatile memory, inertial sensors, and thermal interfaces. 1.

40|$|The {{motivation}} of this dissertation is developing neural prosthetic devices for chronic brain-computer interface. To maintain a chronically sustainable brain-computer interface, implantable devices should have minimal chronic inflammation, mechanically compliance with neural tissue, {{and long term}} durability under physiological conditions. Traditional neural prosthetic devices can seldom fulfill these requirements. This dissertation presents a nanocomposite approach to design the next generation neural prosthetic devices. The rationally designed nanocomposite can achieve {{the combination of the}} desired material properties for neural prosthetic devices, currently unattainable by traditional materials. In this dissertation, we first fabricated a mechanically compliant neural electrode from <b>carbon</b> nanotubes. The <b>seamless</b> integration of <b>carbon</b> nanotubes and polymer offered both mechanical flexibility and electrical conductivity for neural prosthetic devices. Then we explored other nanomaterials to design more exceptional nanocomposites. The gold nanoparticle nanocomposite developed in this research outperformed carbon nanotube composite in term of electrochemical performance. Additionally, we utilized the nanocomposite approach to design flexible insulation material for implantable electronic. By combining aramid nanofibers and epoxy resin, the composite material has outstanding adhesion and biocompatibility. Lastly, we designed a microfabrication process to combine gold nanoparticle composite and aramid nanofiber composite to create tissue compliant and high performance neural electrodes...|$|R

Gerberich. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxii, 139 pages, appendix p. 138 - 139. With a newly developed symmetry-adapted tight-binding molecular dynamics (MD) capability, we performed microscopic calculations {{on a variety}} of quasi-one dimensional silicon, carbon, and molybdenum disulfide nanostructures. In symmetry-adapted MD the helical symmetry instead of the standard translational symmetry is used. In the considered nanostructures, equivalent calculations can now be performed with a substantial smaller, {{in terms of the number}} of atoms, repeating domain. The symmetry-adapted method was utilized in the studied highlighted below. The stability of the most promising ground state candidate silicon nanowires with less than 10 nm in diameter was comparatively studied with with nonorthogonal tight-binding and classical potential models. The computationally expensive tight-binding treatment becomes tractable due to the substantial simplifications introduced by the presented symmetry-adapted scheme. It indicates that the achiral polycrystalline of fivefold symmetry and the hexagonal (wurtzite) wires of threefold symmetry are the most favorable quasi-one-dimensional silicon arrangements. Quantitative differences with the classical model description are noted over the whole diameter range. Using a Wulff energy decomposition approach it is revealed that these differences are caused by the inability of the classical potential to accurately describe the interaction of Si atoms on surfaces and strained morphologies. The elastic response for a large catalog of carbon nanotubes subjected to axial and torsional strain was next derived from tomistic calculations that rely on an accurate tight-binding description of the covalent binding. The application of the computationally expensive quantum treatment is possible due to the simplification in the number of atoms introduced by accounting for the helical and ngular symmetries exhibited by the elastically deformed nanotubes. The elasticity of nanotubes larger than 1. 25 nm in diameter can be represented with an isotropic elastic continuum. The torsional plastic response of single-walled carbon nanotubes is studied with tight-binding objective molecular dynamics. In contrast with plasticity under elongation and bending, a torsionally deformed carbon nanotube can slip along a nearly axial helical path, which introduces a distinct (+ 1,&# 8722; 1) change in wrapping indexes. The low energy realization occurs without loss in mass via nucleation of a 5 - 7 - 7 - 5 dislocation dipole, followed by glide of 5 - 7 kinks. The possibility of nearly axial glide is supported by the obtained dependence of the plasticity onset on chirality and handedness and by the presented calculations showing the energetic advantage of the slip path and of the initial glide steps. Symmetry-adaptedMD combined with density-functional-based tight-binding made possible to compute chiral nanotubes as axial-screw dislocations. This enabled the surprising revelation of a large catalog of MoS 2 nanotubes that lack the prescribed translational symmetry and exhibit chirality-dependent electronic band-gaps and elastic constants. Helical symmetry emerges as the natural property to rely on when studying quasi-one dimensional nanomaterials formally derived or grown via screw dislocations. The nonlinear elastic response of carbon nanotubes in torsion was derived with the symmetry-adapted MD and a density-functional-based tight-binding model. The critical strain beyond which tubes behave nonlinearly, the most favorable rippling morphology, and the twist- and morphology-related changes in fundamental band gap were identified from a rigorous atomistic description. There is a sharply contrasting behavior in the electronic response: while in single-walled tubes the band-gap variations are dominated by rippling, multiwalled tubes with small cores exhibit an unexpected insensitivity. Results are assistive for experiments performed on nanotubes-pedal devices. Despite its importance, little is known about how complex deformation modes alter the intrinsic electronic states of carbon nanotubes. We considered the rippling deformation mode characterized by helicoidal furrows and ridges and elucidate that a new intralayer strain effect rather than the known bilayer coupling and &sigma-&pi orbital mixing effects dominates its gapping. When an effective shear strain is used, it is possible to link both the electrical and the mechanical response of the complex rippled morphology to the known behavior of cylindrical tubes. Moving on to graphene, to describe the strain stored in helical nanoribbons, we supplement the standard elasticity concepts with an effective tensional strain. Using &pi -orbital tight binding and objective molecular dynamics coupled with density functional theory, we show that twisting couples the frontier conduction and valence bands, resulting in band-gap modulations. In spite of the edges and ridges of the helical nanoribbons, from the effective strain perspective these band-gap modulations appear strikingly similar with those exhibited by the <b>seamless</b> <b>carbon</b> nanotubes...|$|E
