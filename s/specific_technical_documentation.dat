But in some cases {{there is a need}} to design unusual tools, for special treatment, which are not available in tool manufacturers’ catalogs. Proper tool design requires strength and geometric calculations. Moreover, in many cases <b>specific</b> <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> is required. By using Computer Aided Design of cutting tools this task can be carried out quickly and with high accuracy. Cutting tool visualization in CAD programs gives a clear overview of the design process. Besides, these programs provide the ability to simulate real machining process. Nowadays, 3 D modeling in CAD programs is a fundamental tool for engineers. Therefore, it is important to use them in the education process...|$|E

Based on this activity a series of instructions and normative has been released in 1949, 1959, 1967, 1995. ICAS realized all spectrum of torrent control structures design for investments sector (around 2000 projects and studies during 1951 - 2011) and <b>specific</b> <b>technical</b> <b>documentations</b> such as: themes, instructions, normative in static dam calculation, morphometry and torrential watersheds hydrology, pluvial erosion and landslides mitigation using forest vegetation and complex management of torrential watersheds basins. According to ICAS studies, through whole national territory, in all 15 major catchments were managed 3, 201 torrential watersheds, {{in which they have}} been forested 67, 193. 4 ha of degraded lands and 2, 165. 2 km of torrential riverbed have been improved. The overwhelming majority of these works were designed by ICAS. For the future it is estimated that in the forest fund are required: 29, 936 ha afforestation of degraded land, 127, 000 m 3 of construction works necessary to ensure existing structures, the improvement of 1855 km of torrential riverbeds using torrent control structures. Torrential watershed planning issues are: chronic underfunding, permissive legislation in the auctions, the disappearance of traditional firms and workers. Finally is mentioned the opportunity offered by relatively new technology of Aerial Laser Scanners to delivery very accurate digital elevation models usable for better and faster design of specific works and the necessity of methodological research in this direction. With its available specialists, I. C. A. S. is, together with the Ministry of Environment and Forests, the National Forest Administration–Romsilva and Faculty of Silviculture and Forest Engineering from Braşov, part of the solution for solving issues regarding this complex domain of forestry. torrent control, watershed management, degraded lands afforestatio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDelivery of <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> of {{manufacturing}} facilities is still mandatory for machinery and plant engineers {{as part of}} the compliance with legal regulations. In addition, current research and development indicate that digital <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> can be used as informative support for operating staff if contents are provided context-sensitive. Despite the importance and potentials of <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> for the engineering process, an integration of editorial staff into this process is not state of the art. In this paper the authors propose a reference implementation for <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> developed within the collaborative research project Cyber System Connector in order to fill this gap both technically and organizationally. The aim is to redesign <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> into a service for all participants in product and production development. This new approach is based on a CPS-supported process of creating <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> and a virtual representation which serves as a platform for knowledge management in machinery and plant engineering. The benefits of implementing the proposed documentation strategy along the supply chain {{of manufacturing}} facilities are depicted by chosen application scenarios...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates {{advantages}} of application of digital photogrammetry {{for the purposes}} of production of <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> for the objects under protection, comparing it with the classical photogrammetric procedures. Based on gained experiences, paper reviews procedures for the completely digital production of <b>technical</b> <b>documentation.</b> Process of making <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> is divided in two logical stages. First stage comprises of photogrammetric recording, necessary field measurements and production of archive documentation. Archive documentation is in completely digital form and it includes: geometrically rectified photogrammetric photos, data on control points, parameters of exterior orientation for all photos and digital orthophotos as a preliminary source of geometric information. Second stage involves the production of detailed documentation with data describing object geometry such as: floor plans, facades, sections, etc, by using suitable CAD tools. Considering that this constitutes the most complicated and the most expensive part of making <b>technical</b> <b>documentation,</b> this stage is done when needed. Proposed method will be illustrated in paper by using experiences gained on projects of making <b>technical</b> <b>documentations</b> for objects of historical and cultural heritage for the towns of Kragujevac (Serbia and Montenegro) and Banja Luka (Republic of Srpska) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>documentation</b> {{has moved}} from printed {{booklets}} to online versions {{that need to be}} updated continuously to match product development and user demands. There is an imminent need to ensure the quality of <b>technical</b> <b>documentation,</b> i. e. information that follows a product. Moving from printed material to online versions also allows for documentation to become active, to integrate interactive content, which blurs the boundaries between information and software. In order to assess quality of <b>technical</b> <b>documentation,</b> we adopt analyses and visualizations known from quality assessment of software. The analyses assess text copies, usage, structural properties, and the conformance of information to meta-information. The analysis results are visualized using a range of abstractions to aid in identifying and communicating quality issues to different stakeholders. In a case study, we assessed the quality of real world <b>technical</b> <b>documentations</b> from a Swedish mobile phone vendor, a Japanese camera vendor, and a Swedish warship producer. The study showed that our analyses and visualization are applicable and can identify quality issues. For example, we tested an unclassified subset of the warship’s <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> and found that 49 % of it was redundant information. The case study was conducted at a Swedish company that is in charge of creating and maintaining <b>technical</b> <b>documentation.</b> While our approach is limited to analysis that can be performed automatically, the company acknowledges that it has great potential and that our results proved helpful...|$|R
