5|$|Breeding is {{normally}} from late May to August, {{but may be}} significantly earlier in northwest Africa or western Pakistan. Returning males arrive about {{two weeks before the}} females and establish territories which they patrol with wings held in a V-shape and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Fights may take place in flight or on the ground. The male's display flight involves a similar wing and tail position with frequent wing clapping as he follows the female in a rising spiral. If she lands, he continues to display with bobbing and fluttering until the female spreads her wings and tail for copulation. Mating occasionally takes place on a raised perch instead of the ground.
