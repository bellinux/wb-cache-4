40|$|Residual stress remarkably {{affects the}} fatigue {{strength}} of welded socket joint. In carbon and {{austenitic stainless steel}} the fatigue strength of <b>socket</b> <b>welded</b> joint is about half of base metal. This {{is caused by the}} high tensile residual stress at the root of socked weld. In this study the variation of residual stress distribution near the weld start and end points, effects of miss-alignment on the residual stress distribution and the principal strain and stress were examined using the neutron diffraction method. As a result, the effects of miss-alignment are negligibly small and the residual stress at the weld root is almost the same with that of normally welded joint. The deviations of principal axes from the specimen directions are not so much large and the principal stresses almost agree with those of specimen axes. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purposes}} of this paper are to evaluate the integrity of <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> in nuclear piping and prepare the technical basis for a new guideline on radiographic testing (RT) for the <b>socket</b> <b>weld.</b> Recently, {{the integrity of the}} <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> is regarded as a safety concern in nuclear power plants because lots of failures and leaks {{have been reported in the}} <b>socket</b> <b>weld.</b> The root causes of the <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> failure are known as unanticipated loadings such as vibration or thermal fatigue and improper weld joint during construction. The ASME Code Sec. III requires 1 / 16 inch gap between the pipe and fitting in the <b>socket</b> <b>weld.</b> Many failure cases, however, showed that the gap requirement was not satisfied. The Code also requires magnetic particle examination (MT) or liquid penetration examination (PT) on the <b>socket</b> <b>weld,</b> but not radiographic examination (RT). It means that it is not easy to examine the 1 / 16 inch gap in the <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> by using the NDE methods currently required in the Code. In this paper, the effects of the requirements in the ASME Code Sec. III on the <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> integrity were evaluated by using finite element method. The crack behavior in the <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> was also investigated under vibration event in nuclear power plants. The results showed that the <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> was very susceptible to the vibration if the requirements in ASME Code were not satisfied. The constraint between the pipe and fitting due to the contact significantly affects the integrity of the <b>socket</b> <b>weld.</b> This paper also suggests a new guideline on the RT for the <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> during construction stage in nuclear power plants...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} the second phase of an EPRI sponsored program to perform high cycle fatigue testing of <b>socket</b> <b>welds</b> in order to quantify the effects of various factors upon the fatigue strength. Analytical results had demonstrated that the <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> leg size configuration can have an important effect on its high cycle fatigue resistance, with longer legs along the pipe side of the weld greatly increasing its predicted fatigue resistance. Other potentially important factors influencing fatigue life include residual stress, weld root and toe condition, pipe size, axial and radial gaps, and materials of construction. The second phase of the program tested 27 additional <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> specimens of various designs by bolting them to a vibration shaker table and shaking them near their resonant frequencies to produce the desired stress amplitudes and cycles. Another objective of the second phase of testing was to evaluate various methods of in-situ modification or repair of <b>socket</b> <b>welds,</b> which could be used as alternatives to replacement with butt welds. The results of the program are presented which include comparisons of the various <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> designs with standard Code <b>socket</b> <b>welds,</b> butt welds, ASME mean failure data, and recent test data published by Higuchi et al. Fatigue Strength Reduction Factors are calculated based on the testing results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Socket</b> <b>welds</b> are {{commonly}} used to assemble small-bore carbon steel process piping systems {{because they can be}} fabricated fairly quickly and are somewhat tolerant of field fit-up issues. In the most simplistic terms, these welds are made by inserting the pipe into a socket and then seal welding using gas tungsten arc welding around the gap between the outside pipe wall {{and the end of the}} fitting. This leaves a notch in the root of the seal weld that is open to the process fluid. This notch can act both as a stress riser and a crevice capable of concentrating chemical species. In many process applications, these <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> notches do not cause any in-service problems. However, in the case of sour service, these notches can become problematic because of the potential for sulphide stress corrosion cracking (SSCC). For SSCC to occur, the right combination of stress, environment, and material susceptibility must be present. Therefore, for <b>socket</b> <b>welds</b> to be used in sour service without the risk of failure, these parameters need to be controlled by proper design and fabrication of the welded joint. Since a crevice is created as a natural by-product of a <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> geometry, where the SSCC environment will be present, the parameter most readily controlled to minimize susceptibility to SSCC is the microstructure and residual stress of the weld filler metal. As will be shown, this resistance to SSCC can b...|$|R

30|$|Welding is {{the main}} method of PE pipes joining for {{pipeline}} construction. As for today, the following welding methods are sufficiently developed from technological {{point of view and}} are commonly used in practice: hot tool butt <b>welding,</b> hot tool <b>socket</b> <b>welding,</b> and resistance welding [7, 8]. The last two methods require some special coupling details, such as socket and resistance fittings. Butt welding is the most simple and multipurpose method and can be used for pipes of all diameters (except the thin-wall pipes).|$|R
5000|$|The {{other major}} {{technique}} is socket fusion. It is distinguished from butt-welding by using custom-shaped and -sized heating plates {{rather than a}} basic flat surface. These heads allow for more surface contact, reducing {{the time needed to}} heat and fuse the pipe. Socket fusion joins pipe and fittings together, rather than simply joining pipe to pipe. It requires less pressure than butt-welding and is more commonly used on smaller sizes of pipe (4" [...] or less). <b>Socket</b> <b>welding</b> has additional advantages of requiring less machinery and is more portable than the heavier equipment required for butt fusion.|$|R

Semi-quantitative chemical analysis of the corroded region showed presence of chlorine as high as 0. 6 wt%.

40|$|AbstractVibration fatigue {{of small}} branch pipes usually induces weld toe cracks. Some cracks will cause advertently {{shutdown}} of the Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). Moreover, {{to judge the}} vibration fatigue failure is the bottle neck in structure health monitoring of the small branch pipes in NPPs. In order to solve this problem, a <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> pipe was simplified as the cantilever beam model, and the stress intensity factor (SIF) was calculated by the ABAQUS software and ZENCRACK software in this paper. The effects of crack depth, circumferential crack size and working load on SIF were discussed. The analysis {{results show that the}} SIF for outer surface circumferential crack distributes as an upside down “U” alphabet. And the maximum value of SIF is at the deepest point of the crack and is a linear increasing function of external load P. Basing on the plane strain fracture criterion, critical crack sizes bearing different external loads were calculated. With the increasing of loads, the critical crack size decreases. These critical values can be applied as the benchmark for evaluating the vibration fatigue failure in the structure health monitoring of small branch pipes in NPPs...|$|R

40|$|Highway sign {{structures}} {{are widely used}} {{in the state of}} Indiana as well as many other states in the US. Due to their high flexibility, wind loading on these sign structures occasionally produces significant stress cycles associated with fatigue damage. Cracking caused by fatigue damage may occur at several critical spots on the sign structures. Cracks in sign structures have been observed {{in a number of states}} and several sign structure failures have been reported. ^ Analytical research was performed to evaluate the fatigue lives of the critical details in sign structures, including double-mastarm cantilever sign structures, box-truss sign structures, monotube sign structures, tri-chord sign structures, and single-mastarm cantilever sign structures. Finite element models of the sign structures were developed based on selected prototype sign structures installed in Indiana. Natural wind gusts was chosen to be the most critical source of load causing fatigue damage on the investigated sign structure types, except for the single-mastarm cantilever sign structure. The wind speed distributions for six locations in Indiana were determined, and a wind load simulation procedure was developed to generate wind load time histories. Dynamic analyses were performed with the generated wind load applied on the finite element models to obtain the stress time histories at several structural details. A fatigue analysis procedure was defined to predict the fatigue lives based on the stress time history results. ^ According to the analytical results, the double-mastarm cantilever sign structure was found to be the most fatigue-susceptible sign structure, excluding the single-mastarm cantilever sign structure, and the post-to-base plate <b>socket</b> <b>weld</b> connection was the most critical structural detail. It was also found that variations in the fatigue life occurred due to differences in the wind environment at various sites. ^ The method, the frequency, the personnel qualification, and the procedures for sign structure inspection were proposed based on a literature search and communication with inspection engineers. Guidelines for component inspection of sign structures were recommended. Suggestions for future research were presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Steel angles are {{extensively}} used {{to connect}} concrete floor/roof elements to the supporting beam in typical dry-assembled precast frame structures widely diffused in Europe {{and other parts}} of the world. These connections allow for relative rotation of the floor element in its vertical plane and restrains their relative displacement, avoiding possible loss of support and consequent fall of the floor element when the structure is subjected to lateral load. The diaphragm behaviour of the precast decks relies on these floor-to-beam connections. Their post-addition to unconnected floor-to-beam joints of existing buildings is a typical seismic retrofit intervention. All these applications are often made without an adequate information about the main structural parameters of the connections, due to lack of experimental or theoretical knowledge. An experimental campaign has been performed at Politecnico di Milano within the framework of the Safecast and ReLUIS research projects with the scope of characterising the mechanical behaviour of post-inserted floor-to-beam connections made with hot-rolled angles, cold-formed angles and <b>welded</b> <b>sockets</b> in the direction parallel to the floor element.

A curved, {{circular}} cross-section steel tube reached from the nose {{at least as far}} aft as the <b>welded</b> <b>sockets</b> which received the ends of the main wing spars. A solid, circular section wood beam was inserted into this steel tube, extending it rearwards. The wing spars were also circular, solid and wooden, set with strong dihedral which took their tips to the height of the extreme nose so that the foreplanes, elevators or jibs could be attached between these three points. [...] Their inner trailing edges were directly controlled by the pilot, who sat over the central beam-wing spar joint. They were initially hinged together at their leading edges, but later the hinge point was moved rearwards towards the aerodynamic centre to reduce pilot load and separated only behind the hinge. [...] Since there were no ribs, the airfoil was determined by the airflow and the pilot, as for the sloop's jib. [...] The main wing, a [...] single surface stretched between the spars and the extreme tail, also had its camber determined by the airflow, like the mainsail of the sloop. [...] Both wing sheets were produced by sewing together narrow strips of material; the longitudinal joints between them are prominent in some back lit, better quality images.|$|R
