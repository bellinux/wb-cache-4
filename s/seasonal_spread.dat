40|$|Old World crops {{entered the}} Americas as {{provision}} on slave ships and were planted by enslaved Africans {{in their home}} gardens, known as the ‘Botanical Gardens of the Dispossessed’. Escaped slaves who settled in Maroon communities in Suriname’s forested interior practiced shifting cultivation for centuries with seeds they brought from their home gardens. After the abolishment of slavery, Creoles largely abandoned agriculture and farming became the activity of Asian wage laborers. Maroon agriculture has never been studied in detail. The recent discovery of African rice (Oryza glaberrima) in a Maroon garden initiated this ethnobotanical study on Old World crops grown by Maroons, and their motivations for maintaining this agrodiversity. In 2013, we collected crop cultivars and landraces and interviewed 16 Aucan and Saramaccan Maroon farmers. The greatest richness was encountered in bananas, taro, okra and rice. Most crops were used for food, but sesame, melegueta pepper and African rice largely lost their food function and served mainly for rituals. Farmers exchanged seeds and tubers with family members and other ethnicities in both urban and forest communities. Spending time in the capital during childbirth or illness resulted {{in the loss of}} typical Maroon crops (e. g., Bambara groundnut), as seeds lost viability during the farmer’s absence. Motivation to grow specific crops and cultivars varied from tradition, food preference, <b>seasonal</b> <b>spreading,</b> rituals and traditional medicine. Documentation of specific landrace properties, storage of seeds in germplasm centers and in situ conservation are urgently needed to safeguard these previously undocumented Maroon landraces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The current {{pandemic}} threat can be {{best understood}} within an ecological framework that takes {{account of the}} history of past pandemics caused by influenza A, the relationships between pandemic and <b>seasonal</b> <b>spread</b> of influenza viruses, and the importance of immunity and behavioural responses in human populations. Isolated populations without recent exposure to seasonal influenza seem more susceptible to new pandemic viruses, and much collateral evidence suggests that this is due to immunity directed against epitopes shared between pandemic and previously circulating strains of inter-pandemic influenza A virus. In the highly connected modern world, most populations are regularly exposed to non-pandemic viruses, which can even boost immunity without causing influenza symptoms. Such naturally-induced immunity helps to explain the low attack-rates of seasonal influenza, as well as the moderate attack-rates in many urbanized populations affected by 1918 – 1919 and later pandemics. The effectiveness of immunity, even against seasonal influenza, diminishes over time because of antigenic drift in circulating viruses and waning of post-exposure immune responses. Epidemiological evidence suggests that cross-protection against a new pandemic strain could fade even faster. Nevertheless, partial protection, even of short duration, induced by prior seasonal influenza or vaccination against it, could provide important protection {{in the early stages of}} a new pandemic...|$|E
40|$|The Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is a {{successful}} invasive species found throughout the world. It is commonly associated with urban areas and invades habitats that have favorable conditions, such as adequate moisture levels. Urban areas in the xeric regions of Southern California that use supplemental irrigation create artificially moist habitats that are thought {{to serve as a}} permanent refuge for the Argentine ant. Invasion is a three step process of introduction, establishment, and spread; for Argentine ants to invade, they must first be introduced to an area. This study was designed to determine if Argentine ants seasonally spread into habitats that have high soil moisture for only a portion of the year, and to access the role that soil moisture, seasonality, proximity to the urban edge, and proximity to a permanent water source play in determining which areas the Argentine ant will spread into, and where they are likely to successfully invade. This study examined three different habitat types on two reserves that differed in water availability: mesic (permanently wet), xeric (upland areas without a permanent water source), and seasonally moist (intermittently wet). Sampling cups were set out in each habitat during the wet and dry season for a period of two years. Measurements were taken on Argentine ant abundance, native ant species abundance, distance to the urban edge, and distance to a permanent water source. Argentine ants were found in mesic sites throughout the study period in both wet and dry seasons. No Argentine ants were found at the xeric sites in either wet or dry seasons. Out of six seasonally moist sites, one that was in close proximity to permanent water had Argentine ants year round, while the other seasonally moist sites had no Argentine ants. Distance to a permanent water source was the best predictor for Argentine ant abundance, followed by soil moisture. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>spreading</b> was not observed in any habitat type. Based on these findings, intermittent water {{does not seem to be}} a risk factor for Argentine ant invasion, but permanent water is a risk factor for invasion.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study conducts}} {{temporal}} price analysis of wheat, faba bean, dates and garlic crops prices to identify seasonal price patterns and their expected {{changes over time}} as compared to storage costs. The analytical approach {{in this study was}} based on the so-called "classical model". The study based preliminary on the secondary data collected from Dongola wholesaler market during period 2000 - 2009. The study found that <b>seasonal</b> prices <b>spread</b> increased about 25 % from index low to the high on average for wheat, about 21 % for faba bean, 18 % for dates and 63 % for garlic, while the annual interest rate of the year 2009 was 10 %. Thus farmers or traders who usually perform storage activity during the harvest to post harvest period will gain excess profit if they buy on the seasonal low price and sell on the seasonal high price and if they could secure storage loans. The large price differences were caused by poor market information and infrastructure, so the improvement of such fields is highly recommended...|$|R

Recently, two new modes of transmission {{have been demonstrated}} in cattle for Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV 8) : vertical and pseudo-vertical transmission. Our objective was to model the <b>seasonal</b> <b>spread</b> of BTV 8 over several years in a homogeneous population of cattle, and {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of vaccination strategies. We built a deterministic mathematical model accounting for the seasonality in vector abundance and all the modes of transmission. We proposed a counterpart of the basic reproduction number (R 0) in {{a seasonal}} context (RS). Set A(t) is the number of secondary cases produced by a primary case introduced at time t. RS is the average of A(t). It is a function of midge abundance and vaccination strategy. We also used A*, the maximum of A(t), as an indicator of the risk of an epidemic. Without vaccination, the model predicted a large first epidemic peak followed by smaller annual peaks if RS> 1. When RS 1. Vaccination reduced RS and A* to less than one, but almost perfect vaccine efficacy and coverage were required to ensure no epidemics occurred. However, a lower coverage resulting in RS> 1 could decrease infection prevalence. A further step would be to optimize vaccination strategies by targeting an appropriate period of the year to implement the vaccination...|$|E
40|$|The {{consistent}} seasonal {{signal that}} characterizes annual influenza epidemics has long suggested a causal {{link between the}} physical environment and the transmission of influenza. Yet, despite considerable interest [...] dating {{as far back as}} Hippocrates [...] the environmental factors that facilitate the <b>seasonal</b> <b>spread</b> of influenza remain unclear. Historically, significant study of influenza seasonality was based almost exclusively on temperate regions,. {{due to a lack of}} high-quality influenza data in low-latitudes. In turn, although numerous hypotheses have been forwarded to explain the seasonal nature of influenza in temperate regions, few acknowledge the seasonal patterns in lower latitudes. This dissertation examines the scientific evidence for the seasonal mechanisms that potentially explain the complex seasonal patterns of influenza disease activity across the latitudinal gradient extending from temperate to tropical regions. I identified seasonal climatic variables that are potentially responsible for influenza seasonality from observational, experimental, ecological and anecdotal studies. I then used a global database of influenza seasonality to assess the consistency of relationships between influenza seasonality and the seasonality of relevant climatic variables. I determined that no single climatic variable is consistently correlated with seasonal influenza activity across temperate, subtropical and tropical regions. However, I did find a significant U-shaped relationship between specific humidity and influenza epidemics globally with epidemics becoming increasingly likely as specific humidity increases or decreases from approximately 12 g/kg. Further, I examined the temporal and spatial variation of influenza activity and specific humidity during the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 pandemic across Mexico, which spans temperate, subtropical and tropical regions. I show that specific humidity may have modified the progression of three distinct waves of infection during the pandemic. These patterns are in agreement with the U-shaped relationship between specific humidity and seasonal influenza epidemics observed at a global scale. In all, this is the first time that relationships between climate and influenza (both seasonal and pandemic) activity have been successfully synthesized into a single parsimonious model across temperate, subtropical and tropical regions...|$|E
40|$|Submerged macrophytes can colonize shallow lakes via several {{reproductive}} mechanisms, and can in turn substantially alter these environments by {{modifying the}} thermal structure and dissolved oxygen levels within these lakes. Although multiple mechanisms of submerged macrophyte expansion have been described, the relative contribution {{of each of}} these in shallow lake environments has been largely overlooked. In this study we analyzed the spatial spread and patterning during seasonal growth of a globally invasive submerged macrophyte, Potamogeton crispus, in a shallow urban lake (Lake Monger, Western Australia). We used underwater and aerial imagery to estimate the spatial pattern of the P. crispus bed. By comparing the spatial extent of the bed at different times during the growing season, we found linear expansion rates two orders of magnitude higher than those previously estimated through rhizome elongation. We formulated a deterministic mathematical model that accounted for the ability of P. crispus to spread through rhizomes and fragments broken off by the feeding activities of aquatic birds, to assess the contribution of fragment dispersal to the emergent patterns of the submerged macrophyte bed. In addition to accounting for dispersal from fragments, the model also accounted for a hypothesized feedback between macrophyte-induced thermal stratification and central dieback. Comparison of our model results against field data indicated that the model accurately represented the spatial spread of the macrophyte bed when fragment dispersal was included. When fragment dispersal {{was not included in the}} model, the spatial spread of the bed was largely underestimated, suggesting that fragment dispersal may well account for the fast <b>seasonal</b> <b>spread</b> of this species. The model also captured the formation of a ring-shaped pattern in spatial macrophyte distribution suggesting that both fragment dispersal and the feedback between stratification and dieback are necessary to reproduce the spatial structure of the macrophyte bed. Our results highlight the potential important role of fragment dispersal in facilitating colonization and submerged macrophyte invasion in shallow lakes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{seasonal}} energy storage {{depends on how}} the firm best operates the storage to capture the <b>seasonal</b> price <b>spread.</b> Energy storage operations typically face limited operational flexibility characterized by the speed of storing and releasing energy. A widely used practice-based heuristic, the rolling intrinsic (RI) policy, generally performs well, but can significantly underperform in some cases. In this paper, we aim to understand {{the gap between the}} RI policy and the optimal policy, and design improved heuristic policies to close or reduce this gap. A new heuristic policy, the “price-adjusted rolling intrinsic (PARI) policy,” is developed based on theoretical analysis of the value of storage options. This heuristic adjusts prices before applying the RI policy, and the adjusted prices inform the RI policy about the values of various storage options. Our numerical experiments show that the PARI policy is especially capable of recovering high value losses of the RI policy. For the instances where the RI policy loses more than 4 % of the optimal storage value, the PARI policy on average is able to recover more than 90 % of the value loss...|$|R

40|$|In {{freshwater}} ecosystems, species compositions {{are known}} to be determined hierarchically by large to small‑scale environmental factors, based on the biological traits of the organisms. However, in ephemeral habitats this heuristic framework remains largely untested. Although temporary wetland faunas are constrained by a local filter (i. e., desiccation), we propose its magnitude may still depend on large-scale climate characteristics. If this is true, climate should be related to the degree of functional and taxonomic relatedness of invertebrate communities inhabiting seasonal wetlands. We tested this hypothesis in two ways. First, based on 52 biological traits for invertebrates, we conducted a case study to explore functional trends among temperate seasonal wetlands differing in the harshness (i. e., dryness) of their dry season. After finding evidence of trait filtering, we addressed whether it could be generalized across a broader climatic scale. To this end, a meta-analysis (225 <b>seasonal</b> wetlands <b>spread</b> across broad climatic categories: Arid, Temperate, and Cold) allowed us to identify whether an equivalent climate-dependent pattern of trait richness was consistent between the Nearctic and the Western Palearctic. Functional overlap of invertebrates increased from mild (i. e., Temperate) to harsher climates (i. e., Arid and Cold), and phylogenetic clustering (using taxonomy as a surrogate) was highest in Arid and lowest in Temperate wetlands. We show that, (i) as has been described in streams, higher relatedness than would be expected by chance is generally observed i...|$|R
40|$|Cholera is {{a serious}} public health problem {{because of the high}} burden of morbidity. Recurrent {{pandemic}} cholera is sustained by an endemic epicenter in the Bay of Bengal region but the mechanism of endemism is not clearly understood. Recent information showing that the dynamics and seasonality of endemic cholera are linked with environmental parameters led to the hypothesis that the population dynamics of V. cholerae, the causative agent of cholera indigenous in natural aquatic environments, is the link causing variation in endemic cholera. To substantiate this hypothesis, the structure and dynamics of V. cholerae populations in the aquatic environments were investigated, employing three approaches. First, the phylogeny of the family Vibrionaceae was analyzed to determine the phylogenetic boundary of V. cholerae. Phylogeny analysis using comparative genomics revealed that the species, V. cholerae, is a direct descendant of a common ancestor of the genus, with at least 25 % of its genome subject to horizontal gene transfer from other vibrios. The second approach was analysis of the population structure of V. cholerae using genomic fingerprinting, with the conclusion that there is a multilayered clonality and paraphyla within the species, with a subvar branch, V. mimicus. It was also concluded that all of the epidemic lineages of V. cholerae are highly clonal, forming a tight phylogenetic compartment. The nonpathogenic clones were found to be highly diverse and some showed significant association with fluctuations observed in the potential-host crustacean zooplankton compositions. Finally, analyses of both the dynamics and compartmentalization of V. cholerae populations during endemic cholera outbreaks yielded a compartmentalized understanding of the mechanism of endemic cholera, namely that there are bodies of water in a cholera endemic area that serve as a reservoir of the bacterium and, therefore, a point source for the <b>seasonal</b> <b>spread</b> of cholera bacteria. The nature of a universal seasonal forcing that repeats the spread of the cholera bacterium from the point source each cholera season is not clear.

Viral infections in urban environments are extremely common and cause severe diseases in domestic animals which often lead to death, resulting in high material and moral damages to owners of animals. Therefore, investigation of the prevalence of pathogens of viral diseases is very important in our time. The aim of this work is to define the indicators of spreading viral diseases of animals in Dnipropetrovsk, to analyze the <b>seasonal</b> <b>spread</b> of viral infections in animals, and influence of sex and breed on the frequency of disease manifestations. Materials for research were obtained on the basis of three veterinary clinics in Dnipropetrovsk. During the study, we used serological methods of diagnostics of clinical materials, namely ELISA and IHA. Immunosorbent assay was performed using the thermostatic shaker ST- 3 and strip immunoassay analyzer Stat Fax 303 Plus. Also we used commercial test systems VetExpert CAV Ag and Feline VacciCheck ImmunoComb®, based on the immuno-chromatographic method. During clinical studies of 491 animals (268 cats and 223 dogs) {{it was found that the}} most common respiratory viral infections in cats were calicivirus infection and rhinotracheitis, while in dogs there were viral diseases of gastrointestinal tract, i. e. enteritis and hepatitis. Using IHA method, we revealed the antibodies to respiratory viruses in the blood of deseased cats: to calicivirus – in 95 cats, to rhinotracheitis – in 60 cats; by ELISA method we identified antigens of parvovirus, enteritis pathogen, in biological material of 61 dogs, by IHA we found antibodies to virus of infectious hepatitis in 49 individuals. Based on these data, it has been revealed that during the winter months the animals suffered mostly the respiratory viral infections (60 %), and in spring there were increased occur-rence of enteritis, observed in all age groups of animals. From May, hepatitis started to appear and prevailed for all summer months, mixed with enteritis (about 50 % of total number of cases). Hepatitis was recorded both in cats and dogs. By the fall, recurrence was observed for calicivirus and herpes virus infections in cats, and the cases of enteritis decreased, while hepatitis was recorded until mid-October. Such statistics is kept relatively constant. The research results can be applied in the practice of veterinary laboratories for the development of diagnostic measures and prevention of viral diseases in domestic animals, as well as in the prediction of dissemination of viral infections in animals in the near future...|$|E
40|$|By far the {{greatest}} {{proportion of the}} 1, 150, 000 acres of light land in Canterbury is found on the Canterbury Plain. This plain, originally covered by "low tussock" and of easy contour, was enticing to the early pioneers {{and became one of}} the earliest areas in New Zealand to be settled and farmed. Over the years it has developed {{into one of the most}} intensively farmed and productive areas of New Zealand. The dominant characteristic of the light land of Canterbury is undoubtedly the climate. The rainfall is reasonably evenly distributed over the year, but because of the low humidity, high temperatures and warm winds experienced over the summer in association with a free draining soil, the effectiveness of the rainfall over this period is drastically reduced. Consequently active plant growth is severely restricted for several months over the summer, and occasionally extends into the spring and/or autumn periods. The uncertainty as to the length and severity of this restricted growth period and the associated problem of equating the variable feed supply to the stock requirements, both within and between years, is the basic problem confronting the light land farmer. In spite of the environmental difficulties the productivity of the light land has increased several fold since early settlement. The original holdings on the Canterbury Plain were large with their boundaries on the rivers so as to provide access to water. Fine wool sheep were extensively grazed. However the introduction of refrigerated shipping and the extension of the water race system in the 1880 's brought about a reduction in the size of holdings and a change in the pattern of farming. Dual purpose sheep were run and by the 1930 's in response to favourable crop prices the system of diversified farming was firmly established. Unfortunately this system placed excessive emphasis on cash cropping, particularly on the light soils. Soil fertility was drained, structure severely damaged and subsequent pasture establishment and survival poor. In the late 1940 s and early 1950 s, with declining crop yields and with more favourable prices being obtained for fat lambs and particularly wool, the emphasis shifted from cropping to livestock farming. The carrying capacity however, was restricted by the reduced soil fertility and poor quality pastures and an environment in which climatic uncertainty tended to inhibit the rapid expansion of stock numbers. The results of research work carried out at the various institutions in Canterbury over the years have undoubtedly promoted a greater understanding and appreciation of the problems confronting the farmer and the limitations of the particular environment in which he must operate. For example, pasture species more suited to the low fertility conditions and climate were introduced with spectacular results. The most significant of these was subterranean clover (introduced in the 1930 s), noted for its ability to withstand the summer droughts, to regenerate in the autumn, and to provide an increased bulk of feed in the spring. Research work had shown that both lime and phosphate were necessary on the light land soils, if high pasture production and persistency was to be expected. Soil fertility increased subsequent to a reduction in the emphasis on cropping and with the higher levels of fertiliser application. High fertility pasture species (e. g. white clover and lucerne), were introduced and not only gave higher and more reliable total production but exhibited improved <b>seasonal</b> <b>spread</b> of production. Investigations into pasture diseases and stock health provided answers to specific problems. Research into flock management generally and in comparisons between the productivity of various sheep breeds indicated the most suitable type of flock and breed for the light land farmer. From this and other research work (in conjunction with the observations of leading farmers in the area), an efficient system of light land farming has gradually evolved in which many of the basic problems have been overcome and which has resulted in a raising of the carrying capacity of the light land from ¾ stock unit per acre in the 1930 's to 3 ½- 4 stock units per acre at present. A central feature of this system (particularly at high stocking rates), is the high degree of flexibility incorporated in both the stock policies and feed supplies. Where the objective function is to maximise productivity over a period of years, it is essential to utilise the available spring feed efficiently while maintaining the ability to destock when confronted with feed shortages in the spring and early summer. Because of the fluctuating feed supply, which is characteristic of light land, the need to maintain feed reserves and to incorporate a high degree of flexibility in the stock policy is evident if the feed supply and demand are to be equated. In summary, the increased productivity can be attributed to two factors: (1) The ability to grow a greatly increased quantity of herbage per acre with an improved seasonal pattern of production. (2) A more efficient utilisation of the herbage produced. Unlike his counterpart in more reliable farming districts, the light land farmer operates in an environment of uncertainty. Yield uncertainty, particularly at high stocking rates, is the major problem to be overcome and this dictates very largely the system of farming adopted. Price uncertainty is also a significant aspect of light land farming because of the reliance on a limited range of products and the inability to diversify. In an analysis of physical and financial data collected from a sample of light land farms in Canterbury (1) there was no evidence to suggest that any one particular pattern of output was superior to all others. This result was surprising, but may reflect the uncertainty inherent in the environment. (1) For a full discussion on this, see Section 3. 3. 2 (a). Alternatively it may infer that the actual patterns of production are less important than the managerial skill with which they are implemented. These results pointed to the need to explore more fully the following facets of light land management: (1) Given a developed farm, is there any one optimal pattern of production which (a) generates increased profit under average seasonal and price conditions, and (b) is subject to only small variations in profit under changing seasonal and price conditions? (2) Given the potential for the development and expansion of light land farming, how profitable is this from the individual farmer's viewpoint? If, in an evaluation of the first problem, high levels of productivity are shown to be profitable on existing well developed farms, then a reallocation of resources to obtain the desired combination should be recommended. An optimum combination of enterprises shown by such an analysis might well serve as the goal where an undeveloped potential still exists on a farm and where a reallocation and intensification in the use of resources is necessary if productivity is to be increased. In this study of light land farming two case farms have been used and although the results refer specifically to these particular farms, some conclusions of a general nature are possible. In Chapter II the physical characteristics of the area are described. In Chapter III a review of the research into specific problems relating to the management of light land is presented. This is followed in Chapter IV by an explanation of the technical principles of light land farming which have evolved. Chapter V is devoted to the comparison of some of the production possibilities open to the light land farmer using linear programming.

40|$|We gave questionnares to 503 female {{students}} （ 326 athletes, 177 non athletes） regarding {{their willingness to}} receive novel influenza A（ H 1 N 1 ） vaccine. A chi-squared {{test was used to}} examine the characteristics between athletic and non-athletic students based on their answers. A total of 261 students （ 51. 9 %） answered that {{they did not want to}} receive the vaccine, while willingness to accept the vaccine was significantly greater among non-athletic（ 56. 5 %） as compared to athletic （ 43. 6 %） students. That finding might have been due the necessities of vaccitinization for other viruses such as rubella and measles, causing them miss taking an important examination to acquire a registered dietitian certificate. Consciousness of accepting other viral vaccines might be related to acceptance of receiving the novel influenza A（ H 1 N 1 ） vaccine. In addition, our results suggest that non-athletic students have a higher level of consciousness of being willing to receive both the new influenza A（ H 1 N 1 ） vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccine. The athletic students in our study showed a higher level of willingness to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine, which may contribute to preventing <b>seasonal</b> influenza from <b>spreading</b> among athletes. Individuals not willing to receive the novel influenza A（ H 1 N 1 ） vaccine should clearly understand that they do not have substantial cross tolerance from receiving the seasonal influenza vaccination. Students in both groups showed a favorable attitude in 2009 for the H 1 N 1 vaccination, though further study is needed...|$|R
30|$|An {{instability}} seed perturbation is {{an important}} requirement for initiating the EPB development although its diagnostics based on observational data has been a challenging task. Gravity waves originating from sources in lower atmosphere were invoked to explain the spatial structures observed in HF radar maps of the ESF irregularities (Rottger 1981). On a statistical basis, the role of gravity waves in the longitudinal and <b>seasonal</b> distribution of <b>spread</b> F has been in part attributed to gravity wave generation at the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and to its geographical and seasonal migration (McClure et al. 1998; Tsunoda 2010). From analyses of the seasonal/global distribution of plasma irregularities observed by the ROCSAT- 1 and from the OLR/ITCZ data, Su et al. (2014) found {{that the role of}} gravity waves was recognizable mainly in South American and African longitude sectors, and not over all longitudes. More recently, from comparison of bubble irregularity occurrences at close-by locations in Asian sector, Li et al. (2016) found that enhanced plasma bubble generation was associated with more active ITCZ sector. On a case study basis, the role of gravity waves in seeding the ESF irregularities has been investigated for different longitude sectors (see, for example, Abdu et al. 2009 a, Sreeja et al. 2009). Based on ionosonde and radar data, it was found that for smaller (larger) PRE vertical drift velocities a larger (smaller) amplitude of the gravity wave perturbations (in density and polarization electric field) was required to produce a given instability growth rate for the ESF development (Abdu et al. 2009 a). In other words, an evaluation of the role of gravity waves (in the form of a precursor seed perturbation) in a given EPB irregularity development would also require a simultaneous assessment primarily of the prevailing PRE vertical drift amplitude and possibly other related parameters as well.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{worldwide}} spread of a pandemic influenza and its possible containment at a global level taking into account all available information on air travel. We studied a metapopulation stochastic epidemic model on a global scale that considers airline travel flow data among urban areas. We provided a temporal and spatial evolution of the pandemic with a sensitivity analysis of different levels of infectiousness of the virus and initial outbreak conditions (both geographical and <b>seasonal).</b> For each <b>spreading</b> scenario we provided the timeline and the geographical impact of the pandemic in 3, 100 urban areas, located in 220 different countries. We compared the baseline cases with different containment strategies, including travel restrictions and the therapeutic use of antiviral (AV) drugs. We show that the inclusion of air transportation is crucial in the assessment of the occurrence probability of global outbreaks. The large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs in all hit countries would be able to mitigate a pandemic effect with a reproductive rate as high as 1. 9 during the first year; with AV supply use sufficient to treat approximately 2 % to 6 % of the population, in conjunction with efficient case detection and timely drug distribution. For highly contagious viruses (i. e., a reproductive rate as high as 2. 3), even the unrealistic use of supplies corresponding to the treatment of approximately 20 % of the population leaves 30 %- 50 % of the population infected. In the case of limited AV supplies and pandemics with a reproductive rate as high as 1. 9, we demonstrate that the more cooperative the strategy, the more effective are the containment results in all regions of the world, including those countries that made part of their resources available for global use.

40|$|Decadal {{predictions}} on timescales {{from one}} year to one decade are gaining importance since this time frame falls within the planning horizon of politics, economy and society. The present study examines the decadal predictability of regional wind speed and wind energy potentials in three generations of the MiKlip (‘Mittelfristige Klimaprognosen’) decadal prediction system. The system is based on the global Max-Planck-Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM), and the three generations differ primarily in the ocean initialisation. Ensembles of uninitialised historical and yearly initialised hindcast experiments are used to assess the forecast skill for 10 m wind speeds and wind energy output (Eout) over Central Europe with lead times from {{one year to}} one decade. With this aim, a statistical-dynamical downscaling (SDD) approach is used for the regionalisation. Its added value is evaluated by comparison of skill scores for MPI-ESM large-scale wind speeds and SDD-simulated regional wind speeds. All three MPI-ESM ensemble generations show some forecast skill for annual mean wind speed and Eout over Central Europe on yearly and multi-yearly time scales. This forecast skill is mostly limited to the first years after initialisation. Differences between the three ensemble generations are generally small. The regionalisation preserves and sometimes increases the forecast skills of the global runs but results depend on lead time and ensemble generation. Moreover, regionalisation often improves the ensemble <b>spread.</b> <b>Seasonal</b> Eout skills are generally lower than for annual means. Skill scores are lowest during summer and persist longest in autumn. A large-scale westerly weather type with strong pressure gradients over Central Europe is identified as potential source of the skill for wind energy potentials, showing a similar forecast skill and a high correlation with Eout anomalies. These results are promising towards the establishment of a decadal prediction system for wind energy applications over Central Europe...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of vaccines, influenza remains a major public health challenge. A key reason is the virus capacity for immune escape: ongoing evolution allows the continual circulation of seasonal influenza, while novel influenza viruses invade the human population to cause a pandemic every few decades. Current vaccines have to be updated continually to keep up to date with this antigenic change, but emerging ‘universal’ vaccines – targeting more conserved components of the influenza virus – offe r the potential to act across all influenza A strains and subtypes. Influenza vaccination programmes {{around the world are}} steadily increasing in their population coverage. In future, how might intensive, routine immunization with novel vaccines compare a gainst similar mass programmes utilizing conventional vaccines? Specifically, how might novel and conventional vaccines compare, in terms of cumulative incidence and rates of antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza? W hat are the ir potential implications for the impact of pandemic emergence? Here we present a new mathematical model, capturing both transmission dynamics and antigenic evolution of influenza in a simple framework, to explore these questions. We find that, even when m atched by per - dose efficacy, universal vaccines c ould dampen population - level transmission over several seasons {{to a greater extent than}} conventional vaccines. Moreover, by lowering opportunities for cross - protective immunity in the population, conventional vaccines could allow the increase d spread of a novel pandemic strain. Conversely, u niversal vaccines could mitigate both <b>seasonal</b> and pandemic <b>spread.</b> However, where it is not possible to maintain annual, intensive vaccination coverage, the duration and breadth of immunity raised by universal vaccines are critical determinants of their performance relative to conventional vaccines. In future, conventional and novel vaccines are likely to play complementary roles in vaccination strategies against influenza: in this context, our results suggest important characteristics to monitor during the clinical development of emerging vaccine technologies...|$|R
40|$|Differently {{from other}} viral diseases, like measles, {{smallpox}} and polyomielitis, influenza {{is caused by}} a virus that undergoes continuous antigenic changes, and has several animal reservoirs. Influenza virus is an enveloped virus, with a segmented negative RNA strand genome, belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza viruses are grouped in three different genotypes:A, B and C. Only genotype A viruses are able to cause relevant outbreaks, and are capable of infecting both humans and animal species. Antigenicity of surface glycoproteins (hemagglutinin, HA, and neuraminidase, NA) stimulate a protective immune response. The emergence of small antigenic changes determined on HA and NA by point mutations (antigenic drift) is {{on the basis of the}} <b>seasonal</b> outbreaks, whose <b>spread</b> is allowed by the incomplete protection provided by immunity against the previous infecting viral strains. The reassortment of genome segments that may occur after mixed infection with different antigenic types is on the basis of the appearance of new antigenic combinations (antigenic shift), leading to the emergence of vaste outbreaks, possibly involving most of the human world population (pandemics). Two classes of drugs are available against influenza: inhibitors of viral entry into the host cell and inhibitors of viral release (neuraminidase inhibitors). As a common phenomenon accompanying the usage of selective drugs, the emergence of resistant viral strains is a problem that is to be considered when planning the large use of antiviral drugs to restrict the spread of a possible pandemic. The recent appearance of a paper describing the complete sequence of the virus causing the tremendous pandemic called “spanish flu” in 1918, and of a paper reporting the in vitro reconstruction of this virus through reverse genetic methods, raised some concern about the possibility that the new information could be used in an offensive way by bioterrorists. On the other hand, thanks to these scientific achievements, the first steps have been accomplished towards the elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms underlying the high pathogenicity of this virus, so rendering more realistic the possibility of preparing appropriate tools to cope with the next pandemic expected to be behind the corner...|$|R
30|$|It is {{interesting}} to compare the occurrence rates of OSS events with the occurrence rates of plasma bubbles observed by satellites. The fact that OSSs are more frequent in Tucumán than in Taiwan and that they mostly occur from September to March in that region {{is consistent with the}} occurrence rates of plasma bubbles as derived from magnetic signatures on the CHAMP satellite orbiting at altitudes of ~ 450 – 380  km (Stolle et al. 2006). Similar results were obtained from direct plasma density measurements onboard DMSP F 9 and F 10 satellites orbiting at ~ 840  km altitude (Huang et al. 2001) and with recent measurement of prereversal enhancement of ion vertical drift by the C/NOFS satellite (Huang and Hairston 2015). Two factors likely contributing to the higher occurrence rates of OSS events and spread F events in Tucumán than those in Taiwan include a weaker Earth magnetic field in Tucumán, which is close to the South Atlantic magnetic anomaly, and a longitudinal distribution of prereversal enhancements of the equatorial electrojet. The seasonal distribution of OSSs in Tucumán is also consistent with the occurrence of the spread F and scintillation reported for Tucumán (e.g., Alfonsi et al. 2013; Ezquer et al. 2003). For Taiwan, Lee et al. (2013) reported a different <b>seasonal</b> distribution of <b>spread</b> F. On the basis of data obtained during the solar minimum in 1996, they found that the spread F occurrence peaks from May to August, i.e., in the local summer half of the year. However, the observation of plasma bubbles by the CHAMP satellite (Stolle et al. 2006) in 2001 – 2004 and the measurements of prereversal enhancement of vertical plasma drift (Huang and Hairston 2015) are closer to our findings such that spread F is more frequently observed around equinoxes. Our results concerning the propagation velocities are consistent with previous reports based on optical and GPS total electron content measurements for South America (e.g., Haase et al. 2011) and for Taiwan (Huang 1990; Liu et al. 2011). Our results are based on larger numbers of events and cover the entire year. Pacheco et al. (2011) studied the super-rotation and zonal ion drift from the ROCSAT- 1 satellite orbiting at an altitude of ~ 600  km from November 1999 to December 2003, which corresponds to the solar maximum. Their results are consistent with our results in that they observed the largest nighttime eastward drifts in the American sector during the northern winter; similar behavior was shown in the neutral winds. They observed the lowest nighttime eastward drifts from May to August.|$|R
40|$|Seasonality {{has a major}} {{effect on}} the spatiotemporal {{dynamics}} of natural systems and their populations and is a {{driving force behind the}} transmission of influenza in temperate regions. Although the seasonality of influenza in temperate countries is widely recognized, inter-state spread of influenza in the United States has not been well characterized. This dissertation characterized the seasonality of influenza throughout the United States by using monthly pneumonia and influenza (P and I) mortality to model inter-state movement of seasonal influenza in the continental United States between 1968 and 2008. The first chapter summarizes the current knowledge of the burden, morphology, and geography of influenza as well as limitations of prior studies. In the second chapter, weekly data on laboratory-confirmed influenza isolates from a national viral surveillance system (considered the "gold standard") is compared with weekly pneumonia and influenza (P and I) mortality data from a national mortality surveillance system in order to determine if the timing of mortality data correlated well with the timing of viral surveillance data and was, therefore, a good measurement for determining the timing of annual influenza epidemics. Sufficient viral surveillance data for influenza is not available {{for the majority of the}} study period and its quality most likely varies geographically. This made it necessary for this study to use mortality data as a substitute. It was, therefore, critical for this dissertation to assess the reliability of mortality data as a measurement to determine the timing of annual influenza waves. In the third chapter, an analysis of monthly P and I mortality data was conducted to identify an average underlying wave of <b>seasonal</b> influenza <b>spread</b> in the United States, the spatial and temporal patterns of seasonal influenza in the U. S. from 1968 to 2008, and the dependence of the timing and spread of influenza on the dominant circulating influenza type or subtype in a given influenza season. Source locations of influenza transmission in the U. S. were also identified. The dependence of the <b>spread</b> process of <b>seasonal</b> influenza in the U. S. on distance and/or population was assessed in chapter four. Additionally, spatial clusters of P and I mortality rates at different phases of an average influenza wave were identified. An assessment of the effect of the introduction or reintroduction of a novel influenza virus subtype on the spatiotemporal dynamics of influenza spread in the U. S. was performed in the fifth chapter. In the sixth and final chapter, I conclude by summarizing the findings of these four studies. This research found that P and I mortality was a valid measure used to assess the timing of influenza epidemics. Additionally, seasonal influenza in the U. S. typically began in November, peaked in February, and ceased in May. Annual influenza epidemics lasted an average of 6. 7 months and produced a small, but significant southward traveling wave of influenza across the United States, originating from northern states in September-October and moving toward southern states over a 4 -month period. H 3 N 2 -prominent seasons were significantly shorter and faster in progression than H 1 N 1 -prominent seasons. Moreover, influenza waves in the contiguous U. S. followed a general spatial contagion model, particularly at their peak, with high clusters of P and I rates found in Midwestern (North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma), Southeastern (Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia) and Northeastern States (New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut) at every phase of an epidemic. Finally, influenza waves that directly followed seasons that introduced or reintroduced a novel influenza subtype were significantly longer and slower in progression than the waves that introduced/reintroduced the novel virus. Identifying spatiotemporal patterns could improve epidemic prediction and prevention. This research determined the spatial and temporal characteristics of seasonal influenza in the U. S. and showed that these characteristics differed by dominant influenza subtype. Results of this research should aid public health professionals in refining influenza intervention strategies that include better placement and distribution of vaccines and other medicines...|$|R
