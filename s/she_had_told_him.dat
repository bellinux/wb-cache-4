5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
25|$|Fontanne went {{to great}} lengths to avoid divulging her true age. Her husband {{reportedly}} died believing she was five years younger than he (as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him).</b> She was, in fact, five years older, but continued to deny, long after Lunt's death, that she was born in 1887.|$|E
25|$|Law did {{not attend}} the IWA General Council {{meetings}} between August 1870 and October 1871. In response to a question on her absence Friedrich Engels said <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she considered she was still a member. She was among the signatories on the 1872 brochure The Fictitious Splits in the International in which Marx and Engels opposed Mikhail Bakunin and his supporters.|$|E

25|$|The next day, on December 13, Juan Diego {{found his}} uncle fully recovered, as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted {{that he too}} had seen her, at his bed-side (fifth apparition); that she had {{instructed}} him to inform the bishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she desired to be known under the title of Guadalupe.|$|E
25|$|Fifth apparition: {{the next}} day Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered, as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he too had seen her, at his bed-side; that she had {{instructed}} him to inform the bishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she desired to be known under the title of Guadalupe. The bishop kept Juan Diego's mantle first in his private chapel {{and then in the}} church on public display where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531 a procession formed for taking the miraculous image back to Tepeyac where it was installed in a small hastily erected chapel. In course of this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when an Indian was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays executed in honour of the Virgin. In great distress, the Indians carried him before the Virgin's image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim made a full and immediate recovery.|$|E
500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in her bedroom and it continued sounding, she opened her bedroom door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her what he should do. [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through her second-floor bedroom window, {{on the roof of the}} home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.|$|E

500|$|Mia Farrow, who {{had come}} and gone from the ashram before, left again and drifted around India before {{returning}} to the United States. Geoffrey Giuliano in Revolver: The Secret History of the Beatles says that, before leaving, she told the Beatles that the Maharishi had made a pass at her. Ned Wynn, one of Farrow's childhood friends, wrote in his 1990 memoir that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> in the early 1970s that the Maharishi had definitely made sexual passes at her. In her 1993 autobiography, Cooke de Herrera wrote that Farrow had confided to her, before the arrival of the Beatles, that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair. Cooke de Herrera wrote that she told Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi's actions. Farrow's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous, describing an encounter with the Maharishi in his private meditation [...] "cave" [...] when he tried to put his arms around her. She reports that her sister Prudence told her that it was [...] "an honour" [...] and [...] "a tradition" [...] for a [...] "holy man" [...] to touch someone after meditation.|$|E
500|$|Alizon Device, {{her mother}} Elizabeth, {{and her brother}} James were summoned to appear before Nowell on 30 March 1612. Alizon confessed that she had sold her soul to the Devil, and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to lame John Law after he had called her a thief. Her brother, James, stated that his sister had also confessed to bewitching a local child. Elizabeth was more reticent, admitting only that her mother, Demdike, had a mark on her body, {{something}} that many, including Nowell, would have regarded as having been left by the Devil after he had sucked her blood. When questioned about Anne Whittle (Chattox), the matriarch of the other family reputedly involved in witchcraft in and around Pendle, Alizon perhaps saw an opportunity for revenge. There may have been bad blood between the two families, possibly dating from 1601, when a member of Chattox's family broke into Malkin Tower, {{the home of the}} Devices, and stole goods worth about £1, equivalent to about £100 as of 2008. Alizon accused Chattox of murdering four men by witchcraft, and of killing her father, John Device, who had died in 1601. She claimed that her father had been so frightened of Old Chattox that he had agreed to give her [...] of oatmeal each year in return for her promise not to hurt his family. The meal was handed over annually until the year before John's death; on his deathbed John claimed that his sickness had been caused by Chattox because they had not paid for protection.|$|E
2500|$|The first witness {{called by}} the {{prosecution}} was Colonel Jefferson Jones, who had interviewed Celia in her cell after her indictment and arrest. He recounted {{the details of his}} conversation with Celia, wherein <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> [...] "the old man had been having sexual intercourse with her," [...] and that {{on the night of the}} murder, she had [...] "told him not to come, that if he came she would hurt him." [...] Jones then described the manner in which Celia had killed Newsom and disposed of his body, as Celia herself had described it to him.|$|E

She will {{tell the whole story}} and Porson will learn it without our interference, and can think what he likes about it." ...|$|R
50|$|The film {{completed}} a trilogy of documentary works by Demers—previously a fiction filmmaker— {{that he was}} inspired to make after finally meeting his biological mother. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that his biological father was Italian, which inspired a film about traditional Montreal barbers, {{many of whom were}} from Italy, entitled Barbiers - Une histoire d’hommes. Demers' follow up film, Les dames en bleu, was about Quebec singer Michel Louvain and his legion of mostly female fans from his mother's generation.|$|R
2500|$|In April 1989, New York Newsday {{published}} {{claims by}} a boyfriend of Brawley's, Daryl Rodriguez, that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{the story was}} fabricated, with help from her mother, in order to avert the wrath of her stepfather. Writing about the case in a 2004 book on perceptions of racial violence, sociologist Jonathan Markovitz concluded [...] "it is reasonable to suggest that Brawley's fear {{and the kinds of}} suffering that she must have gone through must have been truly staggering if they were enough to force her to resort to cutting her hair, covering herself in feces and crawling into a garbage bag." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the detectives}} at Scotland Yard, Frederick Abberline, is {{reported}} to have told George Godley, the policeman who arrested Kłosowski: [...] "You've got Jack the Ripper at last!" [...] In two 1903 interviews with the Pall Mall Gazette, Abberline spelled out his suspicions, referring to Kłosowski by name. Abberline thought Chapman was Jack the Ripper because during the [...] "Jack the Ripper" [...] frenzy he had closely interviewed his first [...] "wife" [...] since arriving in England, Lucie Badewski, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that her husband often used to go out during the night for hours on end.|$|E
2500|$|From Ankara, Yapıcıoğlu went to Çorlu, {{where his}} brother owned a shop. He set his brother's shop on fire {{because he did}} not give him pocket money. He also set the houses of two other {{relatives}} on fire. He raided his father's home in Silivri with intent to kill him, but his father defended himself with a pump-action shotgun. He fled from there to Edremit, where his maternal grandmother lived. Three days later, Yapıcıoğlu killed her by hitting her [...] head with a crystal ashtray, because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> something about his mother (her daughter) that he did not like. His mother {{died of a heart attack}} two days later, upon learning about this incident.|$|E

2500|$|Later, {{a detective}} and two radio car {{officers}} {{found the body}} in a ravine below the sign. Entwistle remained unidentified until her uncle, {{with whom she had}} been living in the Beachwood Canyon area, identified her remains. He connected her two-day absence with the description and the initials [...] "P.E.," [...] written on the suicide note, which had been published in the newspapers. He said that on Friday, September 16, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she was going for a walk to a drugstore and see some friends. The police surmised that instead she {{made her way to the}} nearby southern slope of Mount Lee to the foot of the Hollywoodland sign, climbed a workman's ladder to the top of the [...] "H" [...] and jumped. The cause of death was listed by the coroner as [...] "multiple fractures of the pelvis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Huckstepp's murder {{resulted}} {{in one of}} the longest running inquests of its kind in Australia. It began in 1987 and lasted until 1991, though it only sat for a total of nineteen days in that time. It was alleged at the inquest that Huckstepp had gone to meet an unknown drug dealer to obtain a fresh supply of heroin and was then lured to Busby's Pond, a remote area of the park. She was then strangled and drowned. Peter Smith, the federal policeman she was having an affair with, testified that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she was frightened that Neddy Smith and Roger Rogerson or David Kelleher (who was in prison at the time) may try to murder her. He later told the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that Huckstepp's death was a [...] "traumatic event for (him)". The coroner found that there was insufficient evidence to recommend charges and made a finding that Huckstepp had been murdered by a person or persons unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Horsmanden, one {{of three}} justices {{on the court and}} leader of an investigation, {{pressured}} 16-year-old indentured servant, Mary Burton, to testify against her master Hughson on theft charges. While a grand jury heard that case, the first of 13 suspicious fires broke out. On March 18, a fire broke out at New York governor George Clarke's complex at Fort George. Horsmanden put {{a lot of pressure on}} Burton to talk about the fires. Finally, Burton said the fires were a conspiracy between blacks and poor whites to burn down the town. Horsmanden was pleased with her testimony but was convinced that Burton knew more about the conspiracy than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> He threatened to throw her in jail if she did not tell him more, so she testified further. There was rising fear about slaves and poor whites' combining for insurrection. Burton swore the three members of the Geneva Club met frequently at Hughson's home, had talked about burning the fort and town, and the Hughsons had agreed to help them. Another person suspected in the fires was [...] "Margaret Sorubiero, alias Salingburgh, alias Kerry, commonly called Peggy", or the [...] "Newfoundland Irish" [...] beauty. She was a prostitute who serviced blacks. The room she lived in was paid for by Caesar, with whom she had a child.|$|E

6000|$|Scrymgeour {{thought it}} over. [...] "She is {{grateful}} to me," [...] he concluded, [...] "for drawing away suspicion {{from the other}} man, but what can have made the father so amiable? Suppose <b>she</b> <b>has</b> not <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that I am an impostor, he should still look upon me as a villain; and if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> he should be still more furious. It is curious, but no affair of mine." [...] Three times {{within the next few}} days he encountered the lady on the tow-path or elsewhere with a young gentleman of empty countenance, who, he saw must be the real Lothario. Once they passed him {{when he was in the}} shadow of a tree, and the lady was making pretty faces with a cigarette in her mouth. The house-boat Heathen Chinee lay but a short distance off, and Scrymgeour could see the owner gazing after his daughter placidly, a pipe between his lips.|$|R
2500|$|According to the Zohar, Rabbi Abba {{was once}} going toward Lod {{when he met}} Rabbi Zeira, the son of Rav. [...] Quoting [...] "And he {{believed}} in the Lord, and he counted it to him for righteousness," [...] Rabbi Zeira asked whether it means that God counted it to Abraham, or that Abraham counted it to God. [...] Rabbi Zeira {{reported that he had}} heard that it means that God counted it to Abraham, but that interpretation did not satisfy him. [...] Rabbi Abba replied that it is indeed not so. [...] Noting that [...] says, [...] "and he reckoned her" [...] ( [...] , vayahsh'veha)" [...] and not [...] "and he reckoned to him ( [...] , vayahshov lo)," [...] Rabbi Abba taught that this means that Abraham counted it to God. [...] For [...] says, [...] "And he brought him forth abroad," [...] meaning that God told Abraham, in effect, to give up his astrological speculations; that was not the way to acquire knowledge of God’s Name. [...] Abram, it was true, would not beget children, but Abraham would beget children. [...] says, [...] "So ( [...] , Koh) shall your seed be." [...] The word , Koh, expresses the tenth sacred Crown of the King by which God’s Name may be known; it is the Crown through which judgments are set in motion. [...] Upon hearing God’s promise in [...] Abraham became filled with joy, and [...] "Abraham reckoned Her" [...] — that is, the Crown — [...] "for righteousness"; that is, he reckoned Her as if She were Compassion, because <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that he would father Isaac.|$|E
2500|$|When {{brought before}} Pharaoh, Sarah said that Abram was her brother, {{and the king}} thereupon {{bestowed}} upon the latter many presents and marks of distinction. [...] As a token of his love for Sarai the king deeded his entire property to her, and gave her the land of Goshen as her hereditary possession: for this reason the Israelites subsequently lived in that land. Sarai prayed to God to deliver her from the king, and He thereupon sent an angel, who struck Pharaoh whenever he attempted to touch her. Pharaoh was so astonished at these blows that he spoke kindly to Sarai, who confessed that she was Abraham's wife. The king then ceased to annoy her. According to another version, Pharaoh persisted in annoying her after <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{that she was a}} married woman; thereupon the angel struck him so violently that he became ill, and was thereby prevented from continuing to trouble her. According to one tradition it was when Pharaoh saw these miracles wrought in Sarai's behalf that he gave her his daughter Hagar as slave, saying: [...] "It is better that my daughter should be a slave in the house of such a woman than mistress in another house." [...] Abimelech acted likewise. Sarah is the sister of Abram by another mother and wife of Abram as described in the Hebrew Bible (the Book of Genesis). In Genesis 17:15, God changes her name to Sarah (princess) ("a woman of high rank") as part of the covenant with El Shaddai after Hagar bears Abram his first born son Ishmael. The name Sarai uses the semitic root Šarai or law and like El has the sense of power, authority, lord, deity, natural law, law as might be expected for the lady of the house. The Hebrew name Sarah indicates a woman of high rank (less than that of 1st wife) and is sometimes translated as [...] "princess." ...|$|E
60|$|Cornelia {{was left}} to no better counsels than those of Charmian Maybough, and these were {{disabled}} from what {{they might have been}} at their best, by Cornelia's failure to be frank with her. If she was wronging Charmian by making her a half-confidant only, she could not be more open with her than with Ludlow, and she must let her think that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything until <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything.|$|E

Rasmusson concludes that the only other survivor must have been the informer, whom he suspects has returned to the country to claim the equivalent of £5,000 stolen from the organisation. After more than ten years, he has sought out Jorgenson in order to kill him in revenge.|$|R
