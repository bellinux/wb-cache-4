5000|$|Over the {{continental}} shelf, Antarctic toothfish feed on shrimp (Nauticaris spp.) and small fish, principally another neutrally buoyant nototheniid, the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum). This loosely schooling species {{is also a}} major prey of Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis). [...] Therefore, competition for prey among toothfish and these other mesopredators (middle trophic level predators) could be very important. The large Antarctic toothfish are eaten by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), killer whales (Orcinus orca), Weddell seals and possibly colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). Toothfish that are dwelling on the bottom, particularly those caught during the summer on {{the continental}} slope, eat mainly grenadiers (Macrouridae) but also feed on other smaller fish species and <b>skates</b> (<b>Raja</b> <b>spp.).</b> Antarctic toothfish have been caught to depths of 2200m, though based on commercial fishing effort, few occur that deep.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 In the past, sharks, skates and ray {{species have}} mainly {{occurred}} in incidental fisheries. Now they {{are increasingly being}} directly targeted due to the depleted status of traditionally targeted species. The life history characteristics of many elasmobranch species make them more sensitive to high rates of fishing mortality.

40|$|Like {{many other}} {{elasmobranchs}} (Wourms, 1977), the little <b>skate,</b> <b>Raja</b> erinacea, lays individual eggs {{covered with a}} specialized structure termed the egg case or 'Mermaid's Purse'. Collagen is the major component of the egg case, which is secreted by the shell gland in the anterior region of the oviduct (Wourms, 1977). Smith (1936) and Price & Daiber (1967) suggested that the egg case provided an osmotically isolated environment until the embryo was capable of urea retention and osmoregulation. However, Reed (1968 a) showed that the encapsulated embryos of the <b>skate,</b> <b>Raja</b> binoculata, possess the enzymes of the Krebs ornithine-urea cycle {{and are able to}} retain near-adult levels of both urea and trimethylamine oxide, even at very early stages (Reed, 1968 ft). The retention of urea seems to be secondary to a urea-impermeable embryonic membrane since Needham & Needham (1930) found that the egg cases of Syllium (= Scyliorhinus) canicula are permeable to urea, and this has been substantiated by recent work on the egg cases of the same species (Hornsey, 1978; Foulley & Melinger, 1980).

Until now, sufficient data to evaluate stock status was not available. I parameterized a Graham-Schaefer model using catch (1996 - 2010), catch-per-unit-effort (1996 - 2010), and fishery-independent surveys (1984 - 2009) to estimate current abundance.

Occasional complete capsules were without eggs or possessed unusually small eggs. The right capsule was typically extruded first. Capsules in various stages of development were observed to occur generally throughout the area investigated and in all months of the year. The size of the capsule and the volumes of the contained egg and albumen increased with increase in fish length and consequently were greater in skates from areas where sexual maturity began at greater lengths than in areas where sexual maturity occurred at smaller lengths...|$|R
40|$|Isometric force {{measurements}} {{have had}} a long-standing application {{in the study of}} cardiac contractility and more recent studies of this ilk have been directed at elucidating excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in fish hearts. This paper brings together recent discoveries, emphasizing differences among species and the effects of temperature. The importance of such an overview is tw-fold.

40|$|The {{retention}} of {{high concentrations of}} urea in the tissues of marine elasmobranchs {{is the key to}} their osmoregulation strategy. During environmental dilution, changes in the mechanisms of retention in the kidney result in the reduction of urea concentrations in the body fluids. In the kidney of the little <b>skate,</b> <b>Raja</b> erinacea, the cDNA of a renal urea transporter (UT) was isolated, with high homology to that of the shark kidney UT (SkUT). This UT was down regulated during environmental dilution, indicating its importance in the ability of the renal tubule to reabsorb urea. Facilitated urea transport was characterized also in brush-border membrane vesicles of renal tubules from the dorsal and ventral sections of the kidney. Although facilitated transport was demonstrated in vesicles from both kidney sections, there were significant differences in inhibitor, analogue and ion responses. These findings provide evidence for the role of facilitated urea transporters in urea retention by the skate kidney. ...|$|R

40|$|Organic osmolyte channels: Transport {{characteristics}} and regulation. Erythrocytes of the <b>skate</b> (<b>Raja</b> erinacea) exposed to hypotonic stress swell and then undergo a volume regulatory decrease by releasing taurine and other osmolytes. Previous {{studies showed that}} taurine release occurs via a volume-activated, Na+-independent, bi-directional transporter that has the properties of a size-limited channel. We now report on the transport characteristics of this channel and its regulation. Kinetic, competition and inhibitor studies indicate that polyols (myo-inositol) and trimethylamines (betaine) are transported by the same channel as taurine. Although {{the identity of the}} channel is still unknown a variety of evidence suggests that band 3 is involved in either channel formation or regulation. Hypotonicity causes phosphorylation and structural changes in band 3. Under isotonic conditions band 3 is predominantly in the dimeric form. Hypotonicity causes a shift to tetrameric band 3. We hypothesize that the band 3 tetramer either forms or regulates an osmolyte channel. The finding that expression of band 3 protein increases osmolyte channel activity in Xenopus oocytes supports this hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The all-rod retina of the <b>skate</b> (<b>Raja</b> erinacea or R- 0 scel/ata) {{is known}} to have the {{remarkable}} capability of responding to incremental flashes superimposed on background intensities that initially block all light-evoked responses and are well above the level at which rods saturate in mixed rod/cone retinas. To examine further the unusual properties of the skate visual system, we have analyzed responses of their horizontal cells to intensity-modulated step, sinusoidal, and white-noise stimuli. We found that during exposures to mean intensities bright enough to block responses to incremental stimuli, decremental stimuli were also initially blocked. Thereafter, the horizontal cells underwent a slow recovery phase during which there was marked nonlinearity in their response properties. The cell first (within 2 - 3 rain) responded to decrements in intensity and later (after> 10 rain) became responsive to incremental sdmuli. After adaptation to a steady state, however, the responses to intensity modulation were nearly linear over a broad range of modulation depths even at the brightest mean levels of illumination.
