The laboratory sheets made from pulp samples from the pressurized system had higher <b>strain</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> and tensile energy adsorption index but lower tensile index compared to sheets from the pulp sample refined in a conventional atmospheric high consistency system. ISO-sheets and freely dried sheets were also made from refined pulp samples whose fibres had been coated with one or three layers of polymer. Polyelectrolyte multilayers were built by sequential provision of anionic starch and cationic CMC. Three different stock preparation strategies were used for the provision of polymer.

40|$|A {{coronary}} stent is a mechanical device designed to open arteries {{that have been}} occluded. The manufacturing of stents involves the laser cutting of specific designs in stainless steel tubes. In order to determine factors influencing the mechanical behaviour of stents, tensile tests were performed on struts laser-cut in tubes used for the manufacturing of stents. The hardening curves obtained show that the yield stress and Young’s Modulus increase when {{the width of the}} struts decreases, until a limit is reached where they start decreasing again; the breaking point varies inversely. To confirm the results a three-point bending test was conducted. Because the struts are cut in a tube, the resulting geometry makes it difficult to predict the mechanical behaviour. A model using Finite Element Analysis (F. E. A.) was therefore created and the mechanical behaviour identified by comparing the experimental results and the F. E. A. prediction. The hardening curves obtained confirm the conclusions reached in tension. In order to understand the phenomenon, the accuracy of laser cutting was investigated. An F. E. A. was conducted, showing that the inaccuracy of laser cutting can only explain the <b>strain</b> <b>at</b> <b>breaking</b> decreasing with the width. The geometry of the specimen being discarded, the microstructure was examined {{in order to understand the}} mechanical behaviour. The Heat Affected Zone (H. A.

Consequently, the strut behaves like a sandwich material partly explaining the experimental results.

A commercial-grade of isotactic polypropylene was modified with a beta-specific nucleator. From both the original material (alpha-iPP) and the beta-nucleated material (beta-iPP), tensile test specimens were injection-moulded. Stress-strain measurements performed at room temperature revealed a positive influence of higher mould temperatures but negligible effect of holding pressure on the elastic modulus of injection-moulded specimens. It was suggested that at optimum processing conditions the elastic modulus of both alpha- and beta-iPP may be comparable. The softening effect of beta-form manifested itself in systematically lower yield stress values of beta-iPP as compared to alpha-iPP. The yield strain of both alpha- and beta-iPP decreased {{with the increase of}} mould temperature and the decrease of holding pressure. Prolonged solidification times at higher mould temperatures negatively influenced the <b>strain</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of the specimens; the values of beta-iPP exceeded by several folds those of alpha-iPP.

40|$|International audienceDifferent Ethylene-Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) {{elastomers}} {{with different}} crosslink densities have been processed {{in order to}} evaluate the influence of gamma irradiation on their properties. In {{the case of a}} major phenomenon of chain scissions, the consequences are a decrease in the modulus and also a decrease in the <b>strain</b> <b>at</b> <b>break.</b> This decrease in the <b>strain</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> is opposite to what is expected for materials with increasing average chain length between crosslinks. To gain more insight into the network architecture, which is presumed to be responsible for this behavior, Charlesby's approach is applied. In tandem, a computational model of the degradation is developed for improved prediction of the evolution of the elastic modulus. Using these calculations, a novel interpretation of the ultimate properties of the elastomer as a function of its architecture is proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Segmented poly(ether ester amide) s {{comprising}} glycine or β-alanine extended bisoxalamide hard segments {{are highly}} phase separated thermoplastic elastomers {{with a broad}} temperature independent rubber plateau. These materials with molecular weights, Mn, exceeding 30 × 103 g mol− 1 are conveniently prepared by polycondensation of preformed bisester–bisoxalamides and commercially available PTHF diols. FT-IR revealed strongly hydrogen bonded and highly ordered bisoxalamide hard segments with degrees of ordering between 73 and 99 %. The morphology consists of fiber-like nano-crystals randomly dispersed in the soft polymer matrix. The micro-structural parameters of the copolymers were addressed by simultaneous small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. It is shown that the crystals have strictly identical thickness, which {{is close to the}} contour length of the hard segment. The long dimension of the crystals is identified with the direction of the hydrogen bonds. The melting transitions of the hard segments are sharp, with temperatures up to 170 °C. The studied polymers have an elastic modulus in the range of 139 – 170 MPa, a stress <b>at</b> <b>break</b> in the range of 19 – 31 MPa combined with <b>strains</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of higher than 800 %. The segmented copolymer comprising the β-alanine based bisoxalamide hard segment with a spacer of 6 methylene groups has a melting transition of 141 °C which is higher than the melting transition of its glycine analogue of 119 °C. Likewise, the fracture stress increased from 22 to 31 MPa when the glycine ester group in the hard segment was replaced with β-alanine. The improved thermal and mechanical properties of the latter polymers is related to the crystal packing of the β-alanine based hard segments in the copolymer compared to the packing of the hard segments comprising glycine ester group...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{samples were}} {{prepared}} {{according to the}} routine work for sample preparation in dental laboratories. After reaching dough stage, the mixture packed into dumbbell shaped of stainless steel mould and pressed in a hydraulic bench press for 25 min at room temperature. For heat-cure, the polymerization cycle was carried out using water bath, while self-cure done at room temperature. The residual monomer content was evaluated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The tensile test was evaluated in dry and wet condition (distilled water). The {{results showed that the}} residual monomer content for heat-cure samples was 1. 44 wt. % while self-cure samples was 8. 71 wt. %. The residual monomer content of heat-cure samples was comply with ISO- 1567 standard for denture base material. The heat-cure material depicted higher tensile strength, tensile <b>strain</b> and energy <b>at</b> <b>break</b> than that of self-cure material. This is due to higher residual monomer content in self-cure which acts as plasticizer, subsequently lead to reduce the properties of self-cure material. After immersion, the tensile strength, tensile <b>strain</b> and energy <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of heat-cure samples found to decrease, while the self-cure samples were found to increase. Generally, the heat-cure material showed better properties compared to self-cure material...|$|R
