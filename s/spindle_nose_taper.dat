5000|$|A {{backplate}} with threads may screw onto a threaded <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> (for lathe work) or onto an {{adapter plate}} {{with the same}} nose, to be mounted on the table of milling machines or surface grinding machines. This [...] "threaded spindle nose" [...] type of mounting was the typical method in the 19th century through 1930s. It is simple and useful, but the degree of control of concentricity is not quite {{good enough to be}} foolproof for high-speed, high-precision work (high precision can be achieved, but the time and skill involved in the setups makes it a poor choice now that better options exist, such as the cam-lock <b>spindle</b> <b>noses</b> described below). Threaded <b>spindle</b> <b>noses</b> are still built on new machine tools, but only of the low-end variety (hobbyist, least-expense MRO, etc.). High-capital manufacturing (where high upfront expense yields lowest possible unit expense for mid- to high-volume part counts of high-precision parts) has moved away from this type of mounting. The exact-adjust (Set-Tru) concept is one way to chase high concentricity on threaded <b>spindle</b> <b>noses</b> with some relative degree of ease.|$|R

5000|$|Work on the {{standardization}} of T-slots started in 1924 and a tentative standard {{was published in}} 1927. The first official American Standard for T-slots came in 1941. [...] B5 Technical Committee No. 11 was organized in New York on December 4, 1928, and B5 Technical Committee No. 4 on <b>Spindle</b> <b>Noses</b> was organized on December 5, 1928. These two committees worked in close cooperation {{with each other and}} with manufacturers and users of engine lathes, turret lathes and automatic lathes in developing standards for <b>spindle</b> <b>noses</b> and chucks.|$|R

5000|$|The chuck may be {{held against}} the taper with a {{threaded}} retainer ring (large thin nut), typically wrenched with a spanner wrench of the pin or hook variety. The peak of popularity for building {{this type of}} <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> was the 1940s and 1950s.|$|R

50|$|Almost all {{machine tool}} spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper {{as their primary}} method of {{attachment}} for tools. Even on many drill presses, handheld drills, and lathes, which have chucks (such as a drill chuck or collet chuck), the chuck is attached by a taper. On drills, drill presses, and milling machines, the male member is the tool shank or toolholder shank, and the female socket is integral with the spindle. On lathes, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; <b>spindle</b> <b>noses</b> may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.|$|R

Firstly, this paper proposes a three dimensional finite element models for the motorized spindle, computing equations of heat generation and heat transfer coefficient is provided. Secondly, the thermal behavior such as the temperature field and thermal displacement of the <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> in both the axial and radial directions is dynamically simulated and analyzed. At last, thermal displacement measurement data verified the simulation results were satisfying to replace the experiment data, which can significantly reduce the production costs and increase the efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|Another type {{of shell}} {{fastening}} {{is simply a}} large-diameter fine thread. The shell then screws onto the arbor just as old-style lathe chuck backplates screw onto the lathe's <b>spindle</b> <b>nose.</b> This method is commonly used on the 2" [...] or 3" [...] boring heads used on knee mills. As with the threaded-spindle-nose lathe chucks, this style of mounting requires that the cutter only take cuts in one rotary direction. Usually (i.e., with right-hand helix orientation) this means only M03, never M04, or in pre-CNC terminology, [...] "only forward, never reverse". One could use a left-hand thread if one needed a mode of use involving the opposite directions (i.e., only M04, never M03).|$|R

This design also reduces vibrations and achieves high rotational balance, and enables precise control of rotational accelerations and decelerations. The objective of this work is to optimize the parameters influencing the stiffness of the high frequency milling spindle running at 12000 rpm with power rating of 10 KW. Theoretical analysis {{has been carried out}} to evaluate the spindle stiffness and to minimize deflection at the nose by varying the following parameters: (i) Bearing arrangement, (ii) Overhang of <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> from the front bearing, (iii) Spindle diameter between the bearings. The static analysis was also carried out using ANSYS and there is a good correlation between the results obtained by theoretical approach and ANSYS...|$|R
40|$|The {{contouring}} {{accuracy of}} a multi-axis machine has a critical {{effect on the}} quality of many advanced technology products. One of the best approaches to assessing the contouring performance of machine tools is through double ball bar measurement. During circular interpolation motion, the machine traverses, with two axes at a time, a circular trajectory, with each axis subject to sinusoidal changes in acceleration, velocity, and position. The motion error is measured by detecting the relative distance between a point on the <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> and another point on the machine table and plotting this distance in polar coordinates. The present paper derives mathematical models and diagnosis procedures for first and second-order motion error resulting from the active degrees of freedom of a multi-axis machine. The theoretical results are verified by both computer simulation and double ball bar testing experiments. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{measurement}} and improvement {{system for the}} consistency of machined diameter by a CNC lathe with referring the external shape of a machined workpiece. Under {{the assumption that the}} external shape of the workpiece is axial symmetrical, the axis of symmetry equivalent to the axial line between the <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> and the tailstock can be regarded as the compensatory reference for the straight line motion in turning. This axis in ZX plane can be represented as the successive change of center position of the both external profiles with use of a laser scan sensor traversing in the lathe. For the compensatory machining, the CL data is modified and applied by taking account of the magnitude of machining error from the compensatory reference. As the results of the compensatory machining, the accuracy of finishing has been highly improved as precise as the positioning accuracy of the lathe...|$|R
30|$|According to Fig. 9, by {{applying}} the medium level of the cutting depth, a desirable surface roughness is achieved. The analysis reveals that a proper surface finish is achieved when the <b>spindle</b> speed and <b>nose</b> radius are higher than their moderate level. From the above discussion, {{it can be concluded}} that the highest level of the <b>spindle</b> speed and <b>nose</b> radius, the moderate level of the cutting depth, and the lowest level of the feed rate is an ideal combination to achieve an acceptable surface roughness in the finish hard turning operation.|$|R
5000|$|Many lathes {{that run}} collet chucks have {{dedicated}} collet-closer setups whereby {{there is no}} backplate, and the <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> contains the female taper for either the collet's male outer taper, or a sleeve that will hold it. A hollow drawbar passes back through the headstock to its back side, where a closer mechanism is mounted. The latter allows easy, rapid opening and closing of the collet. The drawbar's inner diameter determines the through-the-spindle bar diameter capacity of the lathe. Some collet-closer systems even allow opening and closing without stopping the spindle rotation. The closer on a manual lathe is either lever-style or handwheel-style. The closer on a CNC lathe is powered (electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic), {{and it may be}} controlled by various means: a foot pedal that the operator steps on when desired; a line in the program (for opening and closing under program control); or a button on the control panel.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{knowledge}} discovery technique {{is used to}} build an effective and transparent mathematic thermal error model for machine tools. Our proposed thermal error modeling methodology (called KRL) integrates the schemes of K-means theory (KM), rough-set theory (RS), and linear regression model (LR). First, to explore the machine tool's thermal behavior, an integrated system is designed to simultaneously measure the temperature ascents at selected characteristic points and the thermal deformations at <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> under suitable real machining conditions. Second, the obtained data are classified by the KM method, further reduced by the RS scheme, and a linear thermal error model is established by the LR technique. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) thermal error model is introduced for comparison. Finally, a verification experiment is carried out and results reveal that the proposed KRL model is effective in predicting thermal behavior in machine tools. Our proposed KRL model is transparent, easily understood by users, and can be easily programmed or modified for different machining conditions...|$|R

5000|$|For Project Gusto, {{the concept}} had been {{simplified}} and {{reduced to a}} single aircraft. Code-named FISH or First Invisible Super Hustler, the aircraft {{was based on a}} lifting body design that bears some resemblance to the ASSET of a few years later. It differed in having the <b>nose</b> <b>taper</b> down to a flat horizontal line instead of the rounded delta of the ASSET, and the fuselage was not as large at the rear. Two vertical control surfaces were placed {{on either side of the}} fuselage at the rear, and a small delta wing covered about the rear third of the aircraft. It was to be powered by two Marquardt RJ-59 ramjets during the cruise phase, providing a cruise speed of Mach 4 at 75000 ft, climbing to 90000 ft as it burned off fuel. In order to handle the intense heat generated by aerodynamic heating at these speeds, the leading edges of the nose and wings were built of a new [...] "pyroceram" [...] ceramic material, while the rest of the fuselage was made of a Honeycomb structure stainless steel similar to the material for the proposed XB-70 Valkyrie. After completing its mission, the aircraft would return to friendly airspace, slow, and then open intakes for two small jet engines for the return flight at subsonic speeds.|$|R
