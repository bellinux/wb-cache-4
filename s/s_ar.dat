50|$|Alpha process {{elements}} (or alpha elements) are so-called {{since their}} most abundant isotopes are integer multiples of four, {{the mass of}} the helium nucleus (the alpha particle). Stable alpha elements are: C, O, Ne, Mg, Si, <b>S,</b> <b>Ar,</b> Ca. They are synthesized by alpha capture prior to the silicon fusing process, a precursor to Type II supernovae. Silicon and calcium are purely alpha process elements. Magnesium can be burned by proton capture reactions. As for oxygen, some authors consider it an alpha element, while others do not. Oxygen is surely an alpha element in low-metallicity population II stars. It is produced in Type II supernovae and its enhancement is well correlated with an enhancement of other alpha process elements. Sometimes carbon and nitrogen are considered alpha process elements, since they are synthesized in nuclear alpha-capture reactions.|$|E

Cells made resistant to ALP (<b>S</b> 49 <b>AR)</b> are defective in sphingomyelin synthesis and ALP uptake, and also have acquired resistance to FasL and DNA damage. However, these cells can be resensitized following prolonged culturing in the absence of ALP. The resistant cells show sustained ERK/Akt activity, consistent with enhanced survival signalling. In search of a common mediator of the observed cross-resistance, we found that <b>S</b> 49 <b>AR</b> cells lacked the PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 phosphatase SHIP- 1, a known regulator of the Akt survival pathway. Resensitization of the <b>S</b> 49 <b>AR</b> cells restored SHIP- 1 expression as well as phosphoinositide and sphingomyelin levels.

40|$|The Sindbis-group alphavirus <b>S.</b> A. <b>AR</b> 86 encodes a {{threonine}} at nonstructural protein 1 (nsP 1) 538 that {{is associated}} with neurovirulence in adult mice. Mutation of the nsP 1 538 Thr to the consensus Ile found in nonneurovirulent Sindbis-group alphaviruses attenuates <b>S.</b> A. <b>AR</b> 86 for adult mouse neurovirulence, while introduction of Thr at position 538 in a nonneurovirulent Sindbis virus background confers increased neurovirulence (M. T. Heise et al., J. Virol. 74 : 4207 - 4213, 2000). Since changes in the viral nonstructural region are likely to affect viral replication, studies were performed to evaluate the effect of Thr or Ile at nsP 1 538 on viral growth, nonstructural protein processing, and RNA synthesis. Multistep growth curves in Neuro 2 A and BHK- 21 cells revealed that the attenuated s 51 (nsP 1 538 Ile) virus had a slight, but reproducible growth advantage over the wild-type s 55 (nsP 1 538 Thr) virus. nsP 1 538 lies within the cleavage recognition domain between nsP 1 and nsP 2, and the presence of the attenuating Ile at nsP 1 538 accelerated the processing of <b>S.</b> A. <b>AR</b> 86 nonstructural proteins both in vitro and in infected cells. Since nonstructural protein processing is known to regulate alphavirus RNA synthesis, experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of Ile or Thr at nsP 1 538 on viral RNA synthesis. A combination of <b>S.</b> A. <b>AR</b> 86 -derived reporter assays and RNase protection assays determined that the presence of Ile at nsP 1 538 led to earlier expression from the viral 26 S promoter without affecting viral minus- or plus-strand synthesis.

40|$|Nucleophilic {{aromatic}} substitution (<b>S</b> N <b>Ar)</b> {{is widely}} used by organic chemists to functionalize aromatic molecules, {{and it is the}} most commonly used method to generate arenes that contain 18 F for use in positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging 1. A wide range of nucleophiles exhibit <b>S</b> N <b>Ar</b> reactivity, and the operational simplicity of the reaction means that the transformation can be conducted reliably and on large scales 2. During <b>S</b> N <b>Ar,</b> attack of a nucleophile at a carbon atom bearing a ‘leaving group’ leads to a negatively charged intermediate called a Meisenheimer complex. Only arenes with electron-withdrawing substituents can sufficiently stabilize the resulting build-up of negative charge during Meisenheimer complex formation, limiting the scope of <b>S</b> N <b>Ar</b> reactions: the most common <b>S</b> N <b>Ar</b> substrates contain strong π-acceptors in the ortho and/or para position(s) 3. Here we present an unusual concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (CS N Ar) that is not limited to electron-poor arenes, because it does not proceed via a Meisenheimer intermediate. We show a phenol deoxyfluorination reaction for which CS N Ar is favoured over a stepwise displacement. Mechanistic insights enabled us to develop a functional-group-tolerant 18 F−deoxyfluorination reaction of phenols, which can be used to synthesize 18 F-PET probes. Selective 18 F introduction, without the need for the common, but cumbersome, azeotropic drying of 18 F, can now be accomplished from phenols as starting materials, and provides access to 18 F-labelled compounds not accessible through conventional chemistry...|$|R
