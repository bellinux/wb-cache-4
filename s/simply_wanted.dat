5|$|In October 2008 President Fernández de Kirchner nationalised private {{pension funds}} for almost $30 billion, ostensibly {{to protect the}} {{pensions}} from falling stock prices around the world, although critics said the government <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to add the money to its budget. Private pension funds, which were first licensed in 1994, suffered large losses during the 19982002 crisis and by 2008, the state subsidized 77% of the funds' beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E
5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan did not believe in either global or strongpoint containment; he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to restore the balance of power between the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E

5|$|Israeli {{military}} {{officials said the}} Palestinians intended to build a mosque on {{the ruins of the}} site. The statement came after workers repairing the tomb painted the site's dome green, the colour of Islam. A Palestinian Authority spokesman denied the allegations and said that Arafat had ordered the renovations and for the synagogue to be rebuilt. Ghassan Shakaa, the mayor, claimed that city officials <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to return the building to the way it looked before it came into Israeli hands in the 1967 Mideast war. Under intense U.S. and international pressure the dome was repainted white.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian's {{candidacy}} {{for the head}} coaching job at Notre Dame was unusual {{because he was not}} a Notre Dame graduate, as every head coach since Knute Rockne had been. Parseghian was also an Armenian Presbyterian, making him the first non-Catholic coach since Rockne, who converted in 1925. Joyce made it clear before his hiring that he did not care about Parseghian's religion, but <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> someone who could lead the football team to success.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{contemplated}} recording more {{tracks to}} make up a double album in a similar manner, but following an earthquake, he decided to relocate to New York City and hold a live recording session at the Record Plant with session players. The basic idea was to create songs with sing-along choruses. Rundgren did not pre-plan who would play on the sessions, but <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> anyone who happened to be in or near the studio to turn up and learn the material.|$|E

5|$|Dave Finnegan {{was cast}} as Mickah Wallace, a belligerent and hot-tempered bouncer {{who becomes a}} drummer for the band. Parker's first meeting with Finnegan began civilly before their exchanges grew more and more heated. They soon became {{verbally}} abusive, threatening each other with disturbing acts of violence. Parker cast Finnegan immediately, explaining that he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to test the limits of Finnegan's aggression, as he wanted the truculence of the character to be convincing. Colm Meaney first learned of the film adaptation while working with Parker on Come See the Paradise. After Parker held auditions for the younger cast members, Meaney secured the role of Jimmy's father Jimmy Rabbitte, Sr. The audition scene in the film, in which various musicians audition at Jimmy Rabbitte's home, required more than 100 band members. Peter Rowen, brother of Irish artist Guggi, appears as a young skateboarding boy who asks to audition for the band. At {{the time of the}} film's production, Rowen had appeared on the cover art of U2's albums Boy (1980) and War (1983), and was a national skating champion.|$|E

25|$|Plamondon was re-elected without {{difficulty}} in the 1993 federal election, as the Bloc won fifty-four out of seventy-five seats in Quebec {{to become the}} official opposition in the House of Commons. The Liberal Party won a majority government {{under the leadership of}} Jean Chrétien. At his own request, Plamondon was left out of the Bloc's initial shadow cabinet. He pleaded guilty to the charge against him in April 1994, maintaining his innocence but adding that he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. He received an absolute discharge and does not have a criminal record.|$|E
25|$|James Cox {{was named}} the {{starting}} quarterback to replace Klatt on August 20. Despite having missed most of spring practice with a broken thumb, Coach Hawkins picked the senior over juniors Brian White and Bernard Jackson saying his seniority wasn't a factor and he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> the best players on the field. With one year left of eligibility, Cox has seen playing time the previous 3 seasons behind Klatt, with two starts to his credit: the 2005 Champs Sports Bowl and in 2004 against Iowa State. In the 14 games he has played in prior to the 2006 season, his stats are 42 of 79 attempts for 423 yards with 3 interception and 2 Touchdowns passing and 37yards rushing in 20 attempts with 1 TD (5 sacks for 28yards).|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Capone {{sent two}} {{more of his}} men, Frank Rio and Willie Heeney, to demand that Touhy once again hand over control of his operations. Touhy himself had no armed men among his gang members. Realizing that Capone would try to use force after his refusal, Touhy {{approached}} local law enforcement officers and others to ask for their support. He explained that he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to sell beer, while domination by the Capone gang would bring lawlessness, gambling and prostitution. Local leaders agreed to help him. Merchants refused to use Capone's gambling punchboards or buy his own low-quality beer. When Rio and Heeney met with Touhy, off-duty police and local farmers were lounging about in the building. This show of force unnerved Capone's gunmen, who reported that Touhy's gang must have had hundreds of armed men.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of the Shang dynasty in the middle Yangtze area came to a sudden end with the dynasty's destruction by the Zhou people in c. 1046 BC, who in turn established their own dynasty on the Central Plains. To {{the people of the}} Yangtze, however, the Zhou were not unknown. Indeed, the Records of the Grand Historian record that before the conquest of Shang, the ruler of Chu, Yuxiong, had traveled {{all the way to the}} Zhou court at Feng in Shaanxi to submit to King Wen of Zhou. Perhaps, speculates Ralph D. Sawyer, Yu Xiong had recognized that the Shang dynasty was crumbling or he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to ensure good relations with all powerful neighbors. Either way, he recognized the Zhou as promising upstarts and established a friendly relationship with them. Consequently, when the Zhou overthrew the Shang dynasty, Chu supported the former by supplying bows and arrows.|$|E
25|$|He {{found it}} {{difficult}} to control the mainly Burman region of Toungoo (Taungoo), over which Ava had only nominal suzerainty. When Thinkhaya, the ruler of Toungoo, came to Ava in 1426, he was treated almost as equal by Mohnyin Thado. Mohnyin Thado tried to encircle Toungoo by making his brother the governor of Tharrawaddy, an adjacent region of Toungoo, and staying on good terms with King Binnya Ran I of Hanthawaddy. Nonetheless, Thinkhaya formed an alliance with Binnya Ran, decided to raise a rebellion and laid siege to Prome. However Binnya Ran <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to keep Ava occupied, and was not eager to restart a war with Ava. He sent envoys to Ava, asking for a princess of Ava as the price of alliance. Mohnyin Thado was so angry that he kept the envoys for three months without audience, and had to be dissuaded from killing them. He finally decided to ally with Hanthawaddy and gave his niece to the Hanthawaddy king. Toungoo remained out of his reach {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E

25|$|The {{portion of}} the five-year plans which argued for full employment, public {{healthcare}} and housing, labour benefits, and raises {{are a result of}} Eva's influence on the policy-making of Perón in his first term, as historians note that at first he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to keep imperialists out of Argentina and create effective businesses. The humanitarian relief efforts embedded in the five-year plan are Eva's creation, which endeared the Peronist movement to the working-class people from which Eva had come. Her strong ties to the poor and her position as Perón's wife brought credibility to his promises during his first presidential term and ushered in a new wave of supporters. The first lady's willingness to replace the ailing Hortensio Quijano as Perón's running mate for the 1951 campaign was defeated by her own frail health and by military opposition. An 22 August rally organized for her by the CGT on Buenos Aires' wide Nueve de Julio Avenue failed to turn the tide. On 28 September, elements in the Argentine Army led by General Benjamín Andrés Menéndez attempted a coup against Perón. Although unsuccessful, the mutiny marked {{the end of the first}} lady's political hopes. She died the following July.|$|E
25|$|Solas {{confesses to}} being Fen'Harel, and {{creating}} the Veil {{in order to}} seal away the Evanuris after they assassinated Mythal, {{the only one who}} kept their ambition in check, before their lust for power destroyed the world. He also reveals his intentions to restore the world of the ancient elves, even if he must destroy the world of the present day. If asked about his role in the events of the core game, Solas explains that he had arranged for Corypheus to obtain the magical orb he used, intending for the magister to unlock it and kill himself in the subsequent explosion, after which Solas would retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to tear down the Veil, restoring the world of the ancient elves. After Corypheus survived the blast, an event Solas had not foreseen, Solas joined and supported the Inquisition, seeing them as the world's best hope of defeating Corypheus. If questioned about why he arranged for the Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered, depending on whether or not he is friends with the Inquisitor, he will either admit that he sees value in the present world, or that he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. At the end of their conversation, Solas magically amputates the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaves, with the Inquisitor resolving to stop him by any means necessary. Alternatively, an Inquisitor who befriended Solas can vow to convince him to abandon his plan, with Solas replying that he would be glad to be proven wrong again.|$|E
