At the request of Sun Printers, Crosfield developed the Idotron (1956) to control ink viscosity, later superseded by the Viscomex (1959). In 1953 the technical director of Axel Springer, Germany's largest newspaper publisher, asked Crosfield to design equipment that would allow Springer to first print coloured illustrations, including advertising, in rotogravure and then re-reel to print the text on web offset. This led to the Insetter (1958) that revolutionised newspaper printing by permitting the economical use of colour. The Synchroscope gave machine minders the capacity to visualise images as they were being printed. In the US, Gravure Research Inc. commissioned Crosfield to develop equipment to stop [...] "speckling", undesirable white flecks in shadow areas.

The purpose of this thesis was to investigate how new tools and tools adapted to a specific production set-up can be used to raise awareness regarding the quality and workflow of images and image processing for <b>sheet-fed</b> <b>offset</b> within the graphic industry. The work is divided in to the following three study areas with several sub-studies: 1) The first research goal of the thesis is to identify knowledge levels regarding color separation of images and demand specifications within printing houses. 2) The second research goal is to investigate whether novel tools and new terminology can help to increase the knowledge level regarding color management 3) The third goal is to investigate whether process specific adaptation of key color control tools can improve quality levels Three surveys about color reproduction (focusing on level of knowledge concerning color separation, the use of ICC-profiles and demand specifications for controlled color reproduction) at printing companies in Sweden were made between 2000 and 2004. The surveys indicated a serious problem in the graphic arts industry, involving both an insufficient understanding of color management and a lack of communication. An important part of the work was to assist in make color management understandable for users and thereby optimize printing. For this purpose, digital test forms have been developed. The developed tools, together with descriptive material, will facilitate the understanding of color management issues. Definitions within the field of color separations have been examined, and changes have been suggested. A new term for separation “Compensation by Black”, CB, has been suggested, instead of e. g. GCR and UCR. Is it possible to adapt the different parts of the process chain in order to achieve an improved production? Yes!

The four factors were (1) fountain solution pH, (2) paper types (coated vs. uncoated), (3) plate-to-blanket pressure, and (4) blanket-to-paper pressure;Overall the results suggested that the main effect of paper was the dominant variable affecting on press dot gain.

Thus, the paper factor was controlled for a second statistical analysis to study the conclusive relationships among the other variables and obtain more accurate estimations for their associated effects. The findings of the second analysis yielded the following recommendations: (1) For prints that require high fidelity and emphasize highlight areas, the process should use coated paper with a combination of lower blanket-to-paper pressures, higher plate-to-blanket pressures, and higher fountain solution pH values. (2) For prints that require high fidelity and emphasize midtones and shadows, the process should use coated paper with a combination of lower blanket-to-paper pressures, lower plate-to-blanket pressures, and lower fountain solution pH values.

40|$|The {{properties}} of the paper surface {{play a crucial role}} in ensuring suitable quality and runnability in various converting and finishing operations, such as printing. Plasma surface modification makes it possible to modify the surface chemistry of paper without altering the bulk material properties. This also makes it possible to investigate the role of the surface chemistry alone on printability without influencing the porous structure of the pigment-coated paper. Since the porous structure of a pigment coating controls both ink setting and optical properties, surface chemical changes created by a plasma modification have a potential to decouple these two effects and to permit a better optimization of them both. The aim of this work was to understand the effects of plasma surface modification on paper properties, and how it influences printability in the <b>sheet-fed</b> <b>offset</b> process. The objective was to broaden the fundamental understanding of the role of surface chemistry on offset printing. The effects of changing the hydrophilicity/ hydrophobicity and the surface chemical composition by plasma activation and plasma coatings on the {{properties of}} coated paper and on ink-paper interactions as well as on <b>sheet-fed</b> <b>offset</b> print quality were investigated. In addition, the durability of the plasma surface modification was studied. Nowadays, a typical <b>sheet-fed</b> <b>offset</b> press also contains units for surface finishing, for example UVvarnishing. The role of the surface chemistry on the UV-varnish absorption into highly permeable and porous pigment-coated paper was also investigated. With plasma activation it was possible to increase the surface energy and hydrophilicity of paper. Both polar and dispersion interactions were found to increase, although the change was greater in the polar interactions due to induced oxygen molecular groups. The results indicated that plasma activation takes place particularly in high molecular weight components such as the dispersion chemicals used to stabilize the pigment and latex particles. Surface composition, such as pigment and binder type, was found to influence the response to the plasma activation. The general trend was that pilot-scale treatment modified the surface chemistry without altering the physical coating structure, whereas excessive laboratory-scale treatment increased the surface roughness and reduced the surface strength, which led to micro-picking in printing. It was shown that pilot-scale plasma activation in combination with appropriate ink oils makes it possible to adjust the ink-setting rate. The ink-setting rate decreased with linseed-oil-based inks, probably due to increased acid-base interactions between the polar groups in the oil and the plasma-treated paper surface. With mineral-oil-based inks, the ink setting accelerated due to plasma activation. Hydrophobic plasma coatings were able to reduce or even prevent the absorption of dampening water into pigmentcoated paper, even when the dampening water was applied under the influence of nip pressure. A uniform hydrophobic plasma coating with sufficient chemical affinity with ink gave an improved print quality in terms of higher print density and lower print mottle. It was also shown that a fluorocarbon plasma coating reduced the free wetting of the UV-varnish into the highly permeable and porous pigment coating. However, when the UV-varnish was applied under the influence of nip pressure, which leads to forced wetting, the role of the surface chemical composition seems to be much less. A decay in surface energy and wettability occurred during the first weeks of storage after plasma activation, after which it leveled off. However, the oxygen/carbon elemental ratio did not decrease as a function of time, indicating that ageing could be caused by a re-orientation of polar groups or by a contamination of the surface. The plasma coatings appeared to be more stable when the hydrophobicity was higher, probably due to fewer interactions with oxygen and water vapor in the air...|$|E

40|$|Today, {{conventional}} printing {{processes such as}} offset lithography, gravure and flexography are not {{the only}} processes available to satisfy the print buyers 2 ̆ 7 needs. Digital printing is now able to rival offset quality, and has taken a substantial position in the commercial and publication printing market. 	Conventional printing technologies have been extensively studied and standardized. The principal international standards for conventional technologies, the ISO 12647 series, specify aims and tolerances that are process based. Digital printing is more difficult to standardize because its diversity of technologies and consumables make the creation of process-based aims nearly impossible. 	A new approach to standardization, conformance to dataset, is emerging and offers the opportunity to overcome the problems associated with standardizing digital printing. In this approach, the focus of conformance shifts from the process to the product, and, as a result, conformance is independent of the process used to produce the product. The recently published CGATS TR 016 provides a methodology and tolerances for assessing conformance to dataset. The tolerances in TR 016 were developed using a <b>sheet-fed</b> <b>offset</b> printing database. This research assesses the ability of digital production presses to meet TR 016 tolerances. 	In order to assess the ability of digital production presses to meet TR 016 tolerances, it was first necessary to enroll digital printers who were willing to prepare samples for assessment. A total of four printers in Europe and in the USA were enrolled and printed testforms were collected from nine electrophotographic digital presses. These testforms were send to RIT and measured on a single instrument to insure data consistency. The measurements obtained were assessed for conformance to TR 016 tolerances and, finally, passing probabilities for digital production presses were compared to the offset passing probabilities provided in TR 016. 	For the digital presses sampled, within-sheet variation passing probabilities closely matched within-sheet passing probabilities for offset. Within-run repeatability for these digital presses was excellent. The major difference between digital passing probabilities and offset passing probabilities was found to be in the area of deviation conformance. Because digital presses frequently print on heavily OBA loaded paper, conformance to TR 016 deviation tolerances is sensitive to the use of substrate corrected colorimetric aims. Not all printers sampled were familiar with this technique, and this lack of familiarity affected the deviation results obtained. In addition, digital front end (DFE) software was shown to have a significant effect...|$|E

The firststudy addresses the {{further development of}} a practical methodto acoustically monitor and analyse the film splitting ofoffset inks. This method was tested on laboratory printingequipment, specifically monitoring the continuous ink splittingin the nip of an IGT ink distribution unit and the short-timeink splitting in the inked print disc-paper nip of the printingunit of an ISIT instrument. The study verified that the inksplitting component of the acoustic signal contributes to thehigher frequency range (10 - 20 kHz) of the audible spectrum, andcan thus {{be separated from the}} lower frequency machine noise. Furthermore, the film splitting component is sensitive tochanges in the ink and printing conditions, thus enabling itsuse in probing the fundamental mechanisms occurring during inktransfer and also suggesting its applicability fornon-intrusive monitoring of industrial printing presses. Anincrease in film thickness during ink distribution correspondsto an increased acoustic power, with the exception of very lowink amounts, which give reduced acoustic emission due to alubricating effect. The effect of the presence of fountainsolution was simulated by adding emulsion-forming, butnon-evaporative, ethylene glycol. This produces an increase inacoustic power at low amounts, due to resistance to glycol dropdeformation, followed by a decrease at higher amounts owing toexcess glycol lining the rolls. During test printing on paper,increasing ink amounts also display an increased acousticresponse. The second study further developed a theoretical model toexplain and predict the evolution of ink tack in terms of inksetting directly after offset printing on coated paper. Asmeasured by the ISIT, the tack of the printed ink rises duringshorter time periods, attains a maximum, and then falls atlonger times. The proposed model described how the ink tack,characterised by the impulse during disc pull-off, dependsdynamically on the viscoelastic properties of the ink, thecontact with paper and disc, and the flow geometry. The inksetting was modelled as a diffusion-limited transport of theoil vehicle through the ink film and into the pores of thecoated paper. The coupling of the tack and setting models,compared to the ISIT experimental measurements, then provided adiffusion coeffcient for ink setting during the tack riseperiod. This coeffcient decreases with time, and increasinglyrapidly with decreasing ink amounts due to theconcentration-dependent diffusion. For an accurate descriptionthe elasticity and adhesion effects also have to be considered,at least for explaining the tack fall period...|$|E

The film splitting sound derives from the cavitation formed by the pressure drop {{in the second half of}} the print nip flow passage. As the ink film is strained, the cavities expand and eventually implode into breaking filaments at the nip exit, while emitting a partly audible, broadband, high frequency, noisy sound. A free-field microphone, A/D-converter and laptop computer were used to record pressure signals in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 50 kHz emitted by a variety of printing instruments and presses for a range of offset ink and paper types. After signal acquisition and filtering two signal averages of power and frequency were estimated. This average power increased with increasing loads of <b>sheet-fed</b> <b>offset</b> ink on an ink distributor, in accordance with a mass-conservation model developed. The behaviour of average frequency and power over different ink load ranges indicated transitions between different flow regimes. A glossy fine-coated paper gave higher average power than a corresponding matte paper during printing with such inks on a laboratory device, possibly due to an air sealing effect. The sound from tack measurements with the Deltack instrument during setting of heat-set offset inks printed on MWC papers showed a relation between the measured tack rise and average power, reflecting changes in splitting mechanism during the course of setting. With the Hydroscope instrument the interaction between these heat-set inks and fountain solution was studied, with the measured tack and sound emission displaying a clear, but non-linear, correlation. A heat-set offset pilot trial showed that the acoustic response from the printing nip sensitively and systematically detected changes in (LWC) paper type, optical density, ink-fount balance, and press stability. Pilot trials of cold-set offset inks on newsprint by sheet-fed presses indicated a strong correlation between evolution in average power, optical density and fountain solution consumption during the first thousand sheets normally needed for stabilisation. Acoustic measurements of ink film splitting have, aside from the laboratory studies performed by one Japanese group, previously received little attention, with the current study showing that a great deal of information useful to the printer can be accessed from this sound emission. Although the detailed mechanisms for ink film splitting have to be further studied and supported by mathematical simulation, the sensitivity of the acoustic method recommends its implementation for monitoring and control of offset printing.
