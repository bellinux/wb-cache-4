5|$|A {{more recent}} theory, with broad <b>support</b> <b>among</b> archaeologists, is that Celtic culture and {{language}} arrived in Ireland {{as a result}} of cultural diffusion. This theory proposes that the Celticisation of Ireland may have been the culmination of a long process of social and economic interaction between Ireland, Britain and adjacent parts of Continental Europe.|$|E

5|$|Pyrrhus {{lost much}} of his <b>support</b> <b>among</b> the Macedonians in 273BC when his unruly Gallic mercenaries plundered the royal {{cemetery}} of Aigai. Pyrrhus pursued AntigonusII in the Peloponnese, yet AntigonusII was ultimately able to recapture Macedonia. Pyrrhus was killed while besieging Argos in 272BC, allowing AntigonusII to reclaim the rest of Greece. He then restored the Argead dynastic graves at Aigai and annexed the Kingdom of Paeonia.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans chose lesser-known Congressman Rick Lazio {{to replace}} him. The {{election}} included a record $90 million in campaign expenditures between Clinton, Lazio, and Giuliani and national visibility.

5|$|According to Atlury Murali, Indian Congress in the 1920s {{appealed to}} Andhra Pradesh peasants by {{creating}} Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built <b>support</b> <b>among</b> peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Franklin Butler {{was born}} in Deerfield, New Hampshire, and later moved to Massachusetts to pursue a legal career. He built a {{successful}} practice in the 1840s and 1850s, and became involved in local politics as a Democrat. A compelling public speaker, Butler was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1853. He successfully ran for a Massachusetts Senate seat in 1859. Despite his Protestant upbringing he gained a faithful following among Massachusetts Catholics, and also built <b>support</b> <b>among</b> laborers. In the 1860 presidential campaign, Butler sought compromise with the slave power, and believed Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi {{ought to be the}} Democratic Party's nominee for president.|$|E

5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain <b>support</b> <b>among</b> legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E
5|$|Celtiberian is {{documented}} as a written language only after {{contact with the}} Romans in the 2nd century BC. Of 103 Celtiberian inscriptions, thirty in Iberian script are hospitality tokens (tesserae hospitales), twenty {{of which are in}} the shape of animals. The social custom of pledging mutual <b>support</b> <b>among</b> families or communities was compatible with hospitium in Roman culture, and the Celtiberians continued to produce the tokens, though switching to Latin, into the 2nd century of the Imperial era. Under Augustus, the territory of the Celtiberians became part of the Tarraconensis province. Written Celtiberian ceases early in the reign of Augustus, if not before.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed {{the support of a}} man who could restore his damaged reputation.

Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little <b>support</b> <b>among</b> modern historians.|$|E

5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework <b>support,</b> <b>among</b> other functions.|$|E

Savimbi paid Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly, a lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C., $5million to lobby the Federal government for aid, portray UNITA favorably in Western media, and acquire <b>support</b> <b>among</b> politicians in Washington.
