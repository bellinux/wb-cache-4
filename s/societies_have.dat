5|$|Ant <b>societies</b> <b>have</b> {{division}} of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human <b>societies</b> <b>have</b> long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Kidnapping, terrorism, {{and torture}} are forbidden, {{as well as}} sterilizations, amputations, mutilations that are not for {{therapeutic}} medical reasons. According to the Catechism, <b>societies</b> <b>have</b> {{a moral obligation to}} strive to provide healthy living conditions for all people.|$|E
5|$|Eusociality is {{the highest}} level of social organization. These <b>societies</b> <b>have</b> an overlap of adult generations, the {{division}} of reproductive labor and cooperative caring of young. Usually insects, such as bees, ants and termites, have eusocial behavior, but it is demonstrated in two rodent species: the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} groups ranging from {{government}} institutions to environmental and conservation organizations to scholarly <b>societies</b> <b>have</b> celebrated Carson's {{life and work}} since her death. Perhaps most significantly, on June 9, 1980, Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. A 17¢ Great Americans series postage stamp was issued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since issued Carson postage as well.|$|E
5|$|Frome {{town centre}} {{contains}} {{a considerable number}} of independent shops, and a few chain stores. Retail is primarily aimed at serving the local population's requirements for food (there are two large supermarkets on opposite edges of the town, and three smaller supermarkets in the town centre), basic clothing, health and beauty, DIY and some electrical goods. However studies show that only {{about a quarter of the}} town's population do their non-food shopping in the town. Banks and building <b>societies</b> <b>have</b> branches in the town centre.|$|E

Despite its relatively small size the <b>Society</b> <b>has</b> produced several nationally ranked members and has been consistently ranked nationally.|$|R
40|$|Modern <b>society</b> <b>has</b> {{traditionally}} {{been viewed as}} comprising of three sectors; government, market and civil society. The theoretical base of three pillars of government (or polity), commerce (or market) and civil <b>society</b> <b>has</b> historically been {{assumed to be a}} comprehensive structure of <b>society.</b> Many theorists <b>have</b> proposed different characteristics for the sectors but until recently none have proposed fundamental change to the structure. Debate over civil <b>society</b> <b>has</b> been a central element of political analysis for hundreds of years. Civil <b>society</b> <b>has</b> been variously theorised as subversive and detrimental to society at large, as the site of social action and as a category into which all human activity that is not market or government can be placed. In the late twentieth century civil <b>society</b> <b>has</b> been viewed as the site of social and community activity and more recently the activities of formal community organisations that have become increasingly involved in the delivery of human services...|$|R

5|$|Throughout history, <b>societies</b> <b>have</b> had numbers they {{consider}} special. For example, in ancient Rome the number 7 was auspicious, in Maya civilisation the number 13 was sacred, in modern-day Japan people give three, five, or seven gifts for luck, and in China the number 8 is considered lucky and 4 is avoided whenever possible. In Western cultures the number 13 is often considered unlucky, hence the term triskaidekaphobia, {{fear of the}} number 13.|$|E
5|$|Weber also {{proposed}} a socioevolutionary model of religious change, showing that in general, <b>societies</b> <b>have</b> moved from magic to polytheism, then to pantheism, monotheism and finally, ethical monotheism. According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed professionalisation {{and the evolution}} of ever more sophisticated priesthood. As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular and desirable.|$|E

5|$|Icelandics were {{exported}} to Great Britain before the 20th century {{to work as}} pit ponies in the coal mines, because of their strength and small size. However, those horses were never registered and little evidence of their existence remains. The first formal exports of Icelandic horses were to Germany in the 1940s. Great Britain's first official imports were in 1956, when a Scottish farmer, Stuart McKintosh, began a breeding program. Other breeders in Great Britain followed McKintosh's lead, and the Icelandic Horse Society of Great Britain was formed in 1986. The number of Icelandic horses {{exported to}} other nations has steadily increased since the first exports of the mid-19th century. Since 1969, multiple <b>societies</b> <b>have</b> worked together to preserve, improve and market these horses {{under the auspices of}} the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations. Today, the Icelandic remains a breed known for its purity of bloodline, and is the only horse breed present in Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised <b>societies</b> <b>have</b> been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E
