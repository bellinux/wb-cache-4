40|$|International audienceAbstractKey messageCoexisting <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>oaks</b> are {{differently}} {{predisposed to}} heat- and drought-induced dieback {{as a function}} of height, prior growth, wood anatomy, and growth responsiveness to temperatures. To forecast post-dieback damage, the variability of species and individual traits must be considered. ContextForests are susceptible to drought-induced dieback. However, considerable variability in how drought translates into tree damage exists in coexisting species. AimsThis study aimed to assess if tree size, radial growth, and wood anatomy predisposed trees to drought damage, measured as defoliation and changes in non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations. MethodsWe measured radial growth, wood anatomy, and post-drought NSC concentrations in highly defoliated and less defoliated holm oak (Quercus ilex) and Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea) trees co-occurring in a coppice stand. ResultsHighly defoliated trees showed a lower height than less defoliated individuals. In holm oak, a reduced previous growth and the formation of vessels with smaller lumen areas predisposed to drought damage, which suggests hydraulic deterioration. In Portuguese oak, most defoliated trees grew less in response to elevated growing season temperatures. Sapwood starch and NSC concentrations decrease in defoliated holm oaks. ConclusionA height-dependent predisposition modulates the responses to drought-induced dieback in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>oak</b> coppices. Coexisting oak species presented different predisposing factors to drought-induced dieback related to growth (holm oak) and its sensitivity to temperature (Portuguese oak).

40|$|Background and Aims: Soil water {{repellency}} (SWR, i. e. the reduced affinity for water {{due to the}} presence of hydrophobic coatings on soil particles) has relevant hydrological implications on the rate of water infiltration, surface runoff, and overland flow. Here, we test how SWR varies along a 2490 m altitudinal gradient encompassing six ecosystems including Mediterranean, Temperate, and Alpine vegetation types. Methods: Water repellency, measured by the Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet (MED) test, was quantified in 80 soil samples collected for 16 different elevations. Soil quality was assessed by measuring soil texture, pH, organic carbon, salinity, and nutrient availability. Results: SWR showed a unimodal pattern along the 2490 m transect, peaking at intermediate elevations. Unexpectedly, SWR was the highest under broad-leaf deciduous forests, and the lowest under evergreen, <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> vegetation types. The soil organic carbon content, and the pH were the main determinants of {{water repellency}}, showing respectively a positive, and a negative correlation with the SWR. In contrast, soil texture and salinity resulted unrelated to the SWR. Conclusions: With this study we demonstrated a linkage between SWR, vegetation type and soil pH and organic carbon content along the elevation gradient. Further studies are needed to explicitly evaluate the impact SRW on erosion risk at catchment scale in the context of climatic change...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{partitioning}} is {{a central}} issue in ecology because it can establish to which point similar species can coexist in the same habitat. Great tits and blue tits have been classical model species in studies of trophic competence. However, most studies on the topic have been conducted at localities where caterpillars {{are by far the}} most relevant prey brought to the nestlings. In Mediterranean mixed forests, nevertheless, the abundance of caterpillars is relatively low and it is spiders that {{play a key role in}} the diet of great tits, at least for nestlings. The aim of this paper was to study nest food provisioning to establish the degree of diet overlap of these two tit species in a Mediterranean forest. Our results showed that blue tit feeding rates were higher than those of great tits, probably to compensate for the smaller prey delivered to nestlings by blue tits. Blue tits brought more spiders than great tits, while grey tits brought larger prey and more caterpillars. This may be because larger great tits can prey upon larger prey items than blue tits. As a main result, this study supports the view of resource partitioning by great and blue tits in <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> forest ecosystem...|$|R
30|$|Quercus pubescens, Quercus cerris, Quercus suber, Quercus ilex are <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>oaks</b> {{found in}} mixed forests {{in central and}} {{southern}} Italy (Bernetti 1995).

The shrubby under-storey comprises many palatable and some unpalatable species, but not much pasture because only scattered light penetrates the tree canopy. These forests are grazed in summer, when livestock seek green leaves and shade, and in winter when the tree stands protects the animals from cold winds (Gambi 1982; Bagnaresi et al. 1984).|$|R

40|$|Grazing is a global, {{dominant}} land use affecting biodiversity and ecosystem processes. In Mediterranean ecosystems grazing {{is a major}} ecological and evolutionary driver but, surprisingly, there is little information {{on the use of}} grazing as a tool to manage biodiversity in these ecosystems. We conducted an experiment to assess if the coexistence of grazing and grazing-excluded patches would increase plant and invertebrate diversity in a <b>Mediterranean</b> evergreen <b>oak</b> woodland. Plant community traits were different between treatments. Plant and litter biomass was higher, and the proportion of bare ground was lower, in grazing-excluded plots. Grazing affected functional diversity with legumes, invertebrate detritivores and sup sucking insects being more abundant in ungrazed plots. There were no differences between treatments in the number of species but there were plant species and invertebrate taxa recorded in grazed or grazing excluded plots, only. Ant communities were functionally different between treatments. Honeydew ant eaters were associated with ungrazed and higher plant biomass plots, and seed-eater as well as aggressive predator ant species were associated with grazed, more open habitat, plots.

40|$|Lack of tree {{regeneration}} and persistency of species-poor shrublands {{represent a}} growing problem across <b>Mediterranean</b> evergreen <b>oak</b> forests. What constrains forest regeneration is poorly understood, and restoration attempts have been largely unsuccessful. We assessed the contribution of four different mechanisms of tree recruitment limitation (that is, source, dispersal, germination, and establishment) in a cork oak (Quercus suber) system in southern Portugal. Using a combination of field studies and experiments, we quantified seed production, seed removal and dispersal, seed survival and germination, seedling establishment and survival, as well as cork oak natural regeneration for the three dominant vegetation types in this system (Cistus ladanifer shrubland, oak forest, and oak savanna). We found that all four forms of cork oak recruitment limitation were significantly more severe in shrublands than in oak forests and savannas, so that oak seedling recruitment in shrubland was impeded in multiple ways. Our results explain why transitions from shrublands to oak savannas and forests are extremely difficult, and that the release from arrested succession in this system requires the simultaneous relief of multiple constraints on recruitment limitation in the early life history of oaks.

40|$|Bulk/wet and {{throughfall}} fluxes {{of major}} compounds were measured from June 2011 to June 2013 at four Mediterranean holm-oak (Quercus ilex) {{forests in the}} Iberian Peninsula. Regression analysis between net throughfall fluxes and precipitation indicated that the best defined canopy process was leaching for K⁺ and uptake for NH₄⁺ at all sites. A more variable response between sites was found for Na⁺, Ca²⁺, SO₄²⁻ and Cl⁻, {{which suggests that the}} interplay of dry deposition, leaching and uptake at the canopy was different depending on site climate and air quality characteristics. A canopy budget model (CBM) was used to try to discriminate between the canopy processes and enable to estimate dry deposition and uptake fluxes at three of the sites that complied with the model specifications. To derive N uptake, an efficiency factor of NH₄⁺ vs. NO₃⁻ uptake (xNH₄) corresponding to moles of NH₄⁺ taken up for each NO₃⁻ mol, has to be determined. Up to now, a value of 6 has been proposed for temperate forests, but we lack information for Mediterranean forests. Experimental determination of N absorption on Quercus ilex seedlings in Spain suggests efficiency factors from 1 to 6. Based on these values, a sensitivity analysis for xNH₄ was performed and the NH₄N and NO₃N modeled dry deposition was compared with dry deposition estimated with independent methods (inferential modeling and washing of branches). At two sites in NE Spain under a milder Mediterranean climate, the best match was obtained for xNH 4 = 6, corroborating results from European temperate forests. Based on this value, total DIN deposition was 12 – 13 kg N ha− 1 y− 1 at these sites. However, for a site in central Spain under drier conditions, variation of the NH 4 + efficiency factor had little effect on DD estimates (which ranged from 2 to 2. 6 kg N ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ with varying xNH₄); when added to wet deposition, this produced a total N deposition in the range 2. 6 – 3. 4 kg N ha⁻¹ y⁻¹. Dry deposition was the predominant pathway for N, accounting for 60 – 80 % of total deposition, while for base cations wet deposition dominated (55 – 65 %). Nitrogen deposition values at the northwestern sites were close to the empirical critical load proposed for evergreen <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> forests (15 – 17 kg N ha⁻¹ y⁻¹). When organic N deposition at these forests is added (3 kg N ha⁻¹ y⁻¹), the total N input to the sites in NE Spain are close to the critical loads for <b>Mediterranean</b> evergreen <b>oak</b> forests...|$|R
