40|$|For {{the first}} time in the history of {{nonvolatile}} Flash memories, the res earch challenges go beyond the scalability issue. The floating gate tech nology reaches its limits, which facilitates the emergence of various ne w memory concepts claiming to take over. Local trapping in a silicon nit ride layer, stacked between dielectrics to prevent charge loss and to en sure data retention, can solve the major issues faced by conventional Fl ash memories. In particular, the most mature solutions are the NROM cell, using hot carrier injection for programming and erasing operations, an d SANOS, based on Fowler-Nordheim injection. These concepts introduce new reliability issues mainly due to local char ge <b>storage,</b> <b>hole</b> injection, and the introduction of high-k materials. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms driving device performance and reliability by confronting simulations, models and measurements. Obtain ing a detailed description of the device behavior is required to reach t he level of confidence needed to bring a concept into production. While the intrinsic reliability of the NROM cell is excellent, the devic e performance degrades after cycling, particularly in terms of data rete ntion. The mismatch between hole and electron distributions during erasi ng and programming operations has been identified as the root cause of t he endurance and retention problems. Tuning of the operating conditions allows to significantly improve the device behavior. In SANOS, the analy sis of the device characteristics has allowed the development of retenti on and programming operation models. These models have been exploited to investigate several options for improving the device performance and re liability. Accurate characterization and modeling triggers new ideas for further improvement of both types of device, which constitutes another step toward future Silicon Nitride based Flash memories. status: publishe...|$|E

Corrective Action Unit 145 is comprised of the following corrective action sites (CASs) : (1) 03 - 20 - 01, Core Storage Holes; (2) 03 - 20 - 02, Decon Pad and Sump; (3) 03 - 20 - 04, Injection Wells; (4) 03 - 20 - 08, Injection Well; (5) 03 - 25 - 01, Oil Spills; and (6) 03 - 99 - 13, Drain and Injection Well. The purpose of this Corrective Action Decision Document is to identify and provide the rationale for the recommendation of a corrective action alternative for the six CASs within CAU 145. Corrective action investigation activities were performed from August 1, 2005, through November 8, 2005, as set forth in the CAU 145 Corrective Action Investigation Plan and Record of Technical Change No. 1. Analytes detected during the Corrective Action Investigation (CAI) were evaluated against appropriate final action levels to identify the contaminants of concern for each CAS. The results of the CAI identified contaminants of concern at one of the six CASs in CAU 145 and required the evaluation of corrective action alternatives. Assessment of the data generated from investigation activities conducted at CAU 145 revealed the following: CASs 03 - 20 - 01, 03 - 20 - 02, 03 - 20 - 04, 03 - 20 - 08, and 03 - 99 - 13 do not contain contamination; and CAS 03 - 25 - 01 has pentachlorophenol and arsenic contamination in the subsurface soils. Based on the evaluation of analytical data from the CAI, review of future and current operations at the six CASs, and the detailed and comparative analysis of the potential corrective action alternatives, the following corrective actions are recommended for CAU 145. No further action is the preferred corrective action for CASs 03 - 20 - 01, 03 - 20 - 02, 03 - 20 - 04, 03 - 20 - 08, and 03 - 99 - 13.

Most previous works have studied nanoparticles of larger than 5 nm size and exhibited bulk-like trapping characteristics. Technologically viable and competitive future devices, however, will require nanoparticles of sub 3 -nm dimensions; a zero-dimensional regime where significant changes to silicon electronic structure occur. In this thesis, the physical {{processes involved in}} charge based nonvolatile memory device operation with colloidal mono-disperse 1. 0 nm silicon nanoparticles embedded in a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) gate stack is studied for the first time. Spin-coating was used to uniformly deliver the nanoparticle colloid across 150 mm wafers with density control over a thin tunneling oxide. Material characterization via spectroscopic ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that across wafer sub-monolayer coverage with low-levels of agglomeration was achieved with nanoparticles so positioned possibly due to solvent-mediated self-assembly effects, and that the intrinsic nanoparticle crystallinity was intact after complete device processing. MOS capacitors with Si nanoparticles embedded in their dielectric exhibit strong endurance and well-behaved impedance (capacitance-voltage) characteristics with persistent hysteresis and only 53 mV standard deviation across wafer. Measurements showed that successive dilution of the nanoparticle colloid correlated directly with a decreased measured hysteresis and similarly fabricated zero-nanoparticle control devices exhibited a negligible hysteresis. Systems with 1. 0 nm nanoparticles exhibited pure <b>hole</b> <b>storage.</b> (cont.) Energy band {{analysis was used to}} understand the nature of charging, hole-type versus electron-type and pure hole-type charging was shown to occur due to the characteristics of ultra-small silicon nanoparticles: large energy gap, large charging energy, and consequently small electron affinity. The retention time behavior of the 1. 0 nm nanoparticle device was shown to be reduced due to a reduced valence band-offset with SiO 2, however the programming time is shown to be dramatically reduced over that of conventional bulk devices. Quantum mechanical tunneling calculations were used to explore and predict routes for increasing the retention behavior by modulating the tunneling distance and experimental devices based on these calculations were fabricated in the SiO 2 system to study experimentally directly these dependencies. by Osama M.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 87 - 98. With {{the ongoing}} development in portable electronic devices, low power consumption, improved data retention rate and higher operation speed are the merits demanded by modern non-volatile memory technology. Flash memory devices with discrete charge-trapping media {{are regarded as}} an alternative solution to conventional floating gate technology. Flash memories utilizing Sinitride as charge storage media dominate due to enhanced endurance, better scaling capability and simple fabrication. The use of high-k dielectrics as tunnel layer and control layer is also crucial in charge-trap flash memory devices since they allow further scaling and enhanced charge injection without data retention degradation. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a powerful technique {{for the growth of}} pinhole-free high-k dielectrics with precisely controlled thickness and high conformality. The application of graphene as charge trapping medium in flash memory devices is promising to obtain improved charge storage capability with miniaturization. Graphene acts as an effective charge storage medium due to high density of states in deep energy levels. In this thesis, we fabricate graphene flash memory devices with ALD-grown HfO 2 /AlN as tunnel layer and Al 2 O 3 as control layer. Graphene oxide nanosheets are derived from the acid exfoliation of natural graphite by Hummers Method. The graphene layer is obtained by spin-coating of water soluble graphene oxide suspension followed by a thermal annealing process. Memory performance including hysteresis window, data retention rate and program transient characteristics for both electron and <b>hole</b> <b>storage</b> mechanisms are determined by performing high frequency capacitance-voltage measurements. For comparing the memory effect of graphene on device performance, we also fabricate and characterize identical flash capacitors with Si-rich SiN layer as charge storage medium and HfO 2 as tunnel oxide layer. The Si-nitride films are deposited with high SiH 4 /NH 3 gas flow ratio by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition system. Graphene flash memory devices exhibit superior memory performance. Compared with Si-nitride based cells, hysteresis window, retention performance and programming speed are both significantly enhanced with the use of graphene. For electron storage, graphene flash memory provides a saturated flat band shift of 1. 2 V at a write-pulse duration of 100 ns with a voltage bias of 5 V. The high density of states and high work function of graphene improve the memory performance, leading to increased charge storage capability, enhanced retention rate and faster programming operation at low voltages. The use of graphene as charge storage medium and ALD-grown high-k dielectrics as tunnel and control layers improves the existing flash technology and satisfies the requirements including scalability, at least 10 -year retention, low voltage operation, faster write performance and CMOS-compatible fabrication.

40|$|Tunnel oxide {{thickness}} scaling is encountering {{problem for}} next generation flash memory device. With tunnel oxide shrinking down, the stress-induced leakage current becomes more serious leading to degraded retention. To overcome this, flash memory with discrete-traps as floating gate was proposed, including nitride charging and nanocrystal storage. The first report on nanocrystal memory is Si nanocrystal memory. After that, tremendous {{efforts have been}} put on using semiconductor or metal nanocrystals for memory application. However, for Si, although long retention time has been demonstrated, the long retention is believed to be related to charge storage on defect levels. Those levels are distributed throughout the whole band gap of Si and are not thermally stable, resulting in compromised device reliability. For metals, on the other hand, the band gap is negligible, therefore the issue of defect level charging is effectively avoided. However, the problem with metal nanocrystal memory lies in the reaction or inter-diffusion between metal and tunnel oxide underneath at high-temperature process step, such as source/drain dopant activation annealing for MOSFET. The reaction or diffusion of metal atoms generates weak points in the tunnel oxide, which degrades the device retention. To solve the dilemma between long retention and scaled tunnel oxide, in this work, engineered floating gate, such as hybrid-nanocrystal and new materials nanocrystals that are compatible with current Si technology, was proposed and good memory performance was demonstrated. Chapter 1 introduces the conventional flash memory, including the operation principle, architectures, challenge in next generation flash memory and some new technologies to address this issue in conventional flash. Chapter 2 describes the methodologies used in this thesis work, including nanocrystal growth methods, nanocrystal characterization techniques, and nanocrystal memory fabrication and device characterization. Chapter 3 discusses the flash memory with Ge/Si hetero-nanocrystals as floating gate. Type-II band alignment between Ge and Si makes Ge/Si hetero-nanocrystal good for long time <b>hole</b> <b>storage</b> than Si nanocrystal memory. In addition to p-MOS, we also developed n-MOS memory with CoSi 2 -coated Si nanocrystals as floating gate in the Chapter 4. The Fermi-level of CoSi 2 locates around the midgap of Si so that the device is good for both electrons and holes trapping. Furthermore, the quantum well formed between CoSi 2 and SiO 2 is deeper than that of Si and SiO 2, leading to an elongated retention time. The Si nanocrystal underneath the CoSi 2 effectively prevents the charges stored in CoSi 2 from leaking back to the channel. In order to lower the thermal budget to make silicide nanocrystals, vapor-solid-solid (VSS) growth mode was employed and NiSi 2 nanocrystsals were synthesized as presented in Chapter 5. The long retention of NiSi 2 nanocrystal memory is also benefited from the deep quantum well between NiSi 2 and SiO 2. For next generation flash memory, more uniform nanocrystals with higher dot density, 1012 cm- 2, is necessary to meet the requirement of 22 nm technology and beyond. In Chapter 6, we developed PtSi nanocrystals using the similar synthesis technique as NiSi 2. The nanocrystal density is enhanced from 3 × 1011 cm- 2 to 1. 5 × 1012 cm- 2. In short, engineering the nano-floating gate by replacing Si nanocrystals with hybrid nanocrystals and silicide nanocrystals benefits the device retention time. These new memories also exhibit faster programming and erasing speeds. The enhanced memory performance makes the devices fit for next generation memory with further scaled tunnel oxide...|$|R
