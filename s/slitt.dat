50|$|The <b>Slitt</b> Vein is {{predominantly}} composed of quartz, with smaller amounts of fluorite and uneconomic amounts of galena lead ore. The earliest mining {{activity at the}} site was the extraction of fluorite and galena from the <b>Slitt</b> Vein itself: the miners worked from levels driven into the vein from the west. In the late 19th century, quarrying of the ironstone began, the <b>Slitt</b> Vein being left untouched so that today it protrudes as a vertical 'rib' along {{the centre of the}} quarry.|$|E

50|$|At West Rigg, the <b>Slitt</b> Vein, a 20 km-long quartz {{intrusion}} in the Namurian Great Limestone, {{is exposed}} at the surface; the exposure {{is up to}} 5 m wide over a distance of some 200 m. During Late Permian times, extensive mineralisation occurred {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>Slitt</b> Vein: high salinity fluids, rich in iron, permeated the Great Limestone which, throughout its full thickness, was mineralised, producing siderite and ankerite minerals which were subsequently oxidised, yielding a limonitic ore with an iron content of over 40 percent. At West Rigg, the iron mineralisation extends up to 60 m on each side of the vein.|$|E
50|$|The Geological Conservation Review has {{identified}} the site as being of national importance {{because it provides}} an accessible illustration {{of the formation of}} iron ore by replacement and oxidation. The site also offers a rare surface view of the <b>Slitt</b> Vein.|$|E
50|$|Westgate is {{a village}} in County Durham, in North East England. It is {{situated}} in Weardale between St John's Chapel and Eastgate-In-Weardale.In the 2001 census Westgate had a population of 298.Westgate is also the entrance to <b>Slitt</b> wood and an old abandoned lead mine. Other features of the village include a caravan site and a football and basketball court.|$|E
40|$|Extremely high {{permeability}} {{has been}} found at 410 m depth in the Weardale Granite, UK, during exploratory drilling for low-enthalpy geothermal resources. The Eastgate Borehole was sunk down the axis of an ancient, sub-vertical hydrothermal vein structure (the <b>Slitt</b> Vein), proving a transmissivity in excess of 4000 darcy m (= 3 × 10 - 9 m 2 m), {{which is one of}} the highest values ever measured deep within a granite intrusion. Sustained hydraulic testing over 24 h showed that this transmissivity was not local to the borehole: sustained flows and steadying of drawdown suggest that this transmissivity persists along the strike of the <b>Slitt</b> Vein structure. Although this finding is encouraging in relation to the prospects for geothermal energy development in this and similar granites, it raises disquieting issues in relation to assumptions commonly made during planning for radioactive waste isolation concerning the feasible maximum permeability likely to be encountered in granite...|$|E

Subjects include the fables on the Bayeux Tapestry, the piety of Earl Godwine, the feudal quota of the pre- 1066 Archbishops of Canterbury, Geoffrey Malaterra's treatment of Roger the Great Count, mints and money in Anglo-Norman England, the church of Lastingham, and a reappraisal of Lanfranc as theologian.
