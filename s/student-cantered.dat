40|$|Advanced Mathematics {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and fundamental courses for students of engineering and science. In this paper, we consider how to enhance advanced mathematics teaching. Group cooperative learning is applied to the advanced mathematics classroom; the traditional teaching mode can be transformed in <b>student-cantered</b> environment so that students can study with each other under relaxing circumstances. It can enhance learners study motivation, foster their self-esteem and develop their interpersonal skills. Keywords: Advanced Mathematics research; Group cooperative learning; Assessment </div...|$|E
40|$|After the education’s {{shift from}} teacher–cantered to <b>student-cantered</b> {{training}} process in Europe {{the concept of}} learning outcomes gained a huge importance in all educational settings. Learning outcomes are written statements of what a learner is expected to know, understand and/or {{be able to do}} {{at the end of a}} period of learning. They can be described for one subject, module, period, first or second cycle study programme. Therefore, the need to look for more effective self-assessment and competence substantiation methods has occurred. The article analyses the role of one of possible methods – integrated self-study project. The research carried out during the implementation of the project has proved it to be a successful and useful tool for student competence self-assessment as well as a possible evidence substantiating students’ achievements and can be used in student portfolio or employment process...|$|E
40|$|Building on Moje et al and Dyson’s {{work within}} a Bakhtinian {{framework}} of dialogism and ethics of answerability, the paper argues {{the need for}} a critical humanities educator to create dialogic learning spaces within classrooms that would be engaging for students and where students would be encouraged to draw from their various ‘funds of knowledge’ in order to connect their ‘school-world’ with their other social worlds. The paper points out the interconnected nature of our knowing-in-the-world and suggests that all teachers, but especially teachers of critical humanities or social sciences adopt an adda-based pedagogy through a permeable curriculum for promoting wholesome, <b>student-cantered</b> learning in colleges and universities that would harness students’ various ‘funds of knowledge’ both in and outside classrooms. The paper argues that even though the use of adda in the classroom, like other similarly negotiated curricula, does generate some challenges for educators, yet the benefits of using an adda-based pedagogy in the classroom far out-weigh its disadvantages {{in the creation of a}} democratic, equitable and engaging learning environment in classrooms. 135593 Kultura-Społeczeństwo-Edukacj...|$|E
40|$|Practical {{skills are}} {{important}} attributes of every engineering graduate. The Internet has provided tertiary education {{with the opportunity}} to develop innovative learning environments. The teaching and learning of practical skills has gained a new dimension with the emergence of remote laboratories. The rapidly growing number of remote laboratories (RL) worldwide is the evidence that the educational community has recognized their potential to develop into a creative, flexible, engaging, and <b>student-cantered</b> learning environment. Even a brief review of the existing RLs shows a large diversity in their structure, design and implementation. However, not many researchers disclose how their RLs are integrated within their curricula. Therefore, an important question still remains to be answered: how to optimize the design of RLs and their integration in a course curriculum for the best learning outcomes? This problem is particularly important when RLs are used in teaching 1 st year students who have limited technical knowledge and practical experience in using real equipment. In this paper we would like to share our experiences with NetLab, an RL developed at the University of South Australia (UniSA) for teaching 1 st year engineering students and make recommendations for improvements in teaching practices based on it...|$|E
