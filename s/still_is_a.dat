5|$|The Poles {{had little}} {{interest}} or desire {{to support the}} French cause in the distant colonies, once again fighting against people who only desired their own independence. In Haiti there <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> popular myth that many Polish soldiers became sympathetic to the former slaves' cause and deserted the French, supporting Jean-Jacques Dessalines in significant numbers, with entire units changing sides. In fact, the actual desertion rate was much lower; nonetheless about 150 Polish soldiers joined the Haitian rebels. The loss of that many patriotic military personnel in the Caribbean was a serious blow to the Polish aspirations for regaining independence. The Haitian experience cast further doubts among Poles about France's and Napoleon's good intentions toward Poland.|$|E

The Broken Hill Proprietary Company became Australia's largest mining company, and later {{became part of the}} world's largest mining company, BHP.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{the city}} on the big bend of the Volga, {{currently}} known as Volgograd, witnessed the Battle of Stalingrad, possibly the bloodiest battle in human history, in which the Soviet Union and the German forces were deadlocked in a stalemate battle for access to the river. The Volga was (and <b>still</b> <b>is)</b> <b>a</b> vital transport route between central Russia and the Caspian Sea, which provides access to the oil fields of the Apsheron Peninsula.|$|E

25|$|While never a noted {{industrial}} suburb, Ashfield has had {{a couple}} of significant industries. On Parramatta Rd near Frederick St was the Australian Six motor car factory which opened in 1920. The site later became an AWA factory producing radio valves and other components. The site has since been turned into a commercial and residential development. On the other side of Frederick St was the Peek Freans biscuit factory, the tower of which was (and <b>still</b> <b>is)</b> <b>a</b> familiar site to passing motorists on Parramatta Rd. However, this factory is also no longer industrial, serving today as a large hardware store.|$|E
25|$|Access to oil was and <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{major factor}} in several {{military}} conflicts of the twentieth century, including World War II, during which oil facilities were a major strategic asset and were extensively bombed. The German invasion of the Soviet Union included the goal to capture the Baku oilfields, as it would provide much needed oil-supplies for the German military which was suffering from blockades. Oil exploration in North America during the early 20th century later led to the US becoming the leading producer by mid-century. As petroleum production in the US peaked during the 1960s, however, the United States was surpassed by Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|The {{power sector}} in the Dominican Republic has {{traditionally}} been, and <b>still</b> <b>is,</b> <b>a</b> bottleneck to the country's economic growth. A prolonged electricity crisis and ineffective remedial measures {{have led to a}} vicious cycle of regular blackouts, high operating costs of the distribution companies, large losses including electricity theft through illegal connections, high retail tariffs to cover these inefficiencies, low bill collection rates, a significant fiscal burden for the government through direct and indirect subsidies, and very high costs for consumers as many of them have to rely on expensive alternative self-generated electricity. According to the World Bank, the revitalization of the Dominican economy depends greatly on a sound reform of the sector.|$|E
25|$|John Parkyn was Trinity's organist {{when the}} Aeolian-Skinner organ was installed. Before 1996, he advised the vestry that the organ {{required}} considerable work. He created a renovation plan {{which included a}} thorough cleaning, console restoration and replacement or repair of a few groups of pipes. The process was executed over three years and rededicated in January 1999. The newest technology was incorporated which allows a computer to control the organ and digitally reproduce sounds from other notable organs. The Aeolian-Skinner organ <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 3-manual, but it has 91-ranks instead of 41, making it an Opus 1482 hybrid pipe and digital organ. Instrumental sounds can be created that mimic flutes, oboes, trumpets, harps and chimes.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of Country Park halt, Kidderminster is, by far, {{the youngest of the}} SVR stations. Bridgnorth to Bewdley passenger services started in 1974, and it was decided to extend the line to Kidderminster to attract more custom from what was (and <b>still</b> <b>is)</b> <b>a</b> bustling town close to the West Midlands conurbation. After Kidderminster goods yard became disused in 1982, the SVR purchased the line to the east of Foley Park. Sharing the British Rail station of Kidderminster was impractical, so SVR claimed a site {{to the west of the}} BR station. Initially, the site was leased from BR until privatisation when BR looked to sell off the site, leading to the 1994 SVR share issue to raise capital to buy it outright.|$|E

Similarly, the well known hospital, Loma Linda Hospital, also had its beginnings as a tubercular clinic. Sadly, most patients admitted for tuberculosis, succumbed to the illness because of the ineffectiveness of pre-antibotic treatments.|$|E
