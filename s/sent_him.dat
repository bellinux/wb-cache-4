5|$|In Neuer's debut for Newark, {{he allowed}} nine walks, eight runs, and made two errors; his {{pitching}} was noted as the direct {{cause of the}} 8–5 loss. By the beginning of June, Newark returned him to New York; in his short time in the Eastern League, Neuer set the record for most strikeouts in a game and most walks in a game, with 13 each. Griffith <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> back to Newark almost immediately, and they in turn <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to the Toronto Maple Leafs, who in turn released him. He then signed with the Little Rock Travelers of the Southern Association, and pitched for them before being released on August 1.|$|E
5|$|The Marine Corps <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to Manila, Philippines. On {{garrison}} duty {{with little}} to do, Butler turned to alcohol to relieve the boredom. He once became drunk and was temporarily relieved of command after an unspecified incident in his room.|$|E
5|$|As Allied forces {{descended on}} Zagreb, Blažeković {{left the city}} on 6 May 1945 and fled from Slovenia into Austria. He was {{subsequently}} placed in a refugee camp in Salzburg. On 28 August, American forces arrested him and <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to a detainment camp before having him extradited to Yugoslavia on 12 February 1946. Blažeković was tried in Zagreb on 12 January 1947, sentenced to death, and executed the same day.|$|E

5|$|Biographer Weissweiler {{does not}} dismiss the {{possibility}} that Busch's increasing alcohol dependence hindered self-criticism. He refused invitations to parties, and publisher Otto Basserman <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to Wiedensahl to keep his alcohol problem undetected from those around him. Busch was also a heavy smoker, resulting in symptoms of severe nicotine poisoning in 1874. He began to illustrate drunkards more often.|$|E
5|$|Bok was {{captured}} after his mother, Adut Al Akok, had <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> {{to the village}} of Nyamlell to sell eggs and peanuts in the village market with some older siblings and neighbors. This was Bok's first trip to the village without his mother, {{and it was the first}} time he was allowed to sell some of the family's goods at the market.|$|E
5|$|Despite his rebellion, Salih paid formal {{allegiance}} to the Fatimid Caliphate after conquering Aleppo, and dispatched Ibn Tawq to meet az-Zahir in Cairo; in turn, az-Zahir officially recognized Salih's Mirdasid emirate and <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> numerous honorary robes and presents. There is no information about the Byzantines' relationship with Salih following the conquest of Aleppo, though Emperor Basil II refused to back Salih's rebellion when he appealed for Byzantine support.|$|E

5|$|During Queen Victoria's widowhood, Edward {{pioneered the}} idea of royal public {{appearances}} as we understand them today—for example, opening the Thames Embankment in 1871, the Mersey Tunnel in 1886, and Tower Bridge in 1894—but his mother did not allow Edward {{an active role in}} the running of the country until 1898. He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals. He annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the Schleswig-Holstein Question in 1864 (she was pro-German) and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet Giuseppe Garibaldi. Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> papers secretly. From 1886, Foreign Secretary Lord Rosebery <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some Cabinet papers were opened to him.|$|E
5|$|During the season, the Rangers were {{interested}} in acquiring Vancouver Canucks forward Pavel Bure. It was reported that Canucks general manager Brian Burke had requested Malhotra {{to be involved in}} a trade that would have <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> along with Niklas Sundstrom, Dan Cloutier and the Rangers' first-round pick in the 1999 draft in exchange for Bure. However, Rangers general manager Neil Smith refused to include Malhotra and the deal never materialized.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{made one}} final {{first-class}} appearance upon returning to Australia, in a testimonial match against Morris's XI. He made 126 {{in the first}} innings, his final century, but could manage only three in the second as his team went down by 121 runs. Nevertheless, the match <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> into retirement ₤5,503 wealthier, and with more first-class centuries than any Australian except Bradman.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, Wilder's agent <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> {{a script}} {{for a film}} called Super Chief. Wilder accepted, but told the film's {{producers}} that he thought {{the only person who}} could keep the film from being offensive was Richard Pryor. Pryor accepted the role in the film, which had been renamed Silver Streak, the first film to team Wilder and Pryor. They became Hollywood's first successful interracial movie comedy duo.|$|E
5|$|In Gonzales, Martin {{turned the}} letter over to Launcelot Smithers. When the Mexican army arrived in Béxar, Smithers had {{immediately}} {{set out for}} Gonzales. Travis may have <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> as an official courier, or he may have journeyed there on his own to warn the townspeople. Smithers added his own message under Martin's, encouraging men to gather in Gonzales {{to go to the}} relief of the Texians at the Alamo.|$|E
5|$|In southeastern Asia, the durian {{has been}} {{cultivated}} for centuries {{at the village}} level, probably since the late 18th century, and commercially since the mid-20th century. In My Tropic Isle, Australian author and naturalist Edmund James Banfield tells how, in the early 20th century, a friend in Singapore <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> a durian seed, which he planted and cared for on his tropical island off the north coast of Queensland.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, Hańska began reading Balzac's novels, and in 1832, she <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> an {{anonymous}} letter. This began a decades-long correspondence in which Hańska and Balzac expressed a deep mutual affection. In 1832, they {{met for the}} first time, in Switzerland. Soon afterward he began writing the novel Séraphîta, which includes a character based on Hańska.|$|E
5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I <b>sent</b> <b>him,</b> which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E
5|$|Julius Delius {{assumed that}} his son would {{play a part in}} the family wool business, and {{for the next three years}} he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's {{representative}} in Stroud in Gloucestershire, where he did moderately well. After being sent in a similar capacity to Chemnitz, he neglected his duties in favour of trips to the major musical centres of Germany, and musical studies with Hans Sitt. His father <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to Sweden, where he again put his artistic interests ahead of commerce, coming under the influence of the Norwegian dramatists Henrik Ibsen and Gunnar Heiberg. Ibsen's denunciations of social conventions further alienated Delius from his commercial background. Delius was then sent to represent the firm in France, but he frequently absented himself from business for excursions to the French Riviera. After this, Julius Delius recognised that there was no prospect {{that his son}} would succeed in the family business, but he remained opposed to music as a profession, and instead <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to America to manage an orange plantation.|$|E

5|$|She {{had enjoyed}} {{developing}} {{the book with}} Warne, and, on July 2, <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> {{the remainder of the}} book, expressing her regret that its production was over. On July 25, proofs sent to her from the publisher showed spottiness that may have been caused by the summer heat affecting the chemicals used in the engraving process; the plates were re-engraved in September.|$|E
5|$|Styer was not {{confined}} to his office. In 1943, Somervell <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to the China Burma India Theater {{to report on the}} Ledo Road. Styer's report persuaded the Combined Chiefs of Staff to allocate the required personnel, equipment and supplies to develop the road. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 7 November 1944.|$|E
