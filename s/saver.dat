5|$|As players hit various objects {{around the}} field, their score goes up. At certain scores, players gain a new ball. If the ball {{falls to the}} bottom, that round is over, and the players' scores are tallied, given bonuses for their achievements. In order to prevent players from losing a ball, the game {{features}} a Ball <b>Saver,</b> which allows the ball to fall without being lost. This eventually goes away, however. The game has a shop system that can provide boosts for players, such one that adds a Ball <b>Saver.</b> Coins are collected through various means, and are used to purchase items from this shop. If all balls are lost, the game is over. The other objective {{of the game is}} to complete the Pokédex, similar to other Pokémon titles. Occasionally, a hole will open in the field, where players can either gain bonuses, such as an added Ball <b>Saver</b> or a score increase, or allow them to go to a special mode. There are four primary modes - Catch 'Em Mode, Egg Mode, Evolution Mode, and Travel Mode. These modes are typically activated by going through a certain path on the board three times, and then entering an area on the board, such as the Sharpedo, which will activate Catch 'Em Mode.|$|E

To become more attractive, the company changed its fares to two classes: Business Full Flex and <b>Saver</b> No Flex. The company also stated that to attract more business travelers, it was looking for an international partner to conduct codesharing on international routes, and perhaps also introduce a frequent flyer program alone or in cooperation with the partner.|$|E

40|$|<b>Savers,</b> {{including}} pension <b>savers,</b> convert savings into assets: homes,government {{bonds and}} shares. The conversion of savings {{is for the}} very long term. Once monies are turned into assets, the reverse process of turning assets into cash cannot be achieved by all <b>savers</b> together. Unavoidably some must stay with the cash flow and value risks of these assets. <b>Savers</b> can swap with other <b>savers,</b> but collectively cannot {{get out of the}} risks. The short term attempts to do so lead to financial,economic and fiscal crises. Governments need to take measures to mitigate these risks. The pricing of risks is based on cash flows and future values. The latter is based on "perceived risks". It is always imprecise as it cannot predict what will happen, but it is based on what might happen. This leads to problems trying to asses the values of pension funds in meeting future commitments. To bridge the gap between short term <b>savers</b> preferences for cash and long term commitments to asset classes a number of possible solutions are provided, like pension dividend, economic easing,foreign home buying scheme, and Eurozone government bond yield management scheme. ...|$|R
