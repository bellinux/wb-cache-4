5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (<b>ssDNA)</b> molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{cellular}} signals activating the SOS response are regions of <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (<b>ssDNA),</b> arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase {{to separate the}} two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division {{and an increase in}} levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, linear chromosomes face {{another issue}} that is not seen in circular DNA replication. Due {{to the fact that}} an RNA primer is required for initiation of DNA synthesis, the lagging strand is at a disadvantage in replicating the entire chromosome. While the leading strand can use a single RNA primer to extend the 5' terminus of the replicating DNA strand, multiple RNA primers are responsible for lagging strand synthesis, creating Okazaki fragments. This leads to an issue {{due to the fact that}} DNA polymerase is only able to add to the 3' end of the DNA strand. The 3'-5' action of DNA polymerase along the parent strand leaves a short <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (<b>ssDNA)</b> region at the 3' end of the parent strand when the Okazaki fragments have been repaired. Since replication occurs in opposite directions at opposite ends of parent chromosomes, each strand is a lagging strand at one end. Over time this would result in progressive shortening of both daughter chromosomes. This is known as the end replication problem.|$|E

50|$|Like AAV, scAAV is {{a member}} of the family Parvoviridae, {{commonly}} known as parvoviruses. These viruses are nonenveloped, <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> (<b>ssDNA)</b> viruses. Within Parvoviridae, scAAV further belongs to the Dependovirus genus, characteristically defined by an inability to replicate on their own. In nature, these viruses depend on another virus to provide replication machinery; adeno-associated virus can only replicate during an active infection of adenovirus or some types of herpesvirus. In lab use, this obstacle is overcome by addition of the helper plasmids, which exogenously expresses replication genes which AAV itself lacks.|$|R
500|$|As {{part of the}} {{transformation}} process, the RecA protein interacts with entering <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (<b>ssDNA)</b> to form RecA/ssDNA nucleofilaments that scan the resident chromosome for regions of homology and bring the entering ssDNA to the corresponding region, where strand exchange and homologous recombination occur. [...] Thus the process of homologous recombination during bacterial transformation has fundamental similarities to homologous recombination during meiosis.|$|E
500|$|DMC1 (DNA meiotic {{recombinase}} 1) is a meiosis specific homolog of RAD51 that mediates strand exchange during homologous recombinational repair. [...] DMC1 {{promotes the}} formation of DNA strand invasion products (joint molecules) between homologous DNA molecules. [...] Human DMC1 interacts directly with each {{of a series of}} repeat sequences in the BRCA2 protein (called BRC repeats) that stimulate joint molecule formation by DMC1. [...] BRC repeats conform to a motif consisting of a sequence of about 35 highly conserved amino acids that are present at least once in all BRCA2-like proteins. [...] The BRCA2 BRC repeats stimulate joint molecule formation by promoting the interaction of <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (<b>ssDNA)</b> with DMC1. [...] The ssDNA complexed with DMC1 can pair with homologous ssDNA from another chromosome during the synapsis stage of meiosis to form a joint molecule, a central step in homologous recombination. Thus the BRC repeat sequences of BRCA2 appear to {{play a key role in}} recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiotic recombination.|$|E

Nevertheless, bundling of CNTs, due to their strong hydrophobicity, is an obstacle for many applications. For biological applications of CNTs, making stable aqueous suspension of individual CNTs by functionalizing their surface with appropriate biomolecules is essential [3, 4]. <b>Single-stranded</b> <b>DNAs</b> (<b>ssDNAs)</b> or double-stranded <b>DNAs</b> (dsDNAs) have been most commonly used for such functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and optical properties of DNA-functionalized SWCNTs have been intensively studied [5 – 7].|$|R

In contrast to the RecA-type recombinases that catalyze strand invasion via an active search for homology, ICP 8 acts by a salt-dependent strand annealing mechanism. The active species in this reaction is a ssDNA:ICP 8 nucleoprotein filament. There appears to be no requirement for ICP 8 to interact with the acceptor DNA. At higher concentrations, ICP 8 promotes the reverse reaction, presumably owing to its helix destabilizing activity. ICP 8 -mediated strand assimilation imparts single-stranded character onto the acceptor DNA, consistent with the formation of a displacement loop. These data suggest that the recombination activity of ICP 8 is similar to the mechanism of eukaryotic Rad 52...|$|R

This dismantling activity is specific for Rad51 since Srs2 does not dismantle DMC1 (a meiosis-specific Rad51 homolog), Rad52 (a Rad 51 mediator) or replication protein A (RPA, a single-stranded DNA binding protein). Srs2 promotes the non-crossover SDSA pathway, apparently by regulating RAD51 binding during strand exchange.|$|E
50|$|Adjuvants in {{immunology}} {{are often}} used to modify or augment {{the effects of a}} vaccine by stimulating the immune system to respond to the vaccine more vigorously, and thus providing increased immunity to a particular disease. Adjuvants accomplish this task by mimicking specific sets of evolutionarily conserved molecules, so called PAMPs, which include liposomes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), molecular cages for antigen, components of bacterial cell walls, and endocytosed nucleic acids such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (<b>ssDNA),</b> and unmethylated CpG dinucleotide-containing DNA. Because immune systems have evolved to recognize these specific antigenic moieties, the presence of an adjuvant in conjunction with the vaccine can greatly increase the innate immune response to the antigen by augmenting the activities of dendritic cells (DCs), lymphocytes, and macrophages by mimicking a natural infection.|$|E
50|$|PARP1 {{has a role}} in {{repair of}} <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (<b>ssDNA)</b> breaks. Knocking down {{intracellular}} PARP1 levels with siRNA or inhibiting PARP1 activity with small molecules reduces repair of ssDNA breaks. In the absence of PARP1, when these breaks are encountered during DNA replication, the replication fork stalls, and double-strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks accumulate. These dsDNA breaks are repaired via homologous recombination (HR) repair, a potentially error-free repair mechanism. For this reason, cells lacking PARP1 show a hyper-recombinagenic phenotype (e.g., an increased frequency of HR), which has also been observed in vivo in mice using the pun assay. Thus, if the HR pathway is functioning, PARP1 null mutants (cells without functioning PARP1) do not show an unhealthy phenotype, and in fact, PARP1 knockout mice show no negative phenotype and no increased incidence of tumor formation.|$|E

A functional replisome is restored by the reloading of GINS and Pol epsilon onto DNA in a RAD 51 - and MRE 11 - dependent manner, but independently of replication origin assembly and firing.

Here, we identify the small molecule 6 -hydroxy-DL-dopa (6 -OH-dopa) as a major allosteric inhibitor of the RAD 52 ssDNA binding domain. For example, we find that multiple small molecules bind to and completely transform RAD 52 undecamer rings into dimers, which abolishes the ssDNA binding channel observed in crystal structures. 6 -OH-Dopa also disrupts RAD 52 heptamer and undecamer ring superstructures, and suppresses RAD 52 recruitment and recombination activity in cells with negligible effects on other double-strand break repair pathways. Importantly, we show that 6 -OH-dopa selectively inhibits the proliferation of BRCA-deficient cancer cells, including those obtained from leukemia patients. Taken together, these data demonstrate small-molecule disruption of RAD 52 rings as a promising mechanism for precision medicine in BRCA-deficient cancers...|$|R
