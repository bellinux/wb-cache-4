25|$|On the radio, Farber became easily {{identifiable}} by his unique combination of drawn-out Southern drawl, intense delivery, verbose prose, and quick wit. Sponsors loved {{his ability to}} deliver a live commercial spot, often ad-libbed, and make whatever the particular product was sound tantalizing; he always <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> truly believed in the product.|$|E
25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> did. You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E
500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} began recording the final 30 minutes of Flight93 at 09:31:57. At this moment, it recorded Jarrah announcing, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen: here the captain. Please sit down, keep remaining seating. We have a bomb on board. So sit." [...] The controller understood the transmission, but chose to respond, [...] "Calling Cleveland center, you're unreadable. Say again, slowly." [...] The cockpit recording captured Dahl moaning and Jarrah telling him in English {{to sit down and}} to stop touching something (presumably the controls); Jason Dahl's wife, Sandy Dahl, listening to the cockpit {{voice recorder}}, determined that Jarrah [...] "was fussing at my husband...he was speaking in English, and he spoke Arabic anytime he was talking with the other hijackers. Jason made moaning sounds after that. It <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was trying to mess with stuff or get up, because the hijacker pilot kept telling him to stop and to sit down." ...|$|E

5000|$|She added about casting:It {{was really}} hard to find that vampire. In fact, Cyril came in so late I thought he was {{delivering}} a pizza to my house. It was really {{late at night and}} I thought ‘God, we’re never going to find a vampire’ and he walked in. He was the first one auditioned who didn’t <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was doing a stage play; and <b>he</b> didn’t <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was doing a period piece or something either. <b>He</b> just talked <b>like</b> a real person and I said [...] "Okay this is the guy!" ...|$|R
500|$|In August 1953, Presley {{walked into}} the offices of Sun Records. He aimed {{to pay for a}} few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: [...] "My Happiness" [...] and [...] "That's When Your Heartaches Begin". He would later claim that he {{intended}} the record as a gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he [...] "sounded like", although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer Peter Guralnick argues that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, [...] "I sing all kinds." [...] When she pressed him on who he <b>sounded</b> <b>like,</b> <b>he</b> repeatedly answered, [...] "I don't sound like nobody." [...] After he recorded, Sun boss Sam Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: [...] "Good ballad singer. Hold." ...|$|E
500|$|Musical {{performances}} in [...] "Mash-Up" [...] received mixed reviews. Joal Ryan for E! Online criticized the show's [...] "overproduced soundtrack", writing that Monteith was being edited {{to sound like}} Cher, and that when Morrison sang [...] "The Thong Song" [...] and [...] "Bust a Move", [...] "he <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was in a music video, not a suburban high school." [...] He enjoyed Michele's [...] "What a Girl Wants", calling her singing [...] "raw and lovely". Entertainment Weekly Michael Slezak criticized the [...] "Bust A Move" [...] performance, writing that Morrison gave a [...] "pale imitation" [...] of the Young M.C. original. He was slightly more positive regarding the [...] "Thong Song" [...] performance, feeling that Morrison had [...] "a slightly less overwrought vocal than Sisqó", and observed that Salling did [...] "more than a serviceable job" [...] on [...] "Sweet Caroline". Fellow Entertainment Weekly writer Dan Snierson called Morrison's performances [...] "pretty impressive", and MTV's Aly Semigran also enjoyed them, writing: [...] "We want more!". Goldman too was positive regarding Morrison's performances, noting: [...] "There is of course something completely dorky about seeing this guy perform these songs, but Morrison infuses Will with such enjoyment in what he's doing, he completely sells it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Fast Lane" [...] was {{received}} favorably by critics. Upon the release on the EP, , Billboard editor Jason Lipshutz published a track-by-track review. According to Lipshutz, [...] "Fast Lane" [...] is [...] "G-funk on steroids, with sing-song refrain breaking up crushing mic-trading bout between Royce da 5'9" [...] and Eminem." [...] He {{also referred to}} [...] "Fast Lane" [...] {{as one of the}} highlight songs of the album. Rolling Stone gave a positive review. According to Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone, [...] "Eminem kicks 'Fast Lane' 1999-style, reconnecting with the hungry young lunatic who <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> only had a stanza to blow us away or it was back to the auto plant." [...] Dolan also commented on the infamous lyric [...] "I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this, Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus," [...] saying that Eminem has been much more heinous before. According to Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly, Royce da 5'9" [...] performs extremely well on the [...] "hard-hitting" [...] song, even calling him a [...] "lyrical beast". Although music website Consequence of Sound gave a rather mixed review on the EP as a whole, editor Winston Robbins favored [...] "Fast Lane" [...] and said that it is [...] "hands down one of the best hip-hop tracks of 2011" [...] and that the rapping is [...] "second to none".|$|E
50|$|Stan Boardman {{talked about}} Focke-Wulf but made it <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> {{was using the}} swear word: it {{resulted}} {{in the end of}} live broadcasts of the show, until the 1990s.|$|R

5000|$|In Norway, {{there was}} much {{discussion}} about Solli-Tangen's English pronunciation of the word [...] "heart", as it could <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> sang hard, resulting in the line [...] "my hard is yours".|$|R
500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{standoff}} with police lasted for approximately four hours. Poplawski's friend Edward Perkovic {{said he got}} a call at work from Poplawski during which he said, [...] "Eddie, I am going to die today. ... Tell your family I love them and I love you." [...] Perkovic said [...] "I heard gunshots and he hung up. ... He <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was in pain, like he got shot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other players gained loyal fans. Called [...] "The Voice" [...] by Tony Glover, Doug Maynard and {{his band}} backed Bonnie Raitt in 1982. Until he died at age 40, Maynard could [...] "break a note into two and three parts {{simultaneously}} so that it <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was harmonizing with himself". Larry Hayes, formerly of the Lamont Cranston Band, wrote [...] "Excusez Moi Mon Cheri" [...] which The Blues Brothers recorded. James Samuel [...] "Cornbread" [...] Harris, who collaborated with Augie Garcia and {{is the father of}} Jimmy Jam, is one of the area's senior players.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{contemporary}} negative for The Division Bell, Tom Graves of Rolling Stone described [...] "What Do You Want from Me" [...] {{as the only}} track that [...] "Gilmour <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> cares".|$|R

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1977, his parents {{sent him to the}} University of Oklahoma for a seven-week {{computer}} camp. Shortly after he arrived, some of the other boys attending the camp introduced themselves. When Garriott replied to their greeting of [...] "Hi" [...] with [...] "Hello" [...] they decided he <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was from Britain, and gave him the nickname [...] "British". Garriott uses the name to this day for his various gaming characters, including Ultima character Lord British and Tabula Rasa character General British; however, despite his nickname and birthplace, his parents moved to Texas when he was a baby and his accent is American rather than British.|$|E
2500|$|Regardless of the music, Rachmaninoff always planned his {{performances}} carefully. He {{based his}} interpretations {{on the theory}} that each piece of music has a [...] "culminating point." [...] Regardless of where that point was or at which dynamic within that piece, the performer had to know how to approach it with absolute calculation and precision; otherwise, the whole construction of the piece could crumble and the piece could become disjointed. This was a practice he learned from Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin, a staunch friend. Paradoxically, Rachmaninoff often <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was improvising, though he actually was not. While his interpretations were mosaics of tiny details, when those mosaics came together in performance, they might, according to the tempo of the piece being played, fly past at great speed, giving the impression of instant thought.|$|E
2500|$|In 621, Wang Shichong's Zheng {{state was}} {{destroyed}} by forces from the faction that would later become the Tang dynasty. As Zhang had been a Sui official before, he was made the sheriff of Gushou County (穀熟, in modern Shangqiu, Henan). Later, after he passed an imperial examination, he was made {{the secretary general of}} Fuping County (富平, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), and was considered capable in his position. After his term of office was over, he was made an assistant imperial censor, and was known for willing to submit accusations against other officials for misbehavior notwithstanding their honorable positions. The second Tang emperor, Emperor Taizong, the reigning emperor at the time, was impressed by him, and stated to his chancellor Fang Xuanling, [...] "In both history and current times, officials often came into their offices due to recommendations by others. But I selected Zhang Xincheng myself, without anyone else's recommendations." [...] On one occasion, possibly in 627, when Emperor Taizong, at an imperial feast, began to talk about differences between people from the Guanzhong region and those from the Shandong region (i.e., those from east of modern Sanmenxia, Henan, not those from modern Shandong), Zhang found the talk to be inappropriate, and stated, [...] "Your subject has heard that the Son of Heaven should view the entire empire as his home, and should not divide it through geographical limitations; if you do so, you will show prejudice." [...] Emperor Taizong was impressed, and awarded Zhang a horse, a set of clothing, and money. He also began to consult Zhang on important matters and promoted Zhang to the post of imperial attendant. In 641, Emperor Taizong, at an imperial gathering, made the comment, [...] "Although I am the lord of the empire, but I also often have to serve as general and chancellor." [...] After Zhang withdrew from Emperor Taizong's presence, he submitted a note indicating his belief that the comment was inappropriate—noting that it <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was arguing over achievements with his subjects. Emperor Taizong approved of his comment.|$|E

5000|$|Chris Evans stated at the 2006 Brit Awards {{that the}} song was {{originally}} to have been called [...] "It's There", but was changed due to Shaun Ryder's strong Mancunian accent making it <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was saying 'It's dare.' ...|$|R

50|$|Wrote Daily Telegraph critic Neil McCormick:DeVille and {{his band}} reached deep into blues and soul, the classic romantic pop of Ben E. King and The Drifters, with a side order of Spanish spices and New Orleans Zydeco swing. They favoured {{castanets}} over tom-toms, and accordion over distorted guitars, and Willy delivered his vocals with a sweet, tuneful flexibility that brought out the emotional resonance beneath his nasal sneer. What the wiry, dapper DeVille had that tied him to fellow CBGB resident bands like The Ramones, Television, Blondie and Talking Heads was an edge. He was drawing {{on some of the}} same musical areas that Bruce Springsteen’s epic rock dipped into, but Willy was an entirely different creature, a macho dandy in a pompadour and pencil mustache, with the dangerous air of a New York gangfighter and an underbelly vulnerability that came out through the romanticism of his music. Springsteen <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was your friend in desperate times. DeVille <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> couldn’t quite decide whether to serenade you or pull a knife on you.|$|E

50|$|SuperGran {{was created}} by author Forrest Wilson.

The first book was published in 1978, followed by several others, many illustrated by David McKee. Following the television series' success, Wilson adapted McDade's scripts as: Television Adventures of Super Gran,More Television Adventures of Super Gran, and Super Gran to the Rescue. Wilson, with Graham Kennedy, also released Super Gran: The Picture Book.|$|E
