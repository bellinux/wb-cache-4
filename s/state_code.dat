5|$|The FIPS {{county code}} is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely {{identifies}} counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number {{is unique to}} each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the <b>state</b> <b>code.</b> This means that, for example, while Addison County, Vermont is 001, Belknap County, New Hampshire and Alachua County, Florida are also 001. To uniquely identify Addison County, Vermont, one must use the <b>state</b> <b>code</b> of 50 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Addison County, Vermont is 50001. The links in the column FIPS County Code are to the Census Bureau Info page for that county.|$|E

500|$|Incorporated {{places in}} Maryland are self-governing {{municipalities}} chartered as cities, towns, or villages by an Act of the Maryland General Assembly or, in some cases, by a referendum. Municipalities are the lowest tier administrative {{units in the}} state, and all except Baltimore are also subject to county administration. Despite the designations of city, town, or village, there are no differences in municipal power and authority. There is no official classification of municipal governments and the municipalities are equal under state law. [...] The municipalities themselves decide whether to avail themselves of the specific powers conferred on them by the Maryland Constitution and <b>state</b> <b>code.</b> Since its separation from Baltimore County in 1851, the City of Baltimore functions more as a county than a city under state law since it exercises charter home rule, which empowers the city with broad legislative authority similar to Maryland's six home rule counties.|$|E
