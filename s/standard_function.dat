The functions under consideration are root and power functions, the exponential, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and their inverse functions. For such a function f and a given rectangular complex interval Z, some interval W is computed that contains all function values of f in Z. This is done by expressing the real and the imaginary part of f as compositions of real <b>standard</b> <b>functions</b> and then estimating the ranges of these compositions. In most cases, the inclusions are optimal, such that W is the smallest rectangular interval containing the range of f.

Generally, business process management is the management of flow of business activities in an effective and efficient way. If companies have effective and efficient business management process, that is a strong weapon for those companies in this fast changing business environments. This paper focuses on business process management of fulfillment and operations and support readiness business processes for telecom companies. For the fulfillment process, we derive recommended <b>standard</b> <b>functions</b> for a company with eTOM (Enhanced Telecom Operations Map). After deriving recommended <b>standard</b> <b>functions,</b> we draw business flow diagram for a certain process in the fulfillment. For operations support and readiness process we derive recommended <b>standard</b> <b>functions</b> for certain processes. In addition, we show some examples to evaluate process performance and optimize a function of a process.
