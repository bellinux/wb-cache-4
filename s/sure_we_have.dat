500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E

He stated that he attempted to work quickly when producing the album, however Rihanna wanted to constantly improve the album's quality stating [...] "Listen, let's up the quality level. Let's make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the emotion, and make sure it's a masterpiece." [...] Harrell stated that when he and Rihanna had previously worked together they aimed to make a great body of work, however on Anti they aimed to create a [...] "masterpiece".

2500|$|As the World Turns {{executive}} producer Chris Goutman stated in a WGN radio interview that Hansis and Silbermann are [...] "both very modest actors". He credited them with having {{the ability to}} show the proper emotions in subtle and effective ways (i.e. [...] "Luke's knowing smile and longing look at Noah, Noah's inner pain and fear of his father"). When asked if they rehearse together to decide which facial expressions they will use to convey these emotions in any given scene, Hansis replied, [...] "No. We rehearse together to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the lines right. But it's not usually about the acting, its just running lines." [...] He said that the [...] "acting comes" [...] when the cameras are on. [...] "We are comfortable with each other as actors, so {{if one of us}} does something new during taping, the other just rolls with it and it usually creates some nice moments," [...] said Hansis.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{reaction}} from the party outside the conference hall was not a positive one. Law had not consulted the local constituency branches about his plan, and several important constituency leaders led by Archibald Salvidge and Lord Derby planned for {{a meeting of the}} Lancashire party, the centre of discontent, on 21 December. Law was preoccupied with the problem of Irish Home Rule and was unable to give the discontent his full attention. He continued to believe that his approach to the problem of tariff reform was the correct one, and wrote to John Strachey on 16 November saying that [...] "it was a case of a choice of two evils, and all that one could do was to take the lesser of the two, and that I am <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done". Speaking to Edward Carson, F.E. Smith, Austen Chamberlain and Lord Balcarres in December after two weeks of receiving negative letters from party members about the change, Law outlined {{that he would not be}} averse to a return to the previous policy considering the negative feelings from the party, but felt that this would require the resignation of both himself and Lansdowne.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1995, Republicans {{leaders such}} as Tom Delay and Grover Norquist {{initiated}} an order to place Republicans in lobbying firm jobs, and exclude Democrats. [...] In addition, the initiative pressured lobbying firms to contribute to Republican campaigns, by withholding access to lawmakers from firms that did not comply. [...] The initiative became politically toxic for Republicans when the Jack Abramoff scandal broke in late 2004. [...] Although some sources indicate that Santorum {{played a key role}} in the K Street Project, Santorum has denied any involvement. [...] In November 2005, several months after the indictments of Abramoff and Delay, Santorum told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, [...] "The K Street project is purely to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> qualified applicants for positions that are in town. From my perspective, it's a good government thing." [...] A few months later, however, Santorum emphatically denied any connection with either the K Street Project or Norquist, saying: [...] "I had absolutely nothing to do—never met, never talked, never coordinated, never did anything—with Grover Norquist and the quote K Street Project." [...] In January 2012, The Washington Posts [...] "Fact Checker" [...] concluded that [...] "we can't prove definitively whether or not Santorum collaborated on the K Street Project", saying that it [...] "depend on how you define the initiative".|$|E
2500|$|The game is {{the first}} Harmonix game to feature a full album in the game as shipped, with the {{entirety}} of American Idiot, Dookie (except for hidden track [...] "All By Myself"), and 21st Century Breakdown being playable. The inclusion of the full album of American Idiot was {{the centerpiece of the}} game's development, according to Harmonix' Chris Foster, {{due in part to the}} thematic nature of the album which is meant to be listened as a whole, as well as the album's success and Broadway musical. This led the team to also including 21st Century Breakdown, an album similar to American Idiot that is meant to be heard as one complete work; as Harmonix had already released six songs from the album as downloadable content, they did not want to make those that had purchased the songs have to pay for them again in the full game, and instead designed the game to immediately incorporate those songs into the game if the player had already purchased them. Once these two albums were selected, Harmonix' CEO Alex Rigopulos determined that they needed to include the full Dookie album, the major label debut of the band and one of the most requested albums by Rock Band fans, in order to complete the experience. Though Harmonix had considered including material from the earliest Green Day albums, 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours and Kerplunk, master multi-track recordings [...] required by the Rock Band game engine to provide proper feedback when playing were not readily available,. According to Cool, while the master tapes for Kerplunk exist, they are in poor shape and the process to digitize them would destroy the tape; as such, Cool stated [...] "We’re making <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the right dudes to do it" [...] as potential future downloadable content for the game. Harmonix opted against using live versions of songs on these albums, feeling that the game needed to stay with the studio versions of the songs. Once Harmonix had selected to focus on the three albums, they decided against including any additional non-Green Day songs, instead focusing on rounding out the group's history to present a complete Green Day experience.|$|E
