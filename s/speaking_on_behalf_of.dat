5|$|On August 9, {{the same}} day ETA claimed {{responsibility}} for the July 30 attack, four bombs exploded in three restaurants and one shopping centre around Palma. The bombs, which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries, went off after three warning calls from ETA. At 11:16 am local time, a man <b>speaking</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> ETA called the firefighters of Calvià, warning that three bombs would go off in Palma. Half an hour later, another person also <b>speaking</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> ETA called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa, giving details of the location and time the bombs would explode. Finally, another warning call was mistakenly made to the personal mobile phone of an inhabitant of Córdoba. Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call, leading to confusion on the location of the bombs.|$|E

5|$|With his {{increasing}} reputation, local Republicans urged Harrison {{to run for}} Congress. He initially confined {{his political}} activities to <b>speaking</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> other Republican candidates, a task for which he received high praises from his colleagues. In 1872, Harrison campaigned for the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana. Former governor Oliver Morton favored his opponent, Thomas M. Browne, and Harrison lost his bid for statewide office. He returned to his law practice and, despite the Panic of 1873, he was financially successful enough to build a grand new home in Indianapolis in 1874. He continued to make speeches on behalf of Republican candidates and policies.|$|E

In 1947 Suslov was transferred to Moscow and elected to the Central Committee Secretariat; he would retain this seat {{for the rest of his}} life. Suslov had the full confidence of Stalin, and in 1948, he was entrusted with the task of <b>speaking</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the Central Committee before a solemn meeting on the twenty-fourth anniversary of Vladimir Lenin's death.

5|$|In {{response}} to the public concern about the mosque's size, the mosque's trustees did not choose Mangera's design for the final plan, deciding instead on a scaled-down structure. Abdul Sattar Shahid, <b>speaking</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the Tablighi Jamaat trustees, announced that the firm of Allies and Morrison was retained to design the mosque. In November 2011, {{it was reported that}} Allies & Morrison had been replaced by NRAP Architects. An outline planning application was submitted in May 2012. The scheme prepared by NRAP Architects included a prayer hall for over 9000, a refectory for 2000 and an Islamic library set within a public garden. A needs analysis and viability assessment submitted with the planning application seek to demonstrate that the proposals represent a justifiable departure from planning policy.|$|E

25|$|In a {{judgment}} delivered on 16 July 1999 Lord Woolf, the Master of the Rolls, <b>speaking</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the Court of Appeal, upheld {{the judgment of}} the High Court.

The legitimate expectation arose from the fact that the promise made to Coughlan had been specific to those premises, expressly made to a small group of people within the same category, conveyed in unqualified terms, and repeated and confirmed in representations made to the group.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} this ban was greater than and similar to, though less harsh than, the {{censorship}} provision introduced in 1988 in the United Kingdom. The UK ban did not prevent reports of interviews with spokespersons. This allowed interviews using actors' voices dubbing the direct speech of censored persons. This was not permissible on RTÉ. In 1992–93, in O'Toole vs RTÉ, RTÉ was found by the High Court and Supreme Court to have illegally and unconstitutionally extended the censorship ban to Sinn Féin members who were not <b>speaking</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the party. The RTÉ ban did not affect UK stations broadcasting in the Republic of Ireland as, until 1988 at least, viewers in the Republic were still able to hear the voices of Sinn Féin representatives.|$|E
