5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{rural and}} tribal women {{do all the}} {{household}} related chores. Heavy works that require more strength {{is done by the}} husband. Now, the chore work is evenly distributed with the men doing just as much work as the women. The scope of their functions include cooking, cleaning, teaching the children, washing clothes, repairs, budgeting, and helping in the farm. The husband is the one who makes sure the farm would yield quality crops, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> all the maintenance work.

25|$|Moses ascends Mount Sinai for {{a second}} time and Yahweh passes before him and says: 'Yahweh, Yahweh, a god of compassion, and showing favor, slow to anger, and great in {{kindness}} and in truth, who shows kindness to the thousandth generation, forgiving wrongdoing and injustice and wickedness, but will by no means clear the guilty, causing the consequences of the parent's wrongdoing to befall their children, and their children's children, to the third and fourth generation' Moses then fasts for another forty days while Yahweh carves the Ten Commandments into a second set of stone tablets.

25|$|The play {{is set in}} 1950s America, in an Italian American {{neighborhood}} {{near the}} Brooklyn Bridge in New York. It employs a chorus and narrator {{in the character of}} Alfieri. Eddie, the tragic protagonist, has an improper love of, and almost obsession with, Catherine, his wife Beatrice's orphaned niece, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not approve of her courtship of Beatrice's cousin Rodolfo. Miller's interest in writing about the world of the New York docks originated with an unproduced screenplay that he developed with Elia Kazan in the early 1950s (entitled The Hook) that addressed corruption on the Brooklyn docks. Kazan later directed On the Waterfront, which dealt with the same subject. Miller said that he heard the basic account that developed into the plot of A View from the Bridge from a lawyer who worked with longshoremen, who related it to him as a true story.|$|E
500|$|Meskó, {{who comes}} from the Hungarian {{minority}} in Romania, was born in Timișoara, where {{he lived with his}} family in 1989 during the revolutions leading to the fall of communism in the former Eastern Bloc and the overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu in Romania. [...] The family was so immersed {{in the middle of the}} crossfire that they often dodged bullets by getting on the floor in their apartment. [...] Zoltán was just passing through toddlerhood at the time of the revolution <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not remember much of the details, but the family stuffed windows with pillows during the conflict. Prior to the overthrow, the family dealt with the realities of communism, such as having to wait seven years to buy a car even though they had the money.|$|E

The old lady sees through her attempt, and in punishment for her [...] "telling stories" [...] compels her to kiss and cuddle all she meets. She cries out in protest that she's too shy for such behaviour, but the old lady assures her that she'll [...] "get over [...] shyness {{after a year or}} two of that sort of thing". Boomblehardt approaches next, and Pipette flings herself on him, crying [...] "Kiss me!". He obliges. She responds, [...] "How dare you take such a liberty! You insolent old man! Kiss me". And <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> She boxes his ears, much to his confusion, and then retreats into the inn in tears.|$|E
500|$|Morley took a {{break from}} Neighbours in mid-2012, which led the writers to improvise an {{on-screen}} break up for Aidan and Chris. The break up occurs after Aidan learns Chris has not told his parents {{that they are in}} a relationship. Mason said that Chris is fine with his friends knowing about his relationship, but it is different story {{when it comes to his}} parents. His father has not always made things easy for him in the past, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not give him and his mother a chance to get to know Aidan. When Chris' parents throw him a birthday party at Lassiter's Lake, he decides not to invite Aidan. However, Aidan learns about the party from Andrew and he feels [...] "hurt and humiliated" [...] by Chris' actions. Aidan makes it clear to Chris that their relationship is over and Mason added [...] "That's when the gravity of the situation hits Chris, and he's left in shock. He thinks, 'How did it come to this?'. Things really seemed to be falling into place with Aidan." [...] Chris then learns that his parents would have accepted the relationship and he realises that he has lost Aidan due to an assumption.|$|E
2500|$|Dysart {{reveals a}} dream he has had, in a Grecian/Homeric setting, {{in which he}} is a public {{official}} presiding over a mass ritual sacrifice. Dysart slices open the abdomens of hundreds of children, and pulls out their entrails. He becomes disgusted with what he is doing, but fears being murdered {{in the same manner as}} the children if he is discovered as a [...] "non-believer" [...] by the other priests, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not stop. Eventually the other priests, aware of his misgivings, grab the knife from his hand before he awakens from the dream.|$|E

2500|$|The Original Snub is the Discordian {{name for}} the events {{preceding}} the Judgement of Paris, although more focus is put on the actions of Eris. Zeus believes that Eris is a troublemaker, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not invite her to Peleus and Thetis's wedding. Having been snubbed, Eris creates a golden apple with the word kallisti ( [...] , to the prettiest one) inscribed in it. This, the Apple of Discord, is a notable symbol in Discordianism for its inclusion in the Holy Chao, and is traditionally described as being made of gold.|$|E
2500|$|They go to a restaurant, where Gigi acts {{the role}} of courtesan {{perfectly}} – perhaps a little too perfectly. Gaston is uncomfortable with her knowledge of the other courtesans, and concerned for Gigi because of the unrelenting attention and judgment of other patrons. Honoré then delivers a crushing blow when he congratulates Gaston on his new courtesan and makes degrading remarks towards Gigi. Gaston, too in love with Gigi to give her this appalling life of uncertainty and judgment, leaves without a word after dragging her home crying. However, he stops a little way {{down the street and}} realizes his love for her is too strong, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> something he never thought he would do and he proposes marriage.|$|E
2500|$|A {{similar case}} {{involved}} Clive Wearing, an accomplished musicologist who contracted a cold sore virus that attacked his brain, causing herpes simplex encephalitis. As a result, Wearing developed both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, {{so he has}} little memory of what happened before the virus struck him in 1985, and cannot learn new declarative knowledge after the virus struck him either. As a result of anterograde amnesia, Wearing repeatedly [...] "wakes up" [...] every day usually in 30-second intervals. [...] He {{has a history of}} repeatedly recording these moments of waking up in his journal (e.g., On Sept 2, 2013 I woke up, etc. etc.) and crossing out prior entries, as if the other moments of waking up were not real. [...] His episodic memory is nonfunctional (<b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not consciously recall having woken up 30 seconds prior). [...] Clive is often elated to see his wife, as if he has not seen her for a while. [...] Despite this, however, Wearing maintained his ability to play the piano and conduct choirs. This case is significant because it demonstrates declarative and procedural memory are separate. Therefore, despite anterograde amnesia preventing Wearing from learning new bits of information that can be explained in words (declarative memory), and also preventing him from storing new memories of events or episodes (also part of declarative memory), he has little trouble in retaining his musical abilities (procedural memory), though he has no conscious memory of having learned music.|$|E
