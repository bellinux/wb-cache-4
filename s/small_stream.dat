5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{irrigation}} {{was introduced}} to the San Joaquin Valley in the late 19th century, and led to the construction of numerous state, federal and privately owned dams, which blocked migrating salmon and caused a large decline in riparian habitat. Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> by the time it reaches its mouth. Efforts to mitigate environmental damage include habitat conservation work, re-establishment of historic streamflow patterns, and the construction of a salmon hatchery.|$|E
5|$|North of CR22, Rutgers Creek {{merges with}} Indigot Creek, a <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> forming {{part of the}} Minisink–Wawayanda town line. The {{combined}} stream continues {{to serve as the}} boundary between the two towns as Rutgers Creek takes on a southeasterly course from this point. NY284 crosses over the waterway, entering Wawayanda and connecting to CR93 (Lime Kiln Road) just north of the town line. From CR93, the highway runs northeastward across open, rolling terrain, following an active part of the MNJ Railroad to the hamlet of Slate Hill. NY284 ends {{in the center of the}} community at a junction with US6.|$|E

5|$|On the {{south-western}} {{part of the}} fort, {{which is}} surrounded by hills on three sides, there is a <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> called the Kamadah Jheel which {{was used by the}} women of the royal family for their daily ablutions. Between this stream and the fort there are two watch towers (dom kilas) located on the hill top which were used to track any enemy intrusions. Of these two towers, one tower houses a small temple of a goddess called Devi Mandir.|$|E
5|$|The route {{proceeds}} west {{into the}} town of Owasco and the hamlet {{of the same name}} within, the first community of any significant size along the route since it left Moravia. It heads westward {{through the center of the}} community before reentering rural surroundings and coming within view of Owasco Lake. The route curves northward at the waterbody and follows the eastern shore of Owasco Lake toward Auburn. Southeast of Auburn, NY38A crosses a <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> and serves the Lakeview Golf and Country Club and the Owasco Country Club as it curves westward around the northern end of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Trapped {{refugees}} began {{piling up}} bodies as barricades {{and tried to}} dig into the ground to hide. Some managed to escape that first night, while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said Chung Koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. By the second day, the gunfire was reduced to potshots and occasional fusillades when a trapped refugee moved or tried to escape. Some also recall planes returning that second day to fire rockets or drop bombs. Racked with thirst, survivors resorted to drinking blood-filled water from a <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> running under the bridge.|$|E

5|$|At 03:50 on 31 July, the Battle of Pilckem Ridge began. The {{division}} {{was ordered to}} capture the German front line, the second line positions based on Pilckem Ridge, a low ridge that also contained the heavily shelled village of Pilckem, followed by Iron Cross Ridge which lay to the east, before storming {{down the other side}} and across a <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> known as the Steenbeck. The division would be opposed primarily by the German 3rd Guards Infantry Division, along with elements of the 3rd Reserve Division and 111th Division, dug-in among trench lines and 280 concrete pillboxes and bunkers. To secure these various objectives, the division planned to attack in waves, with fresh troops constantly moving forward to tackle the next objective.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the only}} Class-A fishery {{waters in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A, the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek, and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek. Only one <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> near Nescopeck Creek's mouth had Class-C fishery waters. The central part of Nescopeck Creek, {{as well as most}} of Black Creek had Class-D fishery waters. There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999. Of these, seventeen had been seen in the watershed before. However, since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that, the brown bullhead and the bluegill fish had vanished from the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|NY421 {{begins at}} a dead end south of the hamlet of Horseshoe in an {{isolated}} part {{of the town of}} Piercefield. Here, the highway connects to a pair of dirt roads, one of which leads north alongside Horseshoe Lake to Horseshoe. The two-lane route heads eastward from the trails, following the southern shore of Horseshoe Lake while traversing the deep woods of Adirondack Park. At the southeastern end of the lake, NY421 turns northeastward, crossing a <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> feeding into the lake before curving back toward the east. For the next , the road passes through unabated wilderness as it heads toward the western shoreline of Tupper Lake.|$|E

5|$|Ostrach {{was a small}} village, with a {{population}} of 300. The village belonged to the Cistercian Imperial Abbey of Salem, an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on Lake Constance. The village was largely dedicated to farming, although a stretch of the imperial post road connected it and Pfullendorf. A wide, flat plain, marshy in places, stretched between the base of the Pfullendorf heights and the village; low lying hills ringed the valley, which was creased by a <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at the northern end of this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. The two armies faced each other across this small and, at that time of that year, very soggy valley.|$|E
5|$|The overlap {{comes to}} an end near the hamlet of Gee Brook, where NY41 splits from NY26 and veers northwestward into a rural valley {{surrounding}} a <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> that gives the hamlet of Gee Brook its name. NY41 crosses through the northeastern corner of the town of Freetown and the southern portion of the town of Solon {{on its way to the}} town of Cortlandville, where it intersects I-81 and US11 west of the village of McGraw. US11 and NY41 come together here and parallel I-81 westward toward the city of Cortland. Just east of the city line, I-81 veers north to avoid downtown Cortland while US11 and NY41 continue west across the Tioughnioga River and into the city.|$|E
5|$|NY61 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY384 (Buffalo Avenue) on the industrial {{banks of the}} Niagara River in eastern Niagara Falls. The route, named Hyde Park Boulevard for its entire length, heads north initially as a city-maintained, undivided four-lane highway; after two blocks, the roadway widens and becomes maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. NY61 continues onward through the densely populated neighborhoods of Niagara Falls to Packard Road, where the route begins to parallel Gill Creek, a <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> leading south to the Niagara River. After five blocks, NY61 intersects with Ferry Avenue, a one-way street carrying southbound U.S. Route62 (US62), {{in the area of}} the Niagara Falls Courthouse. NY61 intersects with northbound US62 three blocks later at Walnut Avenue. At the intersection, Gill Creek passes under both US62 northbound and NY61 as it switches to the east side of Hyde Park Boulevard.|$|E

5|$|Neepaulakating Creek is <b>small</b> <b>stream</b> whose {{headwaters}} {{are located}} at 640 feet (195 m) {{above sea level}} approximately 0.4 miles (0.6km) northwest of {{the north end of}} Lake Neepaulin. These headwaters are located a short distance south of County Route 650 (Libertyville Road) roughly halfway between the hamlet of Libertville in Wantage Township and Sussex Borough. The stream flows into Lake Neepaulin located at 509ft (155 m) above sea level. The man-made lake, created through damming, is the centre of a private residential development. It flows southeast from the lake's dam in the southeast direction for another 1.5 miles (2.4km) before flowing into Papakating Creek. It enters Papakating Creek at 395 feet (120 m) above sea level approximately 2.5 miles (4km) upstream of that creek's junction with the Wallkill River at a location directly south of Sussex Borough along County Route 565 near the hamlet of Lewisburg in Wantage Township and near Sussex Airport.|$|E
5|$|The 44th Brigade {{encountered}} little opposition until {{coming under}} machine gun fire at a <b>small</b> <b>stream,</b> following which German resistance was much heavier. Between 0830 and 0930, the 6th Battalion, The Royal Scots Fusiliers and the 8th Battalion, The Royal Scots reached their initial objectives of Sainte Manvieu and La Gaule. After much {{hand to hand}} fighting they believed the villages to be captured just after midday, although they later found that some German remnants were holding out. Tanks and infantry from the 12th SS and the 21st Panzer divisions launched two counter-attacks to regain Sainte Manvieu but were repulsed {{with the aid of}} intensive artillery fire. The main German opposition in this section of their outpost line, had been from part of the I Battalion, 26th Panzergrenadier Regiment, which had been mostly overrun and the divisional pioneer battalion. The Germans in Rauray, which had not been captured the previous day, were able to subject the British brigades to observed artillery and indirect tank fire, causing considerable casualties and destruction, especially within the village of Cheux.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is built}} on igneous rock in the James Valley, {{sandwiched}} between steep cliffs. It is therefore rather long and thin. The walls of the valley are rough and steep, and rockfalls have been a problem, although now minimised by netting. A <b>small</b> <b>stream,</b> the Run, runs through the valley. The town is commonly divided into lower and upper parts, depending on the distance up James Valley. Being the island's main port (and with the Saint Helena Airport only receiving its first scheduled flight in October 2017) the town is still currently the main entrance to the island to visitors. Despite not being connected to Jamestown proper by road, Rupert's Valley, the next valley north, {{is also part of}} the town. It houses much of the island's infrastructure, such as its power station and associated fuel storage, and a one-ship wharf was completed in June 2016.|$|E
