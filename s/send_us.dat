5|$|Lieutenant General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford) {{is brought}} to a maximum {{security}} military prison to begin a ten-year sentence for his decision (in violation of a presidential order) to <b>send</b> <b>U.S.</b> troops on a mission in Burundi, resulting {{in the deaths of}} eight soldiers. Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), the prison's commandant, is a great admirer of the general but is offended by a comment he overhears: Irwin criticizes Winter's much-prized military artifacts collection, calling it something no actual battlefield veteran would ever have.|$|E
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to <b>send</b> <b>U.S.</b> Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|Intervention in Latin America {{had been}} a minor {{campaign}} issue; Harding spoke against Wilson's decision to <b>send</b> <b>U.S.</b> troops to the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and attacked the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Franklin Roosevelt, {{for his role in}} the Haitian intervention. Once Harding was sworn in, Hughes worked to improve relations with Latin American countries who were wary of the American use of the Monroe Doctrine to justify intervention; at the time of Harding's inauguration, the U.S. also had troops in Cuba and Nicaragua. The troops stationed in Cuba to protect American interests were withdrawn in 1921; U.S. forces remained in the other three nations through Harding's presidency. In April 1921, Harding gained the ratification of the Thomson–Urrutia Treaty with Colombia, granting that nation $25,000,000 as settlement for the U.S.-provoked Panamanian revolution of 1903. The Latin American nations were not fully satisfied, as the U.S. refused to renounce interventionism, though Hughes pledged to limit it to nations near the Panama Canal and to make it clear what the U.S. aims were.|$|E

25|$|Since SHAEF {{believed}} the Wehrmacht {{was no longer}} capable of launching a major offensive, nor that any offensive could be launched through such rugged terrain as the Ardennes Forest — particularly during winter — the Ardennes {{was used as an}} area to <b>send</b> <b>US</b> divisions, which had recently fought and sustained severe casualties, in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest to regroup and refit. It was also used as a place where new units recently from the US were sent to get some field experience in a safe place.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March Kirke, Deputy Director of Operations at GHQ, flew to London {{to report}} that the Germans had gained 12 miles and {{captured}} 600 guns. Wilson wrote that 23 March was “an anxious day”: the War Cabinet discussed falling back on the Channel Ports and agreed to send out 50,000 “boys” of 18 ½ – 19 together with another 82,000 men from Britain, along with 88,000 returning from leave. A British division was recalled from Italy, Allenby was instructed to hold one ready, and Lord Reading (Ambassador in Washington) was asked to urge President Wilson to <b>send</b> <b>US</b> reinforcements quicker.|$|E
500|$|Up {{until the}} middle of 1991, Sega of America had been kept largely uninformed of the details of the project, without a {{functioning}} unit to test (although Sega of America was provided with preliminary technical documents earlier in the year). According to former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham, [...] "When you work at a multinational company, there are things that go well and there are things that don't. They didn't want to <b>send</b> <b>us</b> working Sega CD units. They wanted to <b>send</b> <b>us</b> dummies and not <b>send</b> <b>us</b> the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about what we would do with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating." [...] Even though they were not provided a functioning unit, Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda put together a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. Further frustrating the Sega of America staff was the construction of the add-on. [...] "The Mega-CD was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio CD drive, not a CD-ROM," [...] stated Scot Bayless, former Sega of America senior producer. [...] "Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the units—and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally realized what was happening," [...] citing the need for game titles to utilize more time seeking data than the CD drive was designed to provide.|$|E

500|$|The {{objective}} of the Japanese embassy was both to discuss trade agreements with the Spanish crown in Madrid, and {{to meet with the}} Pope in Rome. Date Masamune displayed a great will to welcome the Catholic religion in his domain: he invited Luis Sotelo and authorized the propagation of Christianity in 1611. In his letter to the Pope, brought by Hasekura, he wrote: [...] "I'll offer my land for a base of your missionary work. <b>Send</b> <b>us</b> as many padres as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{captured}} Croatian {{soldiers and}} civilians were summarily executed after the battle. Journalists witnessed one such killing in Vukovar's main street. They also reported seeing the streets strewn with bodies in civilian attire. BBC television reporters recorded Serbian paramilitaries chanting: [...] "Slobodane, Slobodane, šalji nam salate, biće mesa, biće mesa, klaćemo Hrvate!" [...] ("Slobodan , Slobodan, <b>send</b> <b>us</b> some salad, [...] {{there will be}} meat, there will be meat, we will slaughter Croats").

[...] "I thought he had been bullying too many people for too long, and I told him so," [...] Moran recalled. [...] "He said he didn't mean to be so accusatory ... After that, he would bring me candy from California." [...] Moran said that after the encounter he found Cunningham crying in the cloakroom.|$|E

Then it cuts to him dressing up {{in a suit and}} going onstage to sing the song {{in front of an audience}} of drag queens. Thomas Rogers from Salon criticized the video for portraying drag queens like [...] "patients in a mental ward" [...] as well as the interview sequence, which he felt equated drag queens as people with multiple personality disorder. A writer for Metro questioned [...] "Is Robbie trying to <b>send</b> <b>us</b> a message? Or has he just got extremely carried away playing dress up in his mother's wardrobe." ...|$|E
500|$|The Roosevelt Administration asked Chinese Nationalist {{president}} Chiang Kai-shek's {{permission to}} <b>send</b> <b>U.S.</b> observers {{to visit the}} CPC. Initially, Chiang was hostile to the proposal and delayed action. The Generalissimo consented after foreign correspondents that he had permitted to visit Yan'an reported on the CPC to U.S. readers. [...] Chiang agreed after American Vice-President Henry Wallace made a state visit to Chungking, the nationalists' capital, in late June 1944. [...] John Carter Vincent, an experienced State Department China expert, assisted Wallace in persuading Chiang to allow the U.S. to visit the CPC in Yan'an without Nationalist supervision. In exchange, the U.S. promised to replace the American commander of the Burma India Theater, General Stilwell. He was removed from command in October 1944.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{resulted in}} {{pressure on the}} new Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone, who agreed to review the cases of twenty-four stateless people in immigration detention, and ultimately granted bridging visas to nine people including Al-Kateb, allowing them to be released into the community. However, {{the conditions of the}} bridging visas did not permit holders to work, study, obtain social security benefits or receive healthcare from Medicare, and Al-Kateb remained entirely dependent on donations from friends and supporters to survive. Al-Kateb said of his situation, [...] "We [...] just walking in a big detention. And we are all the time worried that they will <b>send</b> <b>us</b> back to detention again… It's like a death punishment." [...] He was granted a permanent visa in October 2007 by immigration minister Kevin Andrews.|$|E

500|$|Alan Clayson {{writes of}} reviewers criticising [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] for being repetitious, leading Starr {{to respond in}} a 1973 interview: [...] "Play me a pop song that isn't." [...] On release, Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker: [...] "A Number One hit could easily be in store for the maestro of rock drums. There's {{a touch of the}} Marc Bolans in this highly playable rhythmic excursion... It's {{hypnotic}} and effective, ideal for jukeboxes and liable to <b>send</b> <b>us</b> all mad {{by the end of the}} week." [...] Woffinden described the single as [...] "every bit as ebullient" [...] as [...] "It Don't Come Easy", although [...] "slightly inferior", while Mike DeGagne of AllMusic views it as a song where [...] "he jovial spirit of Ringo Starr shines through". In a 1974 article for the NME, Charles Shaar Murray highlighted [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] as a [...] "great radio and juke-box tune".|$|E
500|$|On 7 January 2006, {{three days}} before the auction of the final 1,000 pixels was due to end, Tew {{received}} an e-mail from an organisation called [...] "The Dark Group", and was told The Million Dollar Homepage would become the victim of a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) if a ransom of $5,000 was not paid by 10 January. Believing the threat to be a hoax, he ignored it, but a week later received a second e-mail threat: [...] "Hello u website is under us atack to stop the DDoS <b>send</b> <b>us</b> 50000$."
