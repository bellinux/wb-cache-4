40|$|Abstract—Spinal cord {{analysis}} {{is an important}} problem {{in the study of}} various neurological diseases. Current segmentation and analysis methods in clinical use are slow and laborintensive, especially for pathological data. “Spinal Crawlers” are a recently developed technique based on an artificial life framework for medical image analysis that complements classical deformable models (snakes and deformable meshes) with high-level control mechanisms. Our method extends Spinal Crawlers to better function in a clinical setting in which images of variable quality and challenging anatomy are encountered. We augment the Spinal Crawler’s local optimality with that of globally optimal paths using the live-wire technique. This fusion of globally optimal paths, with locally optimal filtering allows our method to better adapt to contrast changes compared to other methods and therefore allows a larger <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> to be measured. Our improvements are validated on 5 vertebral levels of both healthy and pathological spinal cords from clinical MR data. This is the first study to validate a spinal cord segmentation method over a large region encompassing the length of five vertebrae.

40|$|To {{determine}} if {{presence of the}} Roach muscle, a small muscle bundle lying just beside the umbilical artery, contributes to umbilical cord coiling. 251 umbilical cords were examined. The umbilical coiling index (UCI) was calculated {{as the number of}} coils divided by the cord length in cm. Cords were classified as hypocoiled (UCI p 90). On microscopic examination of a cross <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cord,</b> absence or presence of a Roach muscle was determined. The t-test for independent samples and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. A Roach muscle was observed in 101 cords. The mean UCI was higher in cords with the muscle bundle (0. 23 coils/cm) than in cords without a muscle (0. 18 coils/cm). Difference in mean: 0. 05 coils/cm (95 % C. I. 0. 01 - 0. 09). OR for hypercoiling in presence of the muscle was 2. 98 (95 % C. I. 1. 57 - 5. 64). OR for hypocoiling {{in the presence of the}} muscle was 1. 49 (95 % C. I. 0. 79 - 2. 81). Our results suggest that presence of a Roach muscle bundle contributes to umbilical cord coiling. Given the divergence in umbilical cord coiling within subgroups with or without this muscle, other factors must play a more dominant rol...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} on cerebral anæmia have {{enabled us to}} duplicate, by an entirely different method, many of the results obtained by anatomical division or removal of parts of the central nervous system. In some respects the method of anæmia permits of greater precision than the method of division or excision, and avoids, in great measure, the disturbances due to the wound and to the hemorrhage caused by the latter method. The method of general anæmia, as Couty pointed out long ago, leaves something to be desired {{in the matter of}} exact localization, but this objection may be met, in some degree at least, by appropriate methods of investigation. It is desirable that the results obtained by the method of section should be duplicated by some other method in order to eliminate as much as possible the effects due to the irritation produced by the anatomical lesion. Our results show, as we believe, that, of the bulbar mechanisms studied, the respiratory is the most automatic, the vasomotor in part automatic, and the cardiac like the swallowing mechanism, almost wholly dependent upon afferent impulses for the arousal and discharge of its normal activity. The eye reflexes return during the resuscitation period in the animals in which the cerebral anæmia has not been too prolonged. The motor cortex loses its excitability during anæmia, but may regain it after the reëstablishment of the circulation. The pilomotor mechanism is disturbed during the spasms which occur at a certain stage in the resuscitation. The temperature falls during the occlusion period, but rises again, often to far above normal, in the days following the anæmia. So many disturbing factors, such as the violent muscular contractions during spasms, enter into the problem {{that it is impossible to}} say that there is an actual disturbance of the temperature regulating mechanism although we are inclined to believe that this is the case. All the senses return, following cerebral anæmia, but sight and hearing may afterwards fail without causing the death of the animal. The mental processes may return without any apparent deficiency, if the period of anæmia has been short. After longer occlusion, apparent insanity has been seen, and in one case, apparent total loss of mental processes occurred. The reflex excitability of the cord returns rather early in the resuscitation period. Reflexes from the anterior part of the cord first involve muscles on the same side as the stimulus, and later cross to involve muscles of the opposite side. The spinal cord sometimes falls into much the same condition as that following spinal transection, and the scratch reflex appears. Spinal transection, when these reflexes have appeared, does not produce shock. Practically all phenomena of spinal shock may be reproduced without <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cord.</b> We conclude, therefore, that spinal shock is due more to the cutting off of the reflex pathways through the higher centers of the nervous system than to the stimulation of inhibitory fibers by the anæmia...|$|E

Two groups of monkeys {{were subjected to}} unilateral <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinal <b>cord</b> affecting <b>the</b> rubrospinal tract; one group was subsequently treated with an antibody neutralizing Nogo-A; the second group received a control antibody. Intact animals were {{also included in the}} study. Counting neurons stained with a monoclonal antibody recognizing non-phosphorylated epitopes on neurofilaments (SMI- 32) indicated that their number in the contralesional RNm was consistently inferior to that in the ipsilesional RNm, in a proportion amounting up to 35 %. The lesion also induced shrinkage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neurons detected in the contralesional RNm. Infusing an anti-Nogo-A antibody at <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lesion did not increase <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> SMI- 32 positive rubrospinal neurons in the contralesional RNm nor prevent shrinkage...|$|R
40|$|MALDI-based Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) is an {{analytical}} technique {{that provides the}} opportunity to study <b>the</b> spatial distribution <b>of</b> biomolecules including proteins and peptides in organic tissue. IMS measures a large collection of mass spectra spread out over an organic tissue section and retains the absolute spatial location of these measurements for analysis and imaging. The classical approach to IMS imaging, producing univariate ion images, is not well suited {{as a first step}} in a prospective study where no a priori molecular target mass can be formulated. The main reasons for this are the size and <b>the</b> multivariate nature <b>of</b> IMS data. In this paper we describe <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> principal component analysis as a multivariate pre-analysis tool, to identify the major spatial and mass-related trends in the data and to guide further analysis downstream. First, a conceptual overview of principal component analysis for IMS is given. Then, we demonstrate the approach on an IMS data set collected from a transversal <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinal <b>cord</b> <b>of</b> a standard control rat...|$|R
