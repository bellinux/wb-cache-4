It features Wattage Control, Temperature Protection, Preheat, Digital User Controls, OLED Screen, Onboard Buttons and <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Rectification</b> for maximum battery life and minimal heat generation.|$|E
50|$|Higher {{input voltage}} and <b>synchronous</b> <b>rectification</b> mode makes the {{conversion}} process more efficient. The power {{consumption of the}} controller also {{has to be taken}} into account. Higher switching frequency allows component sizes to be shrunk, but can produce more RFI. A resonant forward converter produces the lowest EMI of any SMPS approach because it uses a soft-switching resonant waveform compared with conventional hard switching.|$|E
50|$|A buck {{converter}} (step-down converter) is a DC-to-DC power converter which steps down voltage (while stepping up current) from its input (supply) to its output (load). It is {{a class of}} switched-mode power supply (SMPS) typically containing at least two semiconductors (a diode and a transistor, although modern {{buck converter}}s frequently replace the diode with a second transistor used for <b>synchronous</b> <b>rectification)</b> {{and at least one}} energy storage element, a capacitor, inductor, or the two in combination. To reduce voltage ripple, filters made of capacitors (sometimes in combination with inductors) are normally added to such a converter's output (load-side filter) and input (supply-side filter).|$|E
5000|$|Practical {{electronic}} converters use switching techniques. Switched-mode DC-to-DC converters convert one DC {{voltage level}} to another, {{which may be}} higher or lower, by storing the input energy temporarily and then releasing that energy to the output at a different voltage. The storage may be in either magnetic field storage components (inductors, transformers) or electric field storage components (capacitors). This conversion method can increase or decrease voltage. Switching conversion is more power efficient (often 75% to 98%) than linear voltage regulation, which dissipates unwanted power as heat. Fast semiconductor device rise and fall times are required for efficiency; however, these fast transitions combine with layout parasitic effects to make circuit design challenging. The higher efficiency of a switched-mode converter reduces the heatsinking needed, and increases battery endurance of portable equipment. Efficiency has improved since the late 1980s due {{to the use of}} power FETs, which are able to switch more efficiently with lower switching losses at higher frequencies than power bipolar transistors, and use less complex drive circuitry.Another important improvement in DC-DC converters is replacing the flywheel diode by <b>synchronous</b> <b>rectification</b> using a power FET, whose [...] "on resistance" [...] is much lower, reducing switching losses. Before the wide availability of power semiconductors, low-power DC-to-DC synchronous converters consisted of an electro-mechanical vibrator followed by a voltage step-up transformer feeding a vacuum tube or semiconductor rectifier, or synchronous rectifier contacts on the vibrator.|$|E
