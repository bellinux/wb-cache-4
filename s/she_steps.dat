500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, {{who worked with}} Madonna in her video for [...] "Borderline", was shot in Venice and partly in New York City in July 1984. Madonna was portrayed as a knowing virgin, a figment of the pornographic mind, as she walked through marble rooms, wearing a wedding gown. It alternated with scenes of a provocative-looking Madonna on board a gondola. She commented, [...] " [...] {{wanted me to be}} the modern-day, worldly-wise girl that I am. But then we wanted to go back in time and use myself as an actual virgin." [...] The video starts with Madonna boarding on a boat from the Brooklyn Bridge and travels to Venice. As <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> down into the city, she moves like a stripper and undulated sinuously. She wears a black dress and blue pants with a number of Christian symbol embedded jewelry around her neck. She sings the song at full volume as she watches a lion walking between the columns of the Piazza San Marco of Venice and along the statute of Saint Mark.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery of MTV News {{called the}} video [...] "jaw-dropping".

On behalf of Rolling Stone, Daniel Kreps stated that [...] "Aguilera assumes no less than a dozen different guises, all scantily clad, ranging from carbon copies of Lady Gaga (borrowing heavily from her unique wardrobe), Madonna, Beyoncé, Gwen Stefani, the girls from Robert Palmer's [...] "Simply Irresistible" [...] video and Michelle Pfeiffer's S Catwoman from Batman Returns. Despite the video's attempt to shock, it's unlikely Aguilera will ever out-Gaga Gaga or out-controversy Madonna. ... Hopefully next time <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> {{in front of the}} lens she'll be more herself and less like everyone else". NME ranked the [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] music video at number 8 on its list of the [...] "50 Worst Music Videos Ever".|$|E

She is determined to steam up any dance floor <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> onto and make sure that no one resists her call to [...] "get [...] bodied". The lyrics are constructed in the traditional verse-chorus form. [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] begins with Beyoncé telling her birthdate [...] "9-4-8-1", followed by a group of male voices singing [...] "hey's" [...] and [...] "jump's" [...] for four bars; the first verse then begins. The verses are written like a list where she sings her missions before going to party. It is followed with the chorus and the hook, where Beyoncé sings: [...] "Can you get me bodied? I want to be myself tonight." [...] The second verse follows, the chorus repeats giving way to the bridge, and Beyoncé sings the chorus again, ending the song with [...] "hey!".|$|E

500|$|The Cat {{brings in}} a big red box from outside, from which he {{releases}} two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two.

However, as soon as filming begins, he immediately asks about her rumoured promiscuity and involvement in the Smurf genocide. To Cartman's surprise, Wendy claims she indeed bulldozed Smurfland to get the valuable Smurfberries, but alludes that Cartman was involved with the plot, and that the Smurfs would have left Smurfland if Cartman had not integrated himself with them. <b>She</b> <b>steps</b> down as student body president, turning the title over to Cartman, and announces her own new book [...] on the Smurfs. Cartman is angry that she has turned the tables on him and stolen his Smurf idea, particularly when she announces she sold the movie rights to director James Cameron, who turned the book into his new film, Avatar. With being the student body president, Cartman can't do the morning announcements anymore because a student can't hold both positions at the same time. Cartman, much to his anger, also learns that being the student body president is a meaningless position with no real power.

500|$|Television {{critics have}} commended the {{development}} of Cheryl, as well as Greer's portrayal of the character. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall declared that Cheryl was his favorite character on the show. In his review for [...] "El Secuestro", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club felt that Greer's vocals were {{the highlight of the}} episode, and affirmed that she effectively portrayed the unstable characteristics of Cheryl. [...] "Greer is mostly just asked to say crazy things as Cheryl, and that’s fun, but <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> it up here, playing both Cheryl’s insanity and the part of her that’s a spoiled trust-fund kid who’s found a day job and has to ride the subway with a dwarf that freaks her out." [...] Likewise, Ian MacDonald of TV Overmind proclaimed that the writers [...] "found a great way to expand on ISIS' most emotionally unstable employees"; [...] "Cheryl, whose crazy has been escalated to an almost extreme," [...] MacDonald stated, [...] "seems almost justified in her maladjusted-ness. She's a billionaire heiress who owns an ocelot and drinks glue [...] Humor involving insane rich people just no getting it is usually pretty funny, and if anyone can pull it off, it's Adam Reed and [...] Greer." [...] Alongside fellow cast members Jessica Walter and H. Jon Benjamin, Greer was a candidate for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in a Television Production—the award was given to Jeff Bennett for his work in the Nickelodeon television series The Penguins of Madagascar.|$|E
2500|$|Christine Daaé is the {{beautiful}} young Swedish chorus girl whom Erik meets at the Paris Opera.

She is described as having a voice that would make an angel cry, with perfect pitch and excellent vibrato, but absolutely no feeling whatsoever. Erik trains her to use her voice properly and, having done so, Christine sings wonderfully. Unfortunately, due to the arrangements by the company's diva, La Carlotta, she is upstaged as soon as <b>she</b> <b>steps</b> out into the public's eye. She was born in 1861, the same year Madeleine died, and is said to bear an almost perfect resemblance to her.|$|E
