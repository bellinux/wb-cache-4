5|$|President Fernando de la Rúa {{resigned}} {{after the}} December 2001 riots {{that had been}} caused by the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression. As his vice president Carlos Álvarez had resigned as well months before, Congress called for a <b>special</b> <b>assembly</b> to designate a new president. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá became president after being elected with 169 votes to 138. He {{was supported by the}} PJ and smaller right-wing parties such as Republican Force and Action for the Republic. The Unión Cívica Radical (UCR) and Alternative for a Republic of Equals voted against him. He was replaced in the governor's office by vice-governor María Alicia Lemme, and took office on December 23, 2001.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a demise of the Crown, the Privy Council—together with the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London as well as representatives of Commonwealth realms—makes a {{proclamation}} declaring the accession of the new sovereign and receives an oath from the new monarch relating to the security of the Church of Scotland, as required by law. It is also customary for the new sovereign to make an allocution to the Privy Council on that occasion, and this Sovereign's Speech is formally published in The London Gazette. Any such <b>Special</b> <b>Assembly</b> of the Privy Council, convened to proclaim the accession of a new sovereign and witness the monarch's statutory oath, is known as an Accession Council. The last such meetings were held on 6 and 8 February 1952: as Elizabeth II was abroad when the last demise of the Crown took place, the Accession Council met twice, once to proclaim the sovereign (meeting of 6 February 1952), and then again after the new queen had returned to Britain, to receive from her the oath required by statute (meeting of 8 February 1952).|$|E

2500|$|In April 1992, Chakufwa Chihana, a labor unionist, openly {{called for}} a {{national}} referendum on the political future of Malawi. He was arrested before he finished his speech at Lilongwe International Airport. By October 1992, this mounting pressure from within and {{from the international community}} forced Banda to concede to hold a referendum on whether to maintain the one-party state. [...] The referendum was held on 14 June 1993, resulting in an overwhelming vote (64 percent) in favor of multiparty democracy. After this, political parties besides the MCP were formed and preparation for the general elections began. Banda worked with the newly forming parties and the church, and made no protest when a <b>special</b> <b>assembly</b> stripped him of his title of President for Life, along with most of his powers. The transition from a rigid authoritarian regime to democracy was fairly peaceful.|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Mary Star of the Sea drew media {{attention}} when a 17-year-old, straight- honor student and student council vice president, Lisa Martinez, was barred from graduation at the parish high school {{because she was}} 6- months pregnant. [...] After the action drew protests from students and criticism in the press, Archbishop Roger Mahony overruled the school's decision. [...] Archbishop Mahony praised the girl for [...] "resisting the pressure {{to conform to the}} unacceptable 'abortion option.'" [...] He said the church should assist, not alienate, pregnant girls. [...] "She has chosen to respect the dignity of the human life she now carries and nurtures," [...] the Archbishop said. [...] When the Archbishop's statement was read at a <b>special</b> <b>assembly</b> held in the church, students applauded, screamed and jumped out of their seats. [...] In his statement, Mahony noted that the parish's pastor, Msgr. Gallagher, and the school's principal [...] "were following in total good faith" [...] the guidelines of the archdiocese, but suggested that the school board formulate new guidelines. [...] Mahony emphasized that he was not condoning premarital sex, but recognizing that [...] "wounded human nature is vulnerable to failure and to sinfulness." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Mid-March, {{after the}} {{increasing}} disorder in Palestine and {{faced with the}} fear, later judged unfounded, of an Arab petrol embargo, the American administration announced the possible withdrawal of its support for the UN's partition plan and for the dispatching of an international force to guarantee its implementation. The US, instead, suggested that Palestine be put under UN supervision. On 1 April, the UN Security Council voted on the American proposal of a convocation of a <b>special</b> <b>assembly</b> intended to reconsider the Palestinian problem, a proposal for which the Soviets abstained from voting. This U-turn from the Americans caused concern and debate among Yishuv authorities, who could not, after the withdrawal of British troops, afford to face the Arab troops {{without the support of}} the USA. In this context, Elie Sasson, the director of the Arab section of Jewish Agency, and several other personalities, ended up convincing David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meyerson to advance a diplomatic initiative towards the Arabs. The job of negotiation was delegated to Joshua Palmon, who was prohibited from limiting the Haganah's liberty of action but was authorized to declare that 'the Jewish people were ready with a truce.' ...|$|E
