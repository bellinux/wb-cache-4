50|$|Another {{criticism}} {{of the system is}} that <b>splitline</b> districts sometimes divide and diffuse the voters in a large metropolitan area. This condition is most likely to occur when one of the first splitlines cuts through the metropolitan area. It is often considered a drawback of the system because residents of the same agglomeration are assumed to be a community of common interest. This is most evident in the <b>splitline</b> allocation of Colorado.|$|E
50|$|Like most {{automatic}} redistricting rules, {{the shortest}} <b>splitline</b> algorithm {{will fail to}} create majority-minority districts, for both ethnic and political minorities, if the minority populations are not very compact. This might reduce minority representation.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} {{of this method}} are that it allows {{a certain amount of}} human intervention to take place (thus solving the Colorado problem of <b>splitline</b> districting); it allows the borders of the district to follow existing jagged subdivisions, such as neighbourhoods or voting districts (something isoperimetric rules would discourage); and it allows concave coastline districts, such as the Florida gulf coast area. It would mostly eliminate bent districts, but still permit long, straight ones. However, since human intervention is still allowed, the gerrymandering issues of packing and cracking would still occur, just to a lesser extent.|$|E
40|$|Space shuttle {{solid rocket}} motor case {{assembly}} joints are sealed with conventional O-ring seals that are shielded from 5500 F combustion gases by thick layers of insulation and by special joint-fill compounds that fill assembly <b>splitlines</b> in the insulation. On {{a number of}} occasions, NASA has observed hot gas penetration through defects in the joint-fill compound {{of several of the}} rocket nozzle assembly joints. In the current nozzle-to-case joint, NASA has observed penetration of hot combustion gases through the joint-fill compound to the inboard wiper O-ring in one out of seven motors. Although this condition does not threaten motor safety, evidence of hot gas penetration to the wiper O-ring results in extensive reviews before resuming flight. The solid rocket motor manufacturer (Thiokol) approached the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field about the possibility of applying Glenn's braided fiber preform seal as a thermal barrier to protect the O-ring seals. Glenn and Thiokol are working to improve the nozzle-to-case joint design by implementing a more reliable J-leg design and by using a braided carbon fiber thermal barrier that would resist any hot gases that the J-leg does not block...|$|R
40|$|NASA {{has begun}} to {{evaluate}} solid-liquid hybrid propulsion for launch vehicle booster. A three-phase program was outlined to identify, acquire, and demonstrate technology needed to approximate solid and liquid propulsion state of the art. Aerojet has completed a Phase 1 study and recommends a solid-liquid staged combustion concept in which turbopump fed LO 2 is burned with fuel-rich solid propellant effluent in aft-mounted thrust chambers. These reasonably sized thrust chambers are LO 2 regeneratively cooled, supplemented with fuel-rich barrier cooling. Turbopumps are driven by the resulting GO 2 coolant in an expander-bleed-burnoff cycle. Turbine exhaust pressurizes the LO 2 tankage directly, and the excess is bled into supersonic nozzle <b>splitlines,</b> where it combusts with the fuel rich boundary layer. Thrust vector control is enhanced by supersonic nozzle movement on flexseal mounts. Every hybrid solid-liquid concept examined improves booster energy management and launch propellant safety compared to current solid boosters. Solid-liquid staged combustion improves hybrid performance by improving both combustion efficiency and combustion stability, especially important for large boosters. These improvements result from careful fluid management and use of smaller combustors. The study shows NASA safety, reliability, cost, and performance criteria are best met with this concept, wherein simple hardware relies on several separate emerging technologies, {{all of which have}} been demonstrated successfully...|$|R
40|$|On car exteriors, {{geometrical}} variation, {{stemming from}} the manufacturing process, can distort the visible relationships between parts, i. e. the split-lines. In the automotive industry, non-nominal visualization is often implemented {{as a part of}} early concept reviews. Visualizing the results from a Computer-Aided Tolerancing analysis in a virtual environment allows to evaluate what deviations will be visible to customers and whether they can have a negative influence on the perceived product quality. The geometry, colors and materials of parts make some split-lines more visually sensitive than others because on them, potential deviations are especially disturbing to the onlooker. Moreover, the visual sensitivity is influenced by the context of product interaction in terms of illumination, reflections and the observer's viewing angle. These factors need {{to be taken into account}} when determining tolerance levels to ensure that an industrial design concept will look good on ce produced. This paper presents a study of the influence split-line geometry and several visualization parameters have on the ability of test persons to identify geometrical deviations in a number of computer generated images. Additionally, eye-tracking was performed to identify what areas of the split-lines the test persons looked at while performing the task. The results confirm that the included <b>splitlines</b> are not equally sensitive to variation. Further, it is shown that the visualization settings indeed have an influence on the ability to detect variation but that the most sensitive settings differ between combinations of deviations and split-lines...|$|R
50|$|Input {{handling}} {{was moved}} into a library called libgii. Generic GGI code was in libgg, a sublib within libgii. The core graphic library, libggi, has a lightweight set of graphic primitives that was common enough to write any kind of graphic application, while higherlevel API went into other libraries on top of libggi. These were called GGI extensions. libggi support a set of targets, {{most of them were}} Linux specific: fbdev, X, aa, vcsa, terminfo and some pseudo targets such as tile, multi, palemu and trueemu. The GGI extensions featured higherlevel API. libggiwmh provides functionality for windowed only targets, at that time this was only X. libggimisc provided some basic stuff like vga <b>splitline.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} environmental {{debate of}} today forces vehicle manufacturers {{to develop new}} concepts with lower fuel consumption and emission levels than ever before. One way of reducing the fuel consumption {{is to improve the}} aerodynamic features of the vehicle. One source of drag is ascribed to the so-called cooling drag, which is defined as the resistance produced by the air passing through the underhood cooling system. A decreased amount of cooling air drag can result in substantial fuel consumption and emission reductions for heavy trucks. The objectives in this research is to quantify the possible reduction in drag as a consequence of a restricted cooling air intake area for a Volvo FH 16. Two approaches are used; the first method is to cover the grill area of the truck and the second method is to cover the cooling package. Two degrees of coverage exist in the study; the grill or the cooling system is either 100 % covered or covered up to the Air Condition (AC) condenser. Another study that is carried out is to investigate the influence of a closed <b>splitline.</b> The results are achieved by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the two commercial softwares ANSA and StarCCM+ are the tools used in this research. The results from the simulations show that it is preferable to cover the grill compared to cover at the cooling package. Covering the grill and <b>splitline</b> of the Volvo FH 16 results in a fuel consumption reduction of 2. 3 % compared to the original truck configuration. A trend that is clearly seen is that a closed <b>splitline</b> always decreases drag for all the tested truck configurations. Even though a closed grill is preferred compared to a closed cooling package, it can still be worth to develop a technical solution for covering the cooling package if no suitable technical solution can be found for covering the grill. The reduction in drag for a covered cooling package is still quite substantial. The case with fully covered cooling package shows a fuel consumption reduction of 1. 2 %. As a conclusion {{it can be said that}} restricting the cooling air intake area for the Volvo FH 16 can result in a substantial fuel consumption reduction...|$|E
40|$|In {{aerospace}} engine industry, large casted components are, {{because of}} sustainability considerations, {{being replaced by}} smaller parts that are welded together. This reduces weight because some parts can be made of lighter material. It also opens up for use of platforms. The division of a large component into smaller parts is called form division. The form division affects the geometrical robustness in the weld splitlines between the parts and thereby the weldability. By optimizing the robustness in weld splitlines, conditions for welding can be improved. A greedy algorithm for weld <b>splitline</b> division is described and exemplified on aerospace case studies...|$|E
40|$|An {{illustration}} of the possible magnitude of the transonic performance prediction problem is shown. These results derived from a careful and systematic set of tests run on a jet effects model, an aerodynamic and force model, and a pressure model, evaluated test techniques and wind tunnel effects. The results were then carefully compared with flight test data where significant discrepancies in zero-lift drag were observed. A vigorous review of the test techniques {{identified a number of}} potential error sources. Some of these were thought to be aircraft roughness and protuberances, tunnel anomalies, sting/model support corrections, and hot gas effects. In addition, there were questions on model metric <b>splitline</b> location and magnitude of corrections for scale and Reynolds number. Flight test inlet/engine characteristics were thought to differ, also, from those of the calibration settings in the ground facilities...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we look at}} various {{problems}} in wireless networking. First we consider two problems in physical-model networks. We introduce a new model for localisation. The model {{is based on a}} range-free model of radio transmissions. The first scheme is randomised and we analyse its expected performance. Then we introduce the concept of a <b>splitline</b> schedule. We conjecture that a certain class of schedules (the regular schedules) is optimal. We prove this for some restricted cases, but the general case remains open. Then we introduce the reverse-binary schedule and prove that it is within a constant factor of optimal. Next we consider the scheduling of wireless transmissions. We give an exact exponential-time algorithm for the Link Independent Set problem. Its branching rules are valid for arbitrary gain matrices, but designed {{to take advantage of the}} structure available in geometric instances. We prove a worst-case bound of O*(1. 888 ^n) on the runtime of the algorithm, but only under an assumption on the input. Next we experimentally demonstrate that this assumption is reasonable for random geometric instances and that, in fact, the effective branching factor of the algorithm is expected to be much better than 1. 888 on such instances. Finally we show that density is a meaningful structural parameter: experiments as well as theory tell us that the size of the optimal link independent set is closely tied the density of the instance. After these results for physical-model networks, we turn our attention to graphs. We introduce a model of recoverable routing in the presence of node failures. The model is based on the concept of backup nodes: for every node in the network, we assign a backup node that will take over in case the original node fails. These backup nodes are used to fix a route easily and locally. We resolve the basic algorithmic and complexity-related questions about this problem: some variants are polynomial-time solvable and others are NP-complete. For the former we give an O(n^ 4) -time algorithm. We give non-trivial exponential-time algorithms for the hard cases of the problem. Then we look at a variant of the problem where the basic path is given and we are merely asked to pick which node is backed up by which other node. Again we see that the problem has variants that are polynomial-time solvable and variants that are NP-complete. We give algorithms for all variants. Lastly, we look at a problem of energy-efficient data gathering in wireless sensor networks. We formalise a version of this problem and call it energy-constrained flow. We study, in particular, the integer version of the problem. We prove NP-hardness and hardness of approximation in various settings. Among other results, we show that the problem is strongly NP-complete on geometric configurations on a line. After these mostly-negative results, we present a column generation algorithm for the fractional relaxation of energy-constrained flow. It performs well and we demonstrate experimentally that this approach also leads to an effective heuristic for the integer problem. We finish the thesis with two algorithms with advantage, improving the best known approximation factor when restricted to st-planar networks...|$|E
