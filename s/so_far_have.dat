5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is known}} from {{hundreds}} of individual specimens, of which over 75 have been assigned to the type species, P. mongoliensis. All Psittacosaurus fossils discovered <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>have</b> been found in Early Cretaceous sediments in Asia, from southern Siberia to northern China, and possibly {{as far south as}} Thailand. The most common age of geologic formations bearing Psittacosaurus fossils is from the late Barremian through Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, or approximately 126 to 101mya (million years ago). Many terrestrial sedimentary formations of this age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of Psittacosaurus, leading to the definition of this time period in the region as the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E
5|$|There were {{considerable}} connections– political, trading, and cultural– {{between the}} Anglo-Saxon kingdoms {{and this is}} demonstrated in the burial ground found at Street House. The practice of burying people in beds {{seems to have been}} very uncommon in the north; most of the bed burials found <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>have</b> been in southern England, in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk, and Wiltshire. Several of the brooches and beads found in the graves are thought to have come from Kent and some of the jewellery and beadwork has strong parallels with finds from East Anglia. The Iron Age gold coins found in one grave came from a tribe that lived in the East Midlands, which suggests that their owner, likewise, was not local.|$|E

5|$|The {{types of}} {{coevolution}} listed <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>have</b> {{been described as}} if they operated pairwise (also called specific coevolution), in which traits of one species have evolved in direct response to traits of a second species, and vice versa. This {{is not always the}} case. Another evolutionary mode arises where evolution is still reciprocal, but is among a group of species rather than exactly two. This is called guild or diffuse coevolution. For instance, a trait in several species of flowering plant, such as offering its nectar {{at the end of a}} long tube, can coevolve with a trait in one or several species of pollinating insects, such as a long proboscis. More generally, flowering plants are pollinated by insects from different families including bees, flies, and beetles, all of which form a broad guild of pollinators which respond to the nectar or pollen produced by flowers.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the laws}} treated <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>have</b> been for {{conjunction}} and disjunction. These operations have the property that changing either argument either leaves the output unchanged or the output changes {{in the same way}} as the input. Equivalently, changing any variable from 0 to 1 never results in the output changing from 1 to 0. Operations with this property are said to be monotone. Thus the axioms <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>have</b> all been for monotonic Boolean logic. Nonmonotonicity enters via complement ¬ as follows.|$|E

25|$|Fiscal policy {{decisions}} <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>have</b> been mostly discretionary, {{as there is}} no explicit goal for fiscal policy. Looking forward, the question of a possible anchor for medium-term fiscal policy is worth exploring. Morocco's low social indicators and large infrastructure needs could justify an increase in social spending and public investment. Further, some nominal tax rates remain high by international standards, possibly warranting a lowering of some rates. At the same time, the relatively high level of public debt remains a constraining factor, particularly as heightened attractiveness to investors is a key component of Morocco's strategy of deepening its integration in the global economy.|$|E
