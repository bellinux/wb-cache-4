500|$|The {{range of}} the black catbird is small and dwindling further due to habitat loss. In 2008, the world {{population}} {{was estimated to be}} less than 50,000 and decreasing. Due to the speed of its decline, which is reported to have been [...] "precipitous" [...] on Caye Caulker between 2003 and 2008, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has assessed the species as near threatened. The late 20th century arrival of the <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird,</b> a brood parasite, into the Yucatán may cause problems for the black catbird as (based on past host choices) the catbird may become a target of the cowbird.|$|E
50|$|Deforestation has led {{to recent}} {{establishment}} of the <b>Shiny</b> <b>Cowbird</b> (Molothrus bonariensis) within the martinique oriole habitat.

40|$|Parasitic cowbirds and cuckoos {{generally}} {{reduce the}} clutch {{size of the}} hosts they parasitize by removing or destroying some of their eggs. <b>Shiny</b> <b>cowbirds</b> (Molothrus bonariensis) puncture their hosts' eggs both when parasitizing the nests and also {{when they do not}} parasitize them. We propose that, by puncturing the host's eggs, <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbirds</b> gain an informational benefit. They assess the degree of development of the host's embryos and so avoid laying in nests that would not provide enough incubation time for the parasitic eggs to hatch. Two predictions follow: (i) punctures should occur in advance or immediately before parasitic events, and (ii) the occurrence of parasitism should depend on the degree of development of the host's embryos when punctures occurred, i. e. on the stage of incubation. Both predictions are supported by our data of <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbirds</b> parasitizing yellow-winged blackbirds (Agelaius thilius). Egg punctures are not used to reset the host's nesting attempt when <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbirds</b> do not parasitize the nests. We discuss the potential mechanisms implicated in egg development assessment and propose a critical experiment to test this hypothesis...|$|R

5000|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a decline in both the {{population}} size and distribution, as the St. Lucia orioles have become more scarce and localized. They are currently classified as [...] "Near Threatened" [...] on the IUCN Red List with a population estimated at over 1,000 adults (although not drastically over). There are many factors that may pose a threat to the species. Potential hazards include habitat loss, pesticide spraying, and parasitism by <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbirds</b> (Molothrus bonariensis). More studies are needed to understand the effects they have on St. Lucia oriole populations.|$|R

50|$|The <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird</b> is a brood {{parasite}} {{that occasionally}} lays its {{eggs in the}} nest of white-rumped swallow. After a <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird</b> fledges, it exhibits behaviour that causes it to be fed more, much {{to the detriment of}} white-rumped swallow nestlings. About six percent of nests are affected by this. This swallow has been known to lose nests to the southern house wren, a subspecies of the house wren.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Avian brood parasites {{depend on}} other species, the hosts, {{to raise their}} offspring. During the {{breeding}} sea-son, parasitic cowbirds (Molothrus sp.) search for poten-tial host nests to which they return for laying {{a few days after}} first locating them. Parasitic cowbirds have a larger hippocampus/telencephalon volume than non-parasitic species; this volume is larger in the sex involved in nest searching (females) and it is also larger in the breeding than in the non-breeding season. In nature, female <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbirds</b> Molothrus bonariensis search for nests without the male’s assistance. Here we test whether, in association with these neuroanatomical and behavioural differences, <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbirds</b> display sexual differences in a memory task in the laboratory. We used a task consisting of finding food whose location was indicated either by the appear-ance or the location of a covering disk. Females learnt to retrieve food faster than males when food was associated with appearance cues, but we found no sexual differences when food was associated with a specific location. Our re-sults are consistent with the view that parasitism and its neuroanatomical correlates affect performance in memory tasks, but the effects we found were not in the expected direction, emphasising that the nature of avian hippocampal function and its sexual differences are not yet understood.

Incubation period for the host was 14 - 15 days, for the parasite 12 - 13 days, with nestling periods of 13 - 14 and 14 - 15 days respectively. Breeding season of host and parasite overlapped almost completety. In a better studied subsample of parasitized nests success for the host was 7, 70 % (ratio Fledglings//eggs of 3 / 39) and for the parasite 6, 45 % (2 / 31). Cowbirds punctured and removed host eggs.

40|$|A {{program to}} trap and remove <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbirds</b> (Molothrus bonariensis) was {{conducted}} during two successive passerine nesting seasons at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in eastern Puerto Rico. It sought to improve existing trapping techniques {{and to determine}} the effect cowbird removal has on the reproductive success of the endangered yellow-shouldered blackbird (Agelaius xanthomus). Decoy traps of two basic designs were used to capture 2449 cowbirds in 1162 trap-days (average 2. l/trap-day) in June-September 1985 and 850 cowbirds in 1571 trap-days (average 0. 5 /trap-day) in March-August 1986. The lower capture rate in 1986 suggests that cowbirds removed in 1985 were not being replaced during the non-trapping period. Trapping data from yellow-shouldered nesting areas in mangrove swamps indicated that cowbird capture rates were significantly higher (P= 0. 02) for large (14. 2 - 14. 8 m 3) traps than for smaller (4. 2 m 3) ones. The effect of cowbird removal on the nesting success of the yellow-shouldered blackbird could not be directly determined because only one nest could be found. Cowbird removal, however, greatly reduced parasitism rates of another parasitized species, the yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia) ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the costs}} to avian parents of rearing brood {{parasitic}} offspring, many species do not reject foreign eggs from their nests. We show that where multiple parasitism occurs, rejection itself can be costly, by increasing the risk of host egg loss during subsequent parasite attacks. Chalk-browed mockingbirds (Mimus saturninus) are heavily parasitized by <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbirds</b> (Molothrus bonariensis), which also puncture eggs in host nests. Mockingbirds struggle to prevent cowbirds puncturing and laying, but seldom remove cowbird eggs once laid. We filmed cowbird visits to nests with manipulated clutch compositions and found that mockingbird eggs {{were more likely to}} escape puncture the more cowbird eggs accompanied them in the clutch. A Monte Carlo simulation of this 'dilution effect', comparing virtual hosts that systematically either reject or accept parasite eggs, shows that acceptors enjoy higher egg survivorship than rejecters in host populations where multiple parasitism occurs. For mockingbirds or other hosts in which host nestlings fare well in parasitized broods, this benefit might be sufficient to offset the fitness cost of rearing parasite chicks, making egg acceptance evolutionarily stable. Thus, counterintuitively, high intensities of parasitism might decrease or even reverse selection pressure for host defence via egg rejection...|$|R
50|$|From 1973 {{until at}} least 1996, the species {{suffered}} a population decline in the Guánica State Forest. The primary reason for this decline was brood parasitism by the <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird</b> (Molothrus bonariensis).|$|E
50|$|It is a bird {{of forests}} and {{secondary}} growth which builds a deep cup nest suspended {{from a tree}} branch or vine. The typical clutch is three white eggs, which are marked with brown. This species is parasitised by the <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} one of the many hosts of the brood {{parasitic}} <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird</b> (Molothrus bonariensis).

50|$|The white-browed meadowlark {{builds a}} deep grass-lined open cup nest {{on the ground}} amongst tall grasses, with several nests often close together.

Juveniles and immature birds are brownish-black with underparts streaked with yellow or buff.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} open areas including cultivation and human habitation. This is a colonial breeder, with several deep, lined cup nests often {{being built in}} one tree. Two to four whitish eggs are laid. Incubation takes 12 days, with a further 14 to fledging. This species is sometimes parasitised by the <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird,</b> but is quite successful at rejecting the eggs of that species.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} found in open forests and {{secondary}} growth. The deep cup nest is made of stems and bark and lined with fine plant fibers; it is suspended by the rim from a side branch low in a tree. The typical clutch is two cream-colored eggs with a rufous wreath. The female incubates for 17 days with a further 15-17 to fledging. This species is parasitized by the <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss and the nest-parasitic <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird.</b> Most of its tiny known range, estimated at only 1 km2 by BirdLife International, is within the Yunguilla reserve, which, following the rediscovery of this species in 1998, {{was set up by}} the Jocotoco Foundation. Following intensive management, including the removal of cowbirds, the population of the pale-headed brush finch is currently increasing. Further increase, however, may be limited by a lack of suitable habitat.|$|E
50|$|The loss {{of feeding}} and {{breeding}} habitat and brood parasitism by the <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird</b> are among other threats that limit and endanger the yellow-shouldered blackbird populations. Natural predators, {{such as the}} pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus), also represent a threat, although minor, to the populations. These animals {{have been reported to}} steal eggs and young from nests and to also destroy or steal nesting materials which in many cases leaves the young as prey for the predators.|$|E
50|$|This swallow {{is found}} in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Its natural {{habitats}} are dry savanna, pastureland, the edge of forests, and subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland. It is classified as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Its population is increasing and it may benefit from the increase in availability of artificial nest sites. The <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird</b> is an occasional brood parasite of the white-rumped swallow.|$|E
50|$|The nest is a cup in a fork {{of a tree}} branch. The red-eyed vireo {{suffers from}} nest {{parasitism}} by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) {{in the north of}} its range, and by the <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird</b> (M. bonariensis) further south. Parasitism by Haemoproteus and trypanosomans might affect these birds not infrequently, as was noted in studies of birds caught in Parque Nacional de La Macarena and near Turbo (Colombia): though only three red-eyed vireos were examined, all were infected with {{at least one of these}} parasites.|$|E
50|$|They build {{a shallow}} open cup nest, some 9-10 cm wide and 7 cm high outside with a 7 cm wide by 4 cm deep cup, {{in a tree}} or some other secure spot. For nest material, it uses rootlets, thin twigs, and ferns. The clutch is two or three eggs. These have a {{background}} colour varying between whitish and dull olive and have dense dark brown flecks and blotches, heavier at the blunt end. They measure about 21-22 by 16 mm. This species is parasitised by the <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird</b> (Molothrus bonariensis).|$|E
50|$|The red-capped {{cardinal}} feeds on insects, rice and fruit. It is usually found in conspicuous pairs or family groups. If {{there is a}} well-marked breeding season, it extends {{over much of the}} year. The {{red-capped cardinal}} has been recorded to breed at least from June to September in northern South America but at Sacha Lodge at the Napo River (Ecuador) an adult was seen feeding a fledgling <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird</b> (a brood parasite) in late March. This suggests that breeding can also occur as early as February/March. There is no indication for a difference in breeding seasons between the red-capped and the masked cardinals.|$|E
5000|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in May and June. The nest is a {{cup-shaped}} structure about 17 cm in diameter, loosely woven out of dry grass and weed stems, and lined with rootlets. The eggs are pale blue with black, brown and lilac blotches and spots. The <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird,</b> a brood parasite, sometimes lays its egg in an oriole blackbird's nest. The incubation period is about 18 days and the incubation is done solely by the female. Both parents join in feeding the chicks with small invertebrates and frogs which are not regurgitated but brought whole to the nest in the parent's beak.|$|E

50|$|Like {{most other}} cowbirds, {{it is an}} obligate brood parasite, laying its eggs in the nests of many other bird species, such as (in Brazil) the {{rufous-collared}} sparrow and the masked water tyrant. The eggs are of two types, either whitish and unspotted, or pale blue or green with dark spots and blotches. The host’s eggs are sometimes removed, and if food is short their chicks may starve, but larger host species are less affected. The incubation period of 11-12 days is shorter than that of most hosts. Extermination of the <b>shiny</b> <b>cowbird</b> within the tiny range of the pale-headed brush finch {{has resulted in a}} population increase in this critically endangered species.|$|E
5000|$|The male {{velvet-fronted grackle}} grows to about 22 cm {{and the female}} about 19 cm. Both sexes are entirely black, with a slight bluish gloss on the dorsal surfaces. The {{feathers}} {{at the front of}} the crown are very short and dense, giving a velvet-like appearance at close quarters. The beak is short, conical and pointed, the iris is dark and the tail is long and somewhat rounded. The calls produced include a crackling [...] "chack" [...] and a whistling [...] "cheziit", and the song, sometimes sung at dusk from a perch, is a moderately-musical rapid gurgling sound.
