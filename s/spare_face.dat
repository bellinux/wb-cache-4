50|$|Acquired {{prosopagnosia}} {{can develop}} {{as the result}} of several neurologically damaging causes. Vascular causes of prosopagnosia include posterior cerebral artery infarcts (PCAIs) and hemorrhages in the infero-medial part of the temporo-occipital area. These can be either bilateral or unilateral, but if they are unilateral, they are almost always in the right hemisphere. Recent studies have confirmed that right hemisphere damage to the specific temporo-occipital areas mentioned above is sufficient to induce prosopagnosia. MRI scans of patients with prosopagnosia showed lesions isolated to the right hemisphere, while fMRI scans showed that the left hemisphere was functioning normally. Unilateral left temporo-occipital lesions result in object agnosia, but <b>spare</b> <b>face</b> recognition processes, although a few cases have been documented where left unilateral damage resulted in prosopagnosia. It has been suggested that these face recognition impairments caused by left hemisphere damage are due to a semantic defect blocking retrieval processes that are involved in obtaining person-specific semantic information from the visual modality.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence that face and object recognition are accomplished by distinct systems. For example, prosopagnosic patients show deficits in face, but not object processing, while object agnosic patients (most notably, patient C.K.) show deficits in object processing with <b>spared</b> <b>face</b> processing. Behaviorally, {{it has been}} shown that faces, but not objects, are subject to inversion effects, leading to the claim that faces are [...] "special". Further, face and object processing recruit distinct neural systems. Notably, some have argued that the apparent specialization of the human brain for face processing does not reflect true domain specificity, but rather a more general process of expert-level discrimination within a given class of stimulus, though this latter claim is the subject of substantial debate. Using fMRI and electrophysiology Doris Tsao and colleagues described brain regions and a mechanism for face recognition in macaque monkeys.|$|R

40|$|Background Williams {{syndrome}} (WMS) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 20 000 live births. Among other characteristics, WMS has a distinctive cognitive profile with <b>spared</b> <b>face</b> processing and language skills that contrasts with impairment in the cognitive domains of spatial cognition, problem solving and planning. It remains unclear whether individuals with WMS process faces using a featural strategy that focuses on features or a configural strategy that takes into consideration the contour of a face and spatial relations between features. Methods To investigate face processing in WMS, the tasks specifically probe unfamiliar face matching by using a design that includes manipulations in face presentation (thatcherised and non-thatcherised), face orientation (upright and inverted) and face valence (happy and neutral expression) in a match-to-target face recognition design. The sample consisted of 20 participants with WMS, 10 participants with non-specific developmental delay (IQ-matched) and 10 normal control participants (chronological age-matched). Results Similar to normal controls, WMS performed best when faces were presented upright. The results show while the WMS group did not perform {{as well as their}} typically developing counterparts, they did significantly better than the IQ-matched developmentally delayed group. WMS did not show an accuracy advantage for inverted faces commonly understood as an index for featural face processing, nor did they perform better on thatcherised inverted face conditions whereby featural processing is forced. Furthermore, no accuracy advantage was observed for positively valenced (happy) faces in the WMS group. Conclusion These results are consistent with previous work showing a configural face processing approach in WMS, a strategy that is also utilised by normal controls...|$|R

40|$|Problems with face {{recognition}} are frequent in older adults. However, the mechanisms involved {{have only been}} partially discovered. In particular, it is unknown to what extent these problems {{may be related to}} changes in configural face processing. Here, we investigated the face inversion effect (FIE) together with the ability to detect modifications in the vertical or horizontal second-order relations between facial features. We used a same/different unfamiliar face discrimination task with 33 young and 33 older adults. The results showed dissociations in the performances of older versus younger adults. There was a lack of inversion effect during the recognition of original faces by older adults. However, for modified faces, older adults showed a pattern of performance similar to that of young participants, with preserved FIE for vertically modified faces and no detectable FIE for horizontally modified faces. Most importantly, the detection of vertical modifications was preserved in older relative to young adults whereas the detection of horizontal modifications was markedly diminished. We conclude that age has dissociable effects on configural face-encoding processes, with a relative preservation of vertical compared to horizontal second-order relations processing. These results help to understand some divergent results in the literature and may explain the <b>spared</b> familiar <b>face</b> identification abilities in the daily lives of older adults...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackgroundBathing suit {{ichthyosis}} (BSI) is {{an uncommon}} phenotype {{classified as a}} minor variant of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). ObjectivesWe report a case of BSI in a 3 -year-old Tunisian girl with a novel mutation of the transglutaminase 1 gene (TGM 1). Case ReportThis infant had been born with a collodion membrane encasing her entire body. From the age of threemonths, brownish scaling was noted on the bathing suit area. Histology showed orthohyperkeratosis with acanthosis of the epidermis. The granular layer was normal, and the superficial dermis was mildly inflammatory, confirming a diagnosis of proliferating ichthyosis. Molecular analysis in the patient and her parents revealed the mutation I 304 F of TGM 1. Treatment with emollients and keratolytics partially improved the patient's skin condition. ConclusionsBathing suit ichthyosis is an uncommon phenotype unique in its topography, which involves the trunk but <b>spares</b> the <b>face</b> and extremities. Previous studies using molecular analysis have shown that BSI is caused mainly by mutations in TGM 1. Twenty missense mutations {{have been reported in}} BSI. Of these 20 missense mutations, nine occurred only in patients with the BSI phenotype and 11 were common to BSI and other types of ARCI. Until recently, there has been no genotype-phenotype correlation. Therefore, the same mutation of the transglutaminase 1 could result in either generalized ARCI or BSI. The present case demonstrates this phenotype in a White Tunisian patient with a novel mutation of TGM 1 (I 304 F) not previously reported in BSI...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{an overall}} {{consensus}} that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) entails atypical processing of human faces and emotional expressions, {{the role of}} neural structures involved in early facial processing remains unresolved. An influential model for the neurotypical brain suggests that face processing in the fusiform gyrus and the amygdala is based on both high-spatial frequency (HSF) information carried by a parvocellular pathway, and low-spatial frequency (LSF) information separately conveyed by a magnocellular pathway. Here, we tested the fusiform gyrus and amygdala sensitivity to emotional face information conveyed by these distinct pathways in ASD individuals (and matched Controls). During functional Magnetical Resonance Imaging (fMRI), participants reported the apparent gender of hybrid face stimuli, made by merging two different faces (one in LSF {{and the other in}} HSF), out of which one displayed an emotional expression (fearful or happy) and the other was neutral. Controls exhibited increased fusiform activity to hybrid faces with an emotional expression (relative to hybrids composed only with neutral faces), regardless of whether this was conveyed by LSFs or HSFs in hybrid stimuli. ASD individuals showed intact fusiform response to LSF, but not HSF, expressions. Furthermore, the amygdala (and the ventral occipital cortex) was more sensitive to HSF than LSF expressions in Controls, but exhibited an opposite preference in ASD. Our data suggest <b>spared</b> LSF <b>face</b> processing in ASD, while cortical analysis of HSF expression cues appears affected. These findings converge with recent accounts suggesting that ASD might be characterized by a difficulty in integrating multiple local information and cause global processing troubles unexplained by losses in low spatial frequency inputs...|$|R

40|$|Human visuoperceptual {{functions}} can {{be divided}} according to their neuroanatomical substrates: processing 'what' an object is depends largely on ventral occipitotemporal regions, whereas processing 'where' an object is relies more on dorsal occipitoparietal regions. Although much is known regarding the mature incarnation of this ventral/ dorsal dissociation, {{little is known about}} how it develops. The current study addressed this with two experiments that involved both typically-developing children and healthy adults, as well as adult individuals with Williams Syndrome (WS), a genetically-based neurodevelopmental disorder for which dissociations in ventral-dorsal stream processing have been reported. The first experiment examined behavioral performance on two matched tasks differing only in their instructions: attend to stimulus identity (face identity-matching; ventral stream) or to stimulus position (face location-matching; dorsal stream). The second experiment examined patterns of brain activation on these same tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) with each of the three populations. By virtue of including both typical adults and children (chronological age, CA, and mental age, MA, controls for the WS participants) in addition to WS participants, these experiments were well poised to provide both insight into the normal development of ventral and dorsal stream processing, and critical information regarding the integrity of these systems in WS. Thirty-three individuals with WS (age M̲ = 27. 2 years), 19 MA controls (age M̲ = 9. 0 years), and 24 CA controls (age ̲M̲ = 20. 7 years) participated in the behavioral experiment. Although overall, typical children (MA controls) responded less accurately and more slowly than adults (CA controls), like adults, their performance did not differ across the identity- and location-matching tasks. By contrast, WS participants showed a pronounced and selective deficit in location-matching when compared with MA controls, but comparable performance on identity- matching. This finding in WS provides empirical support for numerous reports of face processing skills that far exceed general spatial ability in WS. This dissociation is not observed during the course of normal development. Based on this finding, it was hypothesized that the subsequent brain imaging experiment would reveal differentially impacted function in the ventral and dorsal visual streams in WS when compared with typically- developing participants. In the second experiment, both cognitive and FMRI data were collected from a second set of participants: 15 with WS (age M̲ = 30. 1 years), 16 MA controls (age M̲ = 8. 9 years), and 17 CA controls (age M̲ = 31. 0 years; individually age- and gender-matched to the WS participants). In accordance with their cognitive profile (performance on both tasks that had not quite reached the level of CA controls) MA controls recruited many of the same regions as CA controls, but also differed from them in certain key task-related regions. These regions included the face-preferring temporal fusiform gyrus of the left hemisphere (LH) during identity-matching and superior parietal cortex in the LH during location- matching. Given that most critical task-related regions reside in the right hemisphere (RH) (RH fusiform gyrus for face discrimination, RH parietal cortex for location processing), these findings appear to reflect protracted maturation of task-sensitive regions in the nondominant hemisphere. When compared with profiles of activation in MA and CA controls, brain response in WS participants was abnormal. In accordance with their profound location- matching deficits, WS participants showed a striking lack of location-matching activation in parietal cortex, a finding that isconsistent with a dorsal stream deficit hypothesized in this disorder. However, at variance with hypotheses of <b>spared</b> <b>face</b> discrimination and ventral stream function in WS, the brain response was also abnormal for face identity-matching, even though cognitively, WS participants performed this task at the level of MA controls. Abnormalities in WS manifested as a poorly modulated response of the fusiform gyrus, a lack of response in the amygdala, and surprisingly, an abnormally heightened response in a portion of parietal cortex that was not engaged by the task in MA or CA controls. The latter two findings are of particular interest because they may relate to an unusually strong preference for face -to-face social interaction (often described as "hypersociability") that has been described in the WS populatio...|$|R
40|$|Amsterdam Aiport Schiphol (AAS) has the {{ambition}} of becoming Europe's cargo preferred airport. However, {{in addition to}} <b>facing</b> <b>spare</b> capacity for future growth, past research has shown key issues preventing it from reaching this goal. Some of these are truck waiting times, long throughput times and 1 st line warehouse efficiency. One of the logistical concepts aimed at solving these is a Fast Track (FT), based on the transshipment purpose of a cross-dock. The focus {{of this research is}} thus to answer: "How can the input and output distribution processes of a Fast Track (FT) at AAS facilitate a seamless flow {{in the context of a}} multi-actor environment?" Having conducted a thorough process analysis and literature review, different designs are proposed based on the airside distribution, the existence of FT storage and the push/pull nature of the system. A simulation study is conducted in Simio with the goal of understanding if the designs have an effect on the KPIs and if these are relevant. When contrasted to the single handler distribution, the multiple handlers one proved to positively impact lead time (LT), reducing it from 2. 3 to 1. 6 hours and decreasing variability by 50 %. The remaining designs are tested on this configuration and based on it, a design with storage and a push nature selected. The existence of storage affected LT whereas the Push designs positively impacted the landside KPIs. As a conclusion, the decision-making power needs to rest in the FT operator so that the dynamism of the push/pull logic can be sustained and as a consequence, stream and efficient operations ensured.
