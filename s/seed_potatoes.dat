25|$|In 1846, {{three-quarters of}} the harvest was lost to blight. By December, {{a third of a}} million {{destitute}} people were employed in public works. According to Cormac Ó Gráda, the first attack of potato blight caused considerable hardship in rural Ireland, from the autumn of 1846, when the first deaths from starvation were recorded. <b>Seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> were scarce in 1847. Little had been sown, so, despite average yields, hunger continued. 1848 yields would be only two-thirds of normal.

25|$|There were average {{crop yields}} in the 1847 harvest but too few <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> had been planted. Crowds began to throng the public works {{during the last}} months of 1846 and the start of 1847, which {{promoted}} exactly the social conditions for the spread of 'famine fever.' In late January and February, legislation called the Temporary Relief Act went through the British parliament; it became popularly known as the Soup Kitchen Act and occasionally as Burgoyne's Act. This system of relief was designed to deliver cheap food directly and gratuitously to the destitute masses. This system of relief would be terminated in September. The government also announced an additional change in the system of relief. After August 1847, the permanent Poor Law was to be extended and was to become responsible for providing relief and as a result, all relief would be financed by the local Poor Law rates. This put impossible loads on local poor rates, particularly in the rural west and south. With the mass emigration of the famine era, the horrors of the 'coffin ships' and 1847 have ever since been associated in the popular mind, according to James S. Donnelly.|$|E
40|$|Improved potato {{varieties}} {{can increase}} potato yields of smallholders, and thus contribute to food security improvement in Ethiopia. However, the uptake of these varieties by farmers {{is very limited}} so far {{and this is one}} of the causes of insufficient seed quality in the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> system in Ethiopia. The low uptake may be related to the high costs of recommended production methods for these varieties. The objective of this study was to formulate least-cost <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production methods for farmers in Ethiopia. The paper used integer linear programming to determine these least-cost <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production methods, using published data on the perceived contributions to seed tuber yield and quality of different cultivation and post-harvest management options, and calculated <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production cost data for the different options. For the potato-growing districts Jeldu and Welmera, several <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production methods were formulated from which farmers can choose an affordable method that will enable them to produce <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> with reasonable yield and quality levels. Results showed that yield and quality levels could be simultaneously improved at relatively low extra costs, for example, by applying recommended fertilizer rate combined with two fungicide applications. In both districts, most methods were robust to 50 % increases in the rental values of land, prices of seed, wage rates, and prices of agrochemicals. Findings can be used by potato development practitioners to advise farmers on the adoption of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> technologies that are compatible with their financial resources.

40|$|Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira, Unit of Seed Testing and Organic Production Control is {{responsible}} of the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> {{inspection and testing}} in Finland. The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production area was 1290 hectares year 2006. The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production is concentrated in the Nothern parts of Finland where the High Grade Region (Tyrnävä and Liminka in the Oulu region) {{for the production of}} <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> is located. Four generations of prebasic seed (class SS, S, SEE and SE), three generations of basic seed (class EC 1, EC 2 and EC 3) and one generation of certified seed (class A or B) are produced in Finland. The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> inspection schema of Finland includes several steps: the field inspection, the laboratory tests of potato cyst nematodes, bacterial ring rot, brown rot and potato virus and finally the visual tuber inspection. The field inspection, sampling and visual tuber inspection are done by the authorized inspectors. For prebasic and basic seed the inspectors make two official field inspections. For certified seed only one field inspection is needed. Official requirements are set for varietal purity, rogues, potato virus, black leg (Erwinia spp.) and Rhizoctonia. During the field inspection the background information as previous crop is checked. The soil sample for testing potato cyst nematodes is taken per each hectare. The potato cyst nematodes (Globodera sp.) are quarantine organisms and the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production is not possible on the field infected by the nematodes. In the autumn the tubers for winter tests in the laboratory are sampled. For bacterial ring rot a sample is 200 tubers/ha and for virus tests 200 tubers/field. Brown rot is tested as a survey of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production. The testing method for bacterial ring rot (Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus) and brown rot (Ralstonia solanacearum) is the immunofluorescense (IF) method based on the specific antibodies. These quarantine organisms are not accepted in the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production. The potato virus Y-, A-, X-, S-, M- and Potato Leaf Roll are tested once during <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> certification process usually as the prebasic seed. For the other <b>seed</b> classes the <b>potato</b> virus Y and potato virus A are tested. For certified <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> class A there is a list of varieties which are tested. The seed class B is not routinely tested. The testing method is ELISAtest. The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> companies need certificate labels before sorting and packing potatoes. A visual tuber inspection is done by the local inspectors. A sample of 400 tubers/ 50 tn is cut by knife and tubers are inspected one by one. There are requirements for soil, dry and wet rot, external blemishes, common scab, black scurf, skin spot and deep-pitted scab. The quarantine organisms or visual symtops of moptop virus or tobacco rattle virus are not accepted. If all steps of inspection and testing are according to legislation, the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> lot is officially certified and can be marketed as <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> to the farmers. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R

2500|$|Potato {{growth has}} been divided into five phases. During the first phase, sprouts emerge from the <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> and root growth begins.

In the third phase stolons develop from lower leaf axils on the stem and grow downwards {{into the ground and}} on these stolons new tubers develop as swellings of the stolon. This phase is often (but not always) associated with flowering. Tuber formation halts when soil temperatures reach hence potatoes are considered a cool-season crop. Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase, when the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers. At this stage, several factors are critical to yield: optimal soil moisture and temperature, soil nutrient availability and balance, and resistance to pest attacks. The final phase is maturation: The plant canopy dies back, the tuber skins harden, and their sugars convert to starches.|$|E

40|$|A low {{adoption}} of recommended <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> (Solanum tuberosum L.) technologies in Ethiopia {{could be due}} to a lack of alternative <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production methods compatible with farmers’ economic and agro-ecological conditions. A conjoint analysis (a technique used to measure relative contribution of product attributes) was conducted to elicit farmers’ opinions on management attributes that they believed to affect yield and quality of potato. The study involved interviewing 324 farmers who grew <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> in Jeldu and Welmera districts. The results showed that management attributes, such as storage method, hoeing combined with hill size, fertilizer rate (FR) and fungicide application (FA) frequency had larger effect on seed yield and quality than seed source, seed size, sprouting method, tillage frequency, and planting date. In both districts, using diffused light storage (DLS); hoeing twice, combined with big hills; and using recommended FR, combined with two FAs had significant positive effects on yield and quality of <b>seed</b> <b>potato.</b> In both districts, if all farmers switched to the best management attribute levels, potential increases in seed yield would be about two times the actual seed yield produced in 2010.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to show whether {{contract}} production between <b>seed</b> and food <b>potato</b> producers lessens market uncertainty, reduce welfare losses for both parties and increase efficiency in the entire potato chain. These problems were approached from the point of view of the principal-agent theory combined with different contract models. Results indicate that no contract model provided <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> producers with average positive net profits, and profitability ratios for <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> farms stayed below one. The results indicate that <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> producers trading on a fixed-price and pre-emptive market could sell their <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> for 13 per cent less than on a transaction market, but with equal net profits. The more consistent supply chain leads to less market uncertainty. If the food potato producer was not party to the contract, there was no marked decrease in market uncertainty.
