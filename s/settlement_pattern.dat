5|$|A high {{proportion}} of the Welsh population lives in smaller settlements: nearly 20% live in villages of less than 1,500 persons compared with 10% in England. Wales also has a relatively low proportion of its population in large settlements: only 26% live in urban areas with a population over 100,000; in comparison, nearly 40% of the English population live in urban areas larger than the largest in Wales. Another feature of the <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> in Wales is {{the share of the}} population living in the sparsest rural areas: 15% compared with only 1.5% in England.|$|E
5|$|In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials {{have been}} found on Arran, {{although}} not Bute and place name evidence suggests a <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. On the mainland coast there is cluster of Norse place names around Largs and an ornate silver brooch was found on a hillside near Hunterston that is of likely 7th-century Irish origin but with a 10th-century runic inscription. Five Hogback monuments found in Govan hint at Scandinavian enclaves inland.|$|E
5|$|Gaelic {{continued}} to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse settlement period, but place-name evidence suggests it had a lowly status. The obliteration of pre-Norse names is almost total. There is little continuity of style between Pictish pottery {{in the north and}} that of the early Viking period. The similarities that do exist suggests the later pots may have been made by Norse who had settled in Ireland, or by Irish slaves. In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials have been found on Arran, although not on Bute, and place-name evidence suggests a <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. There are numerous Manx Runestones and place names of Norse origin on the Isle of Man.|$|E

In this paper, we show how Maya <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> are logically and statistically self-similar. We demonstrate {{how to measure}} the fractal dimensions (or Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimensions) of several data sets. We describe nonlinear dynamical processes, such as chaotic and self-organized critical systems, that generate fractal patterns. As an illustration, we show that the fractal dimensions calculated for some Maya <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> {{are similar to those}} produced by warfare, supporting recent claims that warfare is a significant factor in Maya <b>settlement</b> <b>patterning...</b>|$|R
40|$|Using box-counting {{and spatial}} regression, this paper {{analyzes}} the morphological characteristics of coastal <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> and their spatial determinants, {{with a case}} of the Wen-Tai region on the Chinese eastern coast. Coastal <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns,</b> which reflect the interactions between people and the surrounding environment, can indicate the anthropogenic pressure sustained in the coastal zones. Characterization of <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> in coastal zones is definitely needed for coastal management. Results indicate that coastal <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> in the Wen-Tai region present significant fractal characteristics, and exhibit obvious spatial variations. The morphological characteristics of <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> are significantly correlated with the standard deviation value of elevation and slope, as well as percentage of loam soils. In particular, cities with greater relief amplitude, higher slope variability, and higher percentage of loam soils would present more complexity in form. Proximity to roads and rivers are insignificant determinants. Our study contributes {{to the understanding of the}} spatial determinants of the morphological characteristics of <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> in coastal zones. We argue that fractal dimension provides a useful tool to facilitate the identification of vulnerability hotspots for coastal studies...|$|R

5|$|Research at the Asummiut {{excavation}} site {{near the airport}} has uncovered the changing <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern,</b> exhibiting transition from the single-family dwellings to tiny villages of several families. The types of dwelling varied from tent rings made of the hides of hunted mammals, to stone hearths, with no evidence of communal living in larger structures. In contrast, there is evidence for reindeer hunting as a coordinated effort of either villagers or groups of more loosely related individuals, with gathering places in proximity of the hunting grounds being found. Despite recent advances in DNA research based on hair samples from the ancient Saqqaq migrants (which gives insight into their origin), {{the reason for the}} decline and subsequent disappearance of the culture are not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} 9th and 10th centuries make {{no mention of}} the Polan (Polanie) tribe. The closest thing would be the huge (400 gords) Glopeani tribe of the Bavarian Geographer, whose name seems to be derived from that of Lake Gopło, but archeological {{investigations}} cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake Gopło area. What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th-century Greater Poland, one around the upper and middle Obra River basin, one in the lower Obra basin, and another one west of the Warta River. There was the Gniezno area tribe, whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center: the Lech Hill of today's Gniezno. Throughout the 9th century, the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole in the cultural, or <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> sense. The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences, such as from the highly developed Moravian-Czech or Baltic Sea centers. Such separation was probably a positive factor by facilitating the efforts of a lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there, known as the Piast House, which resulted {{in the early part of}} the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic Polish state.|$|E

The town of Morón, which started as a community in 1750, survived on a basis of a limited, non-mechanized agricultural, and mostly sugar, production. The <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> that prevailed in the coastal areas and keys was that of squatters, people living in very poor, tach-roof, earth floor dwellings, usually not more than five houses together.|$|E

The settlement layouts broadly fall between two principal types. The first are those constructed in a traditional fashion, such as Radeşti, Vinţu de Jos, and Obreja. These show generally sunken houses in the Dacian manner, with some dwellings having evolved to becoming surface timber buildings. The second settlement layout followed Roman settlement patterns.|$|E

25|$|The Jarabarriu, {{the final}} stage of the Chavín Horizon, lasted from about 400 to 250 BCE. Chavín culture had a {{dramatic}} increase in population. The <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> changed to a proto-urban pattern, consisting of a center of lowland valley peoples and smaller satellite communities in the surrounding higher altitude areas. The culture showed specialization and social differentiation. The people who lived in the east at Chavín de Huantar are thought to have had lower prestige than the communities around the ceremonial center. A diverse and intense production of ceramics is suggested during the Jarabarriu phase, when the valley was heavily populated and the ceramic style more defined. Satellite communities also developed centers of production during this phase.|$|E
