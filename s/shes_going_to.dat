The Oregonian's reviewer thought the characters were too [...] "extreme," [...] {{felt that the}} narrative took too long <b>to</b> get <b>going,</b> and concluded that Shed's method of communicating in sentence fragments (often missing a verb or subject) difficult to comprehend. Nevertheless, while these elements were [...] "irritating", the reviewer concluded: [...] "he exasperation is worth it: There is something triumphant about a novelist who risks this much and manages {{to find his way}} home." [...] The same reviewer also found that some passages might make some readers queasy: [...] "Spanbauer's book, his second novel, is not for the squeamish (or Mormons without a sense of humor). The descriptions of love-making and violence done to the flesh are pretty graphic. Shed is a clear-eyed, unflinching observer, after all; and if someone is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have her legs amputated, <b>Shed</b> is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> report the dismembering in detail. That makes sense in terms of the character, but it can be heavy going for the sensitive." [...] The Los Angeles Times critic noticed a resemblance between Spanbauer's novel and other novels from several years earlier which attempted to shock with sex and violence, and wondered whether the novel was [...] "irresponsible" [...] in the age of AIDS.|$|R

5000|$|Chris {{was arrested}} for murder but {{eventually}} released, and the relationship suffered, with Bloomfield explaining: [...] "Rachel feels confused because she naively assumed everything {{would go back to}} normal post prison. And even though she knows it cant, its her way of coping ... Its more about not recognizing Chris because hes changed and that scares her." [...] Following Chris brain injury in 2013, the couple were at odds following an apparent personality change in Chris, Bloomfield explained, [...] "Rachel realises she has to start to get on board with Chriss new way of thinking. But everything he is doing is completely the opposite of what hed usually do. Rachel finds it really hard to relate to this new Chris ... Rachel thinks its fine for Chris to let his new ideas loose at home and she needs to accept that." [...] Chris suggested the couple have a baby, but according to Bloomfield, Rachel thought it was, [...] "a stupid idea. She cant have children and she doesnt want them. She had a terrible upbringing and isnt prepared to risk raising a child." [...] Instead Chris proposed to Rachel to which she declined, Bloomfield believed the two could work it out, [...] "I think love will prevail for the pair of them, but Rachels still <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be herself. <b>Shes</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> change for him. Shes making a choice to love him regardless of hows hes changed." [...] However, following a talk from Grace Kwan (Lynette Forday), Rachel herself proposed to Chris, to which he accepted. Only moments later, a bomb rigged by Josh Gallagher (Chris Tempest) under the influence of his hero syndrome, exploded, collapsing the deck underneath the couple and leaving their fate ambiguous as the season ended. The two characters survived the cliffhanger but Galvin noted the road <b>to</b> marriage was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "problematic" [...] as, [...] "Rachels a bit contemptuous of the idea of marriage, but .... Chris is fully into that sentimental idea of getting it put in writing". Bloomfield was surprised at the story liners decision to marry Rachel and Chris due to her previous resignation from the show as a result of Rachels no marriage sentiment, but was told that Rachel would go along with the marriage, [...] "to be with him and that means going along with what he wants." [...] Both Galvin and Bloomfield believed the intention of the marriage was to secure a long running relationship on the show and Bloomfield believed if they were to break up, it would be a [...] "bad pay-off" [...] to fans. The wedding episode aired in February 2014 with Harry serving as Chris best man and Harper (Ria Vandervis) acting as Rachels bridesmaid. Bloomfield enjoyed the way Rachel was engaged in the storyline, [...] "The whole premise of this storyline is that Rachel has never wanted to be a bride, never needed or wanted to get married. So when she finally concedes, shes the anti-bride. She goes Im not wearing white, Im not doing this or that." [...] Galvin believed the wedding episode dealt with very little drama as producers wanted one marriage that was, [...] "happy". Galvin also believed Chris and Rachels marriage was Chris most believable, due to he and Bloomfields long lasting friendship. In late 2014 the couple broke up following the revelation Chris knew his baby daughter had not miscarried. Rachel began an affair with Garrett Whitley (Spencer Falls) but Galvin believed Chris was determined to win her back, [...] "He has decided that Rachel is the great love of his life and, for that reason he .... is convinced if he just preserves for long enough she will come to her senses and fall into his arms." ...|$|R

At {{the end of the}} month, Stephen Amell was cast in the titular role of Oliver Queen. When developing the series, producer Marc Guggenheim expressed that the creative team wanted to [...] "chart their own course, their own destiny", and avoid any direct connections to Smallville, which featured its own Green Arrow/Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley), opting to cast a new actor in the role of Oliver Queen. Unlike with Smallville, the series does not initially feature super-powered heroes and villains. Instead, the creative still took inspiration from Smallville, as one of the main themes of Arrow was to [...] "look at the humanity" [...] of Oliver Queen, as Smallville had done with Clark Kent. The decision not to include superpowers was, in part, based on the executives desire to take a realistic look at the characters in this universe. The series was given a full season pick up on October 22, 2012. [...] "I think the idea is to‚Äînot all the time, and not with a set regularity‚Äîbut I think it is critical to explore how he went from the person that he was when he left the island‚Äîwhich is extremely different: hes spoiled, hes entitled, hes a bit of a jerk‚Äîand he comes off it something very, very different.
