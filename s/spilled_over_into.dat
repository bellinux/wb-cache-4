5|$|The Bonvilleâ€“Courtenay feud of 1455 engendered {{a series}} of raids, sieges, and attacks between two major Devon families, the Courtenays and the Bonvilles, in south west England, in the mid-fifteenth century. One of many such aristocratic feuds of the time, it became entwined with {{national}} politics due to the political weight of the protagonists. The Courtenay earls of Devon were the traditional powerbrokers in the region, but by this time a local baronial family, the Bonvilles, had become more powerful and rivalled the Courtenays for royal patronage. Eventually this rivalry <b>spilled</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> physical violence, including social disorder, murder and siege.|$|E
5|$|These growing {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis finally <b>spilled</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> open war in 1167, {{triggered by a}} trivial argument over how money destined for the Crusader states of the Levant should be collected. Louis allied himself with the Welsh, Scots and Bretons, and the French king attacked Normandy. Henry responded by attacking Chaumont-sur-Epte, where Louis kept his main military arsenal, burning the town {{to the ground and}} forcing Louis to abandon his allies and make a private truce. Henry was then free to move against the rebel barons in Brittany, where feelings about his seizure of the duchy were still running high.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigated how and {{for whom}} experiences of the workday <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> relationship functioning at home. Two correlational studies and one experimental study were conducted among Dutch dual-earners with children. Moderated mediation analyses showed that work demands <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> relationship behavior through the depletion of temporary self-regulatory resources and subsequently a decrease in psychological availability for the partner. Whether work demands <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> relationship behavior was dependent on dispositional self-control in that evidence for negative spillover was only found for individuals low in dispositional self-control. The experimental study showed that the induction of gratitude for the partner after the workday helped individuals low in dispositional control to prevent negative spillover into the partner relationship...|$|R
5|$|King Charles's Castle {{was built}} between 1548 and 1551 {{to protect the}} Scilly Isles against French attack. Tensions with France had grown {{during the reign of}} Henry VIII and <b>spilled</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> war in 1538. Henry {{initially}} responded by fortifying the coasts of England, constructing new artillery forts designed to defend against the longer-range cannons that were becoming common in the 16th century. Henry's son, the nine-year-old Edward VI, inherited the throne in 1547, facing renewed war with France. Edward Seymour was made the Lord Protector to the King, and he appointed his brother, Thomas, as England's Lord Admiral. Thomas inspected the Scilly Isles personally and concluded that they were vulnerable to a French invasion.|$|E
5|$|Trade unionists Vernon Hartshorn and George Barker were vocal {{supporters}} of the suffrage movement, while James Grant a socialist propagandist and keen seller of The Suffragette was imprisoned for five days after being arrested for obstruction while lecturing in Treorchy Square. Mary Keating Hill, a forty-year old wife of a Cardiff insurance manager, spent three weeks in jail for resisting the police and disorderly conduct. She {{had been given a}} similar conviction days prior but her brother paid the fine; but she was determined to be imprisoned. On 21 November 1911, after the failure of the Conciliation Bill, anger <b>spilled</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> direct action and 223 suffragettes were arrested during a campaign of window smashing. Among the arrests were seven women with Welsh connections, including Edith Mansell Moullin, Mildred Mansell, the sister of Ivor Guest, MP, and Janet Boyd, sister of Sybil Thomas.|$|E
5|$|The Lowell female textile workers {{continued}} to petition the Massachusetts Legislature and legislative committee hearings became an annual event. Although the initial {{push for a}} ten-hour workday was unsuccessful, the LFLRA {{continued to}} grow, affiliating with the New England Workingmen's Association and publishing articles in that organization's Voice of Industry, a pro-labor newspaper. This direct pressure forced the Board of Directors of Lowell's textile mills to reduce the workday by 30 minutes in 1847. The FLRA's organizing efforts <b>spilled</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> other nearby towns. In 1847, New Hampshire became {{the first state to}} pass a law for a ten-hour workday, although there was no enforcement and workers were often requested to work longer days. By 1848, the LFLRA dissolved as a labor reform organization. Lowell textile workers continued to petition and pressure for improved working conditions, and in 1853, the Lowell corporations reduced the workday to eleven hours.|$|E

5|$|The Nevilles {{were one}} of four major landowners in the north, along with Richard, 3rd Duke of York, the Crown (as the Duke of Lancaster), and the Percy family, who were the Earls of Northumberland. York and the King, however, were {{effectively}} absentee landlords so any tension would have existed solely between the Percys and the Nevilles. By 1453, this tension seems to have <b>spilled</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> outright violence, with Thomas and his brother John actively seeking out the younger sons of the Earl of Northumberland (the hotheaded Thomas, Lord Egremont {{and his younger brother}} Sir Richard Percy) and their retainers. It was Thomas Neville's wedding party, returning from Cromwell's Tattershall Castle, that was attacked by Egremont at Heworth, York on 24 August 1453 as the Nevilles returned to Yorkshire with his new bride, by a Percy force of supposedly 5,000 men. There were to be further encounters before the Percys were defeated at Stamford Bridge on 31 October 1454, when the Percy brothers, Egremont and Sir Richard, were ambushed by Thomas and John Neville and subsequently imprisoned in Newgate.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} <b>spilled</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> {{the next}} Australian season when an English team formed by Alfred Shaw, James Lillywhite and Arthur Shrewsbury toured. A disagreement between Alexander and Lillywhite led {{to members of}} the Fourth Australians refusing to play against the tourists in certain matches and then being banned by the colonial authorities from playing in others. Having agreed contracts for matches with the colonial authorities, Lillywhite offered Alexander 30% of the gate receipts from the first two Tests, but Murdoch {{and the rest of the}} team insisted on 50%. One outcome was that Australia had to make eleven changes to their team for the second Test after terms could not be agreed with the Fourth Australians. The Fourth Australians had made up the team in the first Test but refused to play in the second Test in which nine debutants were necessary alongside Tom Horan and Sammy Jones.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decade}} out of politics, Willis was chosen without {{opposition}} as the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1943. Infighting among the state's Democrats combined with Willis's popular proposal {{to eliminate the}} state income tax carried him to a narrow victory over J. Lyter Donaldson. Willis was opposed by Democratic majorities {{in both houses of}} the Kentucky General Assembly. The end of World War II in 1945 brought sizable budget surpluses to the state, and disagreements over how to spend the excess funds <b>spilled</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> special legislative sessions. Willis was not able to realize his campaign promise of eliminating the state income tax because the legislature expanded the budget far beyond what he proposed. Nevertheless, he was able to forge a record of modest accomplishments, including constructing five tuberculosis hospitals across the state and significantly increasing funding for education. Following his term as governor, he served on various state boards and commissions, but failed in his only attempt to return to elective officea 1952 campaign against Bert T. Combs to return to the Court of Appeals. Willis died on April 1, 1965, and is interred at Frankfort Cemetery in the capital city of Frankfort.|$|E

5|$|Society and {{government}} in England {{in the early}} 14th century were challenged by the Great Famine and the Black Death. The economic and demographic crisis created a sudden surplus of land, undermining the ability of landowners to exert their feudal rights and causing a collapse in incomes from rented lands. Wages soared, as employers competed for a scarce workforce. Legislation was introduced to limit wages and to prevent the consumption of luxury goods by the lower classes, with prosecutions coming to take {{up most of the}} legal system's energy and time. A poll tax was introduced in 1377 that spread the costs of the war in France more widely across the whole population. The tensions <b>spilled</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> violence in the summer of 1381 {{in the form of the}} Peasants' Revolt; a violent retribution followed, with as many as 7,000 alleged rebels executed. A new class of gentry emerged as a result of these changes, renting land from the major nobility to farm out at a profit. The legal system continued to expand during the 14th century, dealing with an ever-wider set of complex problems.|$|E

25|$|The {{trend to}} {{increasing}} gasification and electrification continued {{at the turn}} of the 20th century. In industry, it was the phase of work process optimization. Taylorism was born, and time-motion studies were used to optimize processes.

25|$|Following {{the death}} of Manuel I in 1180, his widow, the Latin princess Maria of Antioch, acted as regent to her infant son Alexios II Komnenos.

Philadelphia City's recent influx of immigrants <b>spilled</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> the rest of Philadelphia County surging the area's population.
