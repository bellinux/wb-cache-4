50|$|Predation is {{considered}} to be top-down because these interactions decrease the population, but the closeness of the interactions of species directly effects the availability of resources causing the population to also be affected by bottom-up controls. Without <b>soil</b> <b>fauna,</b> microbes that directly prey upon competitors of plants and plant mutualists, interactions within the rhizosphere would be antagonistic toward the plants. <b>Soil</b> <b>fauna</b> provide the top-down component of the rhizosphere while also allowing for the bottom-up increase in nutrients from rhizodeposition and inorganic nitrogen. The complexity of these interactions have also been shown through experiments with common <b>soil</b> <b>fauna,</b> such as nematodeas and protists. Predation by bacterial-feeding nemaotodes was shown to influences nitrogen availability and plant growth. There was also an increase in the populations of bacteria in which nematodes were added. Predation upon Pseduomonas by Amoeba shows predators are able to upregulate toxins produced by prey without direct interaction using supernatant. The ability of predators to control the expression and production of biocontrol agents in prey without direct contact is related to the evolution of prey species to signals of high predator density and nutrient availability.|$|E

We investigated changes in <b>soil</b> macro <b>fauna</b> along a ridge {{and at the}} bottom of a slope in Ashiu Experimental Forest, a cool temperate natural forest in central Japan, in which the flora, fauna, microflora, and ecosystem functions were studied before the Sika-deer (Cervus nippon) population increased. The abundance and biomass of soil macrofaunal detritivores (earthworms, isopods, amphipods, and diplopods) and predators (opilionids, Araneae, and chilopods) were adversely affected both along the ridge and at the slope bottom. These results are consistent with prior studies conducted with deer exclosures or natural experiments. The soil organic matter distribution, the carbon-nitrogen ratio in the litter and mineral layers, and soil hardness along the slope also changed. These results suggest that deer overabundance affects ecosystem functions along the slope. The movement of litter and soil along the slope, and the reduction of <b>soil</b> macro <b>fauna</b> associated with decomposition possibly contributed to these changes. 温帯におけるシカ類の密度の増大が、広範な植物相と動物相、生態系プロセスに影響することが示されてきた。我々はニホンジカ(Cervus nippon) の増加以前の土壌動物相の知見が蓄積されている京都大学芦生演習林(中部日本) において、斜面の尾根部と谷部において大型土壌動物相を調査して過去のデータと比較した。過去と現在の間の変化は尾根と谷とで類似しており、腐植食者のミミズ類、等脚類、端脚類、倍脚類と、捕食者であるイシムカデ類、ジムカデ類、クモ類、ザトウムシ類が個体数や現存量に負の影響を受けていた。尾根部で地表排徊性甲虫の密度が増加していた。我々の大型土壌動物に関する結果は排除柵や自然の実験を用いた、有蹄類が土壌動物に及ぼす影響に関する先行研究の結果によく一致するものであった。同じ期間に斜面における有機物土壌の分布と、表層リターおよび土壌におけるC/N比、土壌硬度が顕著に変化しており、シカが生態系機能に影響を与えていることが示唆された。斜面上の有機物の移動や分解者としての土壌動物相の減少がこの変化に寄与した可能性がある...|$|R
