5|$|Prior to a 2006 {{match against}} Arminia Bielefeld in Munich, Michael Rensing {{peppered}} Kahn with practice shots. One shot hit Kahn <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> the eye, causing enough swelling and discoloration {{to keep him}} from playing. With Rensing in goal, Bayern Munich won the match 2–0.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Old Court – New Court controversy, Kentucky's {{politicians}} became divided between the Democrats and the National Republicans. Crittenden's alliance with Henry Clay and his own personal political views put him <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> the National Republican Party. Because of Crittenden's support of his presidential bid, President Adams appointed him United States district attorney for the district of Kentucky in 1827. In 1828, Adams nominated him to replace Kentuckian Robert Trimble as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, but Jackson supporters in the Senate refused to confirm him. When Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, he removed Crittenden from his post as district attorney because of his association with Clay and his opposition to Jackson's financial policies.|$|E

5|$|Rock {{and roll}} {{developed}} out of country, blues, and R Rock's exact origins and early influences have been hotly debated, {{and are the}} subjects of much scholarship. Though <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> the blues tradition, rock took elements from Afro-Caribbean and Latin musical techniques. Rock was an urban style, formed in the areas where diverse populations resulted in the mixtures of African American, Latin and European genres ranging from the blues and country to polka and zydeco. Rock and roll first entered popular music through a style called rockabilly, which fused the nascent sound with elements of country music. Black-performed rock and roll had previously had limited mainstream success, {{but it was the}} white performer Elvis Presley who first appealed to mainstream audiences with a black style of music, becoming one of the best-selling musicians in history, and brought rock and roll to audiences across the world.|$|E
5|$|The Bruges {{exhibition}} {{renewed interest}} in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. Johan Huizinga was the first historian to place Netherlandish art <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court. Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting {{the large number of}} mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.|$|E
5|$|The college {{remained}} {{associated with}} Lancashire and Cheshire, {{with a particular}} preference for those from Prestbury and Prescot, the founders' birthplaces. This was also reflected in early benefactors. These included the donation of John Port, serjeant-at-law, for two fellowships for natives of Chester in 1522; that of William Clyfton, the sub-dean of York, for residents of York, Lincoln and Nottingham in 1538; and for the Brian Higden, Dean of York, who sponsored a fellowship for those in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire in 1549. Another notable benefactor during this period was John Claymond, the first President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, who in 1538 gave funds to maintain six scholars at Brasenose, provided that their lectures on humanity and Greek take place at his own college. Only in 1572 was a Lectureship in Greek established at Brasenose, symptomatic of a conservatism that attached Brasenose to a monastic teaching style that was increasingly problematic during the reformation. By {{the end of the}} sixteenth century, however, the college did boast lectureships ("public readerships") in the new disciplines of logic and natural philosophy. By 1547, the income of the college had increased to almost £200 yearly, with an endowment that placed it <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> the midst of other colleges in size; it did, however, make a yearly loss.|$|E

5000|$|Justice Stevens wrote {{a lengthy}} dissenting opinion. Among his {{disagreements}} {{with the majority}} was the statement that incorporation was not at issue in this case. Citing Cruikshank, Stevens wrote, [...] "The so-called incorporation question was <b>squarely</b> and, <b>in</b> my view, correctly resolved in the late 19th century." [...] In addition, he argues against incorporation, taking issue with the methodology of the majority opinions.|$|R

25|$|While {{steering}} {{into the}} skid (away from the pursuing vehicle) will reduce its effect, {{the fact that}} the pursuing car is continuing to push the rear of the target sideways virtually ensures loss of control of the targeted vehicle. By moving forward out of position, or by staying <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> front of the PIT unit the lead vehicle can disallow the PIT unit from gaining proper positioning to conduct the maneuver. Alternatively, rapid deceleration will, of course, force the PIT unit to overshoot the required positioning.|$|E
25|$|Britain quickly {{went back}} on this {{unofficial}} part of the agreement, attacking Kowloon Walled City in 1899, only to find it deserted. They did nothing with it, or the outpost, and thus posed the question of Kowloon Walled City's ownership <b>squarely</b> up <b>in</b> the air. The outpost consisted of a yamen, as well as buildings which grew into low-lying, densely packed neighbourhoods from the 1890s to 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} genre writers of the 1930s, who also blended genres with deceptive facility, was Pierre Véry, whose mystery novels always incorporated surreal or supernatural elements. Some of his works <b>squarely</b> belonged <b>in</b> the fantasy genre, such as Le Pays sans Étoiles Starless Country (1945) and Tout Doit Disparaître le 5 Mai Must Go On May 5 (1961), a collection of fantastic tales.|$|R

From the valley, it is easy to understand how it came to be seen as the highest peak in the Catskills, since there are no higher peaks close to it. It is bracketed by the only two gaps in the Escarpment — Platte Clove to the south and Kaaterskill Clove to the north.|$|E
25|$|Louis Fles {{was born}} in Maassluis, Netherlands on October 19, 1871 to Jewish parents. His father, Jacob Levie Fles, worked as a diamond cutter, and his mother, Saartje van Blijdestein, ran a hosiery shop, placing young Louis <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> the newly {{expanding}} merchant class. After his father died in 1873 his mother married a man named Swaab. Upon his mother's death in 1878, Louis was taken in and raised by his stepfather's family. As a successful business owner himself, Swaab took the young Louis into his company shortly after the boy had completed primary school.|$|E

The {{situation}} soon became desperate, the forward brigades were almost totally destroyed, and the reserves moving up were swamped. The division's field guns in the forward zone were captured after firing over open sights at the advancing Germans. The line was held by rear details, including the gunners using rifles and Lewis guns. Only two batteries of 59th Divisional Artillery escaped, remaining in action for the next four days under the command of 40th Division, {{during the rest of the}} Battle of St Quentin and the Battle of Bapaume.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 3rd century, major {{problems}} were evident. A series of debasements of the imperial currency had undermined confidence in the coinage, and even the government itself was contributing to this by demanding more and more irregular tax payments in kind, which it channeled directly to the main consumers, the army personnel. Local administration by the councils was careless, recalcitrant, and inefficient; the evident need for firm and purposeful reform had to be <b>squarely</b> faced <b>in</b> the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine I.|$|R

50|$|In {{opposition}} to the Justice Nachura’s original ponencia, Justice Reynato Puno made a very exhaustive discussion on {{the implications of the}} original ruling. The new Decision stressed that the doctrine of substantial distinction in Fariñas was not an obiter dictum because the seemingly unfair treatment caused by the repeal of sec. 67 and retention of sec. 66 was <b>squarely</b> raised <b>in</b> that case. Thus, the discussion on substantial distinction between appointive and elected officials was not merely incidental, but was actually necessary for the determination of that case.|$|R
25|$|On 29 December 1891, the Inishtrahull was {{involved}} in a collision with an Irish sailing vessel from Dublin named the Maggie. The collision occurred in the Irish Sea, just off the Kish Bank. It was found in an investigation afterwards that the fault laid <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> the hands of the second officer of the Inishtrahull, who left the bridge without a competent officer in charge (a carpenter was left alone on the bridge). After the collision the second officer was suspended from duty for two years. As all the crew had been evacuated and the vessel was taking on water, the Maggie was believed to have sunk somewhere around the Kish Lighthouse.|$|E
25|$|With Roses {{out of the}} way, Saint-Cyr {{was free}} to direct his {{energies}} to the relief of Barcelona. After assigning Reille to hold Figueras and Roses {{and to protect the}} roads from France, Saint-Cyr had about 1,500 horsemen and 15,000 foot soldiers in three divisions of 26 total battalions. Girona (Gerona) stood <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> the path that the French army would have to take. The French general knew that besieging Girona was out of the question; in the time it would take to capture the place, Barcelona would be starved out. Once past Girona, there were two available roads. Knowing that the coast road via Mataró was obstructed and could easily be placed under the guns of the British Royal Navy, Saint-Cyr chose to use the inland road. In order for his plan to work, the Imperial general hoped to keep Vives guessing as to his true intentions and to defeat his opponent in detail.|$|E
25|$|When Blücher {{heard about}} Olsufiev's disaster, he ordered Kaptzevich and Kleist {{to turn around}} and make a night march back to Vertus. Sacken, who had marched west to Trilport, was ordered to return to Montmirail. Yorck was {{requested}} to meet Sacken near Montmirail while holding open an escape route over the Marne at Château-Thierry. After the battle, Napoleon found himself <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the overextended Army of Silesia. If he advanced to the east, he would merely push the corps of Kaptzevich and Kleist back. A move to the west held the possibility of trapping and destroying the forces under Sacken and Yorck, so he turned west. Napoleon ordered Marmont with Lagrange's division and the I Cavalry Corps to hold Étoges and keep Blücher under observation. At 7:00 pm the emperor directed Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty with two cavalry divisions to occupy Montmirail. They were to be joined there in the morning by Ricard's division and the divisions under Ney and Mortier. The Battle of Montmirail was fought the next day against Sacken and Yorck.|$|E

5000|$|Ka statues {{were usually}} carved from wood or stone and {{sometimes}} {{painted in the}} likeness of the owner to reinforce the spiritual connection and preserve the person's memory for eternity. Many ka statues were placed in a purpose-built mortuary chapel or niche, which could be covered with appropriate inscriptions. [...] Like most ancient Egyptian statuary, ka statues display a rigid frontalism in which the body faces <b>squarely</b> forward <b>in</b> a formal way. Whether seated or standing, their posture reflects {{the need for the}} statue to [...] "see" [...] the real world {{in front of them and}} conform to an ideal standard of beauty and perfection.|$|R
50|$|The Inmaculado Corazón de María Church is <b>squarely</b> located <b>in</b> the colonia. It {{was begun}} in 1887 and {{designed}} by engineer Ismael Rego in Neo-Gothic style. It was finished in 1902. Originally, {{it was supposed}} to have three naves, but only one was constructed. For this reason, the building is out of proportion. Despite its stone columns and iron arches, it was severely damaged in the earthquake of 1957, which separated the south wall from the vault. This damage was never repaired, so when the earthquake of 1985 occurred, part of the building completely collapsed. Government authorities decided to demolish the rest of the church and rebuild it, keeping the old facade and towers which had not been damaged significantly.|$|R
25|$|When Victor saw {{the success}} of his right wing, he ordered Villatte's left wing brigade under General of Brigade Michel-Marie Pacthod to attack the Spanish right flank. Since many of the {{defending}} units had been sent to the left, Pacthod's assault easily {{reached the top of the}} ridge. Shaken by the obvious reverse on the left flank, the right flank troops offered little resistance. Soon, Venegas's entire force was retreating from the field. The cavalry seems to have fought hardly at all leaving only two or three battalions under General Pedro Agustín Girón to act as the rear guard. Meanwhile, Ruffin's division lost its way and made a wider march than intended. Though Ruffin was late to the field, he and his troops fortuitously arrived <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> the Spanish rear. Latour-Maubourg's pursuing dragoons drove Venegas' hapless soldiers right into the arms of Ruffin's nine battalions. The nimble Spanish cavalry largely escaped along with some left flank infantry, while Girón's men broke out between two French regiments. But the majority of the Spanish foot soldiers were trapped and forced to surrender.|$|E
25|$|Some {{musicians and}} acts have been {{classified}} as cyberpunk {{due to their}} aesthetic style and musical content. Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more <b>squarely</b> <b>in</b> the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include Psydoll, Front Line Assembly, Clock DVA and Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Albums such as Gary Numan's Replicas, The Pleasure Principle and Telekon were heavily inspired by the works of Philip K. Dick. Kraftwerk's The Man-Machine and Computer World albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. Nine Inch Nails' concept album Year Zero also fits into this category. Fear Factory concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. Billy Idol's Cyberpunk drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the cyberdelic counter culture in its creation. 1. Outside, a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by David Bowie, was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including Sonic Youth, whose albums Sister and Daydream Nation take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively.|$|E

5000|$|We {{agree with}} appellants that the Procedures Act {{requires}} {{the agency to}} explain why it rejects their proposed health claims—to do so adequately necessarily implies giving some definitional content to the phrase [...] "significant scientific agreement." [...] We think this proposition is <b>squarely</b> rooted <b>in</b> the prohibition under the APA that an agency not engage in arbitrary and capricious action. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (1994). It simply will not do for a government agency to declare—without explanation—that a proposed course of private action is not approved. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) ("The agency must ... articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action...."). To refuse to define the criteria it is applying is equivalent to simply saying no without explanation. Circuit Judge Silberman ...|$|R
40|$|A close {{examination}} of Genesis 20 shows {{that the concept of}} prophet, which is mentioned {{for the first time in}} this chapter, is emphasised in three ways. First, God actively creates a new office – that of prophet. Second, he specifically gives a job description – that of intercessor. Third, he <b>squarely</b> sets <b>in</b> place a model – one that all subsequent prophets, prophetesses, and prophesies in some way follow and build upon. Significantly, Genesis 20 gives no indication that Abraham sought the designation of prophet or knew in advance it was coming. Abraham’s new office emphasises God’s sovereignty. Starting with Genesis 20, God establishes a pattern of maintaining for Himself the right first to choose Israel’s prophets and later to choose its judges and kings. This article argues that Chapter 20 provides a ten-point foundation for the work of the prophet that the Hebrew Bible enlarges on in later books...|$|R
