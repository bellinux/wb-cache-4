25|$|Quicksand forms {{when water}} {{saturates}} {{an area of}} loose sand and the ordinary sand is agitated. When the water trapped in the batch of sand cannot escape, it creates liquefied soil that can no longer <b>support</b> <b>weight.</b> Quicksand can be formed by standing or (upwards) flowing underground water (as from an underground spring), or by earthquakes. In the case of flowing underground water, {{the force of the}} water flow opposes the force of gravity, causing the granules of sand to be more buoyant. In the case of earthquakes, the shaking force can increase the pressure of shallow groundwater, liquefying sand and silt deposits. In both cases, the liquefied surface loses strength, causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink or fall over.|$|E
6000|$|This lonely leg {{on which}} I rest {{has all the}} {{simplicity}} of some Doric column. The students of architecture {{tell us that the}} only legitimate use of a column is to <b>support</b> <b>weight.</b> This column of mine fulfils its legitimate function. It supports weight. Being of an animal and organic consistency, it may even improve by the process, and during these few days that I am thus unequally balanced, the helplessness or dislocation of the one leg may find compensation in the astonishing strength and classic beauty of the other leg. Mrs. Mountstuart Jenkinson in Mr. George Meredith's novel might pass by at any moment, and seeing me in the stork-like attitude would exclaim, with equal admiration and a more literal exactitude, [...] "He has a leg." [...] Notice how this famous literary phrase supports my contention touching this isolation of any admirable thing. Mrs. Mountstuart Jenkinson, wishing to make a clear and perfect picture of human grace, said that Sir Willoughby Patterne had a leg. She delicately glossed over and concealed the clumsy and offensive fact that he had really two legs. Two legs were superfluous and irrelevant, a reflection, and a confusion. Two legs would have confused Mrs. Mountstuart Jenkinson like two Monuments in London. That having had one good leg he should have another--this would be to use vain repetitions as the Gentiles do. She would have been as much bewildered by him {{as if he had been}} a centipede.|$|E

The software might not <b>support</b> <b>weights</b> for reasons of efficiency, simplicity, or because it was quicker to write the software without <b>supporting</b> <b>weights.</b> We discuss several techniques, both deterministic and random, for efficiently approximating the answer that would be obtained if the software <b>supported</b> <b>weights...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{establish}} the matroid structures corresponding to data-local and local maximally recoverable codes (MRC). The matroid structures of these codes {{can be used}} to determine the associated Tutte polynomial. Greene proved that the weight enumerators of any code can be determined from its associated Tutte polynomial. We will use this result to derive explicit expressions for the weight enumerators of data-local and local MRC. Also, Britz proved that the higher <b>support</b> <b>weights</b> of any code can be determined from its associated Tutte polynomial. We will use this result to derive expressions for the higher <b>support</b> <b>weights</b> of data-local and local MRC with two local codes. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

40|$|Background: Lower body {{positive}} pressure (LBPP) treadmills {{can be used}} {{in rehabilitation}} programs and/or to supplement run mileage in healthy runners by reducing the effective body weight and impact associated with running. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine if body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> influences the stride length (SL) –velocity as well as leg impact acceleration relationship during running. Methods: Subjects (n =  10, 21. 4  ±  2. 0 years, 72. 4  ±  10. 3  kg, 1. 76  ±  0. 09  m) completed 16 run conditions consisting of specific body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> and velocity combinations. Velocities tested were 100 %, 110 %, 120 %, and 130 % of the preferred velocity (2. 75  ±  0. 36  m/s). Body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> conditions consisted of 0, 60 %, 70 %, and 80 % body <b>weight</b> <b>support.</b> SL and leg impact accelerations were determined using a light-weight accelerometer mounted on the surface of the anterior-distal aspect of the tibia. A 4  ×  4 (velocity × body <b>weight</b> <b>support)</b> repeated measures ANOVA was used for each dependent variable (α =  0. 05). Results: Neither SL nor leg impact acceleration were influenced by the interaction of body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> and velocity (p >  0. 05). SL was least during no body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> (p    0. 05). Leg impact acceleration was greatest during no body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> (p    0. 05). SL and leg impact accelerations increased with velocity regardless of support (p <  0. 05). Conclusion: The relationships between SL and leg impact accelerations with velocity were not influenced by body <b>weight</b> <b>support...</b>|$|R

50|$|From the {{cylindrical}} columns to {{the internal}} benches, Paper Dome is a giant hollow paper tube structure supported {{by a total of}} 58 tubes, 5 meters in height.
