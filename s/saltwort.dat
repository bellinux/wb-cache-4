The beach vegetation is largely Spinifex longifolius (beach spinifex), Salsola kali (prickly <b>saltwort),</b> Atriplex cinerea (grey saltbush) and naturalised Cakile maritima (sea rocket). Stable dunes are vegetated by Atriplex paludosa (marsh saltbush), Scaevola crassifolia (thick-leaved fan-flower), Olearia axillaris (coastal daisy-bush), Myoporum insulare (blueberry tree) and Exocarpos sparteus (broom ballart). Sheltered areas behind dunes support Salsola kali and Myoporum insulare and also Nitraria billardierei (nitre bush), the last of these being the only plant on the island to grow over m (5ft) high. In areas where limestone {{is close to the}} surface, the vegetation consists of Pimelea microcephala (shrubby rice-flower), Spyridium globulosum (basket bush) and Acanthocarpus preissii.|$|E

500|$|Coastal lowlands, or wet prairies, are {{salt water}} marshes that absorb marine water {{when it gets}} high or fresh water when rains are heavy. Floods occur during {{hurricane}} and tropical storm surges when ocean water can rise several feet over the land. Heavy wet seasons also cause floods when rain from the north flows into the Everglades. Few trees can survive in the conditions of this region, but plants—succulents like <b>saltwort</b> and glasswort—tolerate salt, brackish water, and desert conditions. [...] Animal life in this zone is dependent upon {{the amount of water}} present, but commonly found animals include Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), Everglades snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), [...] wood stork (Mycteria americana), eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), and small mammals such as rats, mice, and rabbits.|$|E

500|$|Severe weather, in {{the form}} of {{tropical}} storms and hurricanes, also affects the structure of the Everglades. Between 1871 and 2003, 40tropical cyclones struck the Everglades, usually every one to three years. These storms alter the coastline, flush decaying vegetation from estuaries, strip weakened branches from trees, and disperse seeds, pollen, and plant material. Hurricane Donna in 1960 affected [...] of mangrove forests by depositing marl over the roots and depriving the trees of oxygen. It also eradicated orchids, bromeliads, and other epiphytes that once flourished in the mangroves; their reappearance may take a century or more. Donna also significantly spread buttonwood, <b>saltwort,</b> and glasswort, and epiphytes began to grow in new areas. Although the lasting effects remain to be seen, Hurricane Andrew in 1992 also destroyed mangrove forests and snapped slash pines in half. However, regrowth occurred quickly, and sand deposited by the storm surge improved nesting conditions for crocodiles and sea turtles.|$|E
2500|$|The sodium {{carbonate}} concentration in soda ash varied very widely, from 2–3 {{percent for the}} seaweed-derived form ("kelp"), to 30 percent for the best barilla produced from <b>saltwort</b> plants in Spain.

2500|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{was first}} prepared by soap makers. [...] A procedure for making sodium hydroxide appeared {{as part of}} a recipe for making soap in an Arab book of the late 13th century: [...] Al-mukhtara` fi funun min al-suna` (Inventions from the Various Industrial Arts), which was compiled by al-Muzaffar Yusuf ibn `Umar ibn `Ali ibn Rasul (d. 1295), a king of Yemen. [...] The recipe called for passing water repeatedly through a mixture of alkali (Arabic: [...] al-qily, where qily is ash from <b>saltwort</b> plants, which are rich in sodium hence alkali was impure sodium carbonate) and quicklime (calcium oxide, CaO), whereby a solution of sodium hydroxide was obtained. [...] European soap makers also followed this recipe. [...] When in 1791 the French chemist and surgeon Nicolas Leblanc (1742–1806) patented a process for mass-producing sodium carbonate, natural [...] "soda ash" [...] (impure sodium carbonate that was obtained from the ashes of plants that are rich in sodium) was replaced by this artificial version. [...] However, by the 20th century, the electrolysis of sodium chloride had become the primary method for producing sodium hydroxide.|$|E
