50|$|A fault bend, or fault stepover, forms when {{individual}} {{segments of}} the fault overlap and link together. The type of structures which form along the strike-slip fault depend on the sense of slip relative {{to the sense of}} stepping. When a <b>sinistral</b> <b>fault</b> steps to the right or a dextral fault steps to the left, a restraining bend is formed. These are areas of positive relief (topographic uplift), crustal shortening, and exhumation of crystalline basement. As seen in deeply eroded outcrop exposures or from subsurface geophysical surveys, restraining bends commonly define positive flower structures. In plan view we see them form contractional strike-slip duplexs, subparallel reverse or oblique-slip contractional faults that are bounded by two strike-slip segments. Restraining bends are widespread on the Earth's surface, from sub-outcrop-scale examples to large scale mountain ranges. They have been theorized to occur on extraterrestrial bodies, like Jupiter's icy moon Europa and on Venus.|$|E

Three models have been proposed to explain this fault slip transfer: (1) the displacement transfer model suggests that Pliocene slip was transferred along NE-striking normal faults, (2) the transtensional strain model suggests that Pleistocene strain was transferred by extension-dominated transtension {{in the west and}} wrench-dominated transtension in the east, and (3) the rotational block model suggests that slip was transferred by clockwise rotating blocks bounded by NE-striking <b>sinistral</b> <b>faults.</b> New geologic mapping and structural studies in the Huntoon Springs quadrangle (HSQ) of the western MD evaluate these hypotheses.

Recent geologic studies in the southwestern MD provide insight into the kinematics of fault-slip transfer from the WL to the MD. The southwestern MD is a faulted volcanic field underlain by Miocene latite (~ 11. 17 Ma), Pliocene hornblende dacite, tuffaceous sandstone, basalt flows (~ 3. 13 to 3. 43 Ma), andesite, and cinder cones, and Quaternary sedimentary deposits. Faults, which cut all but the Quaternary units, define three zones: NW-striking dextral faults in the south, NE-striking <b>sinistral</b> <b>faults</b> in the north, and the EW-striking <b>sinistral</b> Coaldale <b>fault</b> in the center. The NW-dextral and EW-sinistral Coaldale faults are mutually cross-cutting, illustrating the complex fault geometry that transfers fault slip from the dextral faults of the WL to the <b>sinistral</b> <b>faults</b> of the MD. Offset markers identified along the strike-slip faults include basalt ridge lines, faults, and unit contacts and yield a minimum dextral offset of 0. 8 - 1. 3 km and sinistral offset of 0. 6 km.

To clarify the relation between the two deformation zones, we conducted two high-resolution shallow seismic reflection surveys across Gofukuji and Akagiyama faults.

In the Gofukuji seismic line, we estimated the east-dipping Gofukuji frontal thrust and possible high-angle Gofukuji fault. The Akagiyama seismic profile demonstrates an asymmetric anticline with a steeper eastern limb associated with the west-dipping Akagiyama fault. Based on the tectonic geomorphological features and subsurface structure, it is considered that the two deformation zones were formed by a single main east-dipping fault with reverse and strike-slip displacements.

Structural investigations including new field mapping, meso-scale faults recognition, palaeostress analysis of brittle small-scale faults systems were {{performed in the}} sedimentary cover of the Almanzora corridor and the Huércal-Overa basins, located either in the hanging wall unit of the Filabres extensional shear zone or at the termination of the Alhama de Murcia <b>sinistral</b> <b>fault</b> zone.

Besides, the consistency between the latest ductile and the brittle kinematics for the Filabres extensional shear zone and the activity of meso-scale fault systems that primarily control the main SW-NE depocentres allow concluding to a top-to-the-NW con-tinuum of strain during the final exhumation of the Nevado-Filábride complex.

The zone separates areas of opposing directions of tilt and downthrow on faults in the Yucca Flat and Frenchman Flat areas. Paleomagnetic data show that rocks within the accommodation zone adjacent to Yucca Flat were not strongly affected by vertical-axis rotation and thus that the transverse strikes of fault and strata formed near their present orientation. Both normal- and oblique strike-slip faulting in the FPAZ largely occurred under a normal-fault stress regime, with least principal stress oriented west-northwest. The normal and sinistral faults in the Puddle Peka segment transfers extension between the Plutonium Valley normal fault zone and the Cane Spring <b>sinistral</b> <b>fault.</b> Recognition of sinistral shear across the Puddle Peak segment allows the Frenchman Flat basin to be interpreted as an asymmetric pull-apart basin developed between the FPAZ and a zone of east-northeast-striking faults to the south that include the Rock Valley fault.

A WNW-ESE extension (1) has affected Eastern China from the Campanian to the Late Palaeocene-Early Ypresian. Under this extension, the Qinling (QLFZ) and Southern Tan-Lu (STLFZ) Fault Zones have been dextral transtensional fault zones. A first transpressional event (2) (NNE-SSW shortening) has occurred during the Late Ypresian-Lower Lutetian; the QLFZ and the STLFZ have been dextral transpressional fault zones. A NE-SW extension (3) has affected the Weihe graben during the Palaeogene; after a second transpressional event (4), the NE-SW extension (5) has been rejuvenated during the Late Miocene and the QLFZ has been a normal fault zone again and the STLFZ a <b>sinistral</b> transtensional <b>fault</b> zone; synrift subsidence {{has occurred in the}} Weihe graben. The second transpressional event (4) (WNW-ESE shortening) has occurred during the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene, during a period of uplifting and exhumation. At that time, the STLFZ and the QLFZ have become <b>sinistral</b> transpressional <b>fault</b> zones. A period of extension (6) has taken place during the Late Pliocene-Quaternary; the extensional direction has trended ≈ NNW-SSE; during this event, the QLFZ has been a <b>sinistral</b> transtensional <b>fault</b> zone and the STLFZ a dextral transtensional fault zone. These results are compared with those previously published in order to evaluate the regional significance of these tectonic events...|$|R
40|$|The North Pine Fault System (NPFS) in SE Queensland {{belongs to}} a series of NNW-striking <b>sinistral</b> <b>faults</b> that {{displaced}} Paleozoic to Cenozoic rock units in eastern Australia. We have studied the geometry and kinematics of the NPFS by utilizing gridded aeromagnetic data, digital elevation models, and field observations. The results indicate that all segments of the NPFS were subjected to <b>sinistral</b> reverse strike-slip <b>faulting.</b> Restorations of displaced magnetic anomalies indicate sinistral offsets ranging from ∼ 3. 4 to ∼ 8. 2 km. The existence of a (possibly) Late Triassic granophyre dyke parallel to one of the fault segments, and the occurrence of NNW-striking steeply dipping strike-slip and normal faults in the Late Triassic-Early Cretaceous Maryborough Basin, indicate that the NPFS has likely been active during the Mesozoic. We propose that from Late Cretaceous to early Eocene, NNW-striking faults in eastern Australia, including the NPFS, were reactivated with oblique sinistral-normal kinematics in response to regional oblique extension associated {{with the opening of the}} Tasman and Coral Seas. This interpretation is consistent with the modeled dominant NNE- to NNW-directed horizontal tensional stress in the Eocene. The latest movements along the NPFS involved sinistral transpressional kinematics, which was possibly related to far-field contractional stresses from collisional tectonics at the eastern and northern boundaries of the Australian plate in the Cenozoic. This sinistral-reverse oblique kinematics of the NPFS in the Cenozoic is in line with ∼ESE to ENE orientations of the modeled maximum horizontal stress in SE Queensland...|$|R
