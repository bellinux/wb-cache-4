2500|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, Angelo Mosso invented the 'human {{circulation}} balance', which could non-invasively measure the redistribution of blood during emotional and intellectual activity.

Angelo Mosso investigated several critical variables that are still relevant in modern neuroimaging such as the ‘signal-to-noise ratio', the appropriate choice of the experimental paradigm {{and the need for}} the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>recording</b> of differing physiological parameters. Mosso's manuscripts do not provide direct evidence that [...] the balance was really able to measure changes in cerebral blood flow due to cognition, however a modern replication performed by David T Field has now demonstrated using modern signal processing techniques unavailable to Mosso that a balance apparatus of this type is able to detect changes in cerebral blood volume related to cognition.|$|E
