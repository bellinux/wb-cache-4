40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} controller design of uncertain and parameter-variant piecewise linear systems. The idea is to specify a desired performance, which is represented by a nominal system. Around this nominal system a compact set of systems is obtained which will be robustly stable against switching among members of this set: such a set of systems is then called the stable <b>switched</b> <b>set.</b> The paper shows that obtaining the stable <b>switched</b> <b>set</b> is a signomial program. It is shown that upper bounds on signomial programs can be easily obtained, which are used to compute the stable <b>switched</b> <b>set.</b> A sufficient condition is given {{for the existence of}} a common state feedback controller that stabilizes a number of uncertain and parameter-variant linear systems on a stable <b>switched</b> <b>set.</b> The paper proposes a synthesis procedure in terms of a constrained convex optimization problem that places the uncertain and parameter-variant systems optimally close to the desired nominal system, using one common state feedback controller. An extension is shown for the case that there exists no common state feedback controller. The synthesis framework is then applied to a simple example to demonstrate the procedure. It is shown that real systems, like active suspension of a car, transform natural into uncertain and parameter-variant piecewise linear systems...|$|R

A very small number, mainly ports from Unix-like systems, are programmed to accept [...] "-" [...] {{even if the}} switch character is not set to it (for example netstat and ping, supplied with Windows, will accept the /? option to list available options, and yet the list will specify the [...] "-" [...] convention).|$|E
50|$|Its first (and intended) use {{was during}} the Apollo 10 mission, {{following}} {{the separation of the}} Lunar Module descent stage, prior to the ascent stage burn. An incorrect <b>switch</b> <b>setting</b> led to the AGS causing extensive gyrations of the ascent stage. The next use of the AGS {{was during the}} lunar ascent phase of the Apollo 11 mission, when the LM crew performed a sequence of rendezvous maneuvers that resulted in gimbal lock; the AGS was subsequently used to acquire attitude control.|$|E

50|$|The {{left and}} right {{difficulty}} switches alter how hard the game is. When the left difficulty <b>switch</b> is <b>set</b> to A, the cop cars are smarter in catching the Getaway Car; when it's set to B, enemy cars move in a more set pattern. When the right difficulty <b>switch</b> is <b>set</b> to A, the banks appear in random spots; when the <b>switch</b> is <b>set</b> to B, the banks appear in preset locations.|$|R
5000|$|With the DC <b>switch</b> <b>set</b> to its [...] "AC" [...] {{position}} and the AC <b>switch</b> <b>set</b> to [...] "DC", no current can flow through the instrument. However whenever any moving coil instrument {{is likely to be}} subjected to heavy shock in transit, it is good practice to damp the movement by short circuiting the moving coil using a heavy gauge wire connected across the terminals. On earlier Avometers, this may be done by short-circuiting the input terminals and selecting the most sensitive direct current range. The Model 8 Mark V, 6 & 7 were provided with an [...] "OFF" [...] position on the DC switch which both disconnected the meter's terminals and short-circuited the moving coil.|$|R
50|$|Rising Star Industries was {{the primary}} American {{software}} vendor for the HASCI QX series. Their product line included the TPM-II and III operating system, Valdocs, a robust Basic language implementation, a graphics API library used {{by a variety of}} products which initially supported line drawing and fill functions and was later extended to support the QX-16 color boards, Z80 assembler, and low level Zapple machine code monitor which could be invoked from dip <b>switch</b> <b>setting</b> on the rear of the machine.|$|E
50|$|The cut {{control rods}} also {{explained}} the sudden steep dive. When they were cut, the horizontal stabilizer, {{under its own}} weight, dropped down, causing the nose also to go down. This could be counteracted by the vertical trim; in Il-62s, the <b>switch</b> <b>setting</b> the vertical trim to manual operation was secured by a thin, sharp wire. On Capt. Lipowczan's right hand, small wounds were found, and they were confirmed to be made while Lipowczan was still alive; supposedly, he ripped the security off and tried to control the vertical trim, {{but it was too}} late.|$|E
5000|$|Lethal Enforcers has six stages (including the Training Stage): [...] "The Bank Robbery", [...] "Chinatown Assault", [...] "Hijacking", [...] "The Drug Dealers", and [...] "Chemical Plant Sabotage".

A dip <b>switch</b> <b>setting</b> in the arcade version allows operators to let players progress through the stages in a linear fashion ("arcade mode") or select individual stages ("street mode").|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) {{has been}} {{associated}} with <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> difficulty in both the motor and the cognitive domain. However, the contribution of these <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> deficits to the primary motor symptoms of the disease is unclear. We investigated whether <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> deficits contribute to gait and stepping problems in PD. By contrasting motor and cognitive <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> within the same paradigm, we investigated the nature of <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> deficits associated with freezing of gait (FOG). METHODS: We integrated step initiation with <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> within one task and compared patients with and without FOG with healthy subjects. Motor <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> was defined as a change in stepping direction from one trial to the next. Cognitive <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> was defined as a change in task rule (ie, respond according to the shape or color of the presented stimulus). RESULTS: We found delayed motor switching in PD patients with FOG. We did not observe impaired cognitive switching. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that motor <b>set</b> <b>switching</b> deficits, commonly reported in tasks using verbal or tapping responses, extend to stepping and can contribute to the occurrence of freezing episodes during gait initiation...|$|R

The [...] "AZ" [...] (impact) setting triggers detonation when the bomb hits the ground. The fuze is armed if 4 screw threads {{at the base of}} the arming spindle are visible. This fuze is highly sensitive to disturbance if the selector switch is set to [...] "Zeit" [...] and the bomb is unexploded. The particular <b>switch</b> <b>setting</b> of any type 41 fuze is clearly visible on its exterior.|$|E
50|$|On July 17, 1975, the two craft {{joined up}} in orbit, and astronauts Slayton, Thomas P. Stafford and Vance D. Brand {{conducted}} crew transfers with cosmonauts Alexey Leonov and Valeri Kubasov. At {{the end of}} the flight, an erroneous <b>switch</b> <b>setting</b> led to noxious nitrogen tetroxide fumes from the command module's RCS thrusters being sucked into the cabin during landing, and the crew was hospitalized as a precaution in Honolulu, Hawaii, for two weeks. During hospitalization, a lesion was discovered on Slayton's lung and removed. It was determined to be benign, but he would have almost certainly been grounded from ASTP if this had been discovered before the flight.|$|E
50|$|The SX-117 was {{a triple}} {{conversion}} {{intermediate frequency receiver}} designed to cover the 10 meter to 80 meter amateur radio bands with an additional band <b>switch</b> <b>setting</b> for WWV on 10 MHz. The first and third conversion oscillators were crystal-controlled. The second was variable from 6 to 6.5 MHz. Introduced in 1962 at a price of $379.95, it had a product detector for SSB, a notch filter, and selectable bandwidth of 0.5, 2.5, and 5 KHz. In addition to the ham bands, general coverage was possible for most frequencies in 500 kHz segments from 85 kHz to 30 MHz with appropriate crystals. For frequencies below 3 MHz, the HA-10 LF/MF converter was an optional accessory costing $24.95. The receiver featured 13 vacuum tubes plus solid state rectifiers and a noise limiter.|$|E

50|$|Three-quarter {{unions are}} similar to grand unions {{in that they are}} also rail track {{junctions}} where two double-track railway lines cross at grade, often in a street intersection or crossroads; the primary difference being that one corner of the crossing does not have curved junction tracks, with the union having a total of twelve railroad <b>switches</b> (<b>sets</b> of points).|$|R
5000|$|Lethal Enforcers 2 {{has five}} stages: [...] "The Bank Robbery", [...] "The Stage-Holdup", [...] "Saloon Showdown", [...] "The Train Robbery", and [...] "The Hide-Out". During each stage, the player must shoot the armed outlaws without harming any {{innocent}} townsfolk or fellow lawmen. One shot {{is enough to}} kill most enemies. At {{the end of each}} stage, a boss must be killed in order to complete the stage (though a unique case happened in the third stage where the boss battle {{is in the form of}} a dueling mini-game). Just like the original game, a dip <b>switch</b> <b>setting</b> in the arcade version allows operators to let players progress through the stages in a linear fashion ("arcade mode") or select individual stages ("street mode"), including the between level target practice stages.|$|E
50|$|If {{an upright}} is housing a driving game, {{it may have}} a {{steering}} wheel and throttle pedal instead of a joystick and buttons. If the upright is housing a shooting game, it may have light guns attached {{to the front of}} the machine, via durable cables. Some arcade machines had the monitor placed at the bottom of the cabinet with a mirror mounted at around 45 degrees above the screen facing the player. This was done to save space, a large CRT monitor would otherwise poke out the back of the cabinet, and possibly to avoid eye strain from looking directly up-close at the monitor. To correct for the mirrored image, some games had an option to flip the video output using a dip <b>switch</b> <b>setting.</b> Other genres of game such as Guitar Freaks feature controllers resembling musical instruments.|$|E
50|$|Bosconian was {{the first}} game to feature a {{continuation}} screen and timer {{after the end of}} a game, giving a player who had just lost his or her last life a certain number of seconds to insert more coins and press START in order to continue the game {{from the start of the}} same round. This feature could be disabled entirely for arcade owners who did not want it, by changing a DIP <b>switch</b> <b>setting.</b> However, there is some debate over whether Bosconian or Tempest should be credited as the first arcade game to introduce the concept of continuing: Tempest is the older of the two games, but it did not feature a continuation screen and timer. Instead, it gave the player a choice of starting from any odd-numbered level at the beginning of the game, up to the highest odd-numbered level that had currently been unlocked on the machine.|$|E

5000|$|A Standard BASIC {{cartridge}} {{was included}} with the machine. This cartridge was essentially the common Microsoft BASIC already widely used in the CP/M world. One modification was the addition of single-stroke replacements for common BASIC commands, pressing GRAPHICS-P would insert the word [...] for instance, allowing for higher-speed entry. The machine included sound in/out ports on the back that could be attached to a cassette tape recorder, so BASIC could load and save programs to tape without needing a disk drive. An Extended BASIC cartridge requiring 16 KB was also advertised, but it is unclear if this was actually available; Extended BASIC from Microsoft was available on cassette. Another popular cartridge was the Word Processor PAC which contained {{a version of the}} early word processor program Spellbinder. A constant ROM fault in the wordprocessor PAC was a printer status <b>switch</b> <b>setting</b> for the printer, but most people learned about it and turned it off early in their power-on.|$|E
5000|$|The player {{must take}} control of Grobda, a [...] screw-propelled tank trapped in an arena filled with {{numerous}} indestructible obstacles and several enemy tanks. When an enemy tank is killed, it will cause an explosion, and any other enemies that {{happen to be in}} the blast radius at the time will also suffer the same fate. But if Grobda is too close to the explosion, it will also be killed. Grobda has a shield that offers very temporary protection from enemy fire, but this will soon disappear if it is constantly under attack or shot. Each round is called a [...] "battling", and there are a total of ninety-nine in the game. If all ninety-nine battlings are cleared, the game's high score table will show that the player has cleared one hundred battlings, and if the arcade operator has set the game's [...] "round select" [...] DIP <b>switch</b> <b>setting</b> to [...] "on", the player will also have the option of starting the game on any battling he or she wants.|$|E
5000|$|In this game, Taizo Hori (the player's character) is {{armed with}} two weapons. One is the pump from the {{original}} Dig Dug, {{which is used to}} inflate enemies until they bust. The other is a jackhammer, which can be used at [...] "fault lines" [...] on the map to create faults in the ground. If both ends of a system of faults reach the water, the ground surrounded by them will sink into the ocean, killing all creatures on it, including Taizo himself if the player is not careful. The points earned from this depend on how many enemies are killed at once. Once three pieces of land have been cut off an island, a bonus vegetable will appear somewhere on what remains of the island, which can be eaten for extra points. After the thirty-first round, the rounds will be identical to the first sixteen rounds before it. When only one, two or (on later rounds) three enemies remain on the island, the enemies will eventually head for the edge of the island and jump into the water, killing themselves and the player points are lost. If the arcade operator has set this game's [...] "round select" [...] DIP <b>switch</b> <b>setting</b> to [...] "on", the player will also have the option of starting from Round 1 but Rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are unselectable on this screen.|$|E
50|$|A grand {{union is}} a rail track {{junction}} where two double-track railway lines cross at grade, {{often in a}} street intersection or crossroads. A total of sixteen railroad <b>switches</b> (<b>sets</b> of points) allow streetcars (or in more rare installations, trains) coming from any direction to take {{any of the three}} other directions. The same effect may be achieved with two consequent wyes if the location allows for space.|$|R
50|$|DIP {{switches}} {{are still}} {{used in some}} remote controls to prevent interference; for example, to control a ceiling fan (and its light fixture) that was retrofitted to a single-circuit junction box. The DIP <b>switches</b> <b>set</b> a different radio frequency for each transmitter/receiver pair, so that multiple units can be installed in different rooms of the same house, or different units of the same apartment building, without unintentionally controlling each other.|$|R
5000|$|Many storage heaters {{also have}} a mechanically-controlled {{automatic}} output switch. In this case, if the manual output <b>switch</b> is not <b>set</b> to minimum overnight, the damper will automatically close (as if the output <b>switch</b> had been <b>set</b> to minimum), and then the damper will re-open after a time delay; this time delay {{is measured by the}} gradual drop in the heater's core temperature, and is therefore longer if the core temperature started higher due to more charge. The delay can also be biased by the output <b>switch's</b> <b>setting.</b> [...] Some output <b>switches</b> that are <b>set</b> up this way are marked [...] "early" [...] and [...] "late" [...] as well as [...] "closed" [...] and [...] "open"; the minimum [...] "closed" [...] setting corresponds with [...] "early" [...] and the maximum [...] "open" [...] setting corresponds with [...] "late". These output switches can be controlled manually by ensuring they are closed at night and opened when desired, or they can be left to automatic operation by not closing at night.|$|R
