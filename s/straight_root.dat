40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} uncontrolled removal of dentin during in vitro ultrasonic irrigant activation in prepared root canals using 2 different files. Methods: Fifty-four human single-rooted teeth with <b>straight</b> <b>root</b> canals were prepared to size 35 /. 06 taper. The specimens were randomly allocated to 3 groups (n = 18). Two milliliters of 2 % sodium hypochlorite was delivered 3 times to each root canal by a syringe and an open-ended needle. After each delivery, the irrigant was ultrasonically activated for 10 seconds at 35 % power either by a size 15 ultrasonic K-file (group A) or a size 20 Irrisafe file (Acteon Satelec, Merignac, France) (group B) placed at 2 mm short of the working length. The irrigant in the control specimens (group C) was not activated. Specimens were scanned by micro–computed tomographic imaging at 10 -μm voxel size before preparation, after preparation, and after the final irrigation/activation sequence. Scans were coregistered and segmented, and the amount of dentin removed during the final step was quantified by morphologic operations. Results were analyzed by nonparametric statistical tests. The level of significance was set to P <. 05. Results: Defects with a maximum depth of 0. 09 mm and 0. 07 mm were identified in groups A and B, respectively. Both ultrasonic files removed significantly more dentin than irrigant delivery in the control group (P ≤. 005). K-files removed significantly more dentin than Irrisafe files in the apical third (P =. 001).

40|$|We {{describe}} a practical method for constructing a nontrivial homomorphism between two Verma modules of an arbitrary semisimple Lie algebra. With some additions the method generalises to the affine case. A theorem of Verma, Bernstein-Gel’fand-Gel’fand gives a straightforward criterion {{for the existence}} of a nontrivial homomorphism between Verma modules. Moreover, the theorem states that such homomorphisms are always injective. In this paper we consider the problem of explicitly constructing such a homomorphism if it exists. This boils down to constructing a certain element in the universal enveloping algebra of the negative part of the semismiple Lie algebra. There are several methods known to solve this problem. Firstly, one can try and find explicit formulas. In this approach one fixes the type (but not the rank). This has been carried out for type An in [18], Section 5, and for the similar problem in the quantum group case in [4], [5], [6].

A high-speed imaging system with high temporal and spatial resolution was used to visualize laser-induced shock waves in a resin block model with a curved root canal (inner diameter at the apex 0. 08 mm, taper 4 %, crown height 10 mm, overall length 40 mm) and a glass cylinder model with a <b>straight</b> <b>root</b> canal (inner diameter 1 mm, crown height 10 mm, overall length 40 mm). The study utilized MZ 3 and RFT 3 tips in each model, without water or air spray, and with an average power of 1 W at 35 Hz. Laser-activated irrigation overcame the airlock effect by releasing air trapped in the air column. The mechanism underlying the removal of trapped air from the apical region using an Er,Cr:YSGG laser in a dry root canal is via the disruption of the surface tension at the solution-air interface. This disruption, caused by bubble implosion (cavitation), displaces air in the form of bubbles from the apical region toward the solution, which allows the solution to travel apically...|$|E

Each tooth was obturated using single cone, cold lateral, and warm vertical obturation techniques without sealer. Each obturation technique was performed 20 times for each of the root systems. The weights of the gutta percha were recorded for each root type and obturation technique by subtracting the post-fill weight from the pre-fill weight of the two split-tooth models. Results show that in the straight canal, the three obturation techniques are significantly different (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). The warm vertical technique had the largest weight of gutta percha, followed by the single cone, and lastly by the cold lateral condensation group.

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to compare and evaluate the area increase of root canals with ProTaper, iRaCe and Revo-S systems using cone beam computed tomography for analysis. Materials and Methodology: Forty five extracted human mandibular premolars having single canal and <b>straight</b> <b>root</b> were collected. Teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups (n= 15). Samples were decoronized by maintaining root length at 14 mm. Pre-instrumentation cone beam computed tomography scan was done after stabilizing the samples on wax blocks. The working length was determined at 1 mm short from the apical foramen by using a ISO 15 K-file tip protruding at apical foramen. Preparation was carried out according to the manufacturer′s instructions. Finally, canals were instrumented upto 30 /. 06 apically for each group. After each instrumentation, root canals were irrigated with 2 ml of 3 % sodium hypochlorite solution followed by 2 ml of 17 % EDTA solution. Final irrigation was done with 5 ml of saline. Post instrumentation cone beam computed tomography scans of all samples in the 3 groups were acquired. Results: Mean percentage of area increase in different thirds of the canal was highest for ProTaper followed by i-RaCe and Revo-s system which was statistically significant. Interpretation and Conclusion: Root canal area increase was highest for ProTaper followed by i-Race and Revo-S systems...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective To {{evaluate}} solubility and sealing {{ability of}} Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and root-end filling materials. Material and Methods The materials evaluated were: MTA, Calcium Silicate Cement with zirconium oxide (CSC/ZrO 2), and zinc oxide/eugenol (ZOE). Solubility test was performed according to ANSI/ADA. The difference between initial and final {{mass of the}} materials was analyzed after immersion in distilled water for 7 and 30 days. Retrograde cavities in human teeth with single <b>straight</b> <b>root</b> canal were performed by using ultrasonic tip CVD 9. 5107 - 8. The cavities were filled with the evaluated materials to evaluate sealing ability using the bacterial leakage test with Enterococcus faecalis. Bacterial leakage was evaluated every 24 hours for six weeks observing the turbidity of Brain Heart infusion (BHI) medium in contact with root apex. Data were submitted to ANOVA followed by Tukey tests (solubility), and Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (sealing ability) at a 5 % significance level. Results For the 7 -day period, ZOE presented highest solubility {{when compared with the}} other groups (p< 0. 05). For the 30 -day period, no difference was observed among the materials. Lower bacterial leakage was observed for MTA and CSC/ZrO 2, and both presented better results than ZOE (p< 0. 05). Conclusion MTA and CSC/ZrO 2 presented better bacterial sealing capacity, which may be related to lower initial solubility observed for these materials in relation to ZOE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aim: This {{study was}} carried out to assess the {{recovery}} rate of Enterococcus faecalis count after disinfection of the root canals with Er,Cr:YSGG laser. Methodology: Freshly extracted 40 human teeth of single <b>straight</b> <b>root</b> canals were prepared to a size 50; these specimens were sterilized and then inoculated with E. faecalis suspension and incubated for 48 hrs. They were randomly allocated to three treatments and one control negative group. The infected root canals underwent laser treatment. Then samples were collected immediately (after irradiation of root canal) and after 7 days of irradiation, after that surviving of bacteria were checked by counting the colony-forming units (CFU). Results: The {{results indicated that the}} Er,Cr:YSGG laser was capable of significant reduction of E. faecalis in the infected root canal at all selected output powers 0. 75 W, 1 W and 1. 5 W as well as there was significant antibacterial differences among these powers. In addition the results showed increased in the number of bacterial colonies in the second microbiological sampling compared with the first microbiological sampling, The bacterial recovery decreased when laser irradiation power increased. The best result for the laser that showing less number of E. faecalis after 7 days of irradiation at 1. 5 W. Conclusions: This study recognized the disinfection ability of Er,Cr:YSGG laser against the most resistant bacteria that is associated with endodontic infection...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{provision}} {{of an effective}} apical seal is an essential factor when choosing an appropriate material for success of root-end surgeries. Root-end resection, preparation and obturation should provide an adequate apical seal. The aim of this in vitro {{study was to investigate}} bacterial and dye microleakage of four different root-end filling materials and compare the efficacy of these two methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six single-rooted teeth with intact and <b>straight</b> <b>roots</b> were randomly assigned into four study groups of 12 each and two control groups of three each. After decoronation, root canals were prepared up to file size # 40 using step back technique; then, they were filled with gutta-percha and AH 26 sealer. Root-ends were resected 3 mm above the root-end and 3 mm deep cavities were prepared. Root-end cavities were filled with amalgam, Root Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (Root MTA), White ProRoot MTA (WMTA), and calcium enriched mixture (CEM) cement. Bacterial leakage was investigated in Trypticase Soy Broth (containing Enterococcus faecalis) after 70 days and 1 % methylene blue dye leakage was assessed after 72 hours. Complete dye leakage was checked using stereomicroscope (× 40). Data were statistically analyzed using Fisher Exact test. For pair comparison between the two methods Kapa agreement was utilized. RESULTS: After 70 days there was 100 % bacterial leakage in amalgam, and CEM cement, 91. 7 % in WMTA, and 75 % in Root MTA. This difference was not significantly different. The difference in complete dye leakage was also not significant (WMTA and CEM cement 16. 7 %, Amalgam and Root MTA 33. 3 %). CONCLUSION: There was no significant measure of agreement between dye and bacterial penetration along root-end fillings. CEM cement was not significantly different from currently used retrofilling materials e. g. WMTA...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{antibacterial}} {{efficacy of}} intracanal medicaments containing silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) {{has been well}} documented. However, concerns remain regarding the effect of Ag-NPs on tooth color. This study aimed to assess the effects of calcium hydroxide (CH) mixed with Ag-NPs as intracanal medicaments on tooth color. The effect of location of application of medicament {{on the degree of}} discoloration was evaluated as well. Fifty extracted single-rooted, single-canal human teeth with <b>straight</b> <b>roots,</b> no caries, no cracks or fractures were collected and accessed. After cleaning and shaping of the root canals, the teeth were randomly divided into two experimental groups (n= 20) with CH and CH plus Ag-NPs as intracanal medicaments and a control group of saline (n= 10). Experimental groups were randomly divided into two equal subgroups of A, where medicament was applied below the cemento enamel junction (CEJ) and B where the medicament was applied to the root canal and pulp chamber. Color change (?E) was assessed using a spectrophotometer in CIELAB system at five time points of beforemedicaments application (T 0), immediately medicaments placement (T 1), one week (T 2), one month (T 3) and three months (T 4) after the application of medicaments. Data were analyzed using two-way and three-way ANOVA. Color change in Ag-NPs plus CH and CH groups was not significantly different at any time point (P= 0. 23). Increased exposure time in both groups did not increase the ?E (P > 0. 05). Significant differences were noted in ?E between subgroups A and B (P< 0. 05). Addition of Ag-NPs to CH caused no significant change in tooth color compared to the application of CH alone. However, its use must be limited to the root canal space only...|$|R

Prof. Dr. Ekaterina Boteva Deptartment of Conservative Dentistry Faculty of Dental Medicine; 1 Georgy Sofi isky str.; Sofia, Bulgaria; tel. + 359888328327; e-mail: e_boteva@abv. bgThe macromorphology of pulp {{chambers}} {{has been}} studied {{in the last few}} decades, but {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on the sizes of the pulp chambers of molars. The aim of the present study was to measure the size of the pulp chambers of upper and lower molars with different root curvatures and to compare them with the same dimensions in molars without root curvatures. Seventy-seven upper and lower molars, matured, fully mineralized and sound were selected in the following groups: two groups, including upper and lower teeth, respectively and three groups, divided as follows: with <b>straight</b> <b>roots</b> up to 25 - 30 º, with severe curvatures up to 45 º and with abnormalities 45 º- 90 º from the axial axis. Three dimensions of the crowns were measured for each tooth in mm: one mesio-distal and two bucco-lingual dimensions, one of then being measured from the top of buccal cusp to the top of the mesio-lingual (palatal) cusp. All teeth were submitted to X-rays and were photographed after opening the pulp chambers. Measurements of the pulp chambers were made after opening with horizontal cuts, made 1 mm apically from the equator with a diamond blend. The two buccolingual dimensions were refered to as L 1 and L 2, the mean value – as L and the mesio-distal – as MD, sizes were measured in the widest part of the pulp chamber with an endodontic fi le and endoblock in mm. A careful approach to these sizes of the pulp chambers of the molars with severe curvatures can safe hard dental tissues during endocavity and pulp chamber preparation. These fi ndings are important for the prevention of crown and root fractures, and teeth loses and for lowering the use of posts and pins and the use of crowns and bridges in young age groups...|$|R
