25|$|The company {{spun off}} its Travelers Property and Casualty {{insurance}} underwriting business in 2002.

25|$|Total BC {{petroleum}} {{and natural}} gas emissions in 2014 were 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The city of Vancouver in 2015 issued a report stating that for buildings, natural gas supplied 59% of all energy use, while electricity made up the remainder.

25|$|The {{line was}} opened on 26 August 1857. Gross {{expenditure}} was over £410,000.

Finally in 1862 Brogdens sold the U to the existing Furness Railway having made little or no direct profit. This railway link however was critical to the later industrial development of Barrow-in-Furness and its locality and mining interests. It also caused silt to build up in former tidal areas, creating new agricultural land. Brogdens' decision to <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> valuable railway, with good growth prospects, suggests that they were short of cash.|$|E
