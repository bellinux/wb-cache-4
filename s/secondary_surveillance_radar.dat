The rotodome uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures.

Analysis of satellite communications between the aircraft and Inmarsat's satellite communications network concluded that the flight continued until at least 08:19 and flew south into the southern Indian Ocean, although the precise location cannot be determined. Australia took charge of the search on 17 March when the search moved to the southern Indian Ocean. On 24 March, the Malaysian government noted that the final location determined by the satellite communication is far from any possible landing sites, and concluded that [...] "Flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean."

Several pieces of marine debris found on the coast of Africa and on Indian Ocean islands off the coast of Africa—the first discovered on 29 July 2015 on Réunion—have been confirmed as pieces of Flight 370. However, the bulk of the aircraft has still not been located, prompting many theories about its disappearance.|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of simultaneous independent approaches to parallel runways significantly enhances airport capacity. Current FAA procedures permit independent approaches in {{instrument meteorological conditions}} (IMC) when the parallel runways are spaced at least 4, 300 ft apart. Arriving aircraft must be dependently sequenced at airports that have parallel runways separated by less than 4, 300 ft, a procedure that reduces the arrival rate {{by as much as}} 25 %. The need for greater airport capacity has led to intense interest in new technologies that can support independent parallel IMC approaches to runways'spaced as close as 3, 000 ft. This interestresulted in several FAA initiatives, including a Lincoln Laboratory program to evaluate the applicability of Mode-S <b>secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radars</b> for monitoring parallel runway approaches.

The investigation noted that Rogers was focused on the ongoing surface engagement and was only aware of the inbound aircraft for less than four minutes.

Color Air filed for bankruptcy on 27 September 1999, ending a price war which had cost the airlines NOK 3 billion.

50|$|When {{multiple}} {{radar systems}} {{are connected to}} a single reporting post, a multiradar tracker {{is often used to}} monitor the updates from all of the radars and form tracks from the combination of detections. In this configuration, the tracks are often more accurate than those formed from single radars, as a greater number of detections can be used to estimate the tracks.In addition to associating plots, rejecting false alarms and estimating heading and speed, the radar tracker also acts as a filter, in which errors in the individual radar measurements are smoothed out. In essence, the radar tracker fits a smooth curve to the reported plots and, if done correctly, can increase the overall accuracy of the radar system.A multisensor tracker extends the concept of the multiradar tracker to allow the combination of reports from different types of sensor - typically <b>radars,</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radars</b> (SSR), identification friend or foe (IFF) systems and electronic support measures (ESM) data.|$|R

In order to voluntarily equip, owners and operators must receive benefits from the technology that outweigh the cost or receive other incentives. Through an online survey of stakeholders, applications of ADS-B with the strongest benefits to users are identified. In-cockpit data link offerings are explored in detail, along with a detailed analysis of ADS-B benefits for Hawaiian helicopter operators.

40|$|Automatic {{dependent}} surveillance – broadcast (ADS-B) is {{a central}} component of the NextGen air traffic control program. This surveillance technology can replace current <b>secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radars</b> (SSR) and improve cockpit situational awareness. The service can improve traffic surveillance capabilities by sharing accurate aircraft position information between pilots and air traffic controllers. In addition, ADS-B provides pilots with weather as well as air traffic information for nearby area. In order to receive these traffic and weather services, a pilot must have appropriate onboard equipment including GPS receiver, Universal Access Transceiver, antenna and multi-function cockpit display which is capable of receiving and displaying information. Compared to traditional surveillance technology used in air traffic control, aircraft updates and broadcasts its information more rapidly with ADS-B since it determines its position via satellite navigation, enabling it to be tracked. ADS-B also has a large coverage including most of areas in the world. This feature is especially helpful in special areas such as mountain area for air traffic controllers. The most important potential of ADS-B is to enable procedures not possible with current SSR that would increase the capacity of airspace system due to its high navigation accuracy. ADS-B {{is also helpful to}} improve the safety in air traffic. However, ADS-B program hasn 2 ̆ 7 t been operating well even though FAA highly recommended it and made rules on it. This paper discussed the basic advantages and disadvantages of ADS-B. The experiment was designed to estimate the navigation accuracy of ADS-B by modeling several flights in MATLAB with data from FAA and IGS and then compare the result in ideal situation with current surveillance technology. The result showed that the accuracy of ADS-B is higher than current radar system in this designed situation. The limit of the experiment and its difference to the real world are discussed in the paper as well. ...|$|R
