40|$|International audienceIn this {{technical}} note, {{stability and}} stabilization of two time <b>scale</b> <b>switched</b> linear {{systems in the}} singular perturbation form are addressed in discrete time. We show that, under an arbitrary switching rule, stability of the slow and fast switched subsystems {{is not sufficient to}} assess stability of the original two time <b>scale</b> <b>switched</b> system, even if the singular perturbation parameter tends to zero. Therefore, we propose LMI based conditions that guarantee the asymptotic stability of the two time <b>scale</b> <b>switched</b> system using switched quadratic Lyapunov functions. These conditions express the fact that the coupling between fast and slow subsystems has {{to be taken into account}} in addition to stability properties of the two subsystems, when the switching rule is arbitrary. The presented conditions are extended to state feedback control design. A numerical example illustrates the features of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|A set {{of energy}} {{conservation}} actions that cut across {{all sectors of}} the economy were analyzed so that all actions under consideration be analyzed systematically and as a whole.

40|$|There is {{no single}} answer to the {{question}} of how people should live, nor any silver bullet for solving current ecological problems—and yet, contemporary design must seek ways to think and act in light of emerging environmental challenges. We present here an overview of the Switch! design research program, a continuation of our previous work on how interaction and product design can promote awareness of energy use in everyday life. Extending this approach to a larger architectural and urban <b>scale,</b> <b>Switch!</b> was set up to explore the possibilities of design as an intervention into multiple and interpenetrating technical, material and social systems—or ecologies. In addition to designing materials, objects, and interfaces, Switch! also examines how design can be engaged in staging potential scenarios, narratives and debates. The design of interventions into energy ecologies and the use of design methods become a platform for exposing existing habits and hidden norms as well as for proposing alternative actions and views. These propositions have been developed through practical experimentation and the materialization of design examples. Central to our investigation is how critical practice enables us to examine and discuss the concepts, strategies and ideologies underlying sustainable design. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{cerebral}} cortex development, multipotent neural progenitor cells generate {{a variety of}} neuronal subtypes in a fixed temporal order. How a single neural progenitor cell generates the diversity of cortical projection neurons in a temporal sequence is not well understood. Based on their function in developmental timing in other systems, Dicer and microRNAs are potential candidate regulators of cellular pathways that control lineage progression in neural systems. RESULTS: Cortex-specific deletion of Dicer results in a marked reduction in the cellular complexity of the cortex, due to a pronounced narrowing {{in the range of}} neuronal types generated by Dicer-null cortical stem and progenitor cells. Instead of generating different classes of lamina-specific neurons in order over the 6 -day period of neurogenesis, Dicer null cortical stem and progenitor cells continually produce one class of deep layer projection neuron. However, gliogenesis in the Dicer-null {{cerebral cortex}} was not delayed, despite the loss of multipotency and the failure of neuronal lineage progression. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Dicer is required for regulating cortical stem cell multipotency with respect to neuronal diversity, without affecting the larger <b>scale</b> <b>switch</b> from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. The differences in phenotypes reported from different timings of Dicer deletion indicate that the molecular pathways regulating developmental transitions are notably dosage sensitive...|$|E

40|$|The main {{requirement}} for the Next Generation Transport Network infrastructure is a flexible and efficient support of different services, demanding for several levels of Quality of Service (QoS) and resilience. In order to have an effective utilization of network resources, {{and the ability to}} react to traffic demand changes with time, such multi-service next generation transport networks, should be, to some extend, self-adapting. This requirement are pushing the migration from the traditional legacy circuit based transport networks towards integrated packet optical solutions. The need to introduce packet flexibility into the optics world relying on huge and reliable static pipes, without impacting the scalability of the nodes has lead to multilayer solutions such as current MSPP and POTP platforms based on multiple switching layers (i. e. packet, OTN and optical). This however requires complex control plane functionalities that limit their effectiveness and flexibility. This paper presents a new approach for next generation optical packet transport, based on a pure Layer 2 switching, that is Ethernet compliant since it does not require changes in Ethernet frame format and main Ethernet switch functionalities. It relies on a burst transmission structure that allows to reduce packet processing without introducing underlaid switching layers and consequently to <b>scale</b> <b>switch</b> forwarding functionalities. It could be regarded as a concrete step towards the realization of self-adapting networks. Some relevant simulation results are reported to discuss the main characteristics of such a new transport solution and assess the feasibility of the concept. © 2011 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|The laser {{trigger switch}} (LTS) {{is a key}} {{component}} in ZR-type pulsed power systems. In ZR, the pulse rise time through the LTS is > 200 ns and additional stages of pulse compression are required to achieve the desired < 100 ns rise time. The inductance of the LTS ({approx} 500 nH) in large part determines the energy transfer time through the switch and {{there is much to}} be gained in improving system performance and reducing system costs by reducing this inductance. The current path through the cascade section of the ZR LTS is at a diameter of {approx} 6 -inches which is certainly not optimal from an inductance point of view. The LTS connects components of much greater diameter (typically 4 - 5 feet). In this LDRD the viability of switch concepts in which the diameter of cascade section is greatly increased have been investigated. The key technical question to be answered was, will the desired multi-channel behavior be maintained in a cascade section of larger diameter. This LDRD proceeded in 2 distinct phases. The original plan for the LDRD was to develop a promising switch concept and then design, build, and test a moderate <b>scale</b> <b>switch</b> which would demonstrate the key features of the concept. In phase I, a switch concept which meet all electrical design criteria and had a calculated inductance of 150 nH was developed. A 1. 5 MV test switch was designed and fabrication was initiated. The LDRD was then redirected due to budgetary concerns. The fabrication of the switch was halted and the focus of the LDRD was shifted to small scale experiments designed to answer the key technical question concerning multi-channel behavior. In phase II, the Multi-channel switch test bed (MCST) was designed and constructed. The purpose of MCST was to provide a versatile, fast turn around facility for the study the multi-channel electrical breakdown behavior of a ZR type cascade switch gap in a parameter space near that of a ZR LTS.

The characteristics of the modeled are simulated by using the beam propagation method.

In the analysis of the modulation efficiency of the switch, it is revealed that a large positive refractive index change will produce higher modulation efficiency than a negative refractive index change because of optical field re-distribution.

50|$|As {{discussed}} for {{the linear}} case above, the peaking phenomenon present in Luenberger observers justifies {{the use of}} a sliding mode observer. The sliding mode observer uses non-linear high-gain feedback to drive estimated states to a hypersurface where there is no difference between the estimated output and the measured output. The non-linear gain used in the observer is typically implemented with a <b>scaled</b> <b>switching</b> function, like the signum (i.e., sgn) of the estimated - measured output error. Hence, due to this high-gain feedback, the vector field of the observer has a crease in it so that observer trajectories slide along a curve where the estimated output matches the measured output exactly. So, if the system is observable from its output, the observer states will all be driven to the actual system states. Additionally, by using the sign of the error to drive the sliding mode observer, the observer trajectories become insensitive to many forms of noise. Hence, some sliding mode observers have attractive properties similar to the Kalman filter but with simpler implementation.|$|R

40|$|Wavelength-selective {{switches}} for mode-division-multiplexing {{systems are}} designed by <b>scaling</b> <b>switches</b> from single-mode systems. All modes {{at a given}} wavelength are switched as a unit, which is necessary in systems with substantial mode coupling, and minimizes the number of ports required to accommodate a given traffic volume. When a pure mode is present at the input, modal transmission and coupling coefficients are mode-dependent and may be computed using a simple mode-clipping model. When multiple modes are present, interference between modes alters the transmission and coupling coefficients, shifting the passband center frequency and changing its bandwidth. Mode-coupling matrices are used to compute mixed modes having the narrowest or widest bandwidths, or having the largest center-frequency offsets. In a specific design for graded-index fiber, five mode groups and 50 -GHz channel spacing, the one-sided bandwidth may change up to ± 3. 6 GHz.
