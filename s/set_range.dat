Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake {{a number of different}} behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no <b>set</b> <b>range</b> had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.|$|E

2500|$|The Allies {{captured}} {{and examined the}} PWK, but initially showed {{little interest in the}} new system developed by the Germans. [...] The first example of a type of High-Low System developed after World War II was the British Limbo antisubmarine weapon, which launched depth charge-like projectiles. [...] The Limbo was a development of the World War II Squid, which, while effective, was limited by a <b>set</b> <b>range</b> of 275 meters. [...] The Limbo, by opening and closing vents that varied the pressure of the gases on firing, allowed for a range that could be varied between 336 meters to almost 1000 meters.|$|E
2500|$|To do this, a {{controller}} {{with the}} requisite corrective behaviour is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares {{it with the}} reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are [...] controllability and observability. On this is based the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is feedback control, which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a <b>set</b> <b>range</b> {{by means of a}} [...] "final control element", such as a control valve.|$|E
