5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatment,</b> to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatment</b> of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature bloodâ€“brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E

25|$|Because {{infection}} is rarely <b>symptomatic,</b> <b>treatment</b> is rarely required. There {{have been no}} published trials so treatment remains empirical. Agents {{that have been used}} include albendazole, metronidazole and cotrimoxazole for myositis. Corticosteroids have also been used for symptomatic relief.|$|E
25|$|A <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatment</b> {{includes}} rehydration {{and pain}} relief with {{drugs such as}} paracetamol (acetaminophen in the United States). Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect, which can be devastating {{in the case of}} internal bleeding that can occur with yellow fever.|$|E
50|$|Because pachygyria is a {{structural}} defect no treatments are currently available other than <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatments,</b> especially for associated seizures.

25|$|Immunocompetent {{individuals}} with cryptosporidiosis typically suffer a short (i.e., duration {{of less than}} 2 weeks) self-limiting course of diarrhea that may require <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatment</b> and ends with spontaneous recovery; in some circumstances, antiparasitic medication may be required (e.g., recurrent, severe, or persistent symptoms); however reinfection frequently occurs.|$|E
25|$|Nimesulide is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) {{with pain}} medication and fever reducing properties. Its approved indications are {{the treatment of}} acute pain, the <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatment</b> of osteoarthritis, and primary dysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults above 12 years old. It has a multifactorial mode of action and {{is characterized by a}} fast onset of action.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is {{primarily}} supportive in nature. Early supportive care with rehydration and <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatment</b> improves survival. Rehydration may be via the oral or by intravenous route. These measures may include management of pain, nausea, fever and anxiety. The World Health Organization recommends avoiding {{the use of}} aspirin or ibuprofen for pain due to the bleeding risk associated with use of these medications.|$|E

40|$|A high {{percentage}} of diabetic patients develop peripheral neuropathy with more than 10 % suffering from severe symptoms. Therapeutic alternatives for diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) have so far involved pathogenesis oriented or <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatments.</b> These two therapeutic approaches differ in their effects: the former aims to reverse, halt or delay progression of neuropathic damage, while the latter aims to relieve neuropathic pain and its associated secondary consequences without impact on the underlying neuropathic process. Most guidelines recommend <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatments</b> to alleviate the complaints associated with DSPN. Tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, and alpha(2) -delta ligands are frequently mentioned as first-line drugs for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, new evidence points to pathogenesis-oriented treatments based on alpha-lipoic acid or benfotiamine as promising therapeutic alternatives to classical purely <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatments.</b> A few new trials have reported an advantage of combination therapies versus single-drug administration, but the limited extent of studies on specific combinations together with design flaws in these studies have caused reluctance in recommending combination therapy as a first treatment option in guidelines. However, combination therapy stands as a powerful instrument for DSPN treatment based on the positive evidence accumulated and the otherwise common use of multidrug treatments in clinical diabetic neuropathy...|$|R

25|$|There is no {{specific}} antidote for overdose and all treatment is purely supportive and <b>symptomatic.</b> <b>Treatment</b> with activated charcoal {{may be used}} to limit absorption in cases of oral overdose. Anyone suspected of overdosing on clomipramine should be hospitalised and kept under close surveillance for at least 72 hours. Clomipramine has been reported as being less toxic in overdose than most other TCAs in one meta-analysis but this may well be due to the circumstances surrounding most overdoses as clomipramine is more frequently used to treat conditions for which the rate of suicide is not particularly high such as OCD. In another meta-analysis, however, clomipramine was associated with a significant degree of toxicity in overdose.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of the visible blistering caused by varicella zoster virus varies in children usually from 4 to 7 days, {{and the appearance of}} new blisters begins to subside after the fifth day. Chickenpox infection is milder in young children, and <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatment,</b> with sodium bicarbonate baths or antihistamine medication may ease itching. It is recommended to keep new infants from birth up to age 6 months away from an infected person for 10 to 21 days because their immune systems are not developed enough to handle the stress it can bring on. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is widely used to reduce fever. Aspirin, or products containing aspirin, should not be given to children with chickenpox, as it can cause Reye's Syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Another {{death was}} {{confirmed}} on 24 August 2009. Death toll now increased to 69. The patient, a 38-year-old teacher, {{who was also}} obese, tested positive for H1N1 by a private clinic. Tamiflu was not administered but only gave her <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatment.</b> Five days later, on 18 August, she {{was admitted to the}} hospital after suffering from breathing difficulties and cyanosis. She was referred to KL Hospital and Tamiflu was administered. However, the woman died on 19 August due to pneumonia with AVDS. One more death was confirmed on 25 August 2009. Confirmed by the Mortality Review Committee, the 3-year-old boy who had febrile convulsion and cough was hospitalised on 12 August. The boy was then transferred to ICU after his condition deteriorate and tamiflu was administered. He tested positive for the flu on 17 August.

25|$|Medical {{treatment}} with anti-vertigo medications {{may be considered}} in acute, severe exacerbation of BPPV, {{but in most cases}} are not indicated. These primarily include drugs of the anti-histamine and anti-cholinergic class, such as meclizine and hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine) respectively. The medical management of vestibular syndromes has become increasingly popular over the last decade, and numerous novel drug therapies (including existing drugs with new indications) have emerged for the treatment of vertigo/dizziness syndromes. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action, with many of them being receptor- or ion channel-specific. Among them are betahistine or dexamethasone/gentamicin for the treatment of MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease, carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine for the treatment of paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia in multiple sclerosis, metoprolol/topiramate or valproic acid/tricyclic antidepressant for the treatment of vestibular migraine, and 4-aminopyridine for the treatment of episodic ataxia type 2 and both downbeat and upbeat nystagmus. These drug therapies offer <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatment,</b> and do not affect the disease process or resolution rate. Medications may be used to suppress symptoms during the positioning maneuvers if the patient's symptoms are severe and intolerable. More dose-specific studies are required, however, {{in order to determine the}} most effective drug(s) for both acute symptom relief and long-term remission of the condition.|$|E
25|$|Treatment in {{the acute}} setting is mostly focused on {{symptomatic}} management. After initial {{treatment in the}} hospital, some patients will need short-term placement {{in a nursing home}} or rehabilitation facility before going home. In hospital settings the doctors work with speech pathologists in issues like these. Typically, a commonly used tool to assess the degree of severity of dysphagia and speech issues is the Barnes Jewish Hospital Stroke Dysphagia Screen, which offers a validated guide to assessing plan of action (solid food diet, all liquid diet, IV hydration, etc.) for the patient while in the hospital and the proper course of action in the outpatient setting. Rehabilitation in Wallenbergâ€™s Syndrome focuses on improving balance, coordination, working on activities of daily living, and improving speech and swallowing function. Severe nausea and vertigo can be present and limit progress in rehabilitation and recovery. <b>Symptomatic</b> <b>treatment</b> with anti-emetics and medications for the hiccups are important. Commonly used anti-emetics include ondansetron, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and promethazine. These medications are also used to treat hiccups, along with chlorpromazine. There are case reports of other medications useful in treating hiccups in Wallenbergâ€™s Syndrome including baclofen and anti-epileptic medications. The prognosis for someone with lateral medullary syndrome depends upon the size and location of damaged area of the brain stem. Some individuals recover quickly while others may have significant neurological disabilities for months to years after the initial injury.|$|E

60|$|On {{this point}} {{he had the}} {{concurrence}} of Mr. Pratt, the only other medical man of the same standing in Milby. Otherwise, it was remarkable how strongly these two clever men were contrasted. Pratt was middle-sized, insinuating, and silvery-voiced; Pilgrim was tall, heavy, rough-mannered, and spluttering. Both were considered to have great powers of conversation, but Pratt's anecdotes were of the fine old crusted quality to be procured only of Joe Miller; Pilgrim's had the full fruity flavour {{of the most recent}} scandal. Pratt elegantly referred all diseases to debility, and, with a proper contempt for <b>symptomatic</b> <b>treatment,</b> went to the root of the matter with port wine and bark; Pilgrim was persuaded that the evil principle in the human system was plethora, and he made war against it with cupping, blistering, and cathartics. They had both been long established in Milby, and as each had a sufficient practice, there was no very malignant rivalry between them; on the contrary, they had that sort of friendly contempt for each other which is always conducive to a good understanding between professional men; and when any new surgeon attempted, in an ill-advised hour, to settle himself in the town, it was strikingly demonstrated how slight and trivial are theoretic differences compared with the broad basis of common human feeling. There was the most perfect unanimity between Pratt and Pilgrim in the determination to drive away the obnoxious and too probably unqualified intruder as soon as possible. Whether the first wonderful cure he effected was on a patient of Pratt's or of Pilgrim's, one was as ready as the other to pull the interloper by the nose, and both alike directed their remarkable powers of conversation towards making the town too hot for him. But by their respective patients these two distinguished men were pitted against each other with great virulence. Mrs. Lowme could not conceal her amazement that Mrs. Phipps should trust her life in the hands of Pratt, who let her feed herself up to that degree, it was really shocking to hear how short her breath was; and Mrs. Phipps had no patience with Mrs. Lowme, living, as she did, on tea and broth, and looking as yellow as any crow-flower, and yet letting Pilgrim bleed and blister her and give her lowering medicine till her clothes hung on her like a scarecrow's. On the whole, perhaps, Mr. Pilgrim's reputation was at the higher pitch, and when any lady under Mr. Pratt's care was doing ill, she was half disposed to think that a little more active treatment' might suit her better. But without very definite provocation no one would take so serious a step as to part with the family doctor, for in those remote days there were few varieties of human hatred more formidable than the medical. The doctor's estimate, even of a confiding patient, was apt to rise and fall with the entries in the day-book; and I have known Mr. Pilgrim discover the most unexpected virtues in a patient seized with a promising illness. At such times you might have been glad to perceive that there were some of Mr. Pilgrim's fellow-creatures of whom he entertained a high opinion, and that he was liable to the amiable weakness of a too admiring estimate. A good inflammation fired his enthusiasm, and a lingering dropsy dissolved him into charity. Doubtless this crescendo of benevolence was partly due to feelings not at all represented by the entries in the day-book; for in Mr. Pilgrim's heart, too, there was a latent store of tenderness and pity which flowed forth at the sight of suffering. Gradually, however, as his patients became convalescent, his view of their characters became more dispassionate; when they could relish mutton-chops, he began to admit that they had foibles, {{and by the time they}} had swallowed their last dose of tonic, he was alive to their most inexcusable faults. After this, the thermometer of his regard rested at the moderate point of friendly back-biting, which sufficed to make him agreeable in his morning visits to the amiable and worthy persons who were yet far from convalescent.|$|E
