Later {{in the season}} they become smoother and darker. Fruit: Typical conical acorn and cup. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Hydolyzable gallotannins are converted in the rumen to gallic acid, pyrogallol and resorcinol. Green acorns are more toxic. SYNDROMES: Tannins, Primary nephropathy, Acorn poisoning. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Urogenital system. CLINICAL SIGNS: • In South Africa only bovines are affected. • Usually animals under 2 years of age most susceptible. • Develop craving. • Horses and sheep are susceptible. • Pigs thrive on it and are not susceptible. • Latent period of few days. Gastrointestinal Tract: - Inappetance, abdominal pain - Constipation - soon changes to persistent diarrhoea leading to dehydration and emaciation Urinary System: - Polyuria/anuria - Urine initially dark, haemorrhagic - later pale - Uraemic signs of kidney failure - Prognosis poor - 80 % plus mortalityCLINICAL PATHOLOGY: Marked elevation of BUN and creatinine, hypoproteinaemia.

40|$|Although the <b>slaking</b> of <b>lime</b> is a {{reaction}} of great antiquity, {{there have been}} few fundamental studies of its kinetics and mechanism. In this paper, the kinetics of the reaction are reported for lime samples in two different arrangements: rotating discs and powders. In the former case, the rate was measured by solution analysis; in the latter, by calorimetry. The rate of slaking of a rotating lime disc was approximately constant with time but depended on the disc rotation speed. In the presence of Ca 2 + or OH− ions, the slaking rate was reduced. These results were accounted for by assuming that the slow step {{in the early stages of}} the slaking reaction was the diffusion of calcium hydroxide away from the reacting surface. Reasonable agreement between the measured slaking rates and those calculated on the assumption of slow calcium hydroxide diffusion was obtained. When powder samples were used, the rates of slaking could be fitted to the equation for a shrinking sphere model. It was shown that the effect of increasing the calcium oxide particle size or increasing either the time or temperature of preparation from calcium carbonate was to decrease the rate. Electron micrographs of the powdered <b>lime</b> before <b>slaking</b> were used to interpret these results.
