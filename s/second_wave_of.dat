While punk rock remained largely an underground phenomenon in North America, Australia, and the new spots where it was emerging, in the UK it briefly became a major sensation.|$|E

40|$|Background: Certain {{types of}} news {{coverage}} {{can increase the}} likelihood of suicide. This study explores, how media covered a suicide case in a country, where there was no available guideline, though it was among the leading countries in suicide statistics. The specific aim was to compare the first and <b>second</b> <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> reporting on suicide from the same website. Methods: In 2011, two young women committed double suicide in Budapest, Hungary. We analyzed the first and <b>second</b> <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> the reported articles about this double suicide case, in online daily newspapers, news portals and also the readers’ comments. Results: Provocative aspects were present in 38. 9 - 100. 0 % of the articles, while preventive aspects were found in 0 - 22. 2 % of the articles. Readers commented in 49. 6 % "Other Aspects" (comments about all other aspects not belonging to any other category, i. e. Risk Behavior, Family Relations, Suicide Place and Methods, Prevention, Media Style Reporting) and in 25. 4 % "Without Content" (comments without a specific content: e. g. chatting), while "Prevention" (comments about possible safety preventive measures) was mentioned only in 1. 5 % of the comments. In 34. 1 % the emotional tonality of the comments was "Neutral" (indifferent comments: e. g. chatting). Though articles published for the second time were significantly longer than the firstly published ones, the preventive aspects of reporting were not added to the second articles either, but significantly more provocative aspects were found in them. Conclusions: The suicide reports, both in the first and <b>second</b> <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> reporting, were not in line with the recommendation of the international guidelines on suicide reporting. It draws the attention of professionals to the importance of developing national guidelines on media suicide coverage...|$|R

5|$|The <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> {{parachute}} {{troops were}} dropped in two groups {{to the west}} of the cemetery at about midday. The drop zone was within fields of fire of the Partisans {{to the west of}} Drvar, and they suffered many casualties during the drop. Collecting the remainder, Rybka mounted a second attack, but the pressure on his flanks was too heavy, and the assault again failed. Fighting continued throughout the afternoon with both sides taking heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|The <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> the 1918 {{pandemic}} {{was much}} deadlier than the first. The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those {{most at risk}} were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. But in August, when the second wave began in France, Sierra Leone and the United States, the virus had mutated to a much deadlier form.|$|E
5|$|A <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> work {{took place}} on the city walls in the late 15th century. Backed by {{substantial}} communal effort and financial contributions, Newingate was rebuilt between 1450 and 1470, and probably closely resembled the West Gate in style. Burgate was rebuilt in brick from 1475 onwards, again thanks to public contributions, but it was not completed until 1525, furnished with gunports and anachronistic battlements. Queningate was closed up at shortly after the 15th century, probably following {{the construction of a new}} postern gate nearby. West Gate was appointed the city gaol in 1453 by Henry VI, with Canterbury Castle serving as the county gaol.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, {{the castle}} was {{suffering}} badly {{from the effects}} of coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, carrying out a <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for £35 to form part of the local sea defences.

5|$|English Salukis (chiefly {{descendants}} of Sarona Kelb) were exported to many countries, {{but by the}} mid-1930s, interest slackened, and with the outbreak of World War II, breeding and show activities almost entirely stopped. The number of litters was minimal – just {{enough to keep the}} breed alive. Food rationing reserved all edible meat for humans, and to prevent the Salukis from dying from starvation or being killed by bombs, some owners euthanized entire kennels. A small number of Saluki kennels survived the war, and along with fresh imports belonging to a <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> soldiers returning from the Middle East, the slow process of re-establishing the breed began again.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the true}} <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> {{immigration}} {{did not begin}} until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished national origins quotas. After the passage of that act, Armenians from the Soviet Union, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran and other Middle Eastern countries began migrating in large numbers, many fleeing political instability in their host countries. In the 1950s, most Armenian immigrants in the US were from Soviet Armenia and Turkey. The Istanbul pogrom in 1955 frightened the local Turkish Armenian population, which looked to the West for a safe and more prosperous life.|$|E

5000|$|Its {{history has}} been broad and varied, from classic works of nineteenth-century women authors such as George Eliot and Margaret Fuller to {{cutting-edge}} theoretical work in women's studies and gender studies by [...] "third-wave" [...] authors. In general, feminist literary criticism before the 1970s—in the first and <b>second</b> <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> feminism—was concerned with women's authorship and the representation of women's condition within literature; including the depiction of fictional female characters. In addition, feminist literary criticism {{is concerned with the}} exclusion of women from the literary canon.|$|R
5000|$|The Second Aliyah (1904-14), {{began after}} the Kishinev pogrom; some 40,000 Jews settled in Palestine, {{although}} {{nearly half of}} them left eventually. Both the first and <b>second</b> <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> migrants were mainly Orthodox Jews, although the Second Aliyah included socialist groups who established the kibbutz movement. During World War I, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour sent the Balfour Declaration of 1917 to Baron Rothschild (Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild), {{a leader of the}} British Jewish community, that stated that Britain intended {{for the creation of a}} Jewish [...] "national home" [...] within the Palestinian Mandate.|$|R
5|$|In 1961, type 1 and 2 {{monovalent}} oral poliovirus vaccine (MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent OPV (TOPV) was licensed, {{and became}} the vaccine of choice in the United States and most other countries of the world, largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine. A <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> mass immunizations led to a further dramatic {{decline in the number}} of polio cases. Between 1962 and 1965 about 100 million Americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the Sabin vaccine. The result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases, even from the much reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine.|$|E
5|$|In 842 and 851, Canterbury {{suffered}} {{great loss}} of life during Danish raids. In 978, Archbishop Dunstan refounded the abbey built by Augustine, and named it St Augustine's Abbey. A <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> Danish attacks began in 991, and in 1011 the cathedral was burnt and Archbishop Alphege was killed in 1012. Remembering the destruction caused by the Danes, the inhabitants of Canterbury did not resist William the Conqueror's invasion in 1066. William immediately ordered a wooden motte-and-bailey castle to be built by the Roman city wall. In the early 12th century, the castle was rebuilt with stone.|$|E

Arctic Monkeys were the most prominent act to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking, with two No. 1 singles and Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), which became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.|$|E
