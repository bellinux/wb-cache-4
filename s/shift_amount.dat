40|$|Abstract. A partial {{evaluator}} {{is said to}} be Jones-optimal if {{the result}} of specializing a self-interpreter with respect to a source program is textually identical to the source program, modulo renaming. Jones optimality has already been obtained if the self-interpreter is untyped. If the selfinterpreter is typed, however, residual programs are cluttered with type tags. To obtain the original source program, these tags must be removed. A number of sophisticated solutions have already been proposed. We observe, however, that with a simple representation shift, ordinary partial evaluation is already Jones-optimal, modulo an encoding. The representation <b>shift</b> <b>amounts</b> to reading the type tags as constructors for higherorder abstract syntax. We substantiate our observation by considering a typed self-interpreter whose input syntax is higher-order. Specializing this interpreter with respect to a source program yields a residual program that is textually identical to the source program, modulo renaming. ...|$|R

Still, few studies jointly addressed these tasks so far, mainly because separation is often based on the Short Term Fourier Transform (STFT) whereas recent music analysis algorithms are rather based on the Constant-Q Transform (CQT). The CQT is practical for pitch estimation because a pitch <b>shift</b> <b>amounts</b> to a translation of the CQT representation, whereas it produces a scaling of the STFT. Conversely, no simple inversion of the CQT was available until recently, preventing it from being used for source separation.
