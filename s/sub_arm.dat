5000|$|Notch Hill, on CP's Shuswap <b>Sub</b> near Salmon <b>Arm,</b> British Columbia.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, retired Commander Vadim Pavlovich Orlov, a {{participant}} in the events, held a press conference revealing the <b>subs</b> were <b>armed</b> with nuclear missiles, and that Arkhipov was the reason those devices had not been fired. Orlov presented the events less dramatically, saying that Captain Savitsky lost his temper, but eventually calmed down.|$|R

50|$|Samples are {{collected}} {{by a pair}} of manipulator arms; skilled pilots can use the <b>sub's</b> two <b>arms,</b> the right one more versatile than the left, to collect samples and store them in a mounted basket for later evaluation. The manipulator arms are also used to place temperature probes in hydrothermal vents, and occasionally for movement instead of thrusters, in order to avoid disturbing sediment.|$|R
5000|$|Descent, {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the dive to arrival at the seafloor, took two hours and 37 minutes, almost twice as fast as the descent of Trieste. A Rolex watch, [...] "worn" [...] on the <b>sub's</b> robotic <b>arm,</b> continued to function normally throughout the dive. Not all systems functioned as planned on the record-breaking dive: bait-carrying landers were not dropped in advance of the dive because the sonar needed to find them on the ocean floor was not working, and hydraulic system problems hampered the use of sampling equipment. Nevertheless, after roughly three hours on the seafloor and a successful ascent, further exploration of the Challenger Deep with the unique sub was planned for later in the Spring of 2012.|$|R
2500|$|An attack {{submarine}} or hunter-killer submarine is a submarine {{specifically designed for}} the purpose of attacking and sinking other submarines, surface combatants and merchant vessels. [...] In the Soviet and Russian navies they were and are called [...] "multi-purpose submarines". They are also used to protect friendly surface combatants and missile submarines. [...] Some attack <b>subs</b> are also <b>armed</b> with cruise missiles mounted in vertical launch tubes, increasing the scope of their potential missions to include land targets.|$|R
5000|$|In late March 2012, Rolex {{announced}} that a new prototype diving watch was developed and {{is part of the}} Rolex supported attempt to dive the DSV Deepsea Challenger {{to the bottom of the}} Challenger Deep, the deepest surveyed point in the oceans.On 26 March 2012 the DSV Deepsea Challenger carried a Rolex Oyster Perpetual Date Sea-Dweller DEEPSEA CHALLENGE prototype diving watch strapped to its manipulator arm to a depth of 10898.4 m of seawater (msw).The experimental Sea-Dweller DEEPSEA CHALLENGE watch is designed to be waterproof up to 12000 m. According to the pilot of the DSV Deepsea Challenger, James Cameron, the [...] "Rolex Deepsea Challenge was the reliable companion throughout the dive; it was visible on the <b>sub's</b> manipulator <b>arm</b> and working precisely at 10,898 meters down at the bottom of the Challenger Deep."The normal surface air filled watch case has a diameter of 51.4 mm and a thickness of 28.5 mm (domed synthetic sapphire crystal 14.3 mm) to cope with the water pressure at the deepest surveyed point in the oceans.|$|R
40|$|Secondary, lambda sub 2, and tertiary, lambda <b>sub</b> 3, {{dendrite}} <b>arm</b> spacings {{have been}} measured from Al-Si alloys which were directionally solidified as functions of growth velocity, V, temperature gradient, G, and composition, Co. Both lambda sub 2 and lambda sub 3 decreased as the imposed growth velocity and silicon concentrations were increased, {{and for each}} function a systematic variance in the rate was seen. Complications with measuring secondary arm spacings are shown and {{it was found that}} the tertiary arm data agree much better with coarsening theory, the implication being that lambda sub 3, when measurable, is a more representative and reliable measure of the solidification history than lambda sub 2...|$|R
50|$|The game {{is divided}} into two parts; one in which the player {{controls}} the seaQuest in an isometric perspective overworld and is able to buy equipment and weapons and travel the ocean quadrant, and horizontal scrolling shooter style missions, in which the player must achieve various objectives using a complement of mini-subs, robots, and a trained dolphin wearing an aqua-lung. Some of the missions are simplistic and require the player to make use of only one of the seaQuest's vessels; others have the player make use of several of them in succession. For example, there's a mission in the first ocean quadrants where the player must rescue the crew of an exploration vessel trapped in a caved-in underwater cave, and has to use <b>armed</b> <b>subs</b> to clear several cave-ins before they can bring in the only mini-sub that's equipped to rescue personnel from other subs. The missions also typically involve combat between the player's mini-subs and the units of pirates, eco-terrorists, and other foes, but also more often than not require the player to perform some sort of non-combat task such as the aforementioned rescue operation.|$|R
5000|$|Inverlyon, {{a fishing}} smack, {{was one of}} these vessels. Fitted with a 3-pounder and {{commanded}} by Jehan, Inverlyon sailed for enemy infested waters. While sailing off the coast of Great Yarmouth on 14 August 1915, Gunner Jehan received news that a merchant ship, the Bona Fide, of 59 tons, had been stopped by the German submarine [...] and subsequently scuttled with explosives by a boarding party. By the next day Ernest had rushed to the Bona Fides last known position, at about 20:20 hours, The German sub surfaced near the Inverlyon. Then from the submarines conning tower came the shouts from a German sailor ordering Inverlyons crew to prepare for boarding. Naturally the Q-ship disregarded the German officers order. Jehan waited until the submarine came to 30 yards (27m) away when he gave the command to raise the White Ensign and open fire. A series of three rounds from the sailing ships gun struck the U-boats conning tower and bridge, disabling the German commander. UB-4 then drifted behind Inverlyon, where her gun crew fired another six shots into UB-4s hull while others raked the <b>sub</b> with small <b>arms</b> fire. The U-boat then began to take on water from the bow area; the submarine was almost vertical before slipping beneath the waves and getting caught on Inverlyons fishing net. Because the submarine was caught on Inverlyons net, Jehan sent a message home asking if the submarine should be raised and salvaged. The Admiralty replied with a negative response so the net was simply cut, allowing UB-4 to finish sinking to the bottom. All of the crew and commanding officer, Lt. Karl Gross, were killed. As result of the battle, Ernest Martin Jehan was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on 19 November 1915, and promoted to lieutenant.|$|R
