5|$|After August II's {{death in}} 1733, he rekindled his old ties with Leszczyński, but made some {{attempts}} to secure his own {{election to the}} throne. Eventually, however, he decided to grant Leszczyński his full support, doing <b>so</b> <b>during</b> the convocation sejm of 1733. He again served as Leszczyński's diplomat during the following War of the Polish Succession.|$|E
5|$|Broods {{that fail}} {{tend to do}} <b>so</b> <b>during</b> incubation. One English study showed that only 14.5% of eggs survived to hatching, but once that stage was reached the chances of {{fledging}} successfully were high. European nightjars breed when aged one year, and typically live for four years. The adult annual survival rate is 70%, but that for juveniles is unknown. The maximum known age in the wild is just over 12years.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Division's {{structure}} changed considerably during World War II, with units being detached or {{attached to}} meet operational needs. This was particularly <b>so</b> <b>during</b> early 1942 and late 1943. Below is a divisional {{order of battle}} that is indicative of its generic make up. In addition to those listed, during 1942–1943, the 14th, 21st, 25th and 30th Brigades were also attached, albeit temporarily for varying periods.|$|E

5|$|As was {{the case}} with his grandfather, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Iskandar's {{independent}} mindset resulted in strained relations with the Malaysian federal government on numerous occasions. This was more <b>so</b> <b>during</b> his days as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, whereby a number of notable public incidents involved Sultan Iskandar. Nevertheless, Sultan Iskandar was reputed to show great concern to his subjects, and was held in high esteem by many of his subjects–particularly the Malays and Orang Aslis.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's {{frequent}} co-star, Pat O'Brien, {{appeared with}} him on the British chat show Parkinson in the early 1980s and they both made a surprise appearance at the Queen Mother's command birthday performance at the London Palladium in 1980. His appearance on stage prompted the Queen Mother to rise to her feet, the only time she did <b>so</b> <b>during</b> the whole show, and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{became a}} full {{professor}} at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do <b>so.</b> <b>During</b> his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. In July 1912, {{he returned to his}} alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.|$|E

5|$|It is an {{amalgamation}} {{of design}} features from other revolvers {{made during the}} time period. The revolver has a design flaw in that the cylinder freewheels when not engaged, <b>so</b> <b>during</b> movement (such as in combat) it may rotate to an already fired chamber. Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used is unique to the weapon. The Type 26 has a double-action only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately. The Type 26 {{was replaced by the}} Nambu pistol {{in the first half of}} the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Light {{wind shear}} and {{favorable}} ocean temperatures led to steady intensification of the storm, and satellite images indicated that an eye had developed late on August 31. Minimum pressure lowered to , and the maximum winds increased to 100mph, Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm quickly reached Category3, a major hurricane, and soon after, Category4. As it did so, its eye became ragged, while its lateral {{movement to the}} northwest rose to 17mph around the southern periphery of a strong deep-layer ridge over the United States. By September 1, the hurricane reached its peak intensity of 160mph (260km/h) and a minimum pressure of 921mb (hPa). It had reached Category5, the second of three such powerful storms that would do <b>so</b> <b>during</b> the season.|$|E

5|$|On 4 October 1918, the 24th Battalion {{took part}} in the attack that {{captured}} the Beaurevoir sector in France, and was, therefore, expecting to have a rest the following day when the unit was unexpectedly ordered to take part in another attack. The assault was to commence at 06:05 from the village of Remicourt, and lead to the capture of Montbrehain by the 21st and 24th Battalions with tanks to provide support. The action was to prove the final engagement for the Australian infantry during the war, and it was during this attack that Ingram was to earn the Victoria Cross; the sixty-fourth, and final, Australian to do <b>so</b> <b>during</b> the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Reşadiye and Sultan Osman-ı Evvel {{were then}} pressed into British service. Reşadiye was {{completed}} that month and commissioned as HMS Erin, with Sultan Osman-ı Evvel entering service as HMS Agincourt. In September, Erin joined the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, where she served {{for the duration}} of the conflict. She took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May & 1 June 1916. There, she was the fourth ship in the British line of battle, along with her three surviving King George V-class half-sisters. She did not fire her main battery during the battle, the only British capital ship not to do <b>so</b> <b>during</b> the engagement; her secondary battery fired only six shells.|$|E
5|$|Singaporean citizens, {{government}} and non-governmental organisations may display or fly the national flag {{throughout the year}} to identify themselves with the nation, and especially encouraged to do <b>so</b> <b>during</b> occasions of national celebration or national significance. Non-Singaporean businesses and organisations are also allowed to display the flag throughout the year. The use and display of the flag is governed by Part III of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules made under the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act. It is an offence to knowingly contravene specified provisions of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules; the penalty is a fine not exceeding S$1,000.|$|E

A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for the two nations to walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite their having done <b>so</b> <b>during</b> the 2000 and 2004 Games.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpeckers are sedentary {{but there are}} a few examples of migratory species such as the rufous-bellied woodpecker and yellow-bellied sapsucker, and the Eurasian wryneck breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis's woodpecker, northern flicker, Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North America. Most woodpecker movements can be described as dispersive, such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped woodpecker, which moves to lowlands from hills during the winter months. The woodpeckers that do migrate do <b>so</b> <b>during</b> the day.|$|E
5|$|Yamashiro {{was briefly}} fitted with an {{aircraft}} flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1922. She successfully launched Gloster Sparrowhawk and Sopwith Camel fighters from it, the first Japanese ship to do <b>so.</b> <b>During</b> her modernization in the 1930s, a catapult and a collapsible crane were fitted on the stern, {{and the ship}} was equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938 and then by Mitsubishi F1M biplanes, from 1942 on.|$|E

5|$|About 23 Ma, in the Pleistocene, {{continental}} ice sheets {{expanded from}} the polar {{regions of the}} globe to cover lower latitudes far north of the region, starting a series of cold glacial periods that were interrupted by warmer interglacial periods. Snowmelt from alpine glaciers on the nearby Sierra Nevada during glacial periods fed rivers that flowed into the valleys of the region year round. Since the topography of the Basin and Range region was largely formed by faulting, not by river erosion, many of the basins have no outlets, meaning they will fill up with water like a bathtub until they overflow into the next basin. <b>So</b> <b>during</b> the cooler and wetter pluvial climates of the glacial periods, much of eastern California, all of Nevada, and western Utah were covered by large lakes separated by linear islands (the present day ranges).|$|E
5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} of Sale had {{a population of}} about 365. Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more <b>so</b> <b>during</b> {{the latter half of the}} 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in the latter half of the 19th century also coincides with the arrival of the railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a commuter town. A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs. The table below details population changes since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E
5|$|Aden meets Cassie and flirts with her. He {{ensures that}} her {{previous}} relationship with Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) is definitely over, then asks Cassie out. Her acceptance makes Ric jealous, <b>so</b> <b>during</b> {{a game of}} rugby, he tackles Aden so hard that he is knocked unconscious and hospitalised. Aden's brother Sean (Gabriel Egan) attacks Ric in retaliation, and when Aden recovers, he gives Sean a false alibi. Cassie discovers the truth and breaks up with him. Aden next appears as a rival of Geoff's on the school football team. Annoyed that PE teacher Tony Holden (Jon Sivewright) favours Geoff, Aden spikes Geoff's drink and locks him in the boot of Tony's car. Tony throws Aden off the team, so Aden vandalises Geoff's grandfather's farm, and bullies Geoff and his younger sister Annie (Charlotte Best).|$|E
