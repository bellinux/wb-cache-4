5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from <b>sick</b> <b>building</b> <b>syndrome.</b> David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E

This study aimed to measure that ideal building orientation reduces {{the effect of}} SBS on Occupants and proper management of the design process can reduce the formation of SBS using Northern Cyprus Buildings as case study. The estimated cases of SBS in North Cyprus are at least 909 residential units. Out of the 2252 Responses in North Cyprus, 909 Respondents (40. 3 %) stated they have seen an SBS building, while 293 (13 %) have lived in one at some point. 1343 (59. 6 %) reported to have never seen an SBS building. The Occupants of two residential flat buildings formed the study population and twenty-six (26) sample sizes were chosen and the twenty-six (26) respondents were selected (thirteen from each building) to test how ideal building orientation can minimize the effect of SBS on Occupants and even discourage SBS formation. Date received from 80 % of the respondents making twenty-one (21) respondents (9 from building A and 11 from building B) shows that building orientation affects {{to a large extent}} indoor air quality and lighting. Ideal management of building orientation design construction minimizes the effect of SBS on Occupants and guarantees the improved health of the Occupants. This paper intends to discuss the overall building management steps towards prevention of SBS formation in buildings...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the concentration of}} bacteria and fungi in the indoor environment of Jimma University libraries, so as to estimate the health hazard and to create standards for indoor air quality control. Methods: The microbial quality of indoor air of eight libraries of Jimma University was determined. The settle plate method using open Petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed to collect sample twice daily. Isolates were identified according to standard methods. Results: The concentrations of bacteria and fungi aerosols in the indoor environment of the university libraries ranged between 367 - 2595 CFU/m 3. According to the sanitary standards classification of European Commission, almost all the libraries indoor air of Jimma University was heavily contaminated with bacteria and fungi. In spite of their major source difference, the average fungi density found in the indoor air of libraries did appear to follow the same trend with bacterial density (P= 0. 001). The bacteria isolates included Micrococcus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Neisseria sp. while Cladosporium sp., Alternaria sp., Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. were the most isolated fungi. Conclusions: The indoor air of all libraries were in the range above highly contaminated according to European Commission classification and the most isolates are considered as potential candidates involved {{in the establishment of}} <b>sick</b> <b>building</b> <b>syndromes</b> and often associated with clinical manifestations like allergy, rhinitis, asthma and conjunctivitis.

40|$|Buildings use 40 % of {{the total}} primary energy in the United States, with a {{significant}} part of this energy being used for ventilation and cooling. Despite the large amount of energy used in buildings, reports have shown that the indoor air quality (IAQ) and thermal comfort are not satisfactory. The lowered productivity due to the bad IAQ could cause $ 125 billion loss per year and the <b>sick</b> <b>building</b> <b>syndromes</b> could cause $ 32 billion direct healthcare costs. Most of the problems related to IAQ are caused by insufficient fresh outdoor air supply or lack of maintenance with traditional mechanical ventilation systems. Natural ventilation is an alternative method to mechanical ventilation to reduce building energy use and improve indoor air quality. Natural ventilation can usually be classified into cross ventilation and single-sided ventilation. Cross ventilation is often favored for its larger air exchange rate than single-sided ventilation. However, in most cases, few buildings can achieve cross-ventilation due to the interior partitions, obstacles, and thicknesses. Therefore, single-sided ventilation is still of great importance in building design. However, the modeling of single-sided ventilation rate is difficult due to the bi-directional flow at the opening and the complex flow around buildings. The first part {{of this study is to}} develop a simple empirical model for buildings with simple openings. The model is able to accurately predict the mean ventilation rate and fluctuating ventilation rate caused by the pulsating flow and eddy penetration. This new model calculated the eddy penetration effect in the frequency domain based on Fast Fourier transform. We conducted Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations with Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and used experimental data from other researchers to validate the new empirical model. The model predictions were generally within 25 % error for simple opening. After we developed the model for simple openings, the second part of the research is to develop models for more complicated openings. In reality, only very few buildings use simple openings in their design, instead, the majority of the buildings use hopper, awning or casement windows. Therefore, based on the newly-developed model, we modified it to predict the ventilation rate for these windows types. In order to understand the flow characteristics around the complex openings, we used the CFD to generate database for various wind conditions. First, we validated the accuracy of the CFD LES model by conducting full-scale outdoor measurements and comparing against the CFD simulations. After validating the LES model, it was used to generate database to develop the semi-empirical models for hopper, awning and casement windows. Finally, the full-scale measured data was also compared with the proposed model predictions to validate the semi-empirical models. The comparison showed that the models were able to predict the ventilation rate generally within 30 % error. ^ After we developed the models for predicting single-sided, wind-driven ventilation rate, we evaluated the availability of natural ventilation in the future considering the impact of climate change. This research projected the future monthly weather based on HadCM 3 Global Circulation Model (GCM) for 2020, 2050 and 2080 for three CO 2 emission scenarios. To use the monthly weather data in energy simulation programs, we downscaled the monthly data to hourly data by Morphing method. Then we used the projected data to predict the future cooling and heating energy use in all seven climate zones in the U. S. for various commercial and residential buildings. We also coupled the newly-developed semi-empirical model with EnergyPlus to evaluate the natural ventilation potential in San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle, which are the representations of the typical climates where natural ventilation could be used. The results showed that the impact of climate change varied greatly depending on the geographic locations and building types. Also, the simulations showed that natural ventilation would still be acceptable by 2080 for San Francisco and Seattle even based on the worst case emission scenario, however, for San Diego or regions with warmer summer, natural ventilation could only be used for very limited time each year. Based on our study, the last step of this research is to seek potential approaches to utilize natural ventilation in hotter climates. One major limitation of natural ventilation is that it can only be used when outdoor is cool and may underperform during days with high outdoor temperatures. Mixed-mode cooling that combines natural ventilation and mechanical ventilation has the advantage of natural ventilation and mechanical cooling. To maximize the savings of mix-mode cooling, natural ventilation should be used as much as possible. In order to use natural ventilation mode during temporary hot weather, adequate amount of thermal mass with night cooling strategy would be one potential approach. However, the amount of thermal mass needed to be investigated to achieve cost-effective design. We conducted energy simulations with EnergyPlus to evaluate the impact of thermal mass on mixed-mode cooling energy savings. The results showed that electricity use can be reduced by 6 - 91 % with mixed-mode ventilation compared to traditional mechanical cooling in different climates. ...|$|R

50|$|Some {{other human}} {{diseases}} and symptoms {{have been proposed}} {{to be associated with}} indoor bioaerosol, but no deterministic conclusions could be drawn due to the insufficiency of evidence. One example is the well-known <b>sick</b> <b>building</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SBS). SBS refers to non-specific complaints, such as upper-respiratory irritative symptoms, headaches, fatigue, and rash, which cannot be related to an identifiable cause but are building related. Over the last two decades, there have been many studies indicating association of indoor bioaerosol with <b>sick</b> <b>building</b> <b>syndrome.</b> However, most of the related studies based their conclusions on statistical correlation between concentrations of certain types of bioaerosols and incidence of complaints, which has various drawbacks methodologically. For example, some studies have a small sample size, which critically undermines the validity of speculations based on the statistical results. Also, many studies were not able to exclude the influences of other factors beside bioaerosol in their analysis, which makes the statistical correlation theoretically inappropriate to support association of SBS with bioaerosols. Additional studies revealed that bioaerosol is unlikely to be the cause of SBS. Recent epidemiological and toxicological studies continued to suggest a possible link between bioaerosol exposure and <b>sick</b> <b>building</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but methodological limitations remained in these studies.|$|E
