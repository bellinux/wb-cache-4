5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E
25|$|In HPLC {{the sample}} is forced by a liquid at high {{pressure}} (the mobile phase) through a column that is packed with a <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> composed of irregularly or spherically shaped particles, a porous monolithic layer, or a porous membrane. HPLC is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases. Methods in which the <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> is more polar than the mobile phase (e.g., toluene as the mobile phase, silica as the <b>stationary</b> <b>phase)</b> are termed normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) and the opposite (e.g., water-methanol mixture as the mobile phase and C18 (octadecylsilyl) as the <b>stationary</b> <b>phase)</b> is termed reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC).|$|E

25|$|Reversed-phase {{chromatography}} (RPC) is any {{liquid chromatography}} procedure {{in which the}} mobile phase is significantly more polar than the <b>stationary</b> <b>phase.</b> It is so named because in normal-phase liquid chromatography, the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the <b>stationary</b> <b>phase.</b> Hydrophobic molecules in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the relatively hydrophobic <b>stationary</b> <b>phase.</b> Hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will tend to elute first.

25|$|Ion {{exchange}} chromatography (usually {{referred to}} as ion chromatography) uses an ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes based on their respective charges. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> to separate charged compounds including anions, cations, amino acids, peptides, and proteins. In conventional methods the <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> is an ion exchange resin that carries charged functional groups that interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to retain. There {{are two types of}} ion exchange chromatography: Cation-Exchange and Anion-Exchange. In the Cation-Exchange Chromatography the <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> has negative charge and the exchangeable ion is a cation, whereas, in the Anion-Exchange Chromatography the <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> has positive charge and the exchangeable ion is an anion. Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using FPLC.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} complex {{formation}} is in chiral chromatography in {{which is used}} to separate enantiomers from each other.

Correct interpretation of retention and enantiodiscrimination processes substantially facilitates the development and optimization of new enantioselective methods using cyclofructan-based chiral <b>stationary</b> <b>phases.</b> At first, the interaction mechanisms of three commercially available cyclofructan-based <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> were studied in normal-phase mode of liquid chromatography. Namely, systems using chiral <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> based on dimethylphenyl carbamate cyclofructan 7, R-naphtylethyl carbamate cyclofructan 6 and isopropyl carbamate cyclofructan 6 were studied. Linear free energy relationship model was used as a basic tool for characterization of interactions on the <b>stationary</b> <b>phases.</b> The mentioned model revealed that the main interactions contributing to retention in cyclofructan-based systems are hydrogen bond acidity and dipolarity/polarizibility, while dispersion interactions cause decrease of retention. The impact of oligosaccharide skeleton of the cyclofructan selector on the enantioselectivity was elucidated by the comparison with seemingly analogous cyclodextrin-based chiral <b>stationary</b> <b>phases.</b> Cyclofructan-based chiral [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{classification}} or {{characterization of}} <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> based on chromatographic parameters, in general, requires different test solutes/mixtures and several mobile phases. To simplify the classification/characterization of reversed-phase liquid chromatographic columns, {{to be used}} in separating drug/impurity profiles, a new test procedure was proposed. It consists of injecting two mixtures of relatively similar active substances applying a standard gradient. The aim was to evaluate from this approach the selectivity differences and overall separation quality of newly tested columns compared to that in an earlier selected set of eight <b>stationary</b> <b>phases.</b> The selectivity differences of the columns were evaluated by correlation coefficient-based weighted-average-linkage dendrograms and color maps.
