It is {{difficult}} to determine straightening stroke precisely for automatic <b>straightening</b> <b>machines.</b> The existing calculation method of straightening stroke is based on straightening curvature equation. Because the initial curvature is obtained by curve fitting method, the method is inconvenient to use and its accuracy is not well. In this paper, a method to calculate straightening stroke based on straightening process model is put forward. So the mathematic load-deflection model of straightening process must be established at first. The straightening process model for shafts is developed according to the elastic-plastic mechanics theory. By using the model, the straightening stroke can be calculated directly according to the initial deflection of the bent part. It is advantageous to use and to decrease errors. Comparing with FEM results and experimental results, the calculation results by the model are exact and the errors are small. So the validity and the accuracy of the method are verified.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to calculate straightening stroke precisely for automatic <b>straightening</b> <b>machines.</b> But, the existing mathematic models for calculating straightening stroke can not solve this problem well. In this paper, the mathematic load-deflection model, which reflects elastic range, elastic-plastic range and elastic spring back of press straightening process, is developed. By using the model, the straightening stroke can be calculated directly according to the initial deflection of the bent part. By simplicity, the rectangular section part is selected for study and {{is assumed to be}} the ideal elastic-plastic material. Based on the elastic-plastic mechanics theory, through deriving relationships among the load, bending moment, deflection and elastic region length, the theoretical model of press straightening process has been established. Finally, two examples are calculated. The results calculated by the model are in good agreement with the results computed by FEM. Experimental data also show that the calculation results by the model is exact and the error is small. So the validity and the accuracy of the model are verified.

40|$|Abstract: The uses of Acoustic Emission (AE) {{in process}} monitoring, {{particularly}} in the automotive sector, are little known but very varied (welding, <b>straightening,</b> drawing, <b>machining,</b> etc.) The most common use {{is no doubt in}} the straightening of gear box and steering rack rods. Tears or cracks may occur when tubes are formed or deep drawn. AE can be used to detect the point in the process where the crack occurs (in the case of multiple step processes or multi-station presses). Once this crucial point has been identified, it is then possible to adapt the production process or the metallurgy in order to prevent this damage from occurring. A press has been instrumented {{in order to be able}} to continuously control the production process. The first step when defining the feasibility of a process is performed using a multi-purpose AE system such as those used in research laboratories. Once the process has been clearly identified and the process noise has been characterized, a simplified control system is then defined and put in place on the production lines. Today, the mill decided to first study the localization of the weld seam before implemented the AE process monitoring.

In the present work several essential manufacturing steps of a process chain were investigated experimentally and the distribution of the residual stresses as an important carrier of distortion potential was analyzed by means of non destructive neutron diffraction over the whole cross section of the shafts. The results showed nonsymmetrical residual stress distribution along the cross section after the pre straightening of the uncoiled wire. The cold drawing created high tensile residual stresses at the surface in radial and tangential directions, while much higher compressive stresses were found, particularly in axial direction, in the core. The residual stresses of the drawn shaft were reduced largely by a following cross roll straightening. The final induction hardening changed the residual stress state again largely in dependence on the process parameters.
