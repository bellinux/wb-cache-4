5000|$|After being {{introduced}} in the 1970s, 954 municipalities (30%) in Japan have implemented PAYT programs. The city of Taipei currently runs a scheme where households and companies purchase specially printed blue bin bags, and place waste in it. The municipal waste management department collects only rubbish placed within these special bags. Called the [...] "Per Bag Trash Collection Fee", this scheme encourages usage of recyclable packaging, as those do not need a <b>special</b> <b>bag</b> and are disposed free of charge. As a result, Taipei's waste volume is down 35.08%, and recycling has increased 2.6-fold from 1999. PAYT is also implemented in Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, China, and Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|At ennichi {{or summer}} festival stalls, {{the game is}} not a competition. Participation {{typically}} costs around 100 yen and players can take the scooped goldfish home in a <b>special</b> <b>bag</b> provided by the stall keeper. The game is unlimited, so players can scoop until their pois are completely broken. If they cannot scoop any goldfish, the stall keeper may be kind enough to give them one or two free goldfish. Each stall usually has its own rules. For example, there are some stalls where players can get a stronger poi if they pay more. Other stalls give players special presents if they scoop a lot. In some variations, there are also medaka (Japanese killifish) that are faster and harder to catch than goldfish. Usually, for every four goldfish, there is one medaka, so in ennichi, if you catch one, it counts as four goldfish.|$|E

However, although the reis ül-küttab attended the meetings of the Council, arriving before and leaving after the viziers, he had no right to speak himself in it or directly to the Sultan, and was obliged to do so via the Grand Vizier. His main role was as the head of the Department of the Imperial Council (divan-i hümayun kalemi), which in turn was divided into three bureaux: the beylik, under the beylikçı from the mid-17th century on, which was responsible for drafting and publishing all imperial decrees (firman) or ordinances (evamir), and for keeping an archive of the originals of all laws and regulations (kanun) and treaties with other states; the tahvil, which was responsible for issuing every year the diplomas (berat) of provincial governors, judges, and timariots; the ru'us ("provisions") office, charged with provisioning various officials, as well as paying pensions from the treasury or from charitable establishments (vakf). All state correspondence, except for military or financial matters, was in his hands. Another subordinate official, the amedcı divan-i hümayun ("referendar of the Imperial Council"), was responsible for diplomatic correspondence and for keeping records of the memoranda (telhis) and reports (takrir) presented to the Sultan by the Grand Vizier, acting on behalf of the Imperial Council. The reis ül-küttab brought these in a <b>special</b> <b>bag</b> (kise) to meetings of the Imperial Council.

40|$|Introduction. At low {{temperature}} {{the preservation of}} foodstuffs {{is one of the}} best ways of their storage and therefore this method is widely used in meat industry. The {{low temperature}} suppresses the activity of microorganisms and tissue ferments. Therefore the meat preserved by freezing keeps for a long time its initial properties and there are only minimal changes of food value and taste. At low temperature the activity of ferments slows down but does not stop. Work object. The work object is the determination of the change of physical-chemical properties of meat during freezing and keeping in - 180 C and - 860 C temperature. Work methodics. The research as fulfilled at the laboratory of the evaluation of the cattle meat properties and the meat quality. For the rersearch taken 14 Lithuanian white pig meat samples the mean weight of which was 500 g. were taken. They were put into special freezing bags and were frozen at temperature - 180 C, and - 860 C. Before freezing it the physical-chemical properties of the meat were determined. Two examples from each meat samples were researched. The determination of the physical-chemical properties of the meat was fulfilled every month. Also were was taken 6 Lithuanian white pig meat samples the mean weight of which was 500 g. Before freezing it the physical-chemical properties of the meat were determined. After that was made green tea extract, 500 ml. Water ant 50 g tea. All extract was inject in to the meat samples. They were put into special freezing bags and were frozen at temperature - 180 C. During the test it was researched: the cooking losses were determined by boiling the meat in the circulating water bath for 30 min. The changes of weight of the meat sample were determined by weighing the meat samples before and after boiling. The meat mildness was determined according to the Warner-Bratzler method. The meat abondance of water was determined as the diminuation of the sample weight during 24 h holding the sample hung in a <b>special</b> <b>bag</b> with the net air temperature + 40 C. The water binding capacity was determined according to the Grau and Hamm method. The ash was determined by burning the organic matter of meat at temperatre 600 to 8000 C. The colour was determined according to the CIE-LAB method by measuring meat lightness (L*), colour intensity (b*) and colour tone (a*). The quantity of dry matters as determined by drying the samples to the constant mass and weighing with the automatic scales for dry matters. With the pH-meter pH was mesured. The quantity of fat was determined according to the Socslet method. Results discussion. From table Nr. 3 we see that after two month freezing dry matter was lower then not frozen meat 0. 650 % (p< 0. 01). After five months freezing meat drip loss was 3. 87 % lower (p< 0. 001), comparison with two months freezing drip loss and with do not freezing 1. 9 % lower (p< 0. 001). Not frozen meat water binding capacity after one month freezing was 8. 22 (< 0. 001). From table Nr. 4 we see that not frozen meat drip loss after one month freezing was biggest 3. 56 %(p< 0. 001). After five freezing months meat drip loss was lower 3. 06 % (p< 0. 001) comparison with two months freezing drip loss. Comparison with not frozen meat drip loss after five months freezing drip loss was 0. 48 % (p< 0. 001).

For European food industry, quality is a key factor because the high quality of a product is the basis for success in this highly competitive market. However, it is difficult to decide which sort of meat has the best nutrition value or technological properties (Kortz, 2003). Work object. To research and compare various animal meat quality and nutrition value. During investigation were taken 6 different sorts of animal and poultry meat samples: Lithuanian white pigs, Lithuanian black head sheep, Lithuanian black-white bulls, wild pork, Big- 6 turkey broilers and Hybro G cross chicken broilers. For the samples was taken 500 - 550 g from long back muscle (musculus longissimus dorsi). For poultry and turkey samples was taken breast meat. Pork, sheep, bulls, chicken and turkey broilers were raised and slaughtered in the same groups, had the same feeding and slaughtering conditions, wild pork was hunted in Lithuanian forests. Measuring different animals meat quality and nutrition features, samples were taken chilled 24 hours after slaughtering. Meat quality indexes were measured at ‘Meat characteristics and quality assessment laboratory’ after 48 hours afterslaughtering. Samples were held in refrigerator in + 4 oC temperature. During the test it was researched: the cooking losses were determined by boiling the meat in the circulating water bath for 30 min.

The quantity of dry matters as determined by drying the samples to the constant mass and weighing with the automatic scales for dry matters. Meat pH was measured with pH. The quantity of fat was determined according to the Sosclet method. Results. During measuring meat nutrition value factors, it was discovered that turkey meat had most of dry mater and least is in sheep meat. Differences between two of them were as follows: 5. 64 percent (P< 0. 001) and 5. 63 percent (P< 0. 001). These factors are least in bulls meat: 4. 49 percent (P< 0. 001) and 3. 93 percent (P< 0. 001) less then in turkey meat. Turkey meat was also richest of mineral elements. Chicken and wild pork meat had largest number of fat, difference between them was only 0. 001 percent (P< 0. 05). Least number of fat was found in bulls meat, difference comparing to chicken meat was 0. 91 percent (P< 0. 01), and turkey which difference was 0. 80 percent (P< 0. 05). While investigating sensory factors for animal meat, biggest difference was found in meat colour: chicken meat had the brightest colour, darkest was bulls meat (P< 0. 001). Comparing tenderness of meat was found that chicken meat was more then twice tender then sheep (P< 0. 001), wild pork (P< 0. 05) and bulls meat (P< 0. 01). Comparing technological factors, largest differences were found while investigating drip loss. The biggest number was in sheep meat and the least in chicken meat, this difference was 20. 23 percent (P< 0. 001). Water binding capacity and acid feature differences was not very large for all animal meat, larger number was in bulls and poultry meat...|$|E

40|$|Brassica {{vegetables}} such as {{broccoli and}} red cabbage {{have been associated}} with positive health effects due to their phytochemical content. More specifically, isothiocyanates, the hydrolysis products of glucosinolates that are present in Brassica, have been shown to exert potential anti carcinogenic effects and antimicrobial activities against various bacterial and fungal pathogens. The overall aims of this work was to: (i) increase our understanding of how the cooking preparation methods affect the synthesis of the bioactive glucosinolate hydrolysis products in broccoli, super broccoli and a glucoraphanin-rich variety red cabbage, (ii) investigate the antimicrobial activity of broccoli extracts against potentially pathogenic Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and study the mechanisms of action using a large library of E. coli K- 12 single gene deletion mutants, and (iii) develop a sulforaphane-rich broccoli soup formulation with good organoleptic characteristics based on a consumer evaluation test and carry out a dietary intervention study with subjects ileostomy patients, i. e. patients who have their large intestine surgically removed and their wastes flow {{through the end of the}} small intestine into a <b>special</b> <b>bag</b> (stoma bag), with the aim to evaluate the absorption of sulforaphane by measuring the sulforaphane concentration in the collected ileal fluids. The results indicated that cooking broccoli, super broccoli and red cabbage in vacuum sealed bags (sous vide) prevented leaching of glucosinolates into boiling water. However, very little hydrolysis of the glucosinolates took place most likely due to the inactivation of myrosinase and the epithiospecifier protein (ESP). The addition of myrosinase sources, i. e. horseradish, mustard seed, rocket and watercress during the cooling stage of the cooked broccoli and red cabbage resulted in a significant increase by one to ten-fold for most isothiocyanates with very little amounts of their nitrile analogues being produced, indicating the absence of ESP in most cases in the myrosinase sources used. A wider range of hydrolysis products were detected in red cabbage including sulforaphane nitrile, iberin nitrile, erucin nitrile, iberverin nitrile, 1 -cyano, 2, 3 -epithiopropane and l-cyano- 2 -hydroxy- 3 -butene, formed by hydrolysis of various glucosinolates. The proposed cooking strategy can be used in home cooking as well as industrial cooking to increase the levels of the bioactive isothiocyanates. The antimicrobial assays demonstrated that broccoli extracts had a wide spectrum of strong inhibition against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and that there was a significant positive correlation between antimicrobial activity and sulforaphane concentration. Several pathogens that were resistant to ampicillin, such as Salmonella Typhimurium DTI 04 TID, Escherichia coli 0157 :H 7 VT and E. coli K- 12, and to tetracycline, such as Salmonella hadar, were sensitive to sulforaphane. The results from assessing the antimicrobial activity of pure sulforaphane against the E. coli K- 12 mutant strains indicated that the deletion of genes such as acrR, ToIR, hfq, which are associated with antimicrobial resistance, increased the sensitivity to sulforaphane. Several genes were also identified that are associated with membrane integrity, such as BolA and Sip, whereas others such as malS, milE, to metabolic functions and cell wall recycling. Interestingly, some genes identified in this study, such as moeA, fdnH, lehB, and ycdB, are known to be important for microbial resistance to various metals, although sulforaphane has not been previously shown to be related to metals. Overall, the study suggests that sulforaphane, due to its strong antibacterial activity, could be used as a natural antibacterial agent for food and medical applications. The results also indicate the possibility to increase the antimicrobial effects of broccoli by reducing the temperature of the thermal treatment during cooking or through the addition of myrosinase sources. The developed soup formulations had good organoleptic properties and got satisfactory scores by the consumer panel for overall liking followed by liking of appearance, taste and texture. The best soup formulation was prepared in two ways, one was a standard formulation, and one had increased sulforaphane content through the addition of myrosinase containing mustard seeds during the cooling stage of the cooked soup. Analysis of the ileal fluids indicated that although the ileal fluids collected after feeding with sulforaphane-rich broccoli soup had a higher sulforaphane content, for both types of soups the concentration of sulforaphane was extremely low. Overall, the results demonstrated that more than 98 % of sulforaphane was absorbed rapidly, i. e. within 4 hours after feeding. Sulforaphane was also extracted from the ileal fluid and re-constituted at a similar concertation to that found in the ileal fluid, and tested for its antimicrobial activity against E. coli. No inhibitory activity was observed from this test, which was expected taking into account the high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC); however, the high initial sulforaphane concentration in the broccoli soups and the high microbial inhibitory activity obtained in the in vitro studies suggest that sulforaphane might be exerting its antimicrobial effects during its transit through the stomach and the small intestine, particularly against bacteria associated with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SmO) disorder and potentially Helicobacler pylori...|$|E
