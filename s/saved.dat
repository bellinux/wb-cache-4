50|$|A blown <b>save</b> (abbreviated BSV, BS or B) {{is charged}} to a pitcher who enters {{a game in}} a {{situation}} which permits him to earn a <b>save</b> (a <b>save</b> situation or <b>save</b> opportunity), but who instead allows the tying run to score. Note that if the tying run was scored by a runner who was already on base when the new pitcher entered the game, that new pitcher will be charged with a blown <b>save</b> even though the run will not be charged to the new pitcher, but rather to the pitcher who allowed that runner to reach base. If the reliever allows the tying or leading run, but the reliever's team wins the game, the reliever wins the game. Due to this definition, a pitcher cannot blow multiple <b>saves</b> in a game unless he has multiple <b>save</b> opportunities, a situation only possible when a pitcher temporarily switches defensive positions. The blown <b>save</b> was introduced by the Rolaids Relief Man Award in 1988. A pitcher who enters the game in a <b>save</b> situation and does not finish the game—but his team still leading—is not charged with a <b>save</b> opportunity. <b>Save</b> percentage is the ratio of <b>saves</b> to <b>save</b> opportunities.|$|R
