40|$|The 2, 7 km long Saukopf-tunnel in Weinheim (Germany) is {{operated}} with bidirectional traffic and ventilated using a transverse ventilation system. This incorporates a continuous <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> that enables {{to extract the}} smoke over the half or the entire tunnel length. In addition, the vitiated tunnel air can be extracted {{from the middle of}} the tunnel using the point extraction that can also perform <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction.</b> Due to the enforcement of the new German guideline on tunnel equipment of road tunnels (RABT- 2003 [1]), the ventilation system has to be upgraded in order to cater for the more onerous requirements for the fire case. The distributed <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> is to be replaced with localised <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> using remote controlled dampers. Furthermore during the <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction,</b> a control of the longitudinal flow is recommended. In this tunnel with bidirectional traffic, the most efficient <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> is obtained, if the smoke is extracted such that air flows equally from both sides of the fire towards the extraction point situated above the fire. In order to enable a regulation of the longitudinal flow, new ventilation systems typically use jet fans. However due to civil constraints, this would be difficult to realize for this tunnel and consequently alternatives have been considered. One method is to enable air supply as well as extraction at the current middle extraction point. Furthermore, when smoke is extracted in one half of the tunnel, fresh air could be supplied in the other half. With these means, the flow velocity at the location of the fire can be influenced favourably. In the present work, the theoretical framework for the control of the flow velocity using a punctual air supply or exhaust is developed. The analysis is tested by conducting one-dimensional non-stationary calculations with the in-house computer program SPRINT. Using a scenario approach, the concept for the control routines has been simulated, evaluated and optimised...|$|R

In recent years, the manufacturing industry has gradually been paying greater attention to energy saving; the concept of using the thermal buoyancy effect of air flow for natural ventilation has been integrated in many tall buildings (Evola and Popov 2006; van Hooff and Blocken 2012).

40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of five different <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> modes for an underground channel fire was numerically investigated originally in this paper. Results {{have shown that}} mechanical air supplying from adjacent smoke bays will intensify the air entrainment and increase the smoke production, which lead to a reduction of smoke temperature and buoyancy so that it's easier for smoke to descend to the lower level of the building space. The smoke exhausting process is not effective while using the smoke vents remote to the fire region as the fresh air is strongly sucked into the vents instead of smoke. Compared with the commonly used <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> mode with all the smoke bays together, exhausting the fire-induced smoke with relatively high velocity by using the vents inside of or close to the fire is able to achieve a more effective smoke exhausting process.

40|$|AbstractLife {{safety is}} one of the {{objectives}} of fire engineering design for road tunnels. Fire engineering design requires maintaining a tenable condition {{for a period of time}} to allow occupants to evacuate to safety. This will be achieved by controlling the smoke under credible design fire scenarios in a tunnel. The critical location in a tunnel fire emergency condition is the tunnel region upstream of the fire, where occupants are most likely to reside as traffic jam can usually be created by the fire incident. Tenability for the downstream region of fire is not the main focus of this research because vehicles can generally drive out of the tunnel at a higher speed than that of the smoke flow, and local damper <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> can help keep a tenable condition in the downstream region beyond the local fire zone, in case there is a congestion in the downstream region of the fire. To maintain a tenable condition in the upstream tunnel region from the fire incident, the required minimum longitudinal flow velocity to prevent smoke backlayering can be calculated based on NFPA 502 recommendations. This critical velocity takes no credit of the <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> or active overhead fixed fire suppression effects. <b>Smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> with a dedicated smoke duct along the entire length of the tunnel is gaining popularity because of its efficiency and robustness in providing a tenable environment in the tunnel with unknown upstream and downstream traffic conditions. In this paper, a modified critical velocity to control smoke back-layering while <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> and fire suppression systems are operating has been analyzed. This modified critical velocity is approximately 20 % lower than the critical velocity that is recommended in NFPA 502. This allows significant savings on ventilation capacity for road tunnels which have a local smoke exhaust capability using a dedicated smoke duct. It is concluded that the <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> performance is similar whether using ceiling dampers or vertical wall-mounted dampers for smoke capture to maintain tunnel tenability. However, tunnel gradients play a major role on the modified critical velocity for a nominated design fire and the required <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> rate...|$|R

40|$|The Building Code of Australia (BCA) {{generally}} requires large spaces to {{be protected}} by a mechanical smoke exhaust system. This requires the spaces to be divided at the ceiling level into smoke reservoirs to contain the smoke layer; and exhaust fan(s) installed to remove the smoke from each reservoir. Even though this is a Deemed-to-Satisfy solution, the BCA sets out both prescriptive and performance requirements the system must be designed to satisfy. One of the key performance requirements is that the smoke layer must be contained within the smoke reservoir. Series of parametric {{studies were carried out}} using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses to examine the smoke filling of smoke reservoirs. The studies reveal that, with the BCA prescribed <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> rates, <b>smoke</b> reservoirs with a minimum depth of 0. 5 m specified by the BCA are insufficient to contain the smoke layer within the reservoirs. For smoke layer containment, the necessary reservoir depths are significantly larger than the BCA prescribed minimum of 0. 5 m.

Further studies were also carried out to investigate the <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> for a <b>smoke</b> reservoir with a minimum depth of 0. 5 m. The results show that the <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> rate required for containment of smoke within the reservoir is significantly higher than that prescribed by the BCA. The high exhaust rate is unlikely to be practical and may also introduce significant issues with make-up air.

Two well-known CFD tools, i. e., FDS 6. 0. 1 and ANSYS FLUENT 14, are used for mutual verification. The smoke pattern in tunnel without blockage is studied as a benchmark and the proposed semi-transverse smoke control system can maintain tenable conditions for safe egress.

The unbalanced airflow drives more smoke to the blocked side and makes this side impassable for evacuation within a few minutes.

40|$|In many tunnels with {{transverse}} ventilation, the smoke-extraction {{capacity is}} determined {{on the base}} of the estimated smoke production rate of the design fire. This design method implicitly assumes a stable stratification of the smoke layer. As the assumption of a stratified smoke layer is not justified when higher flow velocities are expected, the entire air volume that flows in the tunnel must be removed. In tunnels with gradients exceeding three percent, the chimney effect due to the rising temperature in the tunnel may cause flow velocities of 4 m/s and more. Therefore, the smoke-extraction capacity has to be designed for an anticipated longitudinal flow at the fire location. In this paper, three models for the calculation of the effective pressure difference due to the chimney effect are compared. With these models, the expected flow velocity in the tunnel can be calculated based on buoyancy and external forces. Examples for <b>smoke</b> <b>extraction</b> systems are given for existing and planned tunnels.
