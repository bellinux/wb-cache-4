5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: {{simultaneous}} and sequential. In the former, both spermatozoa and eggs {{are present in the}} gonads. Simultaneous hermaphroditism typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With sequential hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include parrotfish, wrasses, <b>sea</b> <b>basses,</b> flatheads, sea breams and lightfishes.|$|E
25|$|A few {{species of}} goby, such as blackeye goby and Lythrypnus dalli, can change their sexes. Sex change is {{possible}} in these gobies, since the external genitalia {{for males and females}} do not differ much. Sex changes can take from days to weeks. Most sex changes in gobies are from female to male (protogyny) rather than male to female (protandry). Female-to-male changes are observed not only in gobies but also in wrasses, damselfishes, and <b>sea</b> <b>basses.</b> Female-to-male change usually occurs because the resident male of the group is dead. If there is no male in the group, reproduction will be impossible. Therefore, the dominant female turns into male, allowing mating to happen. Male-to-female change occurs when the females have preference for specific features in males. For example, female gobies prefer large males, and a few large males mate with multiple females, whereas small males lose their chance to mate. Small males either choose to become sneakers (kleptogamy) or choose to transform into females because all females technically have high mating opportunities. By turning into females, males can ensure that they produce many descendants.|$|E
500|$|Fast and energetic, {{the night}} shark feeds {{primarily}} on small, active bony fishes such as mullet, mackerel, butterfish, <b>sea</b> <b>basses,</b> and flyingfish. Squid and shrimp are also sometimes taken. Most feeding activity occurs at night, hence its common name, with peaks {{at dawn and}} dusk. Catch records indicate that this species is usually found in schools and conducts a diel vertical migration, spending the day {{at a depth of}} [...] and moving up to shallower than [...] at night. Ovulating and gravid females are rarely ever caught, suggesting that during this period they may stop feeding or segregate themselves from others of their species. Potential predators of the night shark include larger sharks. Known parasites include the copepods Kroyeria caseyi, which attach to the gills, Pandarus bicolor and P. smithii, which infest the skin, and the tapeworms Heteronybelinia yamagutii, H. nipponica and Progrillotia dollfusi, which are found in the spiral valve intestine. Another parasite is an undescribed isopod similar to Aega webbii. The common remora (Remora remora) may be found attached to this species.|$|E

40|$|Recent tagging studies {{indicate}} that black <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> movements are regional rather than coast wide. The tagging data will be considered when considering management objectives. Beginning in 2011, states are allowed to adjust regulations to better meet their fisheries needs. This is important for Maryland since black <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> support vital recreational and commercial coastal fisheries. The majority of black <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> are caught in federal waters (> 3 nautical miles offshore) where natural hard bottom and cold water corals can be found.

AMH is also produced during postnatal life in both sexes regulating steroidogenesis and early stages of folliculogenesis. Teleosts lack Müllerian ducts, but Amh has been identified in several species including European <b>sea</b> <b>bass.</b> However, information on Amh type- 2 receptor (Amhr 2), the specific receptor for Amh binding, is restricted {{to a couple of}} fish species. Here, we report on cloning <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> amhr 2, the production of a recombinant <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> Amh, and the functional analysis of this ligand-receptor couple. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> amhr 2 segregates with Amhr 2 from other vertebrates. This piscine receptor is capable of activating Smad proteins. Antibodies raised against <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> Amh were used to study native and recombinant Amh, revealing proteins in the range of 66 - 70 kDa corresponding to the full length Amh. Once proteolytically treated, recombinant <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> Amh generates a 12 kDa Cterminal mature protein, suggesting that contrary to what has been described for other fish Amh proteins, this protein is processed in a similar way as mammalian AMH. The mature <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> Amh is a biologically active protein able to bind <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> Amhr 2 and, surprisingly, also human AMHR 2. In prepubertal <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> testes, Amh was detected by immunohistochemistry mostly in Sertoli cells surrounding early germ-cell generations.

Here we assessed the assemblage of groupers and <b>sea</b> <b>basses</b> (Epinephelidae and Serranidae) inside and outside the Arvoredo Marine Reserve (AR), a MPA in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. Density and biomass of 13 fish species (7 Epinephelidae and 6 Serranidae) were recorded. The most abundant groupers were Epinephelus marginatus and Mycteroperca acutirostris, while Serranus flaviventris and S. balwini were the most abundant <b>sea</b> <b>basses.</b> Grouper biomass was significantly higher inside the reserve, indicating the effectiveness of this MPA for target and threatened species, such as E. marginatus. In contrast, biomass of <b>sea</b> <b>basses</b> was higher outside the MPA, as a possible result of prey release effect.

Having this aim in mind, a radiation hybrid (RH) panel of European <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> (Dicentrarchus labrax) was constructed from splenocytes irradiated at 3000 rad, allowing the construction of a 1581 marker RH map. A total of 1440 gene markers providing ~ 4400 anchors with the genomes of three-spined stickleback, medaka, pufferfish and zebrafish, helped establish synteny relationships with these model species.
