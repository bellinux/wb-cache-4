5|$|In 1800 {{there were}} three red deer on the island, later {{replaced}} by goats and then by a small herd of black cattle. Subsequently the <b>summer</b> <b>grazing</b> was used for sheep by crofters from Iona, but in 1997 all livestock was removed. This {{has led to a}} regeneration of the island's vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged the {{vegetation}} {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing has been limited to one ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain vegetation which is susceptible to damage from <b>summer</b> <b>grazing.</b> The vegetation structure has started to improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed. The summit suffers erosion from the large number of walkers who climb Nethermost Pike. The use of fewer footpaths would help reduce the disturbance to the summit species.|$|E
5|$|Livestock {{depredation}} {{has been}} one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance. Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well. Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. The majority of losses occur during the <b>summer</b> <b>grazing</b> period, with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation. The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America). The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.|$|E

25|$|The direct {{consequence}} {{of the war was}} the registration of the entire Tunisian plateau for land tax and its conversion to mainly wheat cultivation. The Musulamii and other nomadic tribes were likely permanently excluded from what had been their <b>summer</b> <b>grazing</b> grounds and forced to lead a more impoverished existence in the Aures mountains and the arid zone. The war also probably sealed the long-term fate of the client kingdom of Mauretania, which was annexed in AD 44 by the Emperor Claudius (ruled 41–54).|$|E
25|$|Transhumant grazing is an {{important}} aspect of the cultural heritage of the Australian Alps, an area of which has been included on the Australian National Heritage List. Colonists started using this region for <b>summer</b> <b>grazing</b> in the 1830s, when pasture lower down was poor. The practice continued during the 19th and 20th centuries, helping make Australia's pastoral industry viable. Transhumant grazing created a distinctive way of life that is {{an important}} part of Australia's pioneering history and culture. There are features in the area that are reminders of transhumant grazing including abandoned stockman's huts, stock yards and stock routes.|$|E
25|$|The Tunisian plateau {{was also}} the {{traditional}} <b>summer</b> <b>grazing</b> region of the semi-nomadic Musulamii and Gaetuli. The result of Roman encroachment in this region was prolonged and bitter conflict between the nomads and Rome during Augustus' rule. His proconsuls in Africa fought a series of campaigns against them: campaigns are recorded in 21 BC, 19 BC, ca. 15 BC, ca. AD 3 and AD 6, some large enough to gain Triumphs for their generals, each implying the killing of at least 5,000 enemy people. After AD 6, no major operations are recorded, but the conflict mutated into a chronic low-level guerrilla resistance to Roman rule. It was in this context of conflict that Tacfarinas grew up.|$|E

25|$|Transhumance in the Pyrenees {{involves}} {{relocation of}} livestock (cows, sheep, horses) to high mountains for summer months, because {{farms in the}} lowland {{are too small to}} support a larger herd all year round. The mountain period starts in late May or early June, and ends in early October. Until the 1970s, transhumance was used mainly for dairy cows, and cheese-making was an important activity in the summer months. In some regions, nearly all members of a family decamped to higher mountains with their cows, living in rudimentary stone cabins for the <b>summer</b> <b>grazing</b> season. That system, which evolved during the Middle Ages, lasted into the 20th century. It declined and broke down under pressure from industrialization, as people left the countryside for jobs in cities.|$|E
25|$|The hill’s name {{translates}} {{from the}} Scottish Gaelic language as “Hill of the Herding” and this {{refers to the}} fact that it lies on the route of one of the main north-south ancient drovers' roads of Scotland, the area around the mountain was used as a gathering point for the cattle. The western corrie of the hill could well have been the collecting point as it is a huge gentle bowl which is ideal for <b>summer</b> <b>grazing</b> and the concealing of cattle. James Stobie’s map of 1770 refers to the hill as Ben Chualach, Charles Knight’s Penny Cyclopaedia of the 1840s also uses this name and the hill seems to have been designated as Beinn a’ Chuallaich by Victorian cartographers in the second half of the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|The Isle of Oxney {{is an area}} {{of higher}} land to the west of Appledore, which is {{isolated}} from high ground to its north and south. The valley around the northern edge of it was known as the Upper Levels, while that to the south was called the Wittersham Levels, and had its own Commission of Sewers. The Rother had been routed around the northern side of the Isle since the 1330s, when the Knelle Dam was built at the western end of the Wittersham Levels. The sea was prevented from entering the levels by the Wittersham Sea Wall, built across the eastern end of the valley. This enabled some of the levels to be used for agriculture all year round, although some was only suitable for <b>summer</b> <b>grazing.</b> A perennial problem with the river was that the tides deposited large quantities of silt in the channel, and during the summer months the flow of the river was insufficient to scour the silt away. As a result, some [...] of the Upper Levels were [...] "drowned lands" [...] by 1629, meaning that they were persistently flooded, and another [...] were only usable in the summer months.|$|E

The trail entered Star Valley about [...] south of the present town of Smoot, Wyoming. From Smoot, the road then continued north about [...] down Star Valley west of the Salt River before turning almost due west at Stump Creek near the present town of Auburn, Wyoming and passing into the present state of Idaho and following the Stump Creek valley about ten miles (16km) northwest over the Caribou Mountains (Idaho) (this section of the trail is now accessible only by US Forest Service path as the main road (Wyoming Highway 34) now goes through Tincup canyon to get across the Caribous.) After crossing the Caribou Range the road split, turning almost ninety degrees and progressing southwest to Soda Springs, Idaho or alternately heading almost due west and passing south of Grays Lake (now part of the Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge) to Fort Hall Idaho. The Lander Road had good grass, fishing, water and wood but was high, rough and steep in many places. Later, after 1869, it was mostly used by ranchers moving their stock to and from <b>summer</b> <b>grazing</b> and/or markets.

500|$|The next {{significant}} advance was in 1630, {{when the}} Dutch Engineer Cornelius Vermuyden was {{employed by the}} Earl of Bedford and others to drain the Fens. [...] The Old Bedford River was cut from Earith to Salters Lode, a distance of , and provided sufficient drainage that the land {{could be used for}} <b>summer</b> <b>grazing.</b> Vermuyden published a document in 1642, entitled Discourse touching the draining of the Great Fennes, in which he proposed the division of the fens into three zones, the North Level, the South Level, and between them, the Middle Level, stretching from Morton's Leam to the Bedford River. An Act of Parliament, the Pretended Act, was obtained in 1649, and work began under his supervision. The New Bedford River was constructed, running parallel to the Old, and the Middle Levels area was protected. [...] The Forty Foot, Twenty Foot and Sixteen Foot Rivers were cut soon afterwards, to drain water from the area to Salters Lode and Welches Dam. In addition to these new channels, the Middle Level also contained [...] of the old course of the Nene, and the ancient artificial waterways of King's Dyke and Whittlesey Dyke, which connect Stanground to Floods Ferry. To the north is Well Creek, most of which was a natural waterway, although the final section to Salters Lode Lock follows the course of the New Podyke, a drainage channel constructed in the early sixteenth century. The primary function of the waterways was drainage, but water levels were managed to enable them to be navigated.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Traditional season-long {{livestock}} grazing {{strategy on}} western riparian areas {{has been identified}} as one of the factors affecting rangeland productivity as well as wildlife habitat in riparian zones. As alternatives to <b>summer</b> season-long <b>grazing,</b> <b>summer</b> short-duration <b>grazing</b> (without haying), and fall short-duration grazing (following haying), were considered in this study to determine their effects on ranch production and profitability. Five grazing plans for the case ranch were evaluated. A planning period of six years (1993 - 98) was used for each plan. The present values (PVs) of net returns, using a 7 percent discount rate, were positive for all the plans. Shifting from <b>summer</b> season-long <b>grazing</b> to plans with <b>summer</b> short-duration <b>grazing</b> reduced the PVs of net returns by 13 percent, on average. Reasons for reductions in net returns included i) higher labor as well as fencing costs, ii) downward adjustment of herd size, and iii) increased overhead costs per animal. Shifting from summer season-long to fall short-duration grazing, in contrast, increased the PVs of net returns by 7 - 9 percent. But this system of grazing involved 1) a large haying costs, and ii) a higher management requirement. Although research results showed a difference in profitability between the three grazing strategies, the differences can be viewed as evidence for "tendency" only. This is so because those differences were so small and so sensitive to changes in some parameters (i. e., changes of magnitudes which are smaller than the measurement error) that they cannot be viewed as significantly different. Recognizing non-pecuniary goals of the ranchers, economic sustainability was determined by the criterion that the rate of return on ranch investment, on a long-term basis, is at least 3 percent (one-half of the opportunity cost of capital as measured by the annual yield rate on 10 -year U. S. Treasury notes). The rate of return on ranch investment, on average, was 3 percent. Thus, the ranch operation was found economically sustainable under all grazing systems examined. However, if public land grazing permit was reduced by 30 percent, then returns to investment, on average, fell to 2. 5 percent, signalling that ranchers no longer were economically sustainable (based on the aforementioned criterion). The study results indicated that grazing strategies correlate with the structure of the riparian habitat. Fall short-duration grazing may be most compatible with a riparian habitat structure that is generally viewed as being ecologically more desirable than other forms of habitat structure. However, some plants, bird, and mammal species preferred the habitat structure correlated with other grazing strategies. Thus, from that perspective, a mixture of grazing strategies (provided they are determinants of vegetation structure) is, at the landscape level, more desirable than a single uniform grazing strategy for encouraging species diversity...|$|R
