40|$|MBA thesisEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems are {{excellent}} software packages that enable businesses to integrate {{a variety of}} business functions. In particular, ERP systems have become systems of choice for many public and private companies and have radically changed the way accounting and business information is processed and audited. The challenge for auditors is {{to keep up with}} the changing nature of ERP systems and how to cope with changes that come when companies implement new ERP systems. Auditors may need to keep abreast of the changes that ERP systems bring and also modify their auditing processes and procedures to ensure that there is less risk in providing incorrect audit opinions as a result of a lack of understanding of the ERP environment. This research was conducted to investigate the impact of implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP) System on the conventional statutory external audit process in South African companies. The research was conducted via an online questionnaire that was distributed to auditors across South Africa. In order to obtain explanations of the result findings, interviews were conducted with <b>selected</b> <b>audit</b> seniors in <b>selected</b> <b>audit</b> firms. A total of 137 questionnaire responses was collected and seven interviews done to triangulate the findings of the questionnaire. The results of this survey indicate that ERP implementation inherently changes business processes and there are audit risks that are associated with auditing ERP-enabled environments compared to non-ERP environments. The results also suggest that auditors recognise the risks associated with inter-dependencies among business processes and control vulnerabilities after an ERP implementation. ii Auditors also recognise that an overall understanding of ERP systems and different methods of auditing is a critical component of ensuring that correct opinions of the audit are formulated...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of national programmes of clinical audit in Britain much effort has gone into evaluating them.

40|$|NoIn recent years, {{corporate}} {{failures and}} accounting irregularities {{have led to}} concerns {{about the effectiveness of}} audit committees in the financial reporting process. In response, corporate governance committees in different countries have made specific recommendations designed to enhance the role of the audit committee in executing its financial reporting oversight duties. We investigate in this study, the effect of some of the recommendations by empirically examining the relationship between <b>selected</b> <b>audit</b> committee characteristics and the level of disclosure in interim reports of a sample of 262 UK listed companies. Specifically, the audit committee characteristics examined are shareholding of audit committee members (as a proxy for audit committee independence), audit committee size and audit committee financial expertise. Employing both a weighted and unweighted index to measure interim disclosure, the results indicate a significant negative association between shareholding of audit committee members and interim disclosure. Our results provide evidence of a significant positive association between interim disclosure and audit committee financial expertise. We find no significant relationship between audit committee size and the extent of disclosure in interim reports. Overall, however, our results suggest that audit committee characteristics have an impact on its monitoring effectiveness of the financial reporting process. These results have important implications for corporate governance policy-makers who have a responsibility to prescribe appropriate corporate governance structures to ensure that shareholders are protecte...|$|E

30|$|We {{consider}} {{an environment of}} a relational database system where the user applications are traced and copied into the anonymized audit trails. A <b>selected</b> <b>audit</b> trail contains information about the scopes of user applications and about SQL statements processed by the applications. In the next stage, a statement EXPLAIN PLAN is used to translate SQL statements included in the trails within the environments of the relevant relational schemas into the precise specifications of execution plans and the estimations of processing costs. The execution plans are represented as syntax trees of expressions built over the arguments like relational tables, relational and/or materialized views and the operators of an extended relational algebra. The plans are initially stored in a syntax tree table, which is later on analyzed to identify and to remove the replicas of the common subtrees as the common fragments of the plans. Finally, the results are saved in the “compressed” syntax tree table. Further reduction of the syntax tree table leads to elimination of subtrees whose frequencies of execution {{are the same as}} their parent syntax trees. At the end of this process, we obtain a reduced syntax tree table. Next, an audit trail passes through “data cleaning” phase which removes the database operations whose impact on a database workload is minimal. In the same stage, a predefined set of time units is used to create a workload trace of an audit trail as a sequence of multisets of syntax trees processed within each time unit. Then, the workload trace is projected into a collection of traces one for each individual syntax tree included in a reduced syntax tree table. The set of traces is used by an algorithm that discovers elementary periodic patterns. In the final stage, the derivation rules are used to combine the elementary periodic patterns into the composite periodic patterns.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess the effects of the Home Energy Audit Program on the conservation behavior of participating households and to test a model of energy conservation behavior. The computer-assisted program was developed by the Iowa State University Extension Service and was used to audit approximately 10, 000 houses between 1977 and 1981;Mail surveys were used to obtain data (N = 526) from randomly <b>selected</b> <b>audit</b> participants and a statewide group of home owners. Respondents were asked to report structural improvements they had made between September 1977 and May 1981. Three-fifths of the control group and almost three-fourths of the audit group made one or more capital improvements to increase the energy-efficiency of their homes;Installation of basement and crawl space insulation revealed {{significant differences between the two}} groups. More than twice as many audit participants insulated these areas as the control group. Much of this differential behavior was attributed to knowledge gained about the relative merits of various energy-conserving innovations from participating in the Home Energy Audit Program;A diffusion-of-innovations framework was used to investigate the factors that contribute to the implementation of energy-conserving innovations: contact with change agents, perceived attributes of innovations, household characteristics, and felt needs or problems. The data supported the hypothesis that conservation behaviors involving improved efficiency are different from those representing curtailment actions. Younger households, households that were more connected with others in the social system, and households that were experiencing problems with the current energy situation, were more likely to make structural changes to improve the energy-efficiency of their homes;By contrast, significant predictors of energy-curtailment improvements included the perceived compatibility of personal comfort with an energy-conserving lifestyle and actively seeking energy information from mass media sources. An economic rationale serves as the underlying theme in the efficiency innovations model, while personal comfort overshadows economic considerations in the curtailment innovations model...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three separate but related essays examining auditor changes, auditor industry specialization and audit fee premiums. ^ The first essay investigates whether audit committee characteristics affect the types of auditor changes from an industry specialist auditor to a non-industry specialist auditor or the reverse. I examine whether selection of an external auditor is affected by audit committee characteristics such as: 1) number of meetings, 2) number of members on the audit committee, 3) proportion of auditing experts and, 4) proportion of financial experts. The findings show that {{a greater proportion of}} auditing experts on the audit committee positively influences the switch from a non-industry specialist to an industry specialist auditor, while more sizable audit committees lower the probability of firm switching from a specialist to a non-specialist non-big four global audit firm. ^ The second essay examines the association between shareholders 2 ̆ 7 ratification voting on an external auditor and the switch between specialists. For a sample of publicly listed U. S. firms for years 2005 - 2011, I explore whether the effects of lateral (from one specialist to another or from one non-specialist to another), downward (industry specialist to a non-industry specialist) and upward (non-industry specialist to an industry specialist) switches affect shareholder ratification of the <b>selected</b> <b>audit</b> firm. The findings show that downward switches are viewed more negatively than upward switches. Further, there is limited evidence of differences in voting outcomes between downward and lateral switches. ^ The third essay explores whether audit fee premiums for firms cross-listed on the US stock exchanges are higher for firms that hire specialists. This essay uses a sample of firms cross-listed on the US stock exchanges, and explores whether culture moderates the relationship between choice of a specialist and audit fee premiums. The findings show that specialization premiums vary with the secrecy dimension. ^ Directions for future research are suggested and potential implications for regulators and policy makers are discussed. ...|$|E
