40|$|Males of many anuran species {{optimize}} {{their chances}} of reproductive success by vigorously calling to attract females or by adopting a non-calling “satellite” mating tactic. Satellite males perch silently near calling males and attempt to intercept females that the caller attracts. Models predict that tactic expression in male anurans is influenced by either extrinsic factors (i. e., the social-acoustic environment) or intrinsic factors (i. e., circulating hormone levels and body condition), but {{it is unclear how}} these factors potentially interact to influence tactic expression. For example, males often adopt a <b>satellite</b> <b>mating</b> tactic in response to the broadcast vocalizations of conspecific males, suggesting that males make mating tactic decisions based on the relative attractiveness of nearby calling males. However, the responses of males to broadcast vocalizations are often highly variable, suggesting that the physiological status of males may also be a primary factor influencing tactic decisions under varying social-acoustic contexts. For example, recent models show that an increase in circulating glucocorticoids and a decrease in circulating androgens associated with the depletion of energy reserves during vocalization mediate transitions from calling to non-calling behavior in anurans. To examine how the social-acoustic environment and physiological status of males potentially interact to influence mating tactic decisions, I broadcast calls to calling male green treefrogs, Hyla cinerea, in natural choruses and observed whether males continued to call or adopted a non-calling <b>satellite</b> <b>mating</b> tactic. I then acquired blood samples and measured the size and weight of males to assess whether the probability that a male remained a caller or switched to a non-calling <b>satellite</b> <b>mating</b> tactic was influenced by circulating hormone levels and/or relative body condition. I found that males that continued to call and males that adopted a non-calling satellite tactic in response to broadcast calls did not differ in circulating hormone levels. However, males that continued to call were generally larger, heavier, and in better condition than non-callers. Males that continued to call also produced longer, lower-frequency calls and invested more energy in calling. My results suggest that mating tactic expression in H. cinerea is determined by relative vocal attractiveness and that vocal quality is influenced by size, weight, and body condition...|$|E
40|$|In many anuran species (frogs and toads), males {{alternate}} between calling and a non-calling “satellite” mating tactic. Satellite males characteristically associate with calling males {{and attempt to}} intercept females that are attracted to the vocalizations of the calling “host” male. The prevailing hypothesis is {{that the decision to}} adopt a calling or <b>satellite</b> <b>mating</b> tactic is based on relative attractiveness – males are predicted to adopt a <b>satellite</b> <b>mating</b> tactic when the vocalizations of nearby males are more attractive than their own. In support of this hypothesis, previous studies have shown that satellite males can be induced to call by removing the associated calling host male. However, there is considerable variation in the responses of males in host removal experiments, suggesting that the physiological status of males may {{play a central role in}} tactic decisions. For my honors research, I investigated the role of circulating hormone levels in mediating mating tactic decisions in the green tree frog, Hyla cinerea. I performed host removal experiments wherein calling males were removed in natural satellite-caller associations. I then observed whether satellite males adopted a calling tactic or remained as non-calling males and subsequently obtained blood samples for hormone analysis. Based on recent models describing the hormonal basis for calling behavior in anurans, I predicted that satellite males would have lower levels of circulating androgens, higher levels of stress hormones, be in poorer condition, and produce calls that are less attractive than calling males. Moreover, satellite males that did not call subsequent to removal of the calling host male were predicted to have lower circulating androgen levels and higher levels of CORT than satellite males that called subsequent to removal of the calling host male. Consistent with these predictions, satellite male H. cinerea had lower levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), higher levels of corticosterone (CORT), were in poorer condition and invested less energy in their calls than calling host males. Satellite males that called subsequent to host removal also had significantly higher DHT levels; however, circulating CORT levels did not differ for the two groups of males. My results suggest that circulating androgen levels play a central role in mediating mating tactic decisions in H. cinerea...|$|E

40|$|The Emei {{mustache}} toad, Leptobrachium boringii (Megophryidae), is terrestrial but breeds {{in permanent}} streams. Primarily, {{it has a}} polygynous mating system and polyandry also occurs. The species vigorously defends submerged nest sites. We report on a reproductive study at Mt. Emei, western China conducted in 2004, 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2011 during the breeding season. Males produce both advertisement and courtship calls underwater, and the latter differs from the former in having an additional trill-like last note of low intensity. Females might determine the oviposition location and hence the egg mass location. A low, submissive posture can be adopted by the male to avoid being attacked by other males. When fighting, the maxillary nuptial spines are employed as weapons, and males hold their opponents on their spines with the forelimbs that enlarge during the breeding season. Male body size and the quantity of fight wounds on its ventral side are positively correlated. <b>Satellite</b> male <b>mating</b> might exist in L. boringii. Additionally, underwater calls from another population of this species and a population of L. leishanense generally {{are similar to those}} of the population from Mt. Emei.

40|$|Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration (MATE) for Survivability is {{introduced}} {{as a general}} methodology for survivability analysis and demonstrated through an application to a <b>satellite</b> radar system. <b>MATE</b> for Survivability applies decision theory to the parametric modeling of thousands of design alternatives across representative distributions of disturbance environments. Survivability considerations are incorporated into the existing MATE process (i. e., a solution-generating and decision-making framework that applies decision theory to model-based design) by applying empirically-validated survivability design principles and value-based survivability metrics to concept generation and concept evaluation activities, respectively. MATE for Survivability consists of eight iterative phases: (1) define system value proposition, (2) generate concepts, (3) specify disturbances, (4) apply survivability principles, (5) model baseline system performance, (6) model impact of disturbances on dynamic system performance, (7) apply survivability metrics, and (8) select designs for further analysis. The application of MATE for Survivability to satellite radar demonstrates the importance of incorporating survivability considerations into conceptual design for identifying inherently survivable architectures that efficiently balance competing performance metrics of lifecycle cost, mission utility, and operational survivability.

40|$|Males of many {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} flexible reproductive phenotypes and must decide before each mating season whether to adopt sneaker, <b>satellite,</b> or territorial <b>mating</b> tactics. How do males gauge their abilities against {{others in the}} population? We tested experimentally whether hormone [...] behavior feedback loops allow Galapagos marine iguana males to activate their three behavioral phenotypes as predicted by the relative plasticity hypothesis. Territorial males defended small mating areas and had significantly higher plasma testosterone (T) levels (75 � 11 ng/ml) than did satellite males that roamed around territories (64 � 8 ng/ml) or sneaker males that behaved like females within territories (43 � 11 ng/ml). In territorial males, temporary pharmacological blockade of T slowed head-bob patrolling, decreased territory size threefold, and {{reduced the number of}} females on territories 20 -fold. This supports previous data that females may gauge male attractiveness by using head-bob patrolling, here shown to be a T-dependent trait. Control-treated neighbors reacted to the weakening of T-blocked males by increasing head-bob rate fivefold and territory size 1. 6 -fold, and female numbers increased 2. 5 -fold. Unmanipulated or control-injected males remained unchanged. Behavioral effects were partly reversed after 7 days. T injections induced satellite males to establish temporary territories, even at unconventional locations. Some T-boosted satellite males suffered serious fighting injuries. T-injected sneakers left female clusters and behaved like larger satellite males that roam around territories. Thus, territorial and mating tactics are activated by T, but experimental (de-) activation at the wrong ontogenetic stage is costly: manipulated males switched phenotype but thereby lowered their access to females. We hypothesize that T levels of males that are based on early-season behavioral interactions influence a males' subsequent phenotypic role.
