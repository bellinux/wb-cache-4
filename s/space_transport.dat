500|$|On December 13, 2011, Allen {{announced}} {{the creation of}} Stratolaunch Systems. Stratolaunch is a proposed orbital launch system consisting of a dual-bodied, 6 engine jet aircraft, capable of carrying a rocket to high altitude; the rocket would then separate from its carrier aircraft and fire its own engines to complete its climb into orbit. If successful, this project {{would be the first}} wholly privately funded <b>space</b> <b>transport</b> system. Stratolaunch, which is partnering with Orbital ATK and Scaled Composites, is intended to launch in inclement weather, fly without worrying about the availability of launch pads and to operate from different locations. [...] Stratolaunch plans to ultimately host six to ten missions per year. On April 13, 2015, Vulcan Aerospace was announced. It is the company within Paul Allen's Vulcan Inc. that plans and executes projects to shift how the world conceptualizes space travel through cost reduction and on-demand access.|$|E

2500|$|Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's Director General, put {{the refusal}} to fund the study into context: [...] "It is not a {{question}} of member states for and member states against. [...] I think the decision could not be taken for reasons that are not linked to Clipper itself. [...] The decision could not be taken because of budgetary restraints." [...] Dordain concluded that he was convinced that European support for Kliper was vital for ESA's future involvement in <b>space</b> <b>transport</b> and that a favourable decision can be achieved until June 2006. In concluding [...] "We need two transportation systems in the world", Dordain also outlined shortly after the European Space Summit that the primary requirement of Europe's involvement in the Kliper project was to rely on two separate systems to support the ISS as had been proven vital after the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster in 2003.|$|E
