40|$|The dynamic {{changes of}} land use and wetland of Shuangtaihekou Nature Reserve were {{analyzed}} from 1988 to 2012 through using the GIS and RS, then the changes of the ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>value</b> of Shuangtaihekou Nature Reserve were analyzed {{from the perspective of}} per unit area ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>value</b> of Chinese terrestrial ecosystems, and finally, the relations between the changes of wetland and the function of its ecological service. During the period of 1988 ~ 2012, any kind of natural wetland of Shuangtaihekou Nature Reserve witnessed some degree of shrinkage, with the area ratio falling from 93. 83 % to 77. 25 %. The reed wetland and bottomland shrank the most; during the same period, the ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>value</b> of Shuangtaihekou Nature Reserve showed a decreasing tendency, and decreased 18. 25 % totally. Specifically, the ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>value</b> of farmland increased 4617 yuan; that of waters, decreased 2012 yuan; and that of typical wetland, decreased 115133 yuan; in terms of the contribution rate to ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>value,</b> Shuangtaihekou Nature Reserve &# 39;s wetland ranks top, far beyond other land-use types; however, its contribution rate to ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>value</b> decreased from 75. 07 % in 1988 to 68. 86 % in 2012. The main cause for the decline of its ecological service function is the intense development activities...|$|R

Contests between economic, environmental, {{cultural and social}} interests have not considered valuations of ecosystem services. This first valuation of Cape York's ecosystem services asks the question: who is winning and where? The total ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>value</b> of Cape York is estimated conservatively to be AUD 130 billion per year. The value for each biome ranges from 0 ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ in 'non-remnant' areas, to 602, 000 ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ for coral reefs.

The productivity of grazing lands is 18 ha⁻¹ y⁻¹, compared to the ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>value</b> of at least 3, 300 ha⁻¹ y⁻¹. We argue that the high ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>value</b> of Cape York is because of Indigenous land management over millennia. Since the disenfranchisement of Indigenous people, ecosystems of northern Australia have suffered significant land degradation.

Competing definitions of ecosystem services, the paucity of ecological and economic information, and the lack of standardization in methodology are major obstacles to applying the ecosystem-services approach at the estuary scale. We present a standardized method that combines habitat maps and habitat&# 8211;faunal associations to estimate ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>values</b> for recreational and commercial fisheries in estuaries. Three case studies in estuaries on the U.
