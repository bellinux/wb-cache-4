A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E

25|$|Another study, an {{environmental}} {{review by the}} U.S. Coast Guard, was commissioned in 2009. The review was required because the project would take place over a navigable waterway. The study cost over $2 million, took four years, and resulted in 5,000 pages of reviews. Despite its duration and cost, which precluded the start of construction until 2013, {{it was one of}} the Coast Guard's quickest environmental reviews for such a major project. In March 2012, the Port Authority submitted a request to the federal government for an expedited environmental review process, which was approved in July 2012 even though some residents in Newark and Staten Island <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> the Coast Guard to conduct a full environmental review.|$|E

She said she will continue to collaborate with Alicia Keys on her upcoming album, and she would be flattered to work with Knowles as her voice is unparalleled. Nicki Minaj was also someone who she would like to collaborate with on the album, but did not get the chance. Her vocal ability is often compared to Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, Beyoncé Knowles, Alicia Keys, Christina Aguilera and Annie Lennox.|$|E
25|$|In the {{eleventh}} stage, the first mountain {{stage of the}} race, Gino Bartali was away together with French Jean Robic. There {{was a lot of}} crowd, and they pressed forward to see the cyclist coming. This caused Bartali to fall down during the descent of the Col d'Aspin, and this caused Robic to also fall down. Bartali got up and won the stage, but felt threatened by spectators, who punched and kicked him. One spectator had threatened Bartali with a knife. Bartali told his team manager Alfredo Binda that he was leaving the Tour de France, and that all Italian cyclists should abandon the race. Not all Italian cyclists wanted to leave: the members from the second Italian team (the Italian Cadets) and Adolfo Leoni wanted to stay. Some Italian cyclists <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to stay in the race to help Magni defend the leading position. Magni felt bad about giving up the chance to win the Tour de France, but accepted the decision. The Tour organisation wanted to keep the Italian cyclists in the race, and among other compromises offered to give them neutral gray jerseys, so the spectators would not recognize them. None of this helped, and both Italian teams left the race. As a consequence, the fifteenth stage, that was originally scheduled to end in Italy (Sanremo), was rescheduled to end in Menton.|$|E

Before development began, when even {{the name of the}} game was undecided, the brothers Robyn and Rand Miller <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> a [...] "natural flow" [...] from the first game to the sequel. As Myst proved to be a popular and commercial success, the two developers were able to expand their four-person team to a much larger crew of designers, artists, programmers, and sound designers. Development spanned more than four years, and was a much larger undertaking than for the first game; Riven had a budget of between US$5and $10million, more than ten times the cost of developing Myst.|$|E
500|$|Reactions {{to the red}} culture {{movement}} were divided. Bo's {{revival of}} Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within much of the middle to lower income strata of Chongqing society, and made Bo a star with both conventional Marxists and neo-leftists. Bo won praise for returning the city to what some called China's 'true socialist heritage' by de-emphasizing material wealth, and evoked nostalgia to the social egalitarianism that existed during Mao's time. Some retirees were particularly inspired and <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to pass on [...] "revolutionary spirit" [...] to their children, while others participated {{as a means to}} praise the Communist Party for the country's economic progress.|$|E

500|$|After {{studying}} {{the music of}} the Bantu at Cape Town University, MacDermot incorporated African rhythms into the score of Hair. [...] He listened to [...] "what [...] called quaylas... very characteristic beat, very similar to rock. [...] Much deeper though.... Hair is very African – a lot of [...] rhythms, not the tunes so much." [...] Quaylas stress beats on unexpected syllables, and this influence can be heard in songs like [...] "What a Piece of Work Is Man" [...] and [...] "Ain't Got No Grass". [...] MacDermot said, [...] "My idea was to make a total funk show. They <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> rock & roll – but to me that translated to 'funk.'" [...] That funk is evident throughout the score, notably in songs like [...] "Colored Spade" [...] and [...] "Walking in Space".|$|E
500|$|All outdoor {{canvassing}} {{scenes were}} {{shot in a}} neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, outside the Parks and Recreation studio. Michael Schur <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to establish the type of groundwork public servants often had to conduct in a small town. Seth Gordon sought to make the canvassing scenes as realistic as possible, so he allowed {{a large amount of}} improvisation among the actors. The Pawnee residents who are vocally opposed to parks were based on real-life California residents the Parks and Recreation producers encountered who opposed the construction of parks in their hometown. One such group, [...] "The Committee for a Better Park", was actually a group of residents opposed to parks in general, and the deceptiveness of their name and mission inspired the Parks producers while writing [...] "Canvassing".|$|E

500|$|Orci and Kurtzman <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> {{the general}} {{audience}} {{to like the}} film {{as much as the}} fans, by stripping away [...] "Treknobabble", making it action-packed and giving it the simple title of Star Trek to indicate to newcomers they would not need to watch any of the other films. Abrams saw humor and sex appeal as two integral and popular elements of the show that needed to be maintained. Orci stated being realistic and being serious were not the same thing. Abrams, Burk, Lindelof, Orci and Kurtzman were fans of The Wrath of Khan, and also cited The Next Generation episode [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] as an influence. Abrams' wife Katie was regularly consulted on the script, as were Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof's wives, to make the female characters as strong as possible. Katie Abrams' approval of the strong female characters was partly why Abrams signed on to direct.|$|E

They decided the two should get married after dating for only a short time because it was funny, it made sense with the characters' personalities, and it raised the stakes for future stories involving the two. Schur said: [...] "We just thought about who they were [...] two impulsive goofballs who don’t approach their lives in a responsible, adult manner [...] and decided, what the hell?

500|$|When a final {{agreement}} was reached with the Republican legislative leadership, Dayton called a special session of the legislature on July 19.

After the budget was passed, Dayton said he approached Republicans again after meeting with ordinary citizens—who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> government services to resume and did not care how the shutdown was ended—and because he feared a worse budget deal and unease in the DFL legislative minorities. Zellers said when the deal was finalized that in his view it was [...] "a deal {{that we can all}} be disappointed in, but a deal that is done, a budget that was balanced".
