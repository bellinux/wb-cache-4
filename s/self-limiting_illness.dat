30|$|In the {{paediatric}} population, acute appendicitis is {{a common}} condition that requires emergency abdominal surgery [1, 2]. It usually occurs in older children (ages 10 – 20) and is rare in children less than 2  years, but can occur at any age [3]. As the incidence of acute abdominal pain is common in children, differentiating acute appendicitis from non-surgical <b>self-limiting</b> <b>illnesses</b> is important.|$|R
30|$|The present {{case was}} unusual, {{given that the}} patient was not immunocompromised but succumbed to lung infiltrates {{associated}} with B. cereus. B. cereus is a well-known pathogen in food poisoning. It causes toxin-mediated, <b>self-limited</b> <b>illness</b> characterized by emetic or diarrheal syndromes [4, 5].

40|$|Introduction Dengue fever is a mosquito-bound viral {{illness that}} occurs in {{tropical}} climates. It is endemic in 110 countries. 1 Fifty to three hundred and ninety million people are infected worldwide every year, 2 leading to 25, 000 deaths. 3 It is often an asymptomatic <b>self-limited</b> <b>illness,</b> which can present with myalgias, arthralgias, and hemorrhagic manifestations such as petechiae. In a fraction of cases, dengue fever can proceed to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which can be life threatening causing thrombocytopenia, bleeding and increased vascular permeability. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) can then ensue, if hypotension occurs, and is fatal in 3 ̆e 10...|$|R

40|$|Serious {{liver disease}} in {{children}} is uncommon and patients with {{all but the}} most trivial and <b>self-limiting</b> <b>illness</b> are looked after by or in partner-ship with a specialist centre. Liver disease may be chronic, which implies there is a process which will lead or has led to cirrhosis (irrevers-ible fibrosis with nodular regeneration), or it may be acute, where there is liver dysfunction in an architecturally normal liver. End-stage liver disease is a result of chronic conditions in about 85 % of cases. The frequency of the various aetiologies differs between age groups, and this is reflected in the frequency of the causes of end-stage liver disease in patients undergoing liver transplant...|$|E
40|$|A 49 {{year old}} woman {{presented}} with one year&#x 2032;s history of dysarthria and ataxia.

All three episodes were diagnosed on the basis of positive peripheral blood films for asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum. The illness reached its peak in two weeks and remained static thereafter. Delayed cerebeller syndrome following falciparum malaria is usually a <b>self-limiting</b> <b>illness</b> with complete recovery (delayed reversible post-malaria cerebellar syndrome).

30|$|The {{increase}} in antibiotics is definitely {{due to the}} improvement of healthcare services in the developing countries and growth of the population. But {{it could also be}} due to the overuse of antibiotics to <b>self-limiting</b> <b>illnesses</b> or used inappropriately. Unfortunately, among the enhanced consumption of antibiotics, is the increment of polymixin B throughout these years (Boeckel et al. 2014). Polymixin B is a bactericidal antibiotic, which causes leakage of the bacterial membrane leading to bacterial death (LEXI-COMP 2016 a, b, c). Polymixin B is currently used as a last resort antibacterial and most commonly in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The over use of polymixin B could mean that resistance has occurred and many antibiotics are not working (Boeckel et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Plasmodium vivax is {{the second}} {{important}} parasite of human malaria widely perceived as causing mild and <b>self-limited</b> <b>illness.</b> Unlike P. falciparum, it has wider geographical distribution. Though the public health importance of this parasite is overshadowed by P. falciparum, it is important parasite outside Africa, mainly in Asia and South America.
