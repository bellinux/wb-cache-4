The Reese’s brand also accounts for over 47% of all <b>seasonal</b> <b>sales</b> within {{the convenience}} store channel, with the top two items in all four seasons (Valentine's, Easter, Halloween, and Holiday).

2500|$|The Belle Époque in Paris was {{the golden}} age of the Grand magasin, or {{department}} store. The first modern department store in the city, Le Bon Marché, was originally a small variety store with a staff of twelve when it was taken over by Aristide Boucicaut in 1852. [...] Boucicaut expanded it, and by deft discount pricing, advertising, and innovative marketing (a mail order catalog, <b>seasonal</b> <b>sales,</b> fashion shows, gifts to customers, entertainment for children) turned it into a hugely successful enterprise with a staff of eleven hundred employees and income that increased from 5 million francs in 1860 to 20 million in 1870, then reached 72 million {{at the time of his}} death in 1877. He built an enormous new building near the site of the original shop on the Left Bank, with an iron structure designed with the help of the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel.|$|E
2500|$|In late 19th- {{and early}} 20th-century Paris, wealth was growing rapidly, {{and it became}} {{increasingly}} concentrated. [...] Paris from 1872 to 1927 was a [...] "rentier society". Rentiers (that is, people who relied primarily on inherited wealth) made up about 10% of the population, but owned 70% of aggregate wealth; they spent heavily on luxuries as their income from capital assets could sustain a living standard far beyond what labor income alone would permit. [...] Paris became world-famous for making consumerism a social priority and economic force, especially through its grand department stores and upscale arcades filled with luxury shops. These were [...] "dream machines" [...] that set the world standard for consumption of fine products by the upper classes {{as well as the}} rising middle class. Aristide Boucicaut, the son of a small clothing-shop owner, became partner in a variety store called Le Bon Marché in Paris in 1848. He became owner in 1852 and transformed it into the first modern department store in Paris with high-volume buying, low profit margins, <b>seasonal</b> <b>sales,</b> discounts, advertising, a mail-order catalog, and entertainment and prizes for customers, spouses and children.|$|E

50|$|As the 1960s began, the United States was in {{the trough}} of a recession.

30|$|The first {{priority}} is to increase {{our understanding of the}} technical aspects of herd continuity. Nozieres et al. 2011 have listed no less than six sources of flexibility within herd management that could be further examined: for example, choices between productivity versus survival in herd feeding methods, or in the <b>seasonal</b> distribution of <b>sales</b> of different livestock species. In particular, the activity of Tabaski marketing is a crucial issue in current livestock development planning in Senegal, especially in the modalities of this activity, its interaction with the grain market and the agricultural calendar.

5000|$|Boucicaut {{introduced}} {{a number of}} marketing innovations; a reading room for husbands while their wives shopped; prizes and entertainment for children; the first mail-order catalog, in 1867; and <b>seasonal</b> <b>sales,</b> including the [...] "white sale", designed to sell sheets and bedding in the winter when sales were slow. Boucicaut also introduced several social innovations for his employees, about half of whom were women. Dormitory housing was provided for the unmarried women employees in rooms on the upper floors of the store. He provided a career track for advancement, from second salesperson to chief of counter to department manager. He established a fund, taken from store profits, to help employees who were sick, and offered pensions to employees who {{had worked in the}} store for twenty years.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, {{the first}} three Frank's {{stand-alone}} Christmas stores, Christmas by Frank's, opened. These stores were temporary installations placed in high-volume regional malls located in trade areas where Frank's also operated conventional stores. The Christmas stores provided shoppers with a convenient store (3,000-5,000 sq ft) where {{they were able to}} purchase holiday decorations, crafts and gift-wrap without making a separate stop. Frank's was pleased with the results, and the following year, the company operated 100 of the temporary stores. Indeed, Christmas decorations and crafts had become increasingly important lines to Frank's, helping to compensate for the <b>seasonal</b> <b>sales</b> declines in gardening supplies. Sales in 1992 grew to $558 million, a seven percent increase over the previous year, yet higher costs and interest on General Host's debt caused its profits to decline, from $8.7 million in 1991 to $2.9 million in 1992.|$|E

40|$|Clearance {{pricing and}} end of season {{inventory}} management are challenging and important problems in retailing. Sales rates depend upon price, seasonal effects, and the remaining assortment of items available to customers.

This paper develops optimal clearance prices and inventory management policies that {{take into account the}} impact of reduced assortment and <b>seasonal</b> changes on <b>sales</b> rates. Versions of these policies have been tested and implemented at three major retail chains and these applications are summarized and discussed. Marketing, Pricing, Retailing...|$|R

50|$|The modern {{department}} store {{was born in}} Paris in 1852, shortly before the Belle Époque, when Aristide Boucicaut enlarged a medium-sized variety store called Au Bon Marché, using innovative new means of marketing and pricing, including a mail order catalog and <b>seasonal</b> <b>sales.</b> When Boucicaut {{took charge of the}} store in 1852, it had an income of 500,000 francs and twelve employees. Twenty years later it had 1,825 employees and an income of more than 20 million francs. In 1869 Boucicault began constructing a much larger store, with an iron frame, a central courtyard covered with a glass skylight, on the rue de Sèvres. The architect was Louis Boileau, who received some assistance from the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel.

40|$|The rush of {{activity}} among London’s auction {{houses in the}} first few weeks of summer has long been a familiar occurrence that persists even today. However, this intense <b>seasonal</b> concentration of <b>sales</b> was not always so. This paper draws on quantitative methods to explore the gradual emergence of a tightly scheduled auction season in London {{at the turn of the}} nineteenth century, focusing on the sale of paintings. By analysing historical art auction catalogue data, the paper traces the ways in which this shift varied across different segments of the auction market, as well as between individual auction houses. As our study shows, the temporal clustering of painting auctions had specific business advantages, but it also played a key role in enhancing the social import of these auctions, demarcating an annual, weeks- long “event” looked to with anticipation and excitement by auctioneers and buyers alike...|$|R
