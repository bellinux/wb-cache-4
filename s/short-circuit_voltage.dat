40|$|Purpose. The {{windings}} {{of power}} transformers have low resistance value and a most inductance, which reduces {{the rate of}} rise of current in the windings. Therefore, when the estimated amount of current is set one should make sure {{of the possibility of}} achieving it. As inductance is characterized by a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>voltage,</b> it is necessary to develop a technique for determining the maximum magnitude of the current in the windings of the transformer according to the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> and operating frequency. Methodology. The classical method of calculation of transient processes to determine the value of the transient current of the transformer windings to achieve purpose is used. Findings. The nature of the transient current in the windings of high-frequency transformer, which is powered by a voltage inverter is investigated and analyzed. Originality. The method for determining the maximum amount of current depending on the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> and frequency of the applied voltage with other set-up parameters was proposed. Practical value. The proposed method allows determining the maximum value of the current in the windings of the high-frequency transformer including its RL-parameters. This will let compare the value of a given current with possible depending on <b>short-circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> and frequency of the applied voltage.

40|$|Reliability and {{lifetime}} of photovoltaic (PV) systems depend {{mainly on the}} energy performance of modules and on their different degradation modes. Accordingly, research must be focused on degradations of PV modules. This paper {{presents the results of}} investigations carried out on the degradation mechanisms of PV modules of the Melouka central in the area of Adrar in Algeria after 28 years of exposure in the Saharan environment. Main degradation modes are observed through visual inspection of PV modules: discoloration of encapsulant, broken and abrasion of glass, delamination, discoloration and hot spot of cells, oxidation of front grid fingers and thermal shocks. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics are acquired with outdoor measurements in the site. The experimental results permit to detect both hot spots and thermal shocks which are the most detrimental total defects visually observable in the site, and to quantify the reduction of electrical performance data correlated with visual degradation data. A maximum power (Pmax) degradation rate of 1. 22 %/year is found which is closely related to short-circuit current (Isc) of 0. 78 %/year, followed by fill factor (FF) of 0. 57 %/year and finally <b>short-circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> (Voc) of 0. 1 %/year.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} computationally and analytically investigates ways {{to model}} solar cells when the lateral {{motion of charge}} carriers and light are relevant. We focus on back-contact perovskite solar cells, and assessing the experimental technique of scanning photocurrent microscopy {{as a means to}} investigate them. Solar cells are three-dimensional objects frequently modelled as being one-dimensional. However, for more complex designs of solar cell or if the cell is only point-illuminated, one-dimensional modelling is insufficient. In the first study, some conditions for reducing the complexity of two-dimensional drift-diffusion simulations are investigated for a back-contact perovskite cell. Analytic expressions for the relationship in both the low extraction velocity and high extraction velocity regimes are demonstrated, and the conditions where these approximations break down are investigated. These findings are then applied a point-excited film with an extended electrode, a problem encountered during scanning photocurrent microscopy. We show the current recorded in this case should decay exponentially with the distance between excitation and electrode, with a decay constant that can be related to device parameters. The characteristic equilibration time for the system to reach this current is demonstrated to increase linearly with distance. Between this gradient and the exponent, information about the diffusion and recombination mechanics can be extracted from a variety of systems. Photon recycling is the process in whereby photogenerated carriers recombine to generate light that is absorbed again within the solar cell. In the second section, we apply the findings of the first section to show that experimental results published elsewhere are best explained by photon recycling in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite back-contact solar cells. However we do not have an established theoretical model for long-ranged lateral optical transport in these solar cells. Three models are developed: a bimolecular model for unscattered, coherent transport; a photon diffusion model for frequently scattered, noncoherent light; and a monomolecular, assisted-diffusion model. The modal nature of coherent optical transport is considered and modifications to previous one-dimensional theories are made. The nature of the photon diffusion model is discussed, as are theoretical shortcomings. All three models are then solved numerically and compared to experimental results. The low-scattering photon diffusion models correspond well to the experiment. The third investigation involves the performance of different architectures of back-contact perovskite cells. These cells potentially offer increased current due to less shadowing by front electrodes. We compare them {{to each other and to}} traditional vertical structures. It is found that, in terms of internal transport, the back-contact solar cells give less efficient performance than the vertical design. The best of the back-contact cells investigated is a flat interdigitated design. The increase in efficiency from optical factors would have to exceed 10 % for the overall efficiency of back-contact cells to be higher than vertical devices. We also develop a model of photon recycling appropriate for short-ranged, bulk 2 D transport and demonstrate that in perovskites, it produces little change in power conversion efficiency (and small changes in <b>short-circuit</b> <b>voltage)</b> when compared with the standard drift-diffusion equations with the second-order recombination constant is adjusted.
