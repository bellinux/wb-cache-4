5|$|The {{corncrake}} {{can be seen}} at {{the bridge}} of Banagher in the summer. Once a common <b>summer</b> <b>visitor</b> to Ireland, corncrakes have suffered drastic population declines over the last few decades and are threatened with global extinction. Conservation efforts have focused on changing harvesting times to avoid the nesting season, May to August. The hay meadows of the callows support large numbers of these birds – {{one of the few places}} in the world where this globally threatened species is still common.|$|E
5|$|In recent decades, {{substantial}} numbers of central European birds have taken to wintering in gardens in Great Britain, and, to a lesser extent, Ireland, where the blackcap was formerly just a <b>summer</b> <b>visitor.</b> Although the British climate is sub-optimal, compensatory factors include the ready availability of food, (particularly from bird tables), a shorter migration distance, and the avoidance of the Alps and the Sahara Desert. These wintering birds come from Germany, and isotope analysis (which enables the wintering location to be determined) showed that the German birds wintering in Britain tend to mate only among themselves, and do not usually interbreed with those wintering in the Mediterranean or western Africa. This is because the British migrants arrive back on the breeding grounds earlier than blackcaps wintering around the Mediterranean, and form pairs before the southern birds arrive. Mixed pairings are also selected against because the hybrid young would migrate in an intermediate direction, which would take them into the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin {{is found}} across Australia except for Tasmania, Cape York, the Top End {{and most of}} the Kimberley (there have been {{occasional}} sightings in the southernmost parts). Offshore populations exist on Rottnest Island, as well as Greenly and Pearson Islands off the Eyre Peninsula, but it is not found on Kangaroo Island. Although widespread, it is uncommon in many areas; it is rare east of the Great Dividing Range, in coastal regions in the south of the continent, and in the northern parts of its range—it is seldom encountered north of 20°S. Its movements are generally poorly known, particularly outside the breeding season. It is sedentary in much of the southern parts of its range, although the red-capped robin is a spring and <b>summer</b> <b>visitor</b> to the Nullarbor Plain and Adelaide region in South Australia, and central Victoria. It is a winter visitor in the northern parts of its range.|$|E

5|$|After {{disappearing from}} Belgium before {{the onset of}} the 20th century, it has {{returned}} to breed in the Belgian Ardennes, Luxembourg and Burgundy, France, by 2000. It appears to be increasing in numbers in Spain and Portugal, where the population was estimated at 405 to 483 pairs in 2006. The black stork is a rare vagrant to the British Isles, turning up in the warmer months—particularly in spring—generally in the south and east. Sightings have become more common since the 1970s as its breeding range moves northwards. It has been recorded in Scotland six times between 1946 and 1983, including from Shetland, Orkney and the Highlands, as well as the Scottish Borders (Peebles). It is not abundant in the western parts of its distribution, but more densely inhabits eastern Transcaucasia. Further east, it has been recorded from locations across Iran, though little is known about its habits there; breeding has been recorded from near Aliabad in Fars province, Khabr National Park in Kerman province, Karun river in Khuzestan province, Qaranqu River in East Azarbaijan province, and Aliabad river in Razavi Khorasan province. The population has declined in Iran due to draining of wetlands. East of the Ural Mountains, the black stork is patchily found in forested and mountainous areas up to 60°‒63° N across Siberia to the Pacific Ocean. South of Siberia, it breeds in Xinjiang, northwestern China, northern Mongolia south to the Altai Mountains, and northeastern China south to the vicinity of Beijing. In the Korean Peninsula, the black stork is an uncommon <b>summer</b> <b>visitor,</b> no longer breeding in the south since 1966. Birds have been seen in the northeast but it is not known whether they breed there. Similarly it has been seen in the summer in Afghanistan, but its breeding status is uncertain.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} show the {{population}} trend of forest and wetland <b>summer</b> <b>visitors</b> to Japan, field observations, literature surveys, and questionnaire surveys were conducted in 1995 - 1997. Field observations and literature surveys showed {{that the number of}} seven species of <b>summer</b> <b>visitors</b> drastically declined in some areas of Japan: Black Paradise Flycatchers Terpsiphone atricaudata, Ashy Minivets Pericrocotus divaricatus, Yellow-breasted Buntings Emberiza aureola, Ruddy Kingfishers Halcyon coromanda, Brown Hawk Owls Ninox scutulata, Jungle Nightjars Caprimulgus indicus, and Porzana Crakes Porzana fusca. These seven species were the focus of questionnaires sent {{to the members of the}} Wild Bird Society of Japan. It was shown that all these species declined in many areas of Japan during the past 25 years, although the pattern of decline varied somewhat by species. Serious habitat destruction and deterioration did not occur in half of the study areas of six forest and grassland species. Longterm observation records showed that in many areas the number of species decreased in <b>summer</b> <b>visitors</b> but did not change or increased in residents. It seems that the population decline of <b>summer</b> <b>visitors</b> is mostly associated with habitat destruction in their wintering areas of Southeast Asia...|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Wordsworth {{corrected}} her husband's note to Miss Fenwick, {{by adding}} in the MS., [...] "at Coleorton"; and at Coleorton the Wordsworths certainly spent {{the winter of}} 1806, the Town-end Cottage at Grasmere being too small for their increasing household. It {{is more likely that}} Wordsworth wrote the poem at Coleorton than at Grasmere, and it looks {{as if it had been}} an evening impromptu, after hearing both the nightingale and the stock-dove. There are no nightingales at Grasmere,--they are not heard further north than the Trent valley,--while they used to abound in the [...] "peaceful groves" [...] of Coleorton. If the locality was--as Mrs. Wordsworth states--Coleorton, and if the lines were written after hearing the nightingale, the year would be 1807, and not 1806 (the poet's own date). The nightingale is a <b>summer</b> <b>visitor</b> in this country, and could not have been heard by Wordsworth at Coleorton in 1806, as he did not go south to Leicestershire till November in that year. But it is quite possible that it was [...] "the stock-dove's voice" [...] that alone suggested the lines, and that they were written either in 1806, or (as I think more likely), very early in 1807. In the month of January Wordsworth was corresponding with Scott about the poems in this edition of 1807.--ED.|$|E

6000|$|The willow wren {{is one of}} the commonest and {{undoubtedly}} the most generally diffused of the British songsters. A <b>summer</b> <b>visitor,</b> one of the earliest to arrive, usually appearing on the South Coast in the last week in March; a little later he may be met with in very nearly every wood, thicket, hedge, common, marsh, orchard, and large garden throughout the kingdom--it is hard to say, writes Seebohm, where he is not found. Wherever there are green perching-places, and small caterpillars, flies and aphides to feed upon, there you will see and hear the willow wren. He is a sweet and constant singer from the date of his arrival until about the middle of June, when he becomes silent for a season, resuming his song in July, and continuing it throughout August and even into September. This late summer singing is, however, fitful and weak and less joyous in character than in the spring. But in spite of his abundance and universality, and the charm of his little melody, he is not familiarly known to the people generally, as they know the robin redbreast, pied wagtail, dunnock, redstart, wheatear, and stonechat. The name we call him by is a very old one; it was first used in English by Ray, in his translation of Willughby's Ornithology, about three centuries ago; but it still remains a book-name unknown to the rustic. Nor has this common little bird any widely known vernacular name. If by chance you find a country-man who knows the bird, and has a name for it, this will be one which is applied indiscriminately to two, three, or four species. The willow wren, in fact, is one of those little birds that are [...] "seen rather than distinguished," [...] on account of its small size, modest colouring, and its close resemblance to other species of warblers; also on account of the quiet, gentle character of its song, which is little noticed {{in the spring and summer}} concert of loud, familiar voices.|$|E
6000|$|The old {{fishing and}} {{seafaring}} village, {{which has now}} almost lost the recollection of its first estate in its absorption with {{the care of the}} summer colony, was sparsely dropped along the highway bordering the harbor, and the shores of the river, where the piles of the time-worn wharves are still rotting. A few houses of the past remain, but the type of the summer cottage has impressed itself upon all the later building, and the native is passing architecturally, if not personally, into abeyance. He takes the situation philosophically, and in the season he caters to the summer colony not only as the landlord of the rented cottages, and the keeper of the hotels and boarding-houses, but as livery-stableman, grocer, butcher, marketman, apothecary, and doctor; there is not one foreign accent in any of these callings. If the native is a farmer, he devotes himself to vegetables, poultry, eggs, and fruit for the summer folks, and brings these supplies to their doors; his children appear with flowers; and there are many proofs that he has accurately sized the cottagers up in their tastes and fancies as well as their needs. I doubt if we have sized him up so well, or if our somewhat conventionalized ideal of him is perfectly representative. He is, perhaps, more complex than he seems; he is certainly much more self- sufficing than might have been expected. The summer folks are the material from which his prosperity is wrought, but he is not dependent, and is very far from submissive. As in all right conditions, it is here the employer who asks for work, not the employee; and the work must be respectfully asked for. There are many fables to this effect, as, for instance, that of the lady who said to a <b>summer</b> <b>visitor,</b> critical of the week's wash she had brought home, [...] "I'll wash you and I'll iron you, but I won't take none of your jaw." [...] A primitive independence is the keynote of the native character, and it suffers no infringement, but rather boasts itself. [...] "We're independent here, I tell you," [...] said the friendly person who consented to take off the wire door. [...] "I was down Bangor way doin' a piece of work, and a fellow come along, and says he, 'I want you should hurry up on that job.' 'Hello!' says I, 'I guess I'll pull out.' Well, we calculate to do our work," [...] he added, with an accent which sufficiently implied that their consciences needed no bossing in the performance.|$|E
