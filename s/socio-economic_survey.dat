40|$|The report {{points out}} that several <b>socio-economic</b> <b>surveys</b> {{have been carried out}} to date in Mozambique. Most of these surveys include food {{consumption}} and other data that could be used as baseline information in the formulation or under the framework of policies and projects related to food security and nutrition. However the data collected are currently underutilized in the country, because there are not enough national technicians with the ability to process and analyse food consumption and nutrition survey results. Strengthening the capacity of Mozambican staff in this area is essential to ensure that the information potentially available is effectively provided for policy formulation and programme monitoring. The first recommendation is that the project trainees start without delay to apply their acquired skills to the consolidation and broadening of the national food and nutrition information basis. The second recommendation is that the methods of data handling introduced by the FAO workshop be promoted for general application country-wide in the processing and analysis of the food and nutrition components of household and other <b>socio-economic</b> <b>surveys</b> undertaken as baseline for development programme and project planning. It is also recommended that a one-week refresher training seminar be organized approximately one year after the TCP workshop and for the same participants. The follow-up seminar would aim to check the level of experience gained by the trainees during the period of practice and to reinforce their theoretical and practical knowledge in the area of food and nutrition data processing and analysis.
