25|$|Typefaces can {{be divided}} into two main categories: serif and sans serif. Serifs {{comprise}} the <b>small</b> <b>features</b> at the end of strokes within letters. The printing industry refers to typeface without serifs as sans serif (from French sans, meaning without), or as grotesque (or, in German, grotesk).|$|E
25|$|The Taurus {{received}} another redesign for 2000, which replaced {{many of the}} oval-derived design {{elements of}} the previous model with sharper creases and corners, an aspect of Ford's New Edge styling language. To reduce the car's price and keep it competitive, Ford reduced costs on the car in 1999, such as giving the Taurus sedan rear drum brakes on ABS equipped vehicles (previously, upgrading to ABS included the addition of rear disc brakes), eliminating the dual exhaust on the higher end models, and trimming many other <b>small</b> <b>features.</b>|$|E

25|$|Semiconductor (or solid state) QCA {{implementations}} {{could potentially}} be used to implement QCA devices with the same highly advanced semiconductor fabrication processes used to implement CMOS devices. Cell polarization is encoded as charge position, and quantum-dot interactions rely on electrostatic coupling. However, current semiconductor processes have not yet {{reached a point where}} mass production of devices with such <b>small</b> <b>features</b> (~20 nanometers) is possible. Serial lithographic methods, however, make QCA solid state implementation achievable, but not necessarily practical. Serial lithography is slow, expensive and unsuitable for mass-production of solid-state QCA devices. Today, most QCA prototyping experiments are done using this implementation technology.|$|E
25|$|ESEM is {{especially}} useful for non-metallic and biological materials because coating with carbon or gold is unnecessary. Uncoated Plastics and Elastomers can be routinely examined, as can uncoated biological samples. Coating {{can be difficult}} to reverse, may conceal <b>small</b> <b>features</b> {{on the surface of the}} sample and may reduce the value of the results obtained. X-ray analysis is difficult with a coating of a heavy metal, so carbon coatings are routinely used in conventional SEMs, but ESEM makes it possible to perform X-ray microanalysis on uncoated non-conductive specimens; however some specific for ESEM artifacts are introduced in X-ray analysis. ESEM may be the preferred for electron microscopy of unique samples from criminal or civil actions, where forensic analysis may need to be repeated by several different experts.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet microscopes {{have two}} main purposes. The {{first is to}} utilize the shorter {{wavelength}} of ultraviolet electromagnetic energy to improve the image resolution beyond that of the diffraction limit of standard optical microscopes. This technique is used for non-destructive inspection of devices with very <b>small</b> <b>features</b> such as those found in modern semiconductors. The second application for UV microscopes is contrast enhancement where the response of individual samples is enhanced, relative to their surrounding, due to the interaction of light with the molecules within the sample itself. One example is {{in the growth of}} protein crystals. Protein crystals are formed in salt solutions. As salt and protein crystals are both formed in the growth process, and both are commonly transparent to the human eye, they cannot be differentiated with a standard optical microscope. As the tryptophan of protein absorbs light at 280nm, imaging with a UV microscope with 280nm bandpass filters makes it simple to differentiate between the two types of crystals. The protein crystals appear dark while the salt crystals are transparent.|$|E

50|$|The mask cost {{strongly}} {{benefits from}} the use of multiple patterning. The EUV single exposure mask has <b>smaller</b> <b>features</b> which take much longer to write than the immersion mask. Even though mask features are 4x larger than wafer features, the number of shots is exponentially increased for much <b>smaller</b> <b>features.</b> Furthermore, the sub-100 nm features on the mask are also much harder to pattern, with absorber heights ≈70 nm.|$|R

500|$|Extrapolation {{from the}} storm's eastward {{progress}} yielded a projected landfall location near Levy County. However, {{after the passage}} of the upper-level system early on August 31, steering currents slackened, and Elena became nearly stationary in the extreme northeastern Gulf of Mexico. At its closest, the center of the storm was around [...] from Cedar Key, Florida, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 105 mph (170 km/h). Elena's intensity remained consistent, and the cyclone was able to continue strengthening as soon as movement resumed. Early on September 1, Elena reached Category 3 major hurricane status. An area of high pressure soon began to build over the eastern United States, causing Elena to slowly retrograde westward. For much of September 1, the center of the hurricane was within range of the WSR-57 radar station in Apalachicola, Florida, enabling extensive study of <b>small</b> <b>features</b> within the eye and surrounding eyewall. During that period of observation, the previously unobstructed eye became cloud-filled.|$|E
2500|$|Utamaro's early bijin-ga follow {{closely the}} example of Kiyonaga. [...] In the 1790s his figures became more exaggerated, with thin bodies and long faces with <b>small</b> <b>features.</b> [...] Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and {{printing}} techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects {{from a wide variety}} of class and background. [...] Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm.|$|E
2500|$|The range {{resolution}} of the TDWR is nearly twice that of that classic NEXRAD scheme. This will give much better details on <b>small</b> <b>features</b> in precipitation patterns, particularly in thunderstorms, in reflectivity and radial velocity. However, this finer resolution is only available up to [...] from the radar; beyond that, the resolution is close {{to that of the}} NEXRAD. However, since August 2008, oversampling on NEXRAD has increase its resolution in lower elevations in reflectivity data to [...] by 0.5 degree, and increase the range of Doppler velocity data to [...] This lessens the advantages of TDWR for those elevations.|$|E

2500|$|First, {{the plaster}} is mixed and {{the pattern is}} sprayed with a thin film of parting {{compound}} to prevent the plaster from sticking to the pattern. The plaster is then poured over the pattern and the unit shaken so that the plaster fills any <b>small</b> <b>features.</b> The plaster sets, usually in about 15 minutes, and the pattern is removed. The mold is then baked, between [...] and , to remove any excess water. The dried mold is then assembled, preheated, and the metal poured. Finally, after the metal has solidified, the plaster is broken from the cast part. The used plaster cannot be reused.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1932 and 1936, {{houses for}} the park superintendent, park naturalist, and several other {{employees}} were completed along with four more utility buildings, a second comfort station, and a dormitory for park rangers. The old log headquarters building was demolished and a new rustic stone structure built in its place. The plaza {{in front of the}} new administration building had a landscaped island in the center with space to park 50 cars around the outside. During this period, Civilian Conservation Corps crews planted over a thousand trees and several thousand shrubs in the Government Camp area. In addition, many <b>small</b> <b>features</b> such as flagstone walks, rustic signs, stone bridges, and drinking fountains were incorporated into the landscape. In 1938, Government Camp was renamed [...] "Park Headquarters" [...] by Superintendent Ernest P. Leavitt.|$|E
2500|$|The {{name and}} {{inspiration}} of the algorithm demand an interesting feature {{related to the}} temperature variation to be embedded in the operational characteristics of the algorithm. This necessitates a gradual reduction of the temperature as the simulation proceeds. The algorithm starts initially with [...] set to a high value (or infinity), and then it is decreased at each step following some annealing schedule—which may be specified by the user, but must end with [...] {{towards the end of}} the allotted time budget. [...] In this way, the system is expected to wander initially towards a broad region of the search space containing good solutions, ignoring <b>small</b> <b>features</b> of the energy function; then drift towards low-energy regions that become narrower and narrower; and finally move downhill according to the steepest descent heuristic.|$|E

The use of PSPI overcoat eliminates several process steps and reduces IC packaging costs when compared to non-photosensitive polyimides (nPSPIs) or other processes. Present packaging applications for photosensitive polyimide utilize aspect ratios of 1 : 1 (film thickness/minimum feature size). Marketplace trends indicate the need for smaller packages and therefore <b>smaller</b> <b>features</b> on the interconnect level of the package.
