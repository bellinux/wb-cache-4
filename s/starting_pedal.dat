40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effects of the free pedal {{position}} adjustment on clutching movements of the left lower limb {{as well as on the}} perceived discomfort. Six automotive clutch pedal configurations were tested by 20 subjects (5 young females, 5 young males, 5 older females, 5 older males) using a multiadjustable experimental mock-up. Results showed that the pedal position was adjusted to ensure a good <b>starting</b> <b>pedal</b> position allowing a less flexed ankle and avoiding unnecessary leg displacement from the foot rest to the position at start depression. Pedal position adjustment seemed not motivated by reducing joint torque though discomfort ratings were found significantly correlated with knee and ankle torques at the end of depression. The present work also illustrates that the less-constrained motion concept is helpful for a better understanding of people preference and useful for identifying motionrelated biomechanical parameters to be considered for defining assessment criteria...|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Autobike {{was equipped}} with a system of centrifugal weights on the rear wheel with a rear derailleur attached to them. When the rider <b>started</b> <b>pedaling</b> it would cause the weights to spin outwards, which shifted the derailleur to a higher gear. When the rider stops pedaling and the bike comes to a stop, the weights {{would return to the}} centre position, shifting the bike into its lowest gear to get started.|$|R

50|$|One <b>pedal</b> <b>starts</b> {{involved}} rearing {{back with}} your arms straight out and almost {{parallel to the ground}} with one foot behind and to aside the rear wheel. The other foot was on a pedal that was extended forward and the front tire pushing against the starting gate. When the gate dropped a rider would lunge forward placing his weight on the lead pedal, accelerating him out of the gate. If timed right with a quick reaction a racer can get a jump on the others out of the gate called the holeshot. By the early 1980s two <b>pedal</b> <b>starts</b> became the mode in which the vast majority of top racers used. It was almost exactly identical to the one <b>pedal</b> <b>start</b> except the trailing foot was on the trailing pedal as with the leading foot was on the leading pedal. The racer maintained his balance with the friction of the front tire pressed against the gate and the racer subtlety shifting his weight to counteract the imbalance. Getting out of the gate was similar to the one <b>pedal</b> <b>start</b> in that the racer lunged his weight forward against the handle bars while pressing his full weight and leg strength against the lead pedal. Simultaneously you use your upper body strength to quickly pull the bike forward with the handle bars. By the early 1980s most racers felt that this provided a quicker start to the old one <b>pedal</b> <b>start</b> with the advantage of not having to find the rear pedal with trailing foot. Since it is already on the pedal you can concentrate fully on starting and getting out of the gate a second sooner than anyone using a one <b>pedal</b> <b>start</b> technique. Ironically, the sanctioning bodies in the early 80's to cut down on gate jumping by those using the two <b>pedal</b> <b>start</b> who could time the cadence of the gate lights because it fell at a set period of time every time (they use starting lights much like those on a top fuel drag racing drag strip). In 1985 the ABA switched to dead man gates in which the green light didn't light and the gate fall in a predictable fashion making timing the gate difficult (the gate still fell the instant the light turned green of course). Concentrating on when the light turn green was critical with reaction time to that was critical. This made two <b>pedal</b> <b>starts</b> even more of a premium making one <b>pedal</b> <b>starts</b> unheard off by the mid to late '80s.|$|R

50|$|The special pedal cranks allowed both pedals to {{be rotated}} forward so that the pedals would form motorcycle-style {{footrests}} in normal operation. To engage the pedals, the left-hand pedal crank could be rotated forward and locked and a drive gear engaged allowing the user to pedal. A short chain connected the pedal drive to the main engine-chain drive system. Pedalling was hard work for the rider: there was no freewheel and the pedal gearing was very low. The engine could be <b>started</b> with <b>pedal</b> drive engaged, causing the pedals to rotate under engine power when the bike was in gear. In practice, the cam and shaft arrangement to engage the pedals frequently seized (in normal operation, a rider would very rarely engage pedal-drive as it was less tiring to push than to pedal).|$|R

This made it easier to use and manipulate while in the act of playing guitars, since it no longer required a hand to be used.|$|R

"The player perches on it like on a {{stationary}} bicycle and <b>starts</b> to <b>pedal.</b> The midi-controller and the Laptop {{can be put}} on a tray {{that is at the}} height of the handlebar. By using a dynamic microphone that is {{at the height of the}} mouth he can experiment with his sic voice respectively breath and modify it per MIDI in real-time. The sound of the arbor at the propeller and the chain is recorded with a condenser microphone (cardioid). Through reverse turns of the pedals the sound of chain and arbor becomes more concisely and is at the same time a variation of sound. By alternating forward and reverse turns a percussive rhythmical complement is built to the laminary sound of the bottle that mainly can be modified in the pitch. Dense and complex structures of sound can be achieved by adding overtones, glissandi and delays." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{single-acting}} uniflow {{steam engine}} configuration closely {{resembles that of}} a two-stroke internal combustion engine, {{and it is possible}} to convert a two-stroke engine to a uniflow steam engine by feeding the cylinder with steam via a [...] "bash valve" [...] fitted in place of the spark plug. As the rising piston nears the top of its stroke, it knocks open the bash valve to admit a pulse of steam. The valve closes automatically as the piston descends, and the steam is exhausted through the existing cylinder porting. The inertia of the flywheel then carries the piston back to the top of its stroke against the compression, as it does in the original form of the engine. Also like the original, the conversion is not self-starting and must be turned over by an external power source to start. An example of such a conversion is the steam-powered moped, which is <b>started</b> by <b>pedalling.</b>|$|R

Junyer ask him if he's all right. Papa bear tries to punch him but he slips and fells on the floor fainted with a shocked Junyer looking on. They proceed on the next act to swing and grab the next swing. Junyer did not grab Papa Bear and swing for the second time Papa screams [...] "Grab me stupid!"

Junyer this time with his head on the board which reads [...] "Hit my Baby son 25 cents for 3 shots", Papa bear throws a baseball at Junyer but it bounces back and hits him, which in turn, knocks him out. Mama Bear carries a couch chair for Papa Bear to land on and Junyer acts to land on the seesaw to send him into the air to land on the couch but he sends him into the sky and to outer space.

5000|$|The lively gigue-like fughetta {{has several}} {{similarities}} {{to the larger}} chorale prelude: {{it is in the}} mixolydian mode of G; it <b>starts</b> with a <b>pedal</b> point of repeated Gs; the number ten occurs as the number of entries of the subject (four of them inverted); and the piece ends on a plagal cadence.

5000|$|Popeye {{has jumped}} out of a plane without a parachute, and as {{punishment}} {{he has to do}} a variety of chores to do to keep the ship clean. He uses the planes on the ships to clean it (e.g. tying mops to the propellers) and also paints camouflage onto the ship showing that he is trying to help the war effort. However, before he can get his jobs done a ‘cloud’ appears that begins to drop bombs onto the ship. At first Popeye is confused but then it is revealed that the ‘cloud’ is actually attached to a Japanese plane with the lettering ‘Made in Japan’ written clearly on the back to make sure the audience knows who the enemy is. A Japanese soldier emerges depicted with thick glasses and big teeth to pander to contemporary racist stereotyping in America in an effort to demonise the enemy. Popeye uses terms like ‘Jap’ and ‘stormtrooper’ to describe the character and starts firing missiles at him from a plane while the stereotyped character frantically <b>starts</b> <b>pedalling.</b> Popeye manages to blow up the plane and the Japanese man is left holding a typical looking umbrella before falling onto a ‘Jap Scrap Repair Ship’. All of the Japanese sailors on the ship look the same, reinforcing the idea of a Japanese unified mass especially when they all make a drilling sound to fix the plane. After falling from his plane, Popeye also lands on the ‘Jap Scrap Repair Ship’ and it begins to tip. All of the Japanese sailors start beating him but after eating his spinach, he throws his empty spinach can in the water to distract them and they all jump into the water. Because of eating his spinach, Popeye turns into the Statue of Liberty which was a familiar symbol in anti-Nazi cartoons as it is also used in Disney’s Der Fuehrer’s Face (1943). As Popeye thinks he is safe, a big Japanese battleship sends bombs his way. But this time he is prepared and rides the repair ship into it. He is able to easily fight off the Japanese sailors and when he throws them into the body of the ship their imprints make a ‘V’ shape, perhaps showing Victory for the Allies. Popeye then uses a piece of railing from the ship to cut it up like a tin with a can opener before sitting back and eating an ice cream waiting for the ship to crumble. The cartoon ends with Popeye flying home with the Japanese sailors locked in a cage behind him, where they start complaining before they [...] "turns" [...] into rats and scurrying around.|$|R
