500|$|Describing the band, National Public Radio host Guy Raz said, [...] "Take the swagger of Jamaican dub, {{throw in}} a little Memphis soul and send it halfway down the globe, and what comes back? The band Fat Freddy's Drop." [...] The band has been {{categorised}} under many genres, and members <b>say</b> <b>many</b> of those genres helped shape their musical style: delta blues, jazz, dub, soul, techno, and contemporary rhythm and blues. Musical styles heard while on tour have also shaped their sound; Dr Boondigga and the Big BW was influenced by contemporary German, Portuguese, and Bhangra music while touring {{in the years before}} its release.|$|E
500|$|The {{involvement}} of Diane Taylor {{as a consultant}} producer is credited with maintaining Scott & Baileys [...] "rigorous authenticity". According to Jessamy Calkin of The Telegraph, [...] "the attention to detail is more extreme on this series, <b>say</b> <b>many</b> of the crew, than others they have worked on". During the filming of Unforgiven in 2008 (written by Wainwright and also starring Suranne Jones), Wainwright was told to meet Taylor by Grant Montgomery, the show's designer. After meeting, the production was given the green light by ITV and the script was largely re-written, with Wainwright commenting: [...] "I wasn't writing a single line of dialogue that Diane hadn't influenced". Wainwright is responsible for writing the majority of episodes.|$|E

Well, thank God, <b>says</b> <b>many</b> a self-confident, whole-hearted Pharisee, it is {{far from}} being mine. We can only say this, he that knows most of his own superlatively {{deceitful}} and desperately wicked heart, suspects himself most, and exercises most godly jealousy over himself; while persons, who see least of themselves, are most self-confident and daring. Even Judas could as boldly ask, 'Master, is it I' who shall betray Thee? as any of the rest of His disciples--(Mason).|$|R
25|$|An Islamist-dominated {{parliament}} {{was elected}} in late 2011 and early 2012. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces dissolved the body in June 2012, <b>saying</b> <b>many</b> of the elections were illegitimate.|$|R
500|$|The {{original}} [...] "Ten Key Values" [...] {{statement was}} approved by the Greens' national steering committee and released in late 1984. [...] The values in the original statement are: Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, Personal and Social Responsibility, Nonviolence, Decentralization, Community-based Economics, Postpatriarchal Values, Respect for Diversity, Global Responsibility, and Future Focus. [...] One unusual aspect, <b>say</b> <b>many</b> observers, is the way the values are described; instead of declaratory statements full of [...] "shoulds" [...] and [...] "musts", each value is followed by a series of open-ended questions. [...] "That idea... came from Mark Satin", Spretnak told scholar Greta Gaard in 1997. [...] Its effect, says sociologist Paul Lichterman, was to promote dialogue and creative thinking in local Green groups across the U.S.|$|E

Mark <b>says</b> <b>many</b> people are now following Jesus, more than the four disciples he has already listed. See also Mark 6#Healing of the sick of Gennesaret. In contrast to the many followers Jesus attracted, {{it is not clear}} how many actual disciples (students) he recruited, only [...] calls it a [...] "great crowd of ... disciples" [...] and [...] <b>says</b> <b>many</b> left.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{say nothing}} of her," [...] remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked on. [...] "She <b>says</b> <b>many</b> hard things of you, but you {{say nothing of}} her. What {{do you think of}} her?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{heard some}} gentlemen, some of papa's friends, who {{were talking about}} him, say the same. They <b>say</b> <b>many</b> of the poor {{patients}} at the hospitals, who tremble before some pitiless and selfish surgeons, welcome him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, not so, Lord Harry," [...] {{interrupted}} the third boy: [...] "I have heard my uncle <b>say,</b> <b>many</b> a time, that England's archery is half her strength--and {{how it was}} our archers {{at the battle of}} Crecy--" ...|$|E

60|$|This. Underneath London--as, I dare <b>say,</b> <b>many</b> of you know--there lies four or {{five hundred}} feet of clay. But not ice-clay. Anything but that, as you will see. It belongs to a {{formation}} late (geologically speaking), but somewhat older than those Disco Island beds.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes,' {{answered}} the secretary. 'He {{certainly does not}} encourage originality among those who surround him.

60|$|I {{knew that}} Sergeant Corney would <b>say</b> <b>many</b> things which he himself did not believe, {{if he thought}} thereby he might {{strengthen}} my courage for the terrible ordeal which was probably before us; therefore his words of cheer had less weight than might otherwise have been the case.|$|E
50|$|The {{agreement}} was reached {{a few years before}} the 1999 Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (between Lutherans and Catholics), which in substance <b>says</b> <b>many</b> of the same things as ECT in that it emphasizes Sola gratia over Sola fide.|$|R
