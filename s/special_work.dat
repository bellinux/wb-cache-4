5|$|Sonderkommandos (<b>special</b> <b>work</b> crews {{forced to}} work at the gas chambers) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from their ears. The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E

25|$|Childcare {{facilities}} were also expanded, {{with the number}} of places in crèches rising steadily between 1981 and 1986. In addition, the minimum wage was significantly increased. From 1981 to 1984, the SMIC rose by 125%, while prices went up by only 75% during that same period. Various measures were also introduced to mitigate the effects of rising unemployment. Between 1981 and 1986, there had been just over 800,000 young people placed on <b>special</b> <b>work</b> schemes, 800,000 early retirements, 200,000 enterprise allowance successes, and 30,000 retrained workers from declining industrial sectors.|$|E

500|$|Maeser had a {{profound}} effect on his students. One of them, Alice Louise Reynolds, wrote that [...] "he had the ability to inspire. He made his students feel the worth of life; he told us that the Lord had sent each of us to do a <b>special</b> <b>work,</b> and that the proper preparation was necessary for that mission." [...] Among the students who studied under Maeser were George Sutherland, William H. King, Bryant S. Hinckley, James E. Talmage, George Albert Smith and J. Golden Kimball. He also inspired his family members; one of his sons, Karl Emil, studied under Maeser and went on to be a respected educator and school president. Maeser retired from Brigham Young Academy in 1892 to devote his time to his position as the Superintendent of Church Schools. He was succeeded by Benjamin Cluff.|$|E
500|$|... "The One with All the Thanksgivings" [...] {{was written}} by Gregory S. Malins and {{directed}} by Kevin S. Bright. It is the fifth Thanksgiving special in the Friends series. The producers knew from past recordings that the audience responded well to seeing [...] "the Friends as they were" [...] and decided to incorporate a flashback episode into a Thanksgiving special. Show creator David Crane considered the Thanksgiving-themed episode as the [...] "hallmark show" [...] in each season. Marta Kauffman added dialogue centering on six characters being together in a room made the holiday <b>special</b> <b>work.</b> When discussing story ideas, the writers decided to create [...] "a bunch of little pieces", until someone suggested [...] "what if it's the worst Thanksgivings?", later used as the hook. Working on a flashback meant the episode needed [...] "to have meaning" [...] as the story continues in the present. It was difficult to keep the characters, particularly Chandler, spontaneously mad for something that happened [...] "years ago". The comedic content was bigger than usual, because Phoebe's arm was blown off and Joey's head stuck in a turkey.|$|E
500|$|William IV, Duke of Bavaria {{commissioned}} The Battle of Alexander at Issus in 1528. Altdorfer {{was approximately}} 50 at the time, and {{was living in}} the Free Imperial City of Regensburg. As a result of over a decade of involvement with the Regensburg city council, Altdorfer was offered the position of Burgomaster on 18 September 1528. He declined; the council annals reported his reasoning as such: [...] "He much desires to execute a <b>special</b> <b>work</b> in Bavaria for my Serene Highness and gracious Lord, Duke [...]" [...] William probably wanted the painting for his newly built summer Lusthaus ("pleasure house") in the grounds of his palace in Munich, approximately [...] south of Regensburg. [...] There, it was to hang alongside seven other paintings with a similar format and subject matter, including Ludwig Refinger's The Matyrdom of Marcus Curtius, Melchior Feselen's The Siege of Alesia by Caesar, and the painting of Battle of Cannae by Hans Burgkmair (1473–1531). Another eight, each portraying a famous woman from history, were later added to the set, probably {{at the behest of the}} Duke's wife, Jacobaea of Baden. Altdorfer's Susanna and the Elders (1526) was among these.|$|E

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{explained}} that the cast listing for the episode, along with [...] "Patient X" [...] was [...] "longer than most cast lists you'll ever see on a TV series". In order {{to allow for the}} increased expenses of hiring additional actors, Carter and the producers of the series talked Fox into allowing the episodes to be slightly more expensive because they would lead into the soon-to-be-released X-Files movie. Carter explained, [...] "we convinced them to spend the extra money to do this extra <b>special</b> <b>work</b> because it was all leading up to [...] when the X-Files movie would be released." [...] In addition, the child he gave the message to was a young boy and the son of production manager J.P. Finn. Rob Bowman originally intended to direct the episode but, due to reshoots, he was unable to do it, resulting in Carter directing. Bowman later recounted, [...] "I was supposed to direct 'The Red and the Black' [...] but we were prepping for the reshoots [...] so I couldn't do it. [...] Chris had to direct this episode. He was so mad at me." [...] When filming the scene where Mulder and Scully go to a medic station, Carter made homage to the medical drama ER, filming it entirely with a Steadicam.|$|E
