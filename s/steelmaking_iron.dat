40|$|As the key {{ingredient}} for <b>steelmaking,</b> <b>iron</b> ore {{is integral to}} the global economy and represents the world's second-largest natural resource market by value. The overall structure and dynamics of the iron ore market have recently undergone various radical changes. The global demand shock caused by the rapid industrialization of China has sent market prices skywards and triggered a collapse of the 40 -year-old benchmark pricing system. The newly adopted quarterly index-based pricing mechanism has brought an abrupt end to the traditional stability of the iron ore market, with price dynamics now experiencing greater volatility. Against the backdrop of these disruptive changes, this dissertation proposes a deterministic nine-region spatial equilibrium model of the 2020 iron ore market based on the fundamental characteristics and mechanics of the market. Key features of the model are its bottom-up structure, modeling supply volumes and costs on an individual mine level {{as well as the}} simulation of interregional trade flows using a linear optimization approach. In analyzing a number of relevant scenarios, this dissertation projects the key characteristics of the 2020 global iron ore market in terms of regional production volumes, demand, iron ore trade flows and market prices. It quantifies market dynamics based on changes in available production capacity, demand and freight rates. From a demand perspective, the dissertation proposes several strategies to mitigate the risk arising from higher and more volatile iron ore prices. Of these strategies, the captivity of mines and the introduction of iron ore export taxes are analyzed in greater detail with respect to their effectiveness and influence on the iron ore market. iron ore, mining, steel, steelmaking, China, market simulation, industry cost curve, pricing, linear opti-mization, trade flows, market dynamics, volatility, risk, freight, captivity, export taxes...|$|E

After {{privatisation}} in 1988 to form British Steel plc, in 1999 the company merged with Netherlands-based steel maker Koninklijke Hoogovens to form Corus Group. Corus utilised the site for basic oxygen <b>steelmaking,</b> using <b>iron</b> produced at the company's Redcar blast furnace. In 2007, Corus was bought by Tata Steel.|$|R
50|$|A {{steel mill}} or {{steelworks}} is an industrial plant for {{the manufacture of}} steel. It may be an integrated steel works carrying out all steps of <b>steelmaking</b> from smelting <b>iron</b> ore to rolled product, but may also describe plants where steel semi-finished casting products (blooms, ingots, slabs, billets) are made, from molten pig iron or from scrap.|$|R
40|$|With rising ore {{prices and}} the {{continued}} demand for higher quality steels, much work {{has been carried out}} into refining and control prospects of steel chemistry. As several technologies around the world are exploring the control of phosphorus with high priority, an overview of current knowledge, ongoing research, and specific interest areas is presented. The reliance of the basic oxygen furnace <b>steelmaking</b> on <b>iron</b> ore quality is considered with regard to impurity levels, as well as the phosphorus content of direct reduced iron introduction to the electric arc furnace process. This article reviews methods to control phosphorus in steelmaking and proposes a practical approach based on laboratory-scale equilibrium experiments.

50|$|The HIsarna {{steelmaking}} {{process is a}} process for primary <b>steelmaking</b> in which <b>iron</b> ore is processed almost directly into steel. The process is based around {{a new type of}} blast furnace called a Cyclone Converter Furnace, which makes it possible to skip the process of manufacturing pig iron pellets that is necessary for the basic oxygen {{steelmaking process}}. Without the necessity for this preparatory step the HIsarna process is more energy-efficient and has a lower carbon footprint than traditional steelmaking processes.|$|R
40|$|The {{basic oxygen}} furnace (BOF) dust is a {{hazardous}} metallurgical waste generated {{in the collection of}} particulate material duringsteel making processes. The occurrence and recovery of metallurgical wastes from <b>steelmaking</b> and <b>iron</b> making processes becomenowadays a great problem, mainly due to the big amount and environmental pollution by heavy metals potential. The research of nonisothermalkinetics by microwave heating was evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the most important factor that strongly affectedmicrowave acid extraction was the microwave power input. It is shown that approximately from 22 to 50 °C the process is controlled bydiffusion with a low apparent activation energy value of Ea = 1. 15 kJ/mol. With increasing temperature the Arrhenius slope is more steeperwith the apparent activation energy value of Ea = 22. 01 kJ/mol, which proves that the microwave leaching process from 50 °C is undercontrol by the surface chemical reaction. This indicates that the microwave promotes the mineral solid particle to burst effectively, makes theparticle to expose a fresh surface and strengthens the leaching process...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{quantities}} of sludge and dust are generated as a waste material or byproduct {{every day from}} iron and steel industries. Nowadays The occurrence and recovery of metallurgical wastes from <b>steelmaking</b> and <b>iron</b> making processes is a great problem, mainlydue to the big amount and environmental pollution of these wastes by heavy metals. The future technology of fine-grain metallurgicalwastes treatment is mainly the thing of ecological and financial limits. This work explains the removal of zinc from blast furnace sludgeby hydrometallurgical process.

40|$|Iron 2 ̆ 6 {{steel making}} {{companies}} operate torpedo cars {{which are used}} to deliver liquid iron from blast furnace. Then the liquid iron is processed by the basic oxygen furnace in the steel making workshop. The desulfurization is performed during the liquid iron delivery process by injecting desulphurization agents into the liquid iron with nitrogen as the carrier gas. ^ As a transport equipment of liquid iron, torpedo car, compared with the previous liquid iron tank, has the advantages of small temperature decrease and little iron loss. It is gradually replacing the liquid iron tank and becomes the main means of liquid iron transport. The producing process shows that: slightly temperature reduce of the <b>steelmaking</b> liquid <b>iron</b> will cause {{a substantial increase in}} energy consumption in steelmaking and continuous casting. ^ In this paper, the temperature field and heat flux field of the tank and its shell in a 300 ton torpedo car were analyzed using ANSYS analysis software. In the thermal analysis, the nonlinear changes of physical parameters of temperature, radiation and other nonlinear factors were taken fully account when the nonlinear finite element simulation of the temperature field and heat flux field was conducted. The temperature distribution of the refractory layers, the heat flux distribution of the tank shell and the hot metal temperature drop were determined according to the initial temperature of the molten iron, the ambient temperature and the parametric study of the thermal properties of different refractory materials. ^ The results can be useful guidance for the future design of torpedo cars in iron and steel making plants. ...|$|R
50|$|Before about 1860 steel was an {{expensive}} product, made in small quantities and used mostly for swords, tools and cutlery; all large metal structures {{were made of}} wrought or cast <b>iron.</b> <b>Steelmaking</b> was centered in Sheffield, Britain, which supplied the European and the American markets. The introduction of cheap steel {{was due to the}} Bessemer and the open hearth processes, two technological advances made in England. In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron is converted to steel by blowing air through it after it was removed from the furnace. The air blast burned the carbon and silicon out of the pig iron, releasing heat and causing the temperature of the molten metal to rise. Henry Bessemer demonstrated the process in 1856 and had a successful operation going by 1864. By 1870 Bessemer steel was widely used for ship plate. By the 1850s, the speed, weight, and quantity of railway traffic was limited by the strength of the wrought iron rails in use. The solution was to turn to steel rails, which the Bessemer process made competitive in price. Experience quickly proved steel had much greater strength and durability and could handle the increasingly heavy and faster engines and cars.|$|R
40|$|<b>Steelmaking</b> {{relies on}} <b>iron</b> ore and {{metallurgical}} coal as main ingredients, {{the trade of}} which is hypothesized to theoretically change in tandem. However, strong correlation is not evident in historical trade prices of steelmaking inputs. To determine causes to this occurrence, the market factors that influence the Australian iron ore and metallurgical coal industries were studied. Data was collected {{over the past decade}} for worldwide resource production and trade quantities of crude steel, iron ore, and metallurgical coal. The data was analysed to reveal trends, allowing examination of the macroeconomic trade of metallurgical coal and iron ore with relation to worldwide and country specific steel production. It was determined that the influential growth of China’s steel production has spurred the growth of worldwide iron ore demand, which was met with increased production and supply, from Australia. The increased metallurgical coal demand has been met with increased production within China locally. Measures of supply elasticity were created for worldwide iron ore and metallurgical coal trade, where comparisons between Australia’s industries to the relevant greatest competitor were examined. The results, along with respective resource production data, highlighted the elevated competitive position that Australian iron ore producers enjoy compared to metallurgical coal producers. Trade characteristics revealed the different market structures that iron ore and metallurgical coal industries operate in, prompting a discussion of the effects these markets have on the two Australian industries...|$|R
