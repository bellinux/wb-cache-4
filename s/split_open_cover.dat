5000|$|A finite <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> {{always has}} a {{continuous}} partition of unity subordinated to it, provided the space is locally compact and Hausdorff. Paracompactness of the space is a necessary condition to guarantee {{the existence of a}} partition of unity subordinate to any <b>open</b> <b>cover.</b> Depending on the category which the space belongs to, it may also be a sufficient condition. [...] The construction uses mollifiers (bump functions), which exist in continuous and smooth manifolds, but not in analytic manifolds. Thus for an <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> of an analytic manifold, an analytic partition of unity subordinate to that <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> generally does not exist. See analytic continuation.|$|R
40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>covers</b> {{have been}} widely {{deployed}} in the London marine insurance market for many years, even though {{a significant number of}} legal issues arising out of their use still needs to be resolved. Not surprisingly, the law concerning <b>open</b> <b>covers</b> is very much alive and open to further development. Given that, quite remarkably, no research study has been done specifically on those particular covers to date; this thesis is aimed at making good that deficiency. To ensure that observation is made over the whole picture in respect of the <b>open</b> <b>covers</b> and to produce a comprehensive guide to the legal complexity arising out of the association between them and their subsequent individual declarations, the complete thesis will comprise five chapters: 60 l Chapter 1 will provide historical information and development background of <b>open</b> <b>covers</b> and also will set out the main differences in the operation of floating policies and <b>open</b> <b>covers</b> which were derived originally from the former. Chapter 2 will illustrate (1) how and why the legal nature of an <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> impacts on the parties' rights, obligations, privileges and immunities, and (2) how and why the formation of an <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> {{plays a key role in}} the determination of proper nature. Chapter 3 will shed light on the applicability of the duty of utmost good faith to <b>open</b> <b>covers</b> by explaining the doctrine of utmost good faith within the general law of insurance and then clarifying whether the duty is enforceable pertaining to the covers themselves or only pertaining to subsequent policies individually. Chapter 4 will explore the agency status of insurance brokers in the context of <b>open</b> <b>covers.</b> To this end, it focuses, first, upon giving the general definition of insurance broking, secondly, describing the use and performance of the brokers in the procurement process, currency and claims process of <b>open</b> <b>covers,</b> and lastly the measure of damages recoverable from the brokers. Chapter 5 will discuss conflict of laws in <b>open</b> <b>covers,</b> and in particular problems of jurisdiction and choice of law where the <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> and declarations under it are potentially governed by different regimes. Finally, the legal and practical issues that have been identified, and their suggested solutions will be summarised in the conclusion. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>cover</b> {{insurance}} {{is widely used}} in cargo insurance in international trade. In particular for the long-term and large-volume export-import trade, <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> {{insurance is}} almost the inevitable choice. This is because, on the one hand, from the assured’s point of view, <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> insurance can relieve him from repetitive negotiations on the terms and conditions of the cargo insurance for {{the same kind of}} trade, and meanwhile provide some other advantages such as simplified procedures and lower premiums; on the other hand, from the insurer’s point of view, he can benefit from simplified procedures and fixed premium income. This thesis begins with a general introduction to <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> insurance system as such, including the identification of, comparison and interaction between relevant definitions of and documents used in <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> system (Chapter 2). And then the thesis will go on introducing four main and characteristic clauses used in the <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> system, including the rationale behind the clauses (Chapter 3). The declaration obligation has certain significance in the whole <b>open</b> <b>cover</b> insurance system, the flaw of which may result in the loss of coverage of concerned shipment(s). Therefore, the second half of this thesis will deliberate on issues regarding declaration obligation. The source, nature, function and practice of declaration will be considered in detail in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 will concentrate on the issues revolving around non-declaration by the assured...|$|R
