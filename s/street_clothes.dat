5|$|Thorpe {{began his}} {{athletic}} career at Carlisle in 1907 {{when he walked}} past the track and beat all the school's high jumpers with an impromptu 5-ft 9-in jump still in <b>street</b> <b>clothes.</b> His earliest recorded track and field results come from 1907. He also competed in football, baseball, lacrosse and even ballroom dancing, winning the 1912 intercollegiate ballroom dancing championship.|$|E
5|$|At 5:24pm Cooper was {{informed}} that his demands had been met, and at 5:39pm the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the tarmac and close each window shade in the cabin to deter police snipers. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in <b>street</b> <b>clothes</b> (to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer) and delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper permitted all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.|$|E
5|$|This video, {{which was}} {{directed}} by Diane Martel, features Beyoncé walking through a performance hall in modern-day <b>street</b> <b>clothes,</b> performing the song. Once she arrives onstage and at the song's bridge, she appears in costume as Deena, dressed in a 1970s-era gown. Intercut into the video are scenes from Dreamgirls, most of which depict Deena's relationship with Curtis. These clips, however, were taken out in the director's cut version of the video; this version appeared on the B'Day Anthology Video Album. In her first outfit, Beyoncé is seen wearing a Wonder Woman T-shirt.|$|E

50|$|The {{newspaper}} offices did {{not last}} long on Li Yuen East Street. Gradually, they relocated to other places. It was during that time <b>street</b> stalls selling <b>clothes</b> succeeded the previous newspaper offices as the familiar scene of the street. As the number of foreign tourists increases, the street stalls diversify the goods they sell. As a result, a wide variety of goods can now be found on the <b>street</b> including <b>clothes,</b> drapery, accessories, and souvenirs. Resembling the “Women Street” in Mongkok, Kowloon, Li Yuen Street East is now dubbed as “Central’s Women Street” and has become a popular tourist spot in Central.|$|R
5|$|Most men {{typically}} just {{wear the}} towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, {{it is perfectly}} acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel to feel his penis, which, if well received, {{is the first step}} in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in <b>street</b> <b>clothes.</b> Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E
5|$|The {{first hint}} of its {{existence}} became public when Square Enix trademarked the name in May 2013. The game was first announced in the second September issue of Famitsu Weekly, and was demoed during TGS 2013. Originally scheduled for release {{in the winter of}} 2013, it was delayed due to development problems concerning environment sizes, which needed to be scaled down. It was rescheduled for the first quarter of 2014, then was pushed forward to spring of that year. <b>Street</b> <b>clothes</b> for the characters were offered as a pre-registration bonus, while a code to download outfits inspired by Kurasame, a supporting character from Type-0, were included in the final volume of the spin-off manga Final Fantasy Type-0 Side Story: Reaper of the Icy Blade. Pre-registration closed on May 7, 2013. Chapter delivery began the day after the game's official release on May 14, 2014. The base game was a free download, but players had the option of buying items, restore health and speeding up re-spawn time via microtransactions. The original version also reset individual character experience levels {{at the end of a}} playthrough, while an update in 2015 allowed players to carry over experience levels between playthroughs.|$|E
25|$|People {{entered the}} small room of the machine while {{it was on the}} beach, wearing their street clothing. In the machine they changed into their bathing suit, {{although}} men were allowed to bathe nude until the 1860s, placing their <b>street</b> <b>clothes</b> into a raised compartment where they would remain dry.|$|E

50|$|Aladdin {{also appears}} at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as a meetable character. He is a frequently-seen character, and often {{accompanied}} by Jasmine, and occasionally Genie. Though he goes barefoot in the film, he wears moccasins in his <b>street</b> rat <b>clothes.</b> Aladdin, Jasmine, Carpet, Abu and Genie make cameo appearances in the Hong Kong Disneyland version of Its a Small World.|$|R
5000|$|Van Gogh was {{interested}} in creating character studies of real, not idealized people, emulating Honoré Daumier and the great Dutch masters. In this portrait he demonstrates this [...] "in his imaginative embellishment of the <b>street</b> child's <b>clothes</b> and unruly hair". In his letters van Gogh also discloses his disdain for such individuals by calling the girl a [...] "dirty mudlark".|$|R
25|$|Analysis of {{photographs}} and video also {{raised concerns about}} firefighters, including chief officers, who were not utilizing personal protective equipment appropriately. Some firefighters were wearing <b>street</b> <b>clothes,</b> while others had open coats or were missing helmets. Some firefighters could be seen walking through toxic smoke without air packs. Fire Chief Rusty Thomas has indicated that everyone inside the structure, including the nine fallen firefighters, were wearing the appropriate protective equipment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning of February 4, 1999, Diallo was {{standing}} near his building after returning from a meal. At about 12:40a.m., police officers Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy, who were all in <b>street</b> <b>clothes,</b> passed by in a Ford Taurus. Caroll later testified that Diallo matched the general description of a serial rapist who had struck a year earlier, or {{that he might have}} been a lookout.|$|E
25|$|The cope, therefore, {{is often}} worn at Anglo-Catholic churches where the celebrant at the Eucharist would {{conventionally}} wear the chasuble. In general those clergy who robe wear a cassock, surplice, scarf and, occasionally, also an academic hood. Since about 1990 there {{has sometimes been}} a practice of wearing a long surplice without a cassock, particularly through the summer. Most clergy in the diocese, however, dispense even with these robes, conducting church services in <b>street</b> <b>clothes</b> ranging from {{a suit and tie}} or clerical collar, to smart casual attire.|$|E
60|$|I {{scarcely}} recognized Mr. Cullen when {{he first}} accosted me {{in the courtyard of}} the Milan. At no time of distinguished appearance, a certain carelessness of dress and gait had brought him now almost on a level with the loafer in the <b>street.</b> His <b>clothes</b> needed brushing, he was unshaved, and he looked altogether very much in need of a bath and a new outfit.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Marmaduke was {{not long}} in ascending, and tripped into the room as Mr. Dix backed out of it, as gayly as tho' he had never sent me about my {{business}} in the <b>street.</b> His <b>clothes,</b> of a cherry cut velvet, were as ever a little beyond the fashion, and he carried something I had never before seen, then used by the extreme dandies in London,--an umbrella.|$|R

25|$|Government {{officials}} {{stated that}} the shipping container could not be cleared through customs, as proper procedures had not been followed. The Sierra Leonean government refused to pay the shipping fee of $6,500. New York Times noted {{that the government had}} already received well over $40 million in cash from international donors to fight Ebola. The New York Times noted that in the 2 months that the shipping container remained on the docks in Freetown, health workers in Sierra Leone endured severe shortages of protective supplies, with some nurses having to wear <b>street</b> <b>clothes.</b>|$|E
25|$|On April 25, 1903, at Berlin, Zarifopol married Ștefania (Fany) Dobrogeanu-Gherea, the {{daughter}} of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. She was Jewish, the couple were religious nonconformists who turned up at the marriage registrar in <b>street</b> <b>clothes</b> and neither held a church wedding nor baptized their children; all this outraged his mother, a strict Romanian Orthodox. Dobrogeanu-Gherea, a literary critic, and his son Alexandru were also Marxist doctrinaires; Alexandru's daughter, also called Fany, was married to Ion Luca Caragiale's son Luca (Luki). While visiting his in-laws, Zarifopol met various figures of international socialism, including revolutionist Karl Radek.|$|E
25|$|On 3 May 2006, Sakuraba {{surprisingly}} {{appeared with}} Hero's head Akira Maeda at a Hero's event wearing his <b>street</b> <b>clothes</b> (yellow shirt and blue jeans) and a pro wrestling mask {{in the style}} of one of his childhood heroes, Tiger Mask. He did not reveal himself, but it was apparent that it was a masked Sakuraba and that he signed with K-1 and FEG. A day later, Sakuraba appeared at a FEG press conference to announce he would fight in Hero's. His defection to Hero's was a culmination of several signs that suggested he was leaving Pride. It was reported that Sakuraba left Takada Dojo (run by Pride's general manager, Nobuhiko Takada), and conspicuously was not entered into Pride's 2006 Open Weight Grand Prix Tournament.|$|E

25|$|Dry {{suits are}} often worn for boating, {{especially}} sailing, and on personal water craft {{in the winter}} months. The primary uses are for protection from spray, and in case of accidental short-term immersion in cold water if the user falls overboard. These dry suits, which are only intended for temporary immersion, are less rugged than diving dry suits. They are usually made of a breathable membrane material to let sweat permeate, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable all day. Membrane type surface dry suits only keep the user dry, and have little thermal insulating properties. Most users will wear a thin thermal undersuit, or <b>street</b> <b>clothes,</b> for warmth; but wearing ordinary fabrics can be dangerous if the suit leaks in cold water because they will lose most of their insulating properties.|$|E
25|$|Sting {{began to}} {{question}} Hogan's trustworthiness and credibility in {{the weeks leading up}} to Fall Brawl. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not resonate with the WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in <b>street</b> <b>clothes</b> and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.|$|E
25|$|On August 9, 1999, Hogan {{started the}} night {{dressed in the}} typical black and white, but after a {{backstage}} scene with his son came out dressed in the traditional red and yellow for his main event six-man tag team match. Hogan then defeated Nash in a retirement match at Road Wild to retain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Injuries and frustrations were mounting up however, and he was absent from television from October 1999 to February 2000. In his book Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Bollea {{said that he was}} asked to take time off by newly hired head of creative booking Vince Russo and was not told when he would be brought back at the time. Despite some reservations, he agreed to do so. On October 24 at Halloween Havoc, Hogan was to face Sting for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. However, Hogan came to the ring in <b>street</b> <b>clothes,</b> lay down for the pin, and left the ring.|$|E
50|$|Amstetten {{provides}} good shopping {{opportunities for}} its residents. There is a shopping centre with clothes shops, shoe shops, a supermarket, technology shops and other amenities. The shopping centre also has free WiFi. Amstetten's high <b>street</b> has some <b>clothes</b> shops and several restaurants. There are two second hand shops in Amstetten where good quality clothes {{can be purchased}} cheaply. There are several large supermarkets including an Interspar, Merkur and Hofer.|$|R
50|$|Park {{organized}} the society after {{she went to}} Japan and saw people on the <b>streets</b> wearing traditional <b>clothes.</b> In Korea, encountering someone wearing hanbok on the streets is unthinkable. This is because Koreans perceive hanbok as too uncomfortable and formal to wear casually. To overcome such a perception, and to enhance {{an understanding of the}} traditional glamour and beauty that hanbok entails, she decided to create the group.|$|R
50|$|As {{the rhythm}} increases, the film begins {{to follow the}} man's {{peculiar}} habits such as crossing a busy <b>street</b> in different <b>clothes</b> and different locations, working in a busy office, working on a conveyor belt, walking through different locations and ending up in a forest where he has the appearance of Tarzan, eating dinner with his wife, {{walking down the street}} seeing pogo stick riders, and visiting a strip club while simultaneously maintaining himself in motion.|$|R
25|$|Beckham {{missed the}} next four LA Galaxy matches – three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates, {{sitting on the bench}} in <b>street</b> <b>clothes.</b> It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to {{security}} concerns, {{it was the first time}} the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star Le Méridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.|$|E
500|$|MTV debuted {{the video}} on March 31, 2011. A {{backstage}} picture of West wearing <b>street</b> <b>clothes</b> along with Perry in a pastel-colored makeup {{and a giant}} braided headpiece was shown on MTV. On March 21, a teaser trailer was released; it was 12 seconds long and showed clips of an unidentified flying object. Its music video was directed by Floria Sigismondi. Prior to release, Perry aspired to make it [...] "larger than life".|$|E
500|$|The {{rhythm of}} the music pauses for two beats. It resumes at a calmer level as the camera shows Jordan in <b>street</b> <b>clothes,</b> {{watching}} from the sideline. Jordan is shown for just two seconds, smiling and nodding. Waterbury said of this shot, [...] "We {{wanted to make sure}} that, through this commercial, people understood Michael's role as a mentor and a coach. His nod of approval at the end is his way of saying, 'Go.'" [...] The camera cuts back to the young player; the tagline [...] "LET YOUR GAME SPEAK" [...] is shown, and the scene fades to black with the [...] "XXI" [...] logo and then the [...] "Jumpman" [...] logo.|$|E
50|$|Eardley set up {{a studio}} in Glasgow, close to the {{deprived}} Townhead area, where she became known for her drawings and paintings of poor city children, often playing in the <b>streets</b> in ragged <b>clothes,</b> the older girls looking after younger siblings. She also drew numerous scenes of the shipyards of Port Glasgow. Eardley had developed a unique style and she soon {{had a reputation as}} a highly individual, realistic and humane artist of urban life. She was often to be seen transporting her easel and paints around Glasgow in an old pram.|$|R
