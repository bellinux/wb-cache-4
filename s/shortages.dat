5|$|Heat {{waves are}} a common feature of summers in the city. These heat waves place extra demand on {{electricity}} usage, leading to <b>shortages.</b> In extreme cases, these power <b>shortages</b> during heat waves can cause traffic jams and protests, such as the December 2013 heat wave (longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires) where increased energy demand lead to energy <b>shortages</b> and power cuts, protests against the government over the lack of service, and traffic jams {{as a result of}} these protests. However, most heat waves are of short duration (usually less than a week), and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind, which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Occasionally, a tornado can form, which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. The greatest risk for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions. These severe storms can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste.|$|E

40|$|The {{profession}} {{is facing a}} unique <b>shortage</b> of nursing faculty. Schools of Nursing {{have always had a}} <b>shortage</b> of doctorally prepared nursing faculty. The academic norm for faculty teaching in baccalaureate and graduate programs to hold earned doctoral degrees was established later in nursing than for other disciplines. At best, 50 % of nursing faculty in such programs have met this academic standard. In addition, the <b>shortage</b> is predicted to escalate in the next decade due to the retirement of a "graying professoriate" of nursing faculty. The <b>shortage</b> of nursing faculty is interwoven with the current national <b>shortage</b> of nurses. The <b>shortage</b> of nurses requires the educational programs of the profession to supply more graduates. But the <b>shortage</b> of nursing faculty will limit student enrollments and likely decrease the number of graduates. Conversely, the <b>shortage</b> of nurses will offer many opportunities and choices to nurses and may decrease the number selecting graduate studies and an academic career, thus contributing to the <b>shortage</b> of nursing faculty The <b>shortage</b> of nursing faculty will also have consequences for the generation of the knowledge base for nursing practice. With a decreased number of individuals to conduct research and the loss of senior investigators through retirement, continuing development of nursing's knowledge base may be curtailed. The <b>shortage</b> of nursing faculty will also limit the professional leaders who are able to shape health policy in the state, national, and international arenas. This article outlines a number of factors influencing the <b>shortage</b> of nursing faculty. Several institutional School of Nursing strategies are suggested for countering the <b>shortage</b> situation. In addition, several national professional and policy strategies are suggested. More creative strategies need to be developed and evaluated by Schools of Nursing and by the profession...|$|R

30|$|Additionally, for any {{specific}} TDP, {{the probability of}} the <b>shortage</b> ratio being higher than 0 {{is defined as the}} risk of irrigation water <b>shortage</b> in this study. With this definition, we could then assess the risks of irrigation water <b>shortage</b> for IMD- 2 under the current situation and with implementation of the mitigation measure. Such assessments can be conducted with regard to individual TDPs. Taking the 6 th TDP as an example, the probability of experiencing irrigation water <b>shortage</b> (<b>shortage</b> ratio > 0) in IMD- 2 is 0.83 and 0.58 for the current situation and the situation with proposed mitigation measure, respectively. The mitigation measure is able {{to reduce the risk of}} irrigation water <b>shortage</b> in IMD- 2 for the 6 th TDP by 0.25. We can also consider the risk of more severe irrigation water <b>shortage.</b> For example, <b>shortage</b> ratio exceeding 0.3 is considered as severe water <b>shortage</b> in the JID and may prompt reduced water supply. By implementing the proposed mitigation measure, the risk of severe water <b>shortage</b> in IMD- 2 for the 6 th TDP can be reduced from 0.72 to 0.52. Thus, the proposed spatiotemporal simulation approach not only can take into account the spatial and temporal variations/co-variations of the multi-site streamflows but also facilitates probabilistic assessment of effectiveness of drought mitigation measures. As a final note, we like to emphasize that it is possible to comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation measures by considering the overall reduction in the risk of the severe water <b>shortage</b> during the crop growth period.|$|R

40|$|Background: The nursing <b>shortage</b> is {{a global}} challenge, {{affecting}} {{every country in the}} world. With this <b>shortage,</b> patients are suffering because the healthcare workforce is not prepared to deal with their health needs. Within each country, the nursing <b>shortage</b> is caused by numerous factors that ultimately cause a decrease in the quality of health care received. However, {{little is known about the}} global causes of a shrinking professional nurse workforce. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to describe what the nursing <b>shortage</b> means in three countries: United States (US), Philippines, and South Africa. In addition, the paper will provide useful information specific to the three countries to further understand global issues affecting the nursing <b>shortage</b> Population: Nursing <b>shortage</b> in the United States, Philippines, and South Africa. Methods: A literature review was performed by four researchers using a peer-reviewed search strategy.

The main search concepts were global nursing <b>shortage,</b> international nursing, nurse migration, brain drain, and health care systems.

There were also heavy losses to fruit trees {{and to the}} sugar industry, after the storm destroyed sugar mills and the rail lines that carried the cane to the mills. The storm destroyed over 100tobacco drying barns, including their contents. The destruction of the tobacco represented a $30million loss for the country. High winds also destroyed 96tobacco storage facilities, although the tobacco was removed beforehand. In Güines near Havana, Alma destroyed food crops, which further exacerbated Cuba's existing food <b>shortages.</b> Alma's passage also resulted in water <b>shortages,</b> prompting the government to urge residents to use less water. There was heavy structural damage across western Cuba, including in Havana, Matanzas, Camagüey, Pinar del Río, and Las Villas. The hurricane destroyed 1,083houses, and overall damage was estimated at $200million. Alma killed 12people {{in the country and}} injured 78others. In the storm's aftermath, Cuban officials sent about 100,000people from Havana to the cities around the capital to repair storm damage.
