50|$|The {{amplification}} of coherent terahertz {{sound in}} a Wannier-Stark ladder <b>superlattice</b> {{has been achieved}} in 2009 according to a paper publication from the School of Physics and Astronomy in the University of Nottingham. Wannier-Stark effect, exists in superlattices. Electron states in quantum wells respond sensitively to moderate electric fields either by the quantum confined Stark effect {{in the case of}} wide barriers or by Wannier-Stark localization {{in the case of a}} <b>superlattice.</b> Both effects lead to large changes of the optical properties near the absorption edge, which are useful for intensity modulation and optical switching. Namely, in a mathematical point of view, if an electric field is applied to a <b>superlattice</b> the relevant Hamiltonian exhibits an additional scalar potential. If an eigenstate exists, then the states corresponding to wave functions are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian as well. These states are equally spaced both in energy and real space and form the so-called Wannier-Stark ladder. In the proposed scheme, an application of an electrical bias to a semiconductor <b>superlattice</b> is increasing the amplitude of coherent folded phonons generated by an optical pulse. This increase of the amplitude is observed for those biases in which the energy drop per period of the <b>superlattice</b> is greater than the phonon energy. If the <b>superlattice</b> is biased such that the energy drop per period of the <b>superlattice</b> exceeds the width of electronic minibands (Wannier-Stark regime), the electrons become localized in the quantum wells and vertical electron transport takes place via hopping between neighboring quantum wells, which may be phonon assisted. As it had been shown previously, under these conditions stimulated phonon emission can become the dominant phonon-assisted hoping process for phonons of an energy value close to the Stark splitting. Thus, coherent phonon amplification is theoretically possible in this type of system. Together with the increase in amplitude, the spectrum of the bias-induced oscillations is narrower than the spectrum of the coherent phonons at zero bias. This shows that coherent amplification of phonons due to stimulated emission takes place in the structure under electrical pumping.|$|E

Although the bottom of the conduction subband and the top of the valence subband are formed in the same semiconductor layer in Type III <b>superlattice,</b> which is similar with Type I <b>superlattice,</b> the band gap of Type III superlattices can be continuously adjusted from semiconductor to zero band gap material and to semimetal with negative band gap.|$|E
