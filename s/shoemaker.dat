5|$|George Schwab was a German <b>shoemaker</b> {{who died}} in 1924.

5|$|On 1 May an {{even larger}} operation, known by the ARVN as Operation Toan Thang 43 and by MACV as Operation Rockcrusher, got {{underway}} as 36 B-52s dropped 774 tons of bombs along {{the southern edge of}} the Fishhook. This was followed by an hour of massed artillery fire and another hour of strikes by tactical fighter-bombers. At 10:00, the 1st Air Cav Division, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the 1st ARVN Armoured Cavalry Regiment, and the 3rd ARVN Airborne Brigade then entered Kampong Cham Province of Cambodia. Known as Task Force <b>Shoemaker</b> (after General Robert M. <b>Shoemaker,</b> the Assistant Division Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division), the force attacked the long-time communist stronghold with 10,000 U.S. and 5,000 South Vietnamese troops. The operation utilized mechanized infantry and armored units to drive deep into the province where they would then link up with ARVN airborne and U.S. airmobile units that had been lifted in by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The data {{returned}} from the Galileo flybys of Gaspra and Ida, and the later NEAR <b>Shoemaker</b> asteroid mission, permitted the first study of asteroid geology. Ida's relatively large surface exhibited a diverse range of geological features.

5|$|William Stacy {{was born}} in Gloucester, Massachusetts in 1734 and died in Marietta, Ohio in 1802. Slightly {{different}} years of birth and death have been reported. Stacy grew up in Gloucester {{on the coast of}} Massachusetts and worked as a <b>shoemaker,</b> a trade learned from his father; he may also have worked in the seafaring business. William Stacy married Sarah Day in 1754. Subsequently, during 1757, they moved away from the coast to New Salem in western Massachusetts, and raised a large family. Stacy took up farming and continued his work as a <b>shoemaker.</b> He also became a commercial banker, loaning money at interest before there were any banks in the area. His customers were from New Salem and other towns in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. By the time of his early middle age, William Stacy was living a comfortable life; he was successful and widely known. During 1775, at the age of 41, William Stacy's life changed with the onset of friction between the Thirteen Colonies and the British Empire.|$|E

Coakley denied threatening anyone, exclaiming that such an idea was a personal affront. Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E

5|$|On June 27, 1997, the NEAR <b>Shoemaker</b> {{spacecraft}} passed within 1,212km of Mathilde while {{moving at}} a velocity of 9.93km/s. This close approach allowed the spacecraft to capture over 500 images of the surface, and provided data for more accurate determinations of the asteroid's dimensions and mass (based on gravitational perturbation of the spacecraft). However, only one hemisphere of Mathilde was imaged during the fly-by. This was only the third asteroid to be imaged from a nearby distance, following 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} content {{featured}} in the game received mixed reviews. Miller thought that the game only revolved around one idea, which led to its simplistic gameplay. Camron and Cooper thought that the campaign was too short for most players. <b>Shoemaker</b> thought that for a full-priced game, it lacked content. Reiner furthered criticized the game's low replay value. Carter advocated that players purchase the game when its price dropped. He added that while the game features lots of ideas, most of them failed to deliver.|$|E
5|$|The first {{nighttime}} {{football game}} was played in Mansfield, Pennsylvania on September 28, 1892 between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary and ended at halftime in a 0–0 tie.

Reeves had a crude leather helmet made by a <b>shoemaker</b> in Annapolis and wore it in the game after being warned by his doctor that he risked death if he continued to play football after suffering an earlier kick to the head.|$|E

5|$|The game's core feature, its Nemesis system, was praised. According to Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar, {{the system}} {{elevated}} Shadow of Mordor to excellence by making its villains memorable and adding personality to its protagonist. Brad <b>Shoemaker</b> of Giant Bomb agreed, writing {{that the system}} created many distinctive characters and its side content extended the game's longevity. Joystiq's Alexander Sliwinski said that the system made each playthrough unique and made the game stand out from other action games. Chris Carter of Destructoid found the system gimmicky, since it failed to create unique villains; it added different appearances and weaknesses to villains without adding personality.|$|E
