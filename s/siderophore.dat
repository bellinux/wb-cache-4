25|$|Many {{bacteria}} secrete small iron-binding molecules called siderophores, which bind {{strongly to}} ferric ions.

25|$|P. aeruginosa {{relies on}} iron as a {{nutrient}} source {{in order to}} grow. However, iron is not easily accessible {{because it is not}} commonly found in the environment. Iron is usually found in a largely insoluble ferric form. Furthermore, excessively high levels of iron can be toxic to P. aeruginosa. To overcome this and regulate proper intake of iron, P. aeruginosa uses siderophores. Siderophores are secreted molecules that bind and transport iron. These iron-siderophore complexes, however, are non-specific. The bacterium that produced the siderophores does not necessarily receive the direct benefit of iron intake. Rather all members of the cellular population are equally likely to access the iron-siderophore complexes. This dynamic is an example of an altruistic interaction; members suffer the metabolic cost of siderophores production {{for the good of the}} group. Members of the cellular population that can efficiently produce these siderophores are commonly referred to as cooperators; members that produce little to no siderophores are often referred to as cheaters. Research has shown when cooperators and cheaters are grown together, cooperators have a decrease in fitness while cheaters have an increase in fitness. It is observed that the magnitude of change in fitness increases with increasing iron-limitation. With an increase in fitness, the cheaters can outcompete the cooperators; this leads to an overall decrease in fitness of the group, due to lack of sufficient <b>siderophore</b> production. These observations suggest that having a mix of cooperators and cheaters can reduce the virulent nature of P. aeruginosa.|$|E
30|$|The role of <b>siderophores</b> in {{biocontrol}} has extensively {{been studied}} previously (Solans et al. 2016). <b>Siderophores</b> can inhibit {{the growth of}} soilborne fungi by {{reducing the amount of}} ferric ions available to rhizosphere microflora. It has also been stated that colonization of the rhizosphere, production of antibiotics, and their antagonistic activity of P. aeruginosa are presumably due to the production of the <b>siderophores</b> (Sulochana et al. 2014). Hydroxamate <b>siderophores</b> are common among the bacterial community (Yeole et al. 2001 and Dharni et al. 2012); however, carboxylate <b>siderophores</b> have not been reported very often. Tian et al. (2009) reported that Pseudomonas sp. G- 229 - 21 could produce high-affinity carboxylate-type <b>siderophores</b> under low iron conditions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Siderophores</b> {{are useful}} as drugs in facilitating iron {{mobilization}} in humans, {{especially in the}} treatment of iron diseases, due to their high affinity for iron. One potentially powerful application is to use the iron transport abilities of <b>siderophores</b> to carry drugs into cells by preparation of conjugates between <b>siderophores</b> and antimicrobial agents. Because microbes recognize and utilize only certain <b>siderophores,</b> such conjugates are anticipated to have selective antimicrobial activity.|$|R
40|$|<b>Siderophores</b> are chelates {{produced}} by bacteria {{as part of}} a highly specific iron uptake mechanism. They are thought to be important in the bacterial acquisition of iron in seawater and to influence iron biogeochemistry in the ocean. We have identified and quantified two types of <b>siderophores</b> in seawater samples collected from the Atlantic Ocean. These <b>siderophores</b> were identified as hydroxamate <b>siderophores,</b> both ferrioxamine species representative of the more soluble marine <b>siderophores</b> characterized to date.

30|$|<b>Siderophores</b> {{are small}} high {{affinity}} chelating molecules with masses below 2000  Da secreted by microorganisms [55].

40|$|<b>Siderophores</b> {{stick out}} by {{their ability to}} form very stable and soluble {{complexes}} with iron. Various organisms produce them to enhance the environmental concentration of bioaviable iron. In this review paper I discuss the factors that determine the ability of <b>siderophores</b> to form complexes with iron. The efficiency of <b>siderophores</b> in mobilizing iron is determined by their structure, {{but also by the}} environmental milieu they are released in.

Thus, <b>siderophore</b> production can be looked at as an altruistic trait because it is beneficial for the local group but costly for the individual. This altruistic dynamic requires every member of the cellular population to equally contribute to <b>siderophore</b> production. But at times mutations can occur that results in some bacterium producing lower amounts of <b>siderophore.</b> These mutations give an evolutionary advantage because the bacterium can benefit from <b>siderophore</b> production without suffering the energy cost.
