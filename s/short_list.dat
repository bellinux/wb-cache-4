5|$|A blocked shot injured Giordano {{early in}} the 2013–14 season as he {{suffered}} a broken ankle in late October. He missed 18 games due to the injury, during which the Flames gained only five wins. He still recorded career highs of 13 goals and 47 points. Though he was not named to the team, Giordano's growing reputation placed him on Team Canada's <b>short</b> <b>list</b> for the 2014 Winter Olympics, and he received a first place vote (finishing 10th overall) in voting for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the league's top defenceman.|$|E
5|$|After Shadwell's {{selection}} the laureate {{was appointed}} by the Lord Chamberlain, on the monarch's instructions. Since the appointment of Henry James Pye in 1790, the Prime Minister has recommended which candidate to appoint. For the appointment of Duffy the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) undertook a consultation of academics and literary organisations {{to draw up a}} <b>short</b> <b>list</b> of recommendations which they presented to the Prime Minister. He, in conjunction with the Cabinet Office then submitted the name to the Queen for approval.|$|E
5|$|As the 1984 U.S. presidential {{election}} primary season neared its end and Walter Mondale became the likely Democratic nominee, {{the idea of}} picking a woman as his vice-presidential running mate gained considerable momentum. The National Organization for Women and the National Women's Political Caucus pushed the notion, as did several top Democratic figures such as Speaker Tip O'Neill. Women mentioned for the role included Ferraro and Mayor of San Francisco Dianne Feinstein, {{both of whom were}} on Mondale's five-person <b>short</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E

5|$|Elemental gallium is {{not found}} in nature, but it is easily {{obtained}} by smelting. Very pure gallium metal has a silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Gallium liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; therefore, {{it should not be}} stored in glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with a <b>short</b> <b>list</b> of other materials that includes water, silicon, germanium, antimony, bismuth, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Koufax's postseason {{record is}} impressive: a 4–3 won-lost {{record with a}} 0.95 earned run average, in four World Series. He is on the very <b>short</b> <b>list</b> of {{pitchers}} who retired with more career strikeouts than innings pitched. Koufax was selected as an All-Star for six consecutive seasons and made seven out of eight All-Star Game appearances those seasons (not selected for 2nd All-Star Game in 1962). He pitched 6 innings in four All-Star games including being the starting pitcher for 3 innings in the 1966 All-Star Game.|$|E

Later, Rivers succeeded Herrera Beutler in the house after the latter's election to the United States Congress.|$|E

Speculation for the reasons behind Taare Zameen Pars failed bid included Rediff.com's Arthur J. Pai's observation that it lacked mainstream media attention; AMPAS jury member Krishna Shah criticised its length and abundance of songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{award is}} based upon the players' {{performances}} in the voting period, typically from August for a year. Prior to 2009, each of the top ten women's national teams nominated two players, and the final selection was made by a 16-person panel. Since 2009, a long list has been chosen by the ICC Awards voting panel, composed of cricket administrators, journalists and former players. This is then trimmed to create a <b>short</b> <b>list</b> by a different, 25-person, board.|$|E

Production began in the United Kingdom in 2000, with Chris Columbus being chosen to create the film from a <b>short</b> <b>list</b> of directors that included Steven Spielberg and Rob Reiner.

5|$|Beijing {{was elected}} {{as the host}} city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on 13 July 2001, during the 112th IOC Session in Moscow, {{defeating}} bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but {{failed to make the}} <b>short</b> <b>list</b> chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds. Toronto's bid was their 5th failure since 1960 (failed bid for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 games losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta).|$|E
5|$|Hatfield's {{re-election}} {{victory for}} governor in 1962 and successful Senate campaign in 1966 made him something of a national figure. In 1968, Hatfield was on Richard Nixon's <b>short</b> <b>list</b> for vice president, and received the strong backing of his friend, the Rev. Billy Graham. Hatfield was considered too liberal by many conservatives and Southern moderates, and Nixon chose the more centrist Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew. Hatfield would later find himself at odds with Nixon over Vietnam and other issues, including a threat by Hatfield to reduce funding for the White House's legal department in 1973 during the Watergate Scandal, after Nixon had failed to use funds appropriated for renovating dams on the Columbia River.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Ralph d'Escures in October 1122, King Henry I decided to allow a free election, with the new primate to be chosen by the leading men of the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular. The monks of the cathedral chapter and the bishops of the kingdom {{disagreed}} on who should be appointed. The bishops insisted {{that it should not}} be a clerk (a non-monastic member of the clergy), but Canterbury's monastic cathedral chapter preferred a monk, and insisted that they alone had the right to elect the archbishop. However, only two bishops in England or Normandy were monks (Ernulf, Bishop of Rochester, and Serlo, Bishop of Séez), and no monks other than Anselm of Canterbury, Ernulf, and Ralph d'Escures, had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091; recent precedent therefore favoured a clerk. King Henry sided with the bishops, and told the monks that they could elect their choice from a <b>short</b> <b>list</b> selected by the bishops. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list contained no monks.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 Algarve Cup, Morgan shared top-scoring honors. She {{finished}} the competition with four assists and three goals, including the equalizer against Sweden that advanced the U.S. {{to the final}} and the two goals against Germany that won the championship. Morgan previously won the tournament's golden boot in 2011. On June 2, 2013, Morgan scored two-second half goals as the U.S. defeated Canada 3–0 {{in front of a}} sold out crowd in Toronto. This was the first match between USA and Canada since the epic semi-final of the 2012 Olympic Games. Morgan was named to her third appearance on the 10-player <b>short</b> <b>list</b> for FIFA Women's World Player of the Year in 2013 and finished fourth in the voting. For the inaugural CONCACAF Awards, she was recognized as the CONCACAF 2013 Female Player of the Year. And as a part of US Soccer's celebration of its Centennial anniversary the Federation revealed the US Soccer's All-Time Women's National Team Best XI, she was youngest player selected at 24 years old.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the failure}} of Adlertag and {{considerable}} loss rates on 15, 16 and 17 August, Kesselring convinced Göring that the only sound strategy was to continue to send heavily escorted bombers to destroy British airfields. Kesselring also advocated the use of Jagdgeschwader (fighter wings) in free-chase tactics. Messerschmitt Bf 109 single-engine fighters were to be sent out {{in advance of the}} main raids to force the British fighters into large-scale air battles which, in theory, would destroy RAF aircraft in combat and deplete the British defences. However, this time, Kesselring changed his operational methods. In consultation with Hugo Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3), he chose not to scatter his effort against a large number of targets. Instead, he narrowed down the targets to a <b>short</b> <b>list</b> in order to concentrate his strength and striking power. Sector stations RAF Kenley, North Weald, Hornchurch and Biggin Hill were chosen as the prime targets.|$|E
