40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{evaluate}} the possible use of three types of pharmaceutical grades of phyllosilicates as pharmaceutical excipients. Seven samples (two smectites, three palygorskites, and two <b>sepiolites)</b> were studied. A complete mineralogical and chemical characterization of each material was made and powder texture was established by image analysis of scanning electron micrographs. Powder flow properties were then determined and the influence of textural characteristics on powder rheology and particle packing was assessed. Mineral contents were adequate for the <b>sepiolites</b> (� 90 % of main mineral) and smectites (78 and 95 %), but should be improved on the palygorskite samples (around 50 % of main mineral in two of the studied samples). According to the textural characterization, the samples presented almost equal size distributions, but exhibited two different morphologies (i. e., laminar for smectites and fibrous for <b>sepiolites</b> and palygorskites). Both <b>sepiolites</b> possessed high flowability, whereas this factor varied from medium to low in the other materials. The compressibility of smectites was adequate, whereas that of palygorskites was high and that of the <b>sepiolites</b> was low. All of the samples studied would be useful as solid dosage form excipients (some samples would require improvement of their flow properties or treatment {{to reduce the amount of}} mineral impurities) ...|$|R
40|$|Near-IR {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} used to distinguish between palygorskites and <b>sepiolites.</b> Three near-IR spectral regions contain bands due to (a) the high frequency region between 6400 and 7400 cm− 1 attributed to the first overtone of the hydroxyl stretching mode, (b) the 4800 – 5400 cm− 1 region attributed to water combination modes and (c) the 4000 – 4800 cm− 1 region attributed to the combination of the stretching and deformation modes of the M–MgOH units of palygorskites and <b>sepiolites.</b> Near-IR bands are observed in the first region and are assigned to the first overtone of the hydroxyl stretching frequency observed at 3620 and 3410 cm− 1 in the mid-IR spectra. The near-IR bands observed in the second region are assigned to the combination of the water OH stretching and deformation vibrational modes. A complex set of low intensity bands are observed in the 4100 – 4600 cm− 1 region and are attributed to the combination of the cation hydroxyl stretching, deformation and translation modes. The difference between the near-IR spectra of palygorskites and <b>sepiolites</b> depends on the dioctahedral nature of the palygorskites and the trioctahedral structure of the <b>sepiolites.</b> Changes in the near-IR spectra are therefore related to the Mg 3 (OH) and Mg 2 (OH) units in the palygorskites...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, it was {{investigated}} the changes of structure of <b>sepiolites</b> under different conditions of acid treatments and heat treatments using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR). At the same time, through the tannin adsorption experiments, it was studied the changes adsorption properties of <b>sepiolites</b> by acid treatments and heat treatments. The H 2 SO 4 treatment {{was found to}} be more effective for the removal of tannin than HCl and HNO 3 treatments. With increasing the acid concentration and acid treatment time of H 2 SO 4, the removal rates and adsorption capacity of tannin by <b>sepiolites</b> were first increased and then decreased. The removal rates and adsorption capacity were 61. 0 % and 23. 7 mg/g when the acid concentration was 4. 0 mol/l. And the removal rates and adsorption capacity were 62. 5 % and 24. 3 mg/g when the acid treatment time was 16 hours. The calcinations treatment exhibited significant effects on the adsorption of tannin. The removal rates and adsorption capacity were 77. 9 % and 30. 8 mg/g when the calcined temperature was 400 ◦C. However, when the calcined temperature was 700 ◦C, the removal rates and adsorption capacity were only 54. 1 % and 20. 8 mg/g...|$|R

40|$|U-Pb-series {{analyses}} of two U-rich opal samples {{have been used}} for dating silcretes included in Miocene rocks in the Paracuellos zone (Madrid Basin.) A sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) was used. The silcretes are composed mainly of opal CT and have variable amount of quartz and locally minor amounts ofmoganite, dolomite, and relics of clays and detrital minerals. The silcretes formed bysilicification of <b>sepiolites</b> (precipitated in small ponds) and smectites (formed in distal alluvial fans). The initial sediments are Aragonian in age. Green fluorescence of two silcrete samples, observed under short-wave UV light, was used to establish the opaline zones to analyze. The estimated U content varies from 76 to 168 ppm. The 206 pb- 23 SU and 207 pb- 235 U ages obtained varies from 10. 5 ± 0. 54 m. a. to 8. 78 ± 0. 54 m. a. These values can be interpreted as: 1) Indicative ofa silicification latter (Vallesian) than expected from previous studies; 2) Corresponding to a local and latter formation U-rich opal zones inside the initial silcrete; 3) The opaline zones analyzed, formed by replacement ofclays, are too heterogeneous to be used for datin...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new nano-biocomposites {{has been one of}} the main research areas of interest in polymer science in recent years, since they can combine the intrinsic biodegradable nature of matrices with the ability to modify their properties by the addition of selected nano-reinforcements. In this work, the addition of mineral nanoclays (montmorillonites and <b>sepiolites)</b> to a commercial starch-based matrix is proposed. A complete study on their processing by melt-intercalation techniques and further evaluation of the main properties of nano-biocomposites has been carried out. The results reported show an important influence of the nano-biocomposites morphology on their final properties. In particular, the rheological and viscoelastic characteristics of these systems are very sensitive to the dispersion level of the nanofiller, but it is possible to assess that the material processing behaviour is not compromised by the presence of these nano-reinforcements. In general, both nanofillers had a positive influence in the materials final properties. Mechanical performance shows improvements in terms of elastic modulus, without important limitations in terms of ductility. Thermal properties are improved in terms of residual mass after degradation and low improvements are also observed in terms of oxygen barrier properties...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the British Museum began {{extensive}} programme of cleaning its collection of classical marble sculptures by {{the application of}} a solvent to remove atmospheric grease and a mud-pack to suck out dirt from the porous surface. The mud-pack consisted of a natural clay-like material called <b>Sepiolite,</b> and the procedure was known as the <b>Sepiolite</b> Method. By 1966 much of the reserve collection of marbles had been cleaned and only the Elgin Marbles remained. These were, however, a sensitive issue because of the cleaning scandal in the late 1930s when craftsmen had over enthusiastically scraped at natural deposits on some of the surfaces with copper tools. When the scandal broke it led to the retirement of the keeper of the Greek and Roman Department (on medical grounds!) and the resignation of an Assistant Keeper who chose to leave the Museum rather than lose seniority. Memories of this incident were still remarkably fresh in 1966 and the masons' assistants who had been doing the routine cleaning thus far were reluctant to continue with the Elgin Marbles. Initial cleaning was carried out by Andrew Oddy and a senior conservator called Hannah Lane who demonstrated that the <b>sepiolite</b> method did not adversely affect the marble. What it did do was to leave the surface looking rather 'milky' {{as a result of the}} removal of dirt from the surface. It was thus decided to apply a very dilute solution of a water-soluble polyethylene glycol wax. Because it is water-soluble, it is easily removed, but it did not stop a conservation scientist in Greece alleging that the British Museum had impregnated the Elgin Marbles with plastic! ...|$|E
