Their vast plain is now, in summer, one sea of golden corn; in winter, a black dreary fallow, cut into squares by stagnant dykes, and broken only by unsightly pumping mills and doleful lines of poplar-trees. Of old it was a labyrinth of black wandering streams; broad lagoons; morasses submerged every spring-tide; vast beds of reed and sedge and fern; vast copses of willow, alder, and grey poplar, rooted in the floating peat, which was swallowing up slowly, all-devouring, yet all-preserving, the forests of fir and oak, ash and poplar, hazel and yew, which had once grown on that low, rank <b>soil,</b> <b>sinking</b> slowly (so geologists assure us) beneath the sea from age to age. Trees, torn down by flood and storm, floated and lodged in rafts, damming the waters back upon the land. Streams, bewildered in the flats, changed their channels, mingling silt and sand with the peat moss. Nature, left to herself, ran into wild riot and chaos more and more, till the whole fen became one [...] "Dismal Swamp," [...] in which, at the time of the Norman Conquest, the [...] "Last of the English," [...] like Dred in Mrs. Stowe's tale, took refuge from their tyrants, and lived, like him, a free and joyous life awhile.|$|E

Large-scale accidents and malicious threats, such as fires or explosions creating a blast loading, potentially carry very high economical and societal consequences. Compared to other statistically certain events, explosive-induced blasts in tunnels have an extremely low {{probability of occurrence}} {{but at the same}} time an enormous damage potential for structure, life, and environment. The paper presents a procedure for evaluation consequences of blast loading threat scenarios, focusing on the local and global structural integrity of tunnel constructions. Methods to capture the dynamic loading and the structural resistance, especially considering the dynamic soil response under large stresses and strains, are described. For that, a combined experimental and numerical approach is chosen, including characterization of the soil by dynamic triaxial experiments realizing stress levels of about 1 MPa, acting in 1 ms on the specimen. The analysis showed that the measured triaxial strength of the soil differed from the static by a factor of 2 for the friction angle. Furthermore, scaled experiments have been designed and conducted to demonstrate and investigate the behavior of a buried tunnel segment under blast loading. The results showed that realistic loading charges can cause massive cracking of the tunnel system and a <b>soil</b> <b>sinking</b> of up to 1 cm. Both experimental results obtained from the triaxial tests on the one hand and from the scaled tunnel experiments on the other hand have been validated using numerical models. The good agreement obtained is the essential input parameter for the evaluation of criticality in tunnels under blast loading scenarios...|$|E

40|$|The global methane cycle {{includes}} both terrestrial and atmospheric processes and {{may contribute to}} feedback regulation of the climate. Most oxic soils are a net sink for methane, and these soils consume approximately 20 to 60 Tg of methane per year. The <b>soil</b> <b>sink</b> for atmospheric methane is microbially mediated and sensitive to disturbance. A decrease in the capacity of this sink {{may have contributed to}} the ∼ 1 % · year− 1 increase in the atmospheric methane level in this century. The organisms responsible for methane uptake by soils (the atmospheric methane sink) are not known, and factors that influence the activity of these organisms are poorly understood. In this study the soil methane-oxidizing population was characterized by both labelling soil microbiota with 14 CH 4 and analyzing a total soil monooxygenase gene library.

The H₂ budget is dominated by the microbe-mediated <b>soil</b> <b>sink,</b> and although its significance has long been recognized, our understanding is limited by the low temporal and spatial resolution of traditional field measurements. This thesis was designed to improve the process-based understanding of the H₂ <b>soil</b> <b>sink</b> with targeted field and lab measurements. In the field, ecosystem-scale flux measurements of atmospheric H₂ were made both above and below the forest canopy for over a year using a custom, automated instrument at the Harvard Forest. H₂ fluxes were derived using a flux-gradient technique from the H₂ concentration gradient and the turbulent eddy coefficient. A ten-fold improvement in precision was attained over traditional systems, which was critical for quantifying the whole ecosystem flux from small H 2 concentration gradients above the turbulent forest canopy. Soil uptake of atmospheric H₂ was the dominant process in this forest ecosystem. Rates peaked in the summer and persisted at reduced levels in the winter season, even across a 70 cm snowpack. We present correlations of the H₂ flux with environmental variables (e. g., soil temperature and moisture). This work is the most comprehensive attempt to elucidate the processes controlling biosphere-atmosphere exchange of H₂. Our results will help reduce uncertainty in the present-day H₂ budget and improve projections of the response of the H₂ <b>soil</b> <b>sink</b> to global change. In the lab, we isolated microbial strains of the genus Streptomyces from Harvard Forest and found that the genetic potential for atmospheric H₂ uptake predicted H₂ consumption activity. Furthermore, two soil Actinobacteria were found to utilize H₂ only during specific lifecycle stages. The lifecycle of soil microorganisms can be quite complex as an adaptation to variable environmental conditions.

These conditions lead to high erosion and a significant transport of organic carbon (OC). Moreover, soil tillage accelerates the oxidation of the OC. Cover crops (CC) are the conservation agriculture (CA) approach for woody crops. They are grown in-between tree rows to protect the soil against water erosion and their organic residues also help to increase the <b>soil</b> carbon (C) <b>sink.</b> <b>Soil</b> and OC losses associated to the sediment were measured over four seasons (2003 - 07) using micro-plots for the collection of runoff and sediment in five experimental fields located in rain-fed olive orchards in Andalusia.

In addition to solving the one-dimensional diffusion-reaction equation, the model includes a parameterization of biological CH 4 oxidation that is sensitive to soil temperature and moisture content, along with simple scalings for land cultivation and wetland fractional coverage.

Methane uptake at mid- to high northern latitudes increases year-round in 2100, with a 68 % increase over present-day values in June.

Day to day variability in above-canopy CH 4 was high, with observed values in the range 1790 to 1910 nmol mol&minus; 1 . High CH 4 was correlated with high carbon monoxide and related to wind direction, consistent with pollutant transport from an urban area by a well-studied mountain-plain wind system. Soil moisture was moderately dry during the study. Vertical gradients of CH 4 were small but detectable day and night, both near the ground and within the vegetation canopy.

A large proportion of the economic mitigation potential (at 100 US$/t CO 2 -eq. and excluding bio-energy) arises from soil carbon sequestration, which has strong synergies with sustainable agriculture and generally reduces vulnerability to climate change. Significant potential is also available from reductions in methane and nitrous oxide emissions, and such emissio...|$|R
40|$|Degradation of shrub {{meadows and}} {{reclamation}} of alpine meadows may heavily affect the <b>soil</b> <b>sink</b> for atmospheric methane (CH 4), {{but this is}} poorly understood. Therefore, in situ measurements of atmospheric CH 4 consumption were conducted in four landuse types: natural alpine meadow (NM), Elymus nutans pasture (EP), herbaceous meadow in shrub (HS), and a P. fruticosa shrub meadow (PS) within two years. CH 4 fluxes were measured using static chambers and gas chromatography. All four types of land use showed atmospheric CH 4 sink throughout the two years, with mean soil CH 4 consumption rates at 24. 6 +/- 10. 9, 33. 8 +/- 15. 0, 39. 8 +/- 10. 3, and 28. 1 +/- 12. 1 mu g CH 4. m(- 2). hr(- 1) for NM, EP, PS, and HS, respectively. Soil CH 4 consumption increased by 40 % by reclamation from NM to EP, while it decreased by 30 % by degradation from PS to HS. Soil CH 4 consumption in four types of land use was significantly correlated with temperature at 5 cm depth (P< 0. 01) and the soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) (P< 0. 05). Temperature showed stronger effects on soil CH 4 consumption than WFPS, except in NM. UV radiation {{was positively correlated with}} soil CH 4 consumption with increasing temperature and decreasing soil moisture. These findings indicate that a decrease in the grazing pressure in shrub meadows and increase in the area of artificial pasture reclaimed from alpine meadows would enhance the CH 4 sink in alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau...|$|R
