This paper explores how health needs assessments may be further strengthened for health promotion planning via an assessment of <b>environmental</b> <b>assets</b> rooted in the multiple environments (policy, information, social and physical environments) that shape health and behavior. Guided by a behavioral-ecological perspective- one that seeks to identify <b>environmental</b> <b>assets</b> that can influence health behavior, and an implementation science perspective- one that seeks to interweave health promotion strategies into existing <b>environmental</b> <b>assets,</b> we present a basic framework for assessing <b>environmental</b> <b>assets</b> and review examples from the literature to illustrate the incorporation of <b>environmental</b> <b>assets</b> into health program design. Health promotion practitioners and researchers implicitly identify and apply <b>environmental</b> <b>assets</b> {{in the design and}} implementation of health promotion interventions;this paper provides foundation for greater intentionality in assessing <b>environmental</b> <b>assets</b> for health promotion planning...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} optimal {{endogenous}} growth model with an <b>environmental</b> <b>asset</b> which delivers a direct social utility value.

Such an assumption corresponds to assuming that past capital accumulation embodies new technologies requiring lower and lower environmental pressure per unit of output. We show that a sustainable balanced growth, where output and capital both grow at a constant positive rate, and the <b>environmental</b> <b>asset</b> remains constant over time, exists, is unique and is saddle-point stable.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{correlations}} between {{systolic blood pressure}} (SBP) and total cholesterol levels (CHOL) might result from genetic or environmental factors that determine variation in the phenotypes and are shared by family members. Based on 330 nuclear families in the Framingham Heart Study, we used a multivariate normal model, implemented in the software FISHER, to estimate genetic and <b>shared</b> <b>environmental</b> components of variation and genetic and <b>shared</b> <b>environmental</b> correlation between the phenotypes. The natural logarithm of the phenotypes measured at the last visit in both Cohort 1 and 2 {{was used in the}} analyses. The antihypertensive treatment effect was corrected before adjustment of the systolic blood pressure for age, sex, and cohort. Results The univariate correlation coefficient was statistically significant for sibling pairs and parent-offspring pairs, but not significant for spouse pairs. In the bivariate analysis, the cross-trait correlation coefficients were not statistically significant for all relative pairs. The <b>shared</b> <b>environmental</b> correlation was statistically significant, but the genetic correlation was not significant. Conclusion There is no significant evidence for a close genetic correlation between systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol levels. However, some <b>shared</b> <b>environmental</b> factors may determine the variation of both phenotypes. </p...|$|R
30|$|Only a {{few studies}} {{included}} DZ twins (n[*]=[*] 2) [29, 32], so we pooled the rMZ to provide {{an estimate of the}} upper bound of heritability. Traditionally, twin and family studies investigating the heritability of a phenotype (e.g., PA engagement [15, 16], BMI [39], and chronic pain [40]) have done so using a cross-sectional design, with twin studies dividing the variance of a phenotype into components or proportions due to additive genetic factors (heritability), <b>shared</b> <b>environmental</b> factors, and unique environmental factors. Our pooled estimates represent the upper bound of heritability, including variance from additive genetic and <b>shared</b> <b>environmental</b> factors. However, our study investigated how shared familial factors influence the response to PA, with the rMZ derived from the change in outcome status following an intervention. Since interventions were implemented over a specified timeframe, with training parameters controlled, {{it has been suggested that}} unique and <b>shared</b> <b>environmental</b> factors would make minor contributions to the variance of the response to PA [22], resulting in a rMZ that would give a close estimate of heritability. However, family studies included in this review found significant correlations between spouses for the response of body composition [38] and cardiorespiratory fitness [19, 24] following a PA intervention. Although some suggest this indicates a greater influence of <b>shared</b> <b>environmental</b> factors [19], this correlation may equally be due to shared genes (assortative mating), so without making strong assumptions as to which is occurring in spouses, this is unlikely to indicate a greater influence of <b>shared</b> <b>environmental</b> factors.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} genetic, <b>shared</b> <b>environmental,</b> and nonshared environmental {{contributions to}} stability {{and change in}} internalizing and externalizing problems. Method: Maternal Child Behavior Checklist ratings were obtained for 3, 873 twin pairs at age 3 and 1, 924 twin pairs at age 7. For 1, 575 twin pairs, ratings were available at both ages. Results: For Internalizing/Externalizing ratings, genetic, <b>shared,</b> and nonshared <b>environmental</b> factors explained about 59 / 51 %, 10 / 30 %, and 31 / 19 % of the variance at age 3, and 40 / 52 %, 31 / 32 %, and 29 / 16 % of the variance at age 7. The phenotypic correction of r = 0. 38 / 0. 54 between problems assessed at 3 and 7 years of age was explained for 66 / 55 % by genetic factors, for 23 / 37 % by <b>shared</b> <b>environmental</b> factors, and for 11 / 8 % by nonshared environmental factors. The genetic, <b>shared</b> <b>environmental,</b> and nonshared environmental correlations between ages 3 and 7 were 0. 51 / 0. 57, 0. 47 / 0. 66, and 0. 13 / 0. 24, respectively.
