40|$|Abstract — Modern {{passenger}} vehicles with gasoline engines {{are provided with}} different compensating devices for fuel air mixture supply. Even {{then there is a}} high fuel consumption because of many factors. One of the important factors that affect the fuel consumption is that design <b>of</b> <b>carburettor.</b> The venturi <b>of</b> the <b>carburettor</b> is important as it provides a necessary pressure drop in the carburettor device. Since different SI engine use alternative fuels such as LPG, CNG in the present day to reduce the pollution and fuel consumption. Still for a better economy and uniform fuel air supply {{there is a need to}} design the carburettor with an effective analytical tool or software. In this work two parameters namely pressure drop and fuel discharge nozzle angle <b>of</b> the <b>carburettor</b> will be analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. CFD analysis <b>of</b> the <b>carburettor</b> has been done by solid works and results obtained are used for optimum design <b>of</b> a <b>carburettor...</b>|$|R

50|$|Ernest Robert Godward (7 April 1869 - 2 December 1936) was an English born {{inventor}} and {{engineer who}} lived in New Zealand, England, and the United States. He created the spiral hairpin and a type <b>of</b> <b>carburettor</b> called a petrol economizer, which boosted engine performance and reduced fuel consumption.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1933 Hillman {{announced}} that the Wizard had been given Cyclonic Induction providing [...] "a power surge". This {{appears to have been}} a switch from an unspecified design <b>of</b> <b>carburettor</b> to a downdraught design.Just two months later in mid-September Hillman announced the Wizard's replacement, their new model Hillman 20/70, with new all-steel bodies and electric direction indicators.|$|R
5000|$|... 304 Series 2 Vantage coupés {{were built}} - {{including}} 131 X-Packs [...] - and 192 Volantes (in spite of only having been officially introduced in 1986, {{near the end}} of production). Of the 'Cosmetic' Vantage (for the US Swiss and Japanese markets, with fuel injection instead <b>of</b> Weber <b>carburettors),</b> 14 Series 2 coupés and 56 Volantes were built. Cosmetic Vantages lacked the powerful Vantage engine but retained the Vantage name and most of its body alterations - though the lack <b>of</b> <b>carburettors</b> allowed a flattened hood. From 1980 they featured DOT-approved 5 mi/h km/h safety bumpers front and rear. Most of these cars have since been retrofitted with full power, European spec engines.|$|R
25|$|In April 1975, the North American Series II got a {{slightly}} revised <b>set</b> <b>of</b> front bumpers which had rubber over-riders covering {{the full length}} of the bumper with embedded turn signals at each end. In 1975 V12 XJS / XJ12L cars and in 1978 the 4.2 6 cyl. XJ6L North American cars got the addition of Bosch-Lucas electronic fuel injection in the place <b>of</b> Zenith-Stromberg <b>carburettors.</b>|$|R

Among other products, Malossi produces cylinders and variators for both racing and road use. Malossi is currently producing two product lines, the Malossi and the MHR (Malossi Hyper Racing) which is exclusively for racing use.|$|R
50|$|From 1968 on, Alfa Romeo {{models for}} the US market were fitted with fuel {{injection}} systems instead <b>of</b> <b>carburettors</b> to comply with emissions control legislation. The only 105 Series models in which the classic twin-cam engine was fitted with fuel injection were the US market 1750 range, and the US market 2000 range which replaced the 1750s in mid-1972. No 105/115 series coupe models with 1300 or 1600cc engines were ever made with fuel injection.|$|R
5000|$|The 3.0 litre ‘big six’ was {{produced}} from 1951 until 1967 with {{no change in}} its 2996 cc/182 in³ displacement derived from a slightly under-square 85 mm x 88 mm bore and stroke. It featured an overhead cam, and an aluminum head with an innovative diagonal head-to-block joint that allowed for oversized intake and exhaust valve. The various versions of the engine (M186 - M199) produced from [...] - [...] as compression ratios rose and the number <b>of</b> <b>carburettors</b> multiplied or were replaced with fuel-injection.|$|R
500|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>carburettors</b> was {{calculated}} {{to give a}} higher specific power output, due to the lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems. However, the Merlin's float controlled carburettor meant that both Spitfires and Hurricanes were unable to pitch nose down into a steep dive. The contemporary Bf 109E, which had direct fuel injection, could [...] "bunt" [...] into a high-power dive to escape attack, leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been forced out <b>of</b> the <b>carburettor's</b> float chamber by the effects of negative g-force (g). RAF fighter pilots soon learned to [...] "half-roll" [...] their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents. [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice", a restrictor in the fuel supply line to restrict flow together with a diaphragm fitted in the float chamber to contain fuel under negative G, went some way towards curing the fuel starvation in a dive; however, at less than maximum power a fuel-rich mixture still resulted. Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet from the bottom <b>of</b> the S.U. <b>carburettor</b> to exactly halfway up the side, which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g.|$|R
50|$|With {{the decline}} of the British {{motorcycle}} industry, the use <b>of</b> Amal <b>carburettors</b> declined, but they are still produced under different ownership as spares for the classic market.|$|R
50|$|The {{first race}} ran {{from north to}} south, {{beginning}} in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, across the international border from El Paso, Texas, and finishing in El Ocotal, Chiapas, (now known as Cd. Cuauhtémoc) on the Guatemala-Mexico border opposite from La Mesilla, Guatemala. At least one stage was run each day for five consecutive days. The elevation changes were significant: from 328 ft to 10482 ft above sea level, requiring amongst other modifications re-jetting <b>of</b> <b>carburettors</b> to cope with thinner air. Most the race was run between 5000 ft and 8000 ft.|$|R

50|$|Moodie {{finished}} {{first in the}} 2008 World Championship, but was subsequently disqualified and suspended from racing after scrutineering revealed a problem with his carburettor. Moodie proclaimed his innocence and later investigations revealed {{that there was a}} manufacturing fault in a batch <b>of</b> <b>carburettors,</b> <b>of</b> which Moodie’s was one. However, Moodie remained suspended and his lack of racing meant that he did not win the National Points Championship in both 2008 and 2009. A four-month ban imposed towards the end of 2014 saw Moodie miss {{the first half of the}} 2015 season, ruling him out of contention for the National Points Championship in 2015.|$|R
5000|$|Speedometer House, {{built in}} 1913 at 179 Great Portland Street, was a London motor {{industry}} landmark. Its top two floors {{were devoted to}} the production of Smiths speedometers, gauges and other instruments, while the basement was given over to the production <b>of</b> <b>carburettors.</b> John Donald [...] "Jack" [...] Barclay, after leaving the Royal Flying Corps {{at the end of the}} First World War, set up the Barclay & Wyse partnership at 91 Great Portland Street in 1922 to sell Vauxhall automobiles. The head offices of the UK's Retail Motor Industry Federation are located at 201 Great Portland Street.|$|R
50|$|Instead <b>of</b> a <b>carburettor,</b> a {{revolving}} petrol distributor was developed, with {{the quantity of}} fuel being regulated by a drip-feed. One advantage of this device was that {{a wide variety of}} fuels could be used.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, Fiat of Brazil paid {{a record}} fine {{because of the}} Fiat Mille Electronic, a very popular version of the Fiat Uno with a 1.0-litre engine. They sold 500,000 {{vehicles}} with a combination <b>of</b> <b>carburettor</b> and digital ignition that uses different strategies for laboratory or street driving conditions. In 1998, Honda Motor Company had to spend $267 million to correct the disabling of the misfire monitoring device on 1.6 million 1996 and 1997 model year vehicles, and Ford Motor Company paid $7.8 million for programming 60,000 1997 Ford Econoline vans to keep emissions low during the 20-minute EPA test routine, and then disabling the emissions controls during normal highway cruising.|$|R
50|$|These 1921 Grand Prix chassis were {{amenable}} to changes of both engine and body. Two engines {{were used in}} competitions; the 1921 3-litre straight-eight dohc and the 1916 4.9-litre. Body types included two-seaters and single-seater with pointed tails, slanted tails or exposed fuel tank. Bonnets were adjusted according to the type <b>of</b> <b>carburettors</b> and engines used. In addition, radiators and badges of the three firms constituting S.T.D. were interchangeable. The Works selected the most appropriate combination of body, engine and radiator for each speed event. The cockpit arrangement as well as car dimensions were arranged according to each pilot’s specific requirements; resulting in tailor made cars for the Works team drivers.|$|R
50|$|From 2007 the VanVan {{comes with}} fuel {{injection}} instead <b>of</b> the <b>carburettor</b> featured on earlier models. It {{is often referred}} to as a 'sandbike', as its low-pressure wide-section tyres helps grip and propel the bike across loose surfaces.|$|R

50|$|With the Rover Group only a {{few months}} away, the limited edition (500 + 5 press cars) MG Maestro Turbo (displayed at Birmingham in October 1988 and {{launched}} in early 1989) was the final car from ARG. It made use of the 2.0's already impressive engine, but the combination <b>of</b> <b>carburettor</b> and turbocharger gave it a top speed of 206 km/h and a 0-60 mph time of 6.7 seconds. It was faster than the majority of its competitors, but the high performance, Tickford designed bodykit and alloys did little to disguise {{the fact that it was}} very much still a Maestro. Sales were slow, as it appeared six years after the Maestro's launch.|$|R
50|$|The 2-door {{convertible}} {{body was}} similar to the 4-door Corona RT20 sedan from the waistline down. The 1500 cc engine used a pair <b>of</b> SU <b>carburettors</b> and was connected to a 4-speed, all synchronised manual gearbox. It was not put into production.|$|R
5000|$|Internally, an enlarged-bore 3.8 L (231 in³), [...] DOHC straight-6 {{replaced}} the previous 3.4 L (210 in³) [...] unit. The B-type {{head of the}} Mark VIII was retained, but with a chamfer {{at the bottom of}} the combustion chamber to accommodate the enlarged bore. Twin HD6 1.75" [...] SU carburettors were fitted. A smaller electromagnetically controlled auxiliary carburettor was placed between the main pair <b>of</b> <b>carburettors</b> to act as a choke. It often proved troublesome in operation and many were converted to manual switching [...] Standard compression ratio was 8:1, but a higher performance 9:1 compression ratio was also available, as was a 7:1 compression ratio for export markets, such as Africa, where quality of petrol was sometimes a problem.|$|R
50|$|Renault {{launched}} the Renault 3 and the Renault 4 simultaneously in July 1961. The cars {{shared the same}} body and most mechanical components, but the R3 was powered by a 603 cc version of the engine while the R4 featured a 747 cc engine. This placed the R3 in the 3CV taxation class while the R4 was in the 4CV class. Actual maximum power output was claimed by Renault as 22.5 hp for the R3, and 26.5 or 32 hp for the R4, depending on price level and the type <b>of</b> <b>carburettor</b> fitted. Initially the base versions of the R3 and R4 came with a thick C-pillar behind each of the rear doors. Quarter glass was a 400 francs option for the basic R4. The extra visibility increased {{the weight of the}} vehicle, but these windows soon became standard for all R4s.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{witness to}} refute the {{accidental}} death theory was a vehicular expert {{who had studied}} {{the remains of the}} Morris Minor, and who testified that a joint on the feeding pipe between the petrol tank and the <b>carburettor</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle had been forcibly loosened to allow petrol to flow into and beneath the motor, thus discrediting earlier defence claims that excessive heat in a burning car would invariably result in the loosening of this particular joint. (At one stage as Rouse stood in the witness box to reiterate his claims the fire had been accidental, prosecuting attorney William Norman Birkett placed the actual <b>carburettor</b> <b>of</b> Rouse's vehicle in his hands, causing Rouse to become visibly nervous as he attempted to explain earlier witness testimony as to the forcible loosening of the feeding pipe between the petrol tank and <b>carburettor</b> <b>of</b> his vehicle.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{engine tuner}} David Vizard rated this {{carburettor}} highly {{in his book}} Tuning the A Series Engine and also in recent on-line comments pertaining to the high fuelling atomisation characteristics <b>of</b> this <b>carburettor</b> suiting the siamese port layout of BMC A-Series engines. Similarly, the author Clive Trickey rated these carburettors well in his book More Mini Tuning.|$|R
5000|$|The Ferrari 340 MM {{was a more}} {{powerful}} version of the 340 Mexico which was intended for the Carrera Panamericana. The use <b>of</b> Weber <b>carburettors</b> helped the 340 achieve [...] at 6600 rpm. 11 examples were made, 4 Pinin Farina Berlinettas, 2 Touring Spyders and 5 Vignale Spyders (designed by Giovanni Michelotti). Some were converted to 375 MM spec.|$|R
50|$|The car {{presented}} for trial was a standard open 5-passenger machine. It {{was taken out}} to High Wycombe and Prince's Risborough then over Kop Hill back to London. A strong head wind kept the speed down to 40 mph but on the return a 50 mph pace was easily set and maintained. It is a moderate size of engine but it runs remarkably smoothly and with elasticity. Many other engines of a similar size give greater power but the Austin is serene in its work. The throttle had to be kept wide open to achieve the desired performance and while pick-up and acceleration were good perhaps another form <b>of</b> <b>carburettor</b> might give a great improvement. It is not a fast car on the level or hill-climbing. Kop Hill was climbed with little effort but first gear was required about one {{hundred yards from the}} summit.|$|R
