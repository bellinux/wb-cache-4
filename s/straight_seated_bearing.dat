40|$|Engineering components, e. g. tubing {{systems for}} the {{down-hole}} applications in {{the oil and gas}} industry (in particular, sucker rod pumps, progressing cavity pumps and some other components of the artificial lifting systems), as well as numerous valves and <b>seats,</b> <b>bearings,</b> gears and plungers, require protection against friction and sliding abrasion service conditions. The hard boride based coatings on steels and alloys obtained through the thermal diffusion process have a high potential for these severe application conditions over many other types of coatings as they can be obtained on the entire working surfaces of large size and complex shape products. Intensive tribological studies of the iron boride based coatings on carbon steel obtained at Endurance Technologies Inc. have been conducted using the Cameron-Plint testing unit (reciprocating sliding of the metallic rod under the load over a flat surface of the coated samples). The friction wear loss, friction coefficient and structural changes of the coatings have been studied in dry and lubricating (water-oil) friction conditions, which simulate actual application conditions. It was demonstrated that the obtained boride coatings have the friction loss significantly smaller than untreated steel (e. g. 2 ̆ 23 c 10 - 30 times in the dry conditions and at least 5 times in the lubricating conditions) with no peeling and flaking-off. The friction coefficients of the boride coatings are steady over the test duration. The influence of the thickness on the boride coatings performance is demonstrated. The encouraging results are explained by the specific coating structure of the hard coating obtained through the thermal diffusion process and the thin 'tribofilm' formed during a friction mode.

Therefore, a research about factors that influence to {{the potential of the}} work accident of the truck drivers at PT BerkatNugraha SinarLestari, Belawan in 2015. The research samples are 39 truck drivers. The characteristic of this research is analytic using cross sectional design. The data analysis used are univariate, bivariate using Exact Fisher test and multivariate using Binary Logistic Regression test with backward stepwise method. The result of the research shows that truck drivers who ever got work accident are 14 drivers (35. 9 %) and 25 drivers (64. 1 %) are never got work accident. The result of exact fisher test show that the condition of the vehicle, the condition of the road and the condition of the body physical have a corellation to the potential of the work accident. The result of binary logistic regression test with backward stepwise method show that the most significant variable influence is the condition of the body physical with value p= 0, 003 and Exp (/ 6) = 0, 065.

40|$|Lecturepg. 33 - 45 This paper reviews a long {{standing}} issue {{related to the}} stiffness and damping coefficients of tilting-pad (TP) bearings; namely, What {{is the nature of}} their frequency dependency? A research project was implemented at the Turbomachinery Laboratory (TL) at Texas A&M University (TAMU) around 2003 to examine the issue, applying procedures that had been developed and used to investigate the rotordynamic characteristics of annular gas seals. Those seals, using a smooth rotor and a honeycomb or hole-pattern stator were predicted to have strongly frequency-dependent reaction forces that could not be modeled by a combination of stiffness, damping, and inertia coefficients. Measurements confirmed the strongly frequency dependent nature of their stiffness and damping coefficients. Subsequent test have examined the following bearing types: (i) Two-axial-groove bearing, (ii) pressure dam bearings, (iii) Flexure-pivot-pad tilting-pad bearing (FPTP) in load-on-pad (LOP) and load-between-pad (LBP), (iv) Rocker-pivot-pad TP bearing in LOP and LBP configurations at two different preloads and 50 and 60 % offsets, and (v) a spherical <b>seat</b> <b>bearing</b> in LOP and LBP configurations. Representative test results are presented for some of these bearings. In addition, this paper includes experimental results for 5 -pad and 4 -pad tilting pad bearings (with similar features to TAMU configuration iv) tested at the GE Global Research Facility (GRC) as part of an independent research initiative from GE Oil and Gas. Frequency effects on the dynamic-stiffness coefficients were investigated by applying dynamic-force excitation over a range of excitation frequencies. Generally, for all bearings tested at TAMU and GRC, the direct real parts of the dynamic-stiffness coefficients could be modeled as quadratic functions of the excitation frequency and accounted for by adding a mass matrix to the conventional [C][K] model to produce a frequency-independent [M][C][K] model. Additionally, the direct damping could be modeled by a constant, frequency-independent coefficient. Consequently, these experimental findings from two independent sources support the use of synchronously reduced force coefficients for characterizing the dynamic performance of tilting pad bearings in Oil and Gas applications, as prescribed by API 617 7 th edition (Process Centrifugal Compressors) and more generally by API 684 Rotordynamic Tutorial...|$|R

The release knob on the hand brake was also red and silver instrument dials. Floor mats also had red piping along their edges. The red theme continued externally with a red striping on the bumpers and red brake calipers. The wheels were 16" [...] x 7" [...] split rim BBS RS 722 alloys, visually similar to the 15" [...] that were found on VR6 model. Brush stainless steel rear twin tailpipes on the exhaust and smoked front fog and indicator lamps to match the rear lamps. 3 optional extras were made available; electric sunroof, air conditioning and metallic black paintwork. Insurance {{was based on the}} standard GTI which made this version a very desirable model. The edition was sold in only 6 colour schemes and the 1000 number figures that were produced was as follows; 600 8 valve models, 150 16 valve models and 250 TDI models. The diesel model was only produced for the European market and was not sold in the UK. Unfortunately many of the models fell into the UK company car and lease market prior to the second-hand market and its believed only a few hundred still survive.However, another factor in the rarity of Mark 3 Golfs, unlike the excellent build quality of the Mark 2, at least in the UK, is the very low quality steel sourced by VW on some occasions, and used across the range, from entry model to VR6. According to independent mechanics and parts specialists, and MOT testers, the floorpan, both door sills, and rear hatch can suffer severe rot and disintegration, and anybody planning to buy one is advised to check for rot, and holes and patches to the floorpan.|$|R
