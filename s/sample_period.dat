2500|$|The [...] is customarily used to {{represent}} the interval between samples and is called the <b>sample</b> <b>period</b> or sampling interval. And the samples of function x(t) are commonly denoted by [...] (alternatively [...] "xn" [...] in older signal processing literature), for all integer values of n. A mathematically ideal way to interpolate the sequence {{involves the use of}} sinc functions. Each sample in the sequence is replaced by a sinc function, centered on the time axis at the original location of the sample, nT, with the amplitude of the sinc function scaled to the sample value, x. Subsequently, the sinc functions are summed into a continuous function. A mathematically equivalent method is to convolve one sinc function with a series of Dirac delta pulses, weighted by the sample values. Neither method is numerically practical. Instead, some type of approximation of the sinc functions, finite in length, is used. The imperfections attributable to the approximation are known as interpolation error.|$|E
2500|$|The {{estimate}} of cooperative time presented {{below is a}} minimum estimate, since data were not originally collected {{with a focus on}} recording all cooperative activity. Short cooperative activities were especially unlikely to be recorded in field notes. For example, examination of videotapes from hunting episodes during the <b>sample</b> <b>period</b> reveals that very short cooperative activities are frequently embedded into longer hunting segments that we have not coded as cooperative time. [...] While pursuing monkeys, hunters often call to others to [...] "stay put", [...] "don't make noise", [...] "don't shoot", [...] "shake a branch", [...] "pound a vine" [...] etc. [...] Other multi-hunter pursuits contain numerous similar requests. [...] The recipient of such a command almost always complies immediately, at a cost to his own chances of making the kill. [...] These events were extremely common, but of very short duration (usually only 10 seconds or so) and are not included in the analyses. Aché men spent an average of 41 (s.e. 7) minutes per day in food acquisition activities scored as cooperative, and women spent 33 (s.e. 14) minutes per day cooperating in foraging. This represents about 10% of total foraging time in the men's sample, and 11% of total foraging time in the women's sample. [...] Both sexes show some sample days with more than 50% of total foraging time being spent helping other individuals to acquire resources.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of varying the <b>sampling</b> <b>period</b> on the dynamic response of the sampled-data Large Space Telescope (LST) system. A range of <b>sampling</b> <b>periods</b> was recommended based on the criterion that self-sustained oscillations are to be avoided in the LST system. The step responses of the LST system were then investigated when various <b>sampling</b> <b>periods</b> are used. For small <b>sampling</b> <b>periods,</b> the dynamic behavior of the sampled-data system is very {{similar to that of the}} continuous-data system. When T is large (but less than 0. 25 sec) the overshoot of the step response of the sampled-data becomes greater. However, the dynamic behavior of the sampled-data system may be improved by redesigning the controller. It appears that a <b>sampling</b> <b>period</b> as high as 0. 1 second is feasible for the LST system. However, it should be noted that the conclusions are obtained with the existing system model.
