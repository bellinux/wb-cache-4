2500|$|On 14 August 1899, he {{was laid}} {{to rest in the}} St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg, not far from his late father, Alexander III. During the service, his mother stood without tears, only deep {{suffering}} was imprinted on her face. When the coffin was put down into the tomb, Maria Feodorovna stood next to Xenia, holding her arm-in-arm and suddenly, looking at her daughter with widely open, unseeing eyes, she loudly said, [...] "Let's go home. Let's go home, I cannot stand it anymore!" [...] and she rushed out. When a board was laid down for leaving the tomb, she went away so quickly that it was difficult for others to keep pace with her. Nobody even had enough time to throw flowers on to the tomb. In the carriage <b>she</b> <b>sobbed</b> for a long time, pressing to her breast George's hat that she took off the coffin's cover.|$|E
2500|$|Jo Ann Compton's {{daughter}} Laurie Ann {{was stabbed}} to death in 1988—and a decade later, the mom was tangled in her grief. [...] "I hope they're in the same hell I'm in," [...] she said of her daughter's murderers on a 1998 show. Oprah brought in Dr. Phil to help Jo Ann. He {{asked her if she}} thought her daughter would want her to be in so much pain—and Compton said no. [...] "Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life," [...] Phil continued. [...] "She lived for 18 vibrant years, and you focus on the day she died." [...] After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: [...] "I never thought of it that way." [...] Later, <b>she</b> <b>sobbed</b> while revealing that she had been planning to end her life after the show. When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: [...] "She continues to stay alive every time I do something positive." [...] Compton's surviving daughter, Cindy, said [...] "She went from existing to living. It was an amazing transformation." ...|$|E
