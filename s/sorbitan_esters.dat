30|$|In {{order to}} obtain more {{versatile}} and more economic nanocarriers, synthetic surfactants have been employed to obtain liposome-like drug delivery systems. Non-ionic surfactants are widely used at this purpose, {{and are able to}} self-assemble into unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles (non-ionic liposomes, niosomes, or non-ionic surfactant vesicles). <b>Sorbitan</b> <b>esters</b> surfactants (Spans®) are lipophilic substances widely used in niosome preparation. In order to prolong the vesicles circulation time and obtain “stealth” nanocarriers, polyethylene glycol (PEG) incorporation is a gold standard approach: through this conjugation, ethoxyethylatedsorbitan esters surfactants (Tweens®) are obtained. Both Span and Tween are characterized by a different hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) value and the choice of the surfactant allows preparing niosomes with the desired properties [10]. Furthermore, the addition of cholesterol is used for the enhancement of the bilayer stability by stretching out the surfactant tails, affecting surfactant’s gel to liquid phase transition temperature and conferring rigidity of the lipophilic bilayer [11, 12].The “optimized” nanocarrier is designed to improve formulation and/or enhance targeting [10].|$|E

Mangiferin was finely dispersed in the suspension with the addition of surfactants studied. Span® 20 was chosen as the surfactant for film preparation in the next step due to the dispersing and film forming properties. Effects of vinyl acetate (VA) contents on the film properties were investigated. The EVA films with 12 % VA had the highest tensile strength and oxygen barrier, followed by 18, 25 and 40 % VA, respectively. Addition of Span® 20 had only a slight effect on mechanical and barrier properties of the films, but markedly increased the release of mangiferin from the EVA matrices except in the 40 % VA films. The maximum concentrations of mangiferin released from the 40, 25, 18 and 12 % VA films into 95 % ethanol were 83. 30, 66. 84, 51. 77 and 34. 57 μg·mL− 11, respectively. The release concentrations from the 40 and 25 % VA films was 2. 4 and 1. 9 folds of that from the 12 % VA film, respectively.

Thus, a lot of research has been developed to the antimicrobial and/or antioxidant characteristics of essential oils. We, therefore, examined the influence of environmental stress conditions (i. e. salt addition and acidification) on the stability of oregano essential oil emulsions that were stabilized by either Tween 80 or Inutec SP 1. Whereas Tween 80 is a non-ionic, food-grade ethoxylated <b>sorbitan</b> <b>ester,</b> Inutec SP 1 is a biodegradable and renewable hydrophobically modified inulin. Whereas the emulsions prepared with Tween 80 exhibited phase separation (oiling off) at all salt concentrations studied, the emulsions stabilized with Inutec SP 1 remained stable for several days; pH variation on the other hand exhibited no significant effect on the stability. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy measurements by nuclear magnetic resonance (DOSY NMR) as well as viscosity measurements suggested the dehydration of the polyoxyethylene (POE) head groups of Tween 80 upon NaCl addition. Measurements by a Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, on the other hand, presented no NaCl effect on the thickness of the adsorbed Tween 80 layer to a hydrophobic surface. Besides the effect of NaCl addition or pH variation, the influence of the ripening inhibitor concentration in the lipid phase and/or temperature variation on the Ostwald ripening levels were also investigated. Emulsions containing a 50 : 50 ratio of oregano essential oil to sunflower oil stored at 4 degrees C exhibited a significant reduction in Ostwald ripening rate.

Because M. diernhoferi ATCC 19340 (indicator strain for smegmatocin) is highly susceptible to oleic acid and smegmatocin requires Tween 80 for manifestation of its anti-M. diernhoferi activity, it is likely that smegmatocin-mediated antimicrobial action is caused by oleic acid generated by hydrolysis of Tween 80 by the inherent esterase action of smegmatocin. Other mycobacteriocins from rapidly growing mycobacteria also have inherent esterase activity against Tween 80 and require Tween 80 for expression of antimycobacterial action.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{examines}} the microstructure, gelation tempera-tures, and flow properties of novel amphiphilogels consisting solely of non-ionic surfactants. Methods. Gels were prepared by mixing the solid gelator (sorbitan monostearate or sorbitan monopalmitate) and the liquid phase (liq-uid <b>sorbitan</b> <b>esters</b> or polysorbates) and heating them at 60 °C {{to form a}} clear isotropic sol phase, and cooling the sol phase to form an opaque semisolid at room temperature. Gel microstructure was ex-amined by light and electron microscopy and by small angle neutron scattering (SANS); gelation temperatures were measured by hot-stage microscopy, a melting point apparatus, and high sensitivity dif-ferential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC). Flow rheograms were per-formed to establish the zero-rate viscosity of the gels and their per-formance under shear. Results. Gel microstructures consisted mainly of clusters of tubules of gelator molecules that had aggregated upon cooling of the sol phase, forming a 3 D network throughout the continuous phase. The gels demonstrated thermoreversibility. Gelation temperature and viscos-ity increased with increasing gelator concentration, indicating a more robust gel network. At temperatures near the skin surface tempera-ture, the gels softened considerably; this would allow topical appli-cation. Conclusions. This study has demonstrated the formation/preparation of stable, thermoreversible, thixtropic surfactant gels (amphiphilo-gels) with suitable physical properties for topical use.

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, proniosomes of {{risperidone}} were formulated, optimized and evaluated for effective transdermal delivery {{in order to}} overcome the bioavailability issues of orally administered risperidone. The proniosomes were prepared using various <b>sorbitan</b> <b>esters</b> with cholesterol and soya lecithin and were evaluated for in-vitro parameters, ex-vivo permeation and in-vivo performance. Results indicated that the vesicles were spherical in shape, their size ranged from 284. 00 Â nm to 941. 40 Â nm and they had high zeta potential. The entrapment efficiency for spans was higher compared to tweens. DSC and IR studies confirmed the absence of chemical interactions between the risperidone and proniosome components. In-vitro release study showed that formulations with spans exhibit controlled release profile and followed the Higuchi model. No significant change in vesicle size and entrapment efficiency was observed when the proniosomes were stored at 4 Â Â±Â  1 Â Â°C and 25 Â Â±Â  2 Â Â°C for three months.

A study was made of the influence of vesicle composition and preparation method on the vesicle structure (MLV, LUV, SUV), size distribution, entrapment efficiency and in vitro release of incorporated tretinoin. Results showed that {{in the presence of}} cholesterol all the amphiphiles used were able to form stable vesicle dispersions with or without tretinoin. Vesicle sizes were dependent on the preparation method, bilayer composition and drug load. Multilamellar (MLV) vesicles were larger than extruded (LUV) and sonicated (SUV) vesicles while drug-loaded vesicles were generally smaller than empty ones. Entrapment efficiencies of tretinoin were always very high especially for multilamellar (91 - 99 %) and extruded (88 - 98 %) vesicles. The in vitro release of tretinoin from the prepared vesicular formulations was studied using the vertical Franz diffusion cells. The rate of drug release through a Silastic membrane from a liposomal and niosomal tretinoin dispersion was generally faster than from a tretinoin solution. Release data showed that tretinoin delivery is mainly affected by the vesicular structure and that tretinoin delivery increased from MLVs to LUVs to SUVs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Selected {{nonionic}} {{surface active}} agents, incorporated in various ointment bases, {{were applied to}} normal rabbit skin daily {{in an attempt to}} determine their chronic toxicity. The dermatitic effects of these surfactant preparations were evaluated by three methods: gross observation, histological examination and biochemical techniques. The results indicated that the tested nonionic surfactants have a distinct potential to irritate rabbit skin, and cause histological and biochemical changes in the skin to which they are applied. It was apparent that the polyoxyethylene ether types of surfactants have the highest capacity to produce dermal reactions. These substances caused thickening, scaling and fissuring of the skin. They induced histological changes: hyperplasia, acanthosis, and various necrosis of the epidermis, edema and inflammation of the dermis. The biochemical changes measured were also the greatest with this type of surfactants. The metabolic measurements indicated a two or three-fold increase in the oxygen uptake of skin samples treated with the polyoxyethylene ether types of surfactants. The phospholipid content of skin samples treated with ten percent polyoxyethylene ether 96 was increased by 47 - 80 percent on the basis of phosphorus content after four days of application. The <b>sorbitan</b> fatty acid <b>esters</b> and polysorbates also had undesirable influences on rabbit skin. Depending on the type and concentration of these surfactants, they also produced various degrees of erythema, hyperkeratinization and desquamation of the skin, hyper-plasia of the epidermis and inflammation of the dermis. Undiluted polysorbate 80 and ten percent polysorbate 60 produced severe necrosis of the upper epidermis and a high number of inflammatory cells in the dermis. The oxygen uptake of skin samples treated with <b>sorbitan</b> fatty acid <b>esters</b> or polysorbates showed a two, three and fourfold increase, depending on the length of the treatment, the concentration and the type of agent used. Polysorbate 85 and sorbitan trio-leate (ten percent in petrolatum) induced a 26 - 53 percent and 27 - 58 percent increase, respectively, in phosphorus content derived from phospholipids of the rabbit epidermis. Morphological and biochemical changes induced by the above three types of surfactants resembled those of various skin diseases. Results of laboratory studies of irritants applied to animal skin are not always reliable for predicting the effects of similar materials on human skin. However, the general similarities between the properties of rabbit skin treated with surfactants and those of human skin in chronic dermatitis lead to a postulation that surfactants may {{play an important role in}} production of external dermatitis of the hands, which is one of the most common dermatoses in our modern North American society...|$|R

The enthalpy and entropy of micelle formation are evaluated according to the phase separation model. The surface tension of solutions was determined by means of Du Nöuys ring.

As the surfactants' chain length increases the CMC at a constant temperature decreases, which {{is directly related to the}} decrease of hydrophilicity of the molecules. For each surfactant, as the system temperature increases, the CMC initially decreases and then increases, owing to the smaller probability of hydrogen bond formation at higher temperatures. The onset of micellization tends to occur at higher concentrations as the temperature increases. To evaluate the enthalpy of micellization, the CMCs are first correlated by a polynomial equation. It is found that ∆Gºm decreases monotonically as the temperature increases over the whole temperature range. Both ∆Hºm and ∆Sºm appear to be decrease monotonically with an increase in temperature.

The {{aim of this study}} was to prepare and characterise non-ionic surfactant vesicles (niosomes) for the ocular drug delivery of naltrexone hydrochloride. The niosomes were prepared using the thin film hydration method and characterised using polarized light microscopy, cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM), percent drug entrapment efficiency (EE %), laser light diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Two classes of non-ionic surfactants (<b>sorbitan</b> <b>esters</b> and polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers) were investigated. The results revealed that tuning of cholesterol concentrations can significantly alter the niosome's physical properties including sizes, EE% and membrane fluidity (thermo-responsiveness). The prepared vesicles were in the range of 7. 0 +/- 1. 0 to 14. 6 +/- 0. 8 microm in size. The prepared niosomes showed different abilities to accommodate cholesterol. This was highly dependent on the structure and continuity of the hydrophobic chains of the used surfactants. Span 60 -based vesicles containing 30 % mol/mol of cholesterol showed the highest EE%. The microstructure and lamellarity of the niosomes were studied using Cryo-SEM. Typical concentric multilayered structures (onion or rose-like) were seen suggesting the formation of multilamellar vesicles. DSC-studies conducted on Span 60 -based niosomes containing 30 % mol/mol cholesterol revealed liquid-gel transition (T(m) and entropy of 43. 5 degrees C and 0. 82 kcal/mol, respectively).

40|$|Innovative {{approaches}} in nanotechnology can provide drug delivery systems {{with a high}} potential in different fields. To avoid trial and error assays as a main driving force governing new designs and, furthermore, to develop successful nanosystem optimization strategies, it is of the greatest importance to develop specific characterisation techniques beyond conventional determinations of size, zeta potential and morphology. However, the application of techniques able to determine some key characteristics, such as nanostructure (i. e., solid structure vs vesicular), {{and the way in}} which the reorganization of components takes place on these structures has been scarcely explored. The present work has been devoted to provide some insights about the potential offered by some NMR techniques to those scientists working on nanotechnological approaches. For this purpose, we selected our nanosystems based on sorbitan monooleate as a case study. We used 1 H NMR methods, including a recently proposed method relying in the well-known Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) experiment for the observation of 'invisible signals' in large aggregates (Invisible State STD or ISSTD). Overall, these techniques revealed the presence in these nanosystems of a gradient of flexibility from an internal rigid core towards a more flexible region located on their surface, as well as the absence of water content in both regions. Such structure, corresponding to a solid nanostructure rather than a vesicular one, can explain some of the interesting properties previously observed for these innovative nanosystems, such as their high stability, and allows us to refer to these nanosystems with the term "Solid <b>Sorbitan</b> <b>esters</b> Nanoparticles" (SSN). On the basis of the valuable information provided by the mentioned characterisation techniques, it is our understanding that they could facilitate the future design of new drug delivery nanosystems as well as the improvement of existing ones and/or the development of new applications for classical drug delivery concepts...|$|E

Using optimised conditions for the injector, detector and final oven temperature of 380 degC and a DB 1 -ht column, it was found that all possible ester species elute for the short chain fatty acid esters studied. However as the chain length increases the number of ester species eluting decreases, for the longer fatty acid chain length esters based on oleic and stearic acid the sorbitan and sorbitol tri esters are the largest esters to elute. HT-GC analysis of a range of manufactured sorbitan mono esters based on palmitic, stearic and oleic acid was successful with all the mono ester species separated and identified and these separated from the di and tri esters. Validation of the method with sorbitan mono oleate showed that the method was precise and therefore a suitable method for characterising sorbitan mono esters. HT-GC with on-column injection was also investigated and it was found that for the longer chain fatty acid esters more ester species eluted than when using splitless injection. Validation would be required to establish the precision of the method, however it may also be a suitable method for characterising <b>sorbitan</b> <b>esters.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceCroda Chemicals Europe (Sponsor) GBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to design proniosomal gel drug delivery system of flurbiprofen in a trial to overcome the adverse effects associated with oral administration of the drug. This can be overcome by the use of vesicular drug delivery system. Encapsulation of a drug in vesicular structure can be predicted to prolong the existence of the drug in the systemic circulation and thus enhance penetration into target tissue and reduce toxicity. Due to the limited solvent system present, the proniosomes formed were the mixture of many phases of liquid crystal, viz. lamellar, hexagonal and cubic phase liquid crystals. The potential of proniosomes as a transdermal drug delivery system of flurbiprofen was investigated by encapsulating the drug in various formulations of proniosomal gel composed of various ratios of <b>sorbitan</b> fatty acid <b>esters,</b> cholesterol, prepared by coacervation-phase separation method. The formulated systems were characterized in vitro for size, vesicle count, drug entrapment, drug release profiles and vesicular stability at different storage conditions. Stability studies for proniosomal gel were carried out for 4 weeks. The method of proniosome loading resulted in an encapsulation yield of 30. 6 – 75. 4 %. Invitro studies showed prolonged release of entrapped flurbiprofen. At refrigerated conditions, higher drug retention was observed. It is evident from this study that proniosomes are a promising prolonged delivery system for flurbiprofen and have reasonably good stability characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of formulation variables on development of carvedilol (CAR) proniosomal gel formulations as potential transdermal delivery systems. Different non-ionic surfactants; polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, namely Brij 78, Brij 92, and Brij 72; and <b>sorbitan</b> fatty acid <b>esters</b> (Span 60) were evaluated for their applicability in preparation of CAR proniosomal gels. A 23 full factorial design was employed to evaluate individual and combined effects of formulation variables, namely cholesterol content, weight of proniosomes, and amount of CAR added on performance of proniosomes. Prepared proniosomes were evaluated regarding entrapment efficiency (EE%), vesicle size, and microscopic examination. Also, CAR release through cellulose membrane and permeation through hairless mice skin were investigated. Proniosomes prepared with Brij 72 and Span 60 showed better niosome forming ability and higher EE% than those prepared with Brij 78 and Brij 92. Higher EE% was obtained by increasing both weight of proniosomes and amount of CAR added, and decreasing cholesterol content. Release rate through cellulose membrane was inversely affected by weight of proniosomes. In Span 60 proniosomes, on increasing percent of cholesterol, a decrease in release rate was observed. While in Brij 72 proniosomes, an enhancement in release rate was observed on increasing amount of CAR added. Permeation experiments showed that skin permeation was mainly affected by weight of proniosomes and that Span 60 proniosomal gels showed higher permeation enhancing effect than Brij 72. Proniosomal gel could constitute a promising approach for transdermal delivery of CAR...|$|R
40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this research was}} the design of polymeric cationic nanoparticles from nano-emulsions obtained by low-energy methods for biomedical applications. This {{general objective}} includes the preparation of oil inwater (O/W) cationic nano-emulsions by low-energy methods and their characterization, the preparation and characterization of cationic polymeric nanoparticles using the O/W cationic nano-emulsions as templates, the functionalization of the polymeric nanoparticles and in vitro studies of functionalized nanoparticles. Nano-emulsions with droplet sizes < 300 nm, positive surface charges and acceptable stability were successfully obtained in the Aqueous solution / [CatA: nonionic surfactant] / [Polymer in ethyl acetate] system. Nano-emulsion properties were controlled by the type of the nonionic surfactant, the CatA: nonionic surfactant ratio, composition of the aqueous solution, polymer concentration and polymer molecular weight. Nano-emulsion properties using a castor oil surfactant derivative, i. e. Cremophor® WO 7 or Cremophor® EL, are more suitable for the intended application than those using a <b>sorbitan</b> <b>ester</b> surfactant which suggests that the surfactant structure plays a significant role. The CatA : nonionic surfactant mixing ratio of 1 : 1 was found to be optimum for nano-emulsion formation with small droplet size, appropriate surface charge and stability. The properties of nano-emulsions prepared with MilliQ® water or HEPES solution did not differ significantly while nano-emulsions prepared with a phosphate buffer were highly unstable. The incorporation of glucose (to adapt the solution to the osmolarity required for in vitro studies) had no influence on droplet size and surface charge. Increasing the polymer concentration (from 6 wt% to 10 wt%) did not improve nano-emulsion properties. Decreasing the polymer molecular weight (from EC 10 to EC 4) did not significantly change nano-emulsion properties. Cationic nanoparticles with small particle sizes (< 250 nm), positive surface charges and acceptable stability were obtained from nano-emulsion templating by the solvent evaporation method. Nanoparticle surface charge and stability were {{similar to those of the}} template nano-emulsions while particle size was smaller. The nature of the nano-emulsion aqueous component did not influence significantly nanoparticle size and stability. Surface charge values, however, were lower in HEPES solution than in water. Decreasing the polymer molecular weight (from EC 10 to EC 4) did not significantly change nanoparticle size and surface charge, independently on the aqueous solution used. Complex formation between nanoparticles and folic acid at different charge ratios was achieved. Complex formation was not influenced by the nature of the aqueous component. The size of the complexes formed with different cationic/anionic (c+/a) charge ratios was not significantly changed compared to that of uncomplexed nanoparticles. However, surface charge values were significantly decreased. Complexation between nanoparticles and an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) at different nanoparticle:antisense oligonucleotide (N/P) ratios was achieved. The complexes showed the same trends regarding surface charge and size as those of nanoparticle:folic acid complexes and are hence suitable for therapeutic applications. In the presence of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), surface charge values of the nanoparticle:ASO complexes remained in the negative range suggesting that serum components were absorbed onto the nanoparticle surface. In vitro studies of nanoparticle dispersions revealed that nanoparticles are nontoxic to HeLa cells up to a concentration of 3 mM. A low concentration of cationic species is required for obtaining low hemolytic activity. Moreover, low hemolysis values are achieved with folic acid attached to the nanoparticles. In the absence of Fetal Bovine Serum, Renilla luciferase gene inhibition showed an optimum for the N/P ratio 28 (40 %) which makes them promising candidates for gene inhibition in cell cultures. However, in the presence of serum proteins, no gene silencing was detected, precluding the use of these nanoparticles for in vivo experiments. However, with appropriate functionalization (e. g. with CPP), cell uptake and consequently transfecction could be favored. El objetivo general de esta investigación fue el diseño de nanopartículas poliméricas catiónicas, a partir de nano-emulsiones obtenidas por métodos de baja energía, para aplicaciones biomédicas. Este objetivo incluye la preparación de nano-emulsiones catiónicas de tipo aceite en agua (O/W) con métodos de baja energía y su caracterización, la preparación y caracterización de nanopartículas poliméricas catiónicas utilizando los O/W nano-emulsiones catiónicas como plantilla, la funcionalización de las nanopartículas poliméricas y estudios in vitro de las nanopartículas funcionalizadas. Se han obtenido nanopartículas catiónicas poliméricas a partir de nano-emulsiones, utilizando un polímero preformado que era incorporado en la fase oleosa. Se confirmó la posibilidad de formar complejos entre nanopartículas seleccionadas y compuestos bioactivos, tales como ácido fólico y oligonucleótido antisentido (ASO) fosforotioato. Las características (tamaño y carga superficial) de las nanopartículas y de los complejos formados con ácido fólico o ASO se hallan en un rango que permitiría su aplicación como agentes terapéuticos. Los estudios in vitro de nanopartículas y de los complejos de nanopartículas: oligonucleótido revelaron que las nanopartículas, a concentraciones iguales o inferiores a 3 mM no son tóxicas para las células HeLa, que la concentración de especies catiónicas de las nanoparticluas debe ser baja para obtener valores bajos de hemólisis y que la presencia de ácido fólico unido a las nanopartículas contribuye a la obtención de valores bajos de hemólisis. Además, los complejos de nanopartícula: oligonucleótido mostraron una inhibición de genes en ausencia de suero bovino fetal (FBS), por lo que son candidatos prometedores para la inhibición de genes in vitro. Sin embargo, en presencia de proteínas del suero, no se detectó silenciamiento génico, lo que limita el uso de estas nanopartículas para experimentos in vivo. No obstante, con una funcionalización adecuada (por ej. con CPP) posiblemente se podría favorecer la penetración celular y por tanto conseguir transfección...|$|R
40|$|We are {{grateful}} to Pierre Lanteri and Yohann Clement for their help with the statistical analyses. We {{would also like to}} thank Helene Wong and Jose Serrano for their collaboration to this project. International audienceThe skin toxicity of four ionic surfactants and fourteen non-ionic surfactants was investigated so as to disclose structure/toxicity relationships. The skin toxicity was assessed by means of four in vitro assays, MU and LDH test of cell viability, and detection of the inflammation markers IL- 1 alpha. and IL- 8. Several descriptors of the physicochemical properties of the surfactants were measured in order to find out those molecular descriptors that correlate with the toxicity measured on skin. Principal component analysis and analysis of the matrix of Pearson's correlation coefficients were used for the search of the molecular descriptors having the highest relevance. There was a definite difference between ionic and non-ionic surfactants. Ionic surfactants are the most toxic if they are soluble in water. Crystalline ionic surfactants of low solubility show low toxicity. The sign of the charge, anionic or cationic, does not matter. The value of the CMC that has been put forward as a highly relevant parameter does not account for the full skin toxicities observed; the CMC of non-ionic surfactants is not a parameter of relevance. For non-ionic surfactants, the nature of the chemical bond linking the polar head group and the alkyl chain has a significant impact on skin toxicity; PEG ethers appear more toxic than PEG esters. The results revealed the mildness of polyoxyethylene <b>sorbitan</b> <b>esters</b> whatever be their alkyl chain length. On the other hand, for sucrose ester surfactants, C 12 alkyl length resulted in the greatest skin toxicity. Since the molecular parameters of ionic, non-ionic, water-soluble and crystalline surfactants are different, a universal parameter was introduced, the order parameter describing the orientation ordering of surfactant molecules at interfaces. The highly ordered organization of crystalline surfactants associated with their low solubility in water makes them very low-irritant surfactants...|$|E
40|$|Adjuvants are {{compounds}} {{added to}} an agrochemical spray formulation to improve or modify {{the action of}} an active ingredient (AI) or the physico-chemical characteristics of the spray liquid. Adjuvants can have more than only one distinct mode of action (MoA) during the foliar spray application process and they are generally known {{to be the best}} tools to improve agrochemical formulations. The main objective for this work was to elucidate the basic MoA of adjuvants by uncoupling different aspects of the spray application. Laboratory experiments, beginning from retention and spreading characteristics, followed by humectant effects concerning the spray deposit on the leaf surface and ultimately the cuticular penetration of an AI, were figured out to evaluate overall in vivo effects of adjuvants which were also obtained in a greenhouse spray test. For this comprehensive study, the surfactant classes of non-ionic <b>sorbitan</b> <b>esters</b> (Span), polysorbates (Tween) and oleyl alcohol polyglycol ether (Genapol O) were generally considered because of their common promoting potential in agrochemical formulations and their structural diversity. The reduction of interfacial tension {{is one of the most}} crucial physico-chemical properties of surfactants. The dynamic surface tension (DST) was monitored to characterise the surface tension lowering behaviour which is known to influence the droplet formation and retention characteristics. The DST is a function of time and the critical time frame of droplet impact might be at about 100 ms. None of the selected surfactants were found to lower the surface tension sufficiently during this short timeframe (chapter I). At ca. 100 ms, Tween 20 resulted in the lowest DST value. When surfactant monomers are fully saturated at the droplet-air-interface, an equilibrium surface tension (STeq) value can be determined which may be used to predict spreading or run-off effects. The majority of selected surfactants resulted in a narrow distribution of STeq values, ranging between 30 and 45 mN m- 1. Nevertheless, all surfactants were able to decrease the surface tension considerably compared to pure water (72 mN m- 1). The influence of different surfactants on the wetting process was evaluated by studying time-dependent static contact angles on different surfaces and the droplet spread area on Triticum aestivum leaves after water evaporation. The spreading potential was observed to be better for Spans than for Tweens. Especially Span 20 showed maximum spreading results. To transfer laboratory findings to spray application, related to field conditions, retention and leaf coverage was measured quantitatively on wheat leaves by using a variable track sprayer. Since the retention process involves short time dynamics, it is well-known that the spray retention on a plant surface is not correlated to STeq but to DST values. The relationship between DST at ca. 100 ms and results from the track sprayer showed increasing retention results with decreasing DST, whereas at DST values below ca. 60 mN m- 1 no further retention improvement could be observed. Under field conditions, water evaporates from the droplet within a few seconds to minutes after droplet deposition on the leaf surface. Since precipitation of the AI must essentially being avoided by holding the AI in solution, so-called humectants are used as tank-mix adjuvants. The ability of pure surfactants to absorb water from the surrounding atmosphere was investigated comprehensively by analysing water sorption isotherms (chapter II). These isotherms showed an exponential shape with a steep water sorption increase starting at 60...|$|E
40|$|Rose, Michael J., Jr. (Veterans Administration Hospital, Washington, D. C.), Stephen A. Aron, and Bernard W. Janicki. Effect {{of various}} {{nonionic}} surfactants on growth of Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 91 : 1863 – 1868. 1966. —Escherichia coli cultivated in media containing 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, or 4. 0 % concentrations of surface-active polyoxyethylene derivatives of formaldehyde polymers of octyl phenol (Triton WR- 1339; Macrocyclon) or of <b>sorbitan</b> mono-fatty acid <b>esters</b> (Tween 20, 40, 60, and 80) exhibited significantly retarded growth {{only at the}} highest concentration. To determine the mechanism of bacteriostasis, certain derivatives and compounds related to the surfactants were investigated. Experiments with compounds related to the Triton-type agents demonstrated that incorporation of monomeric substances (Triton X- 205, X- 305, Igepal CA- 730, or Dowfax 9 N 20) into the medium at a concentration of 4. 0 % did not inhibit the growth of E. coli. It was concluded that the formaldehyde polymer was essential for growth inhibition by the polyoxyethylene derivatives of octyl phenol. The inhibitory activity of the Tween compounds, in contrast, appeared to result from the unesterified fatty acids which contaminate the commercial preparations. Polyol (60), the sorbitan polyoxyethylene derivative of Tween 60 and the basic structural unit of all the Tween-type compounds, and a Tween 80 preparation which was purified by extraction of the unesterified oleic acid, were not inhibitory. Moreover, the amount of free oleic acid present as a contaminant of Tween 80 {{was found to be}} sufficient to cause significant growth inhibition. These results and the observation that E. coli does not appear to hydrolyze the esterified fatty acid of Tween 80 led to the conclusion that growth inhibition obtained with various Tween compounds probaby is a function of their respective fatty acid contaminants...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{coalescence}} or {{fusion of}} fat globules {{is a common}} form of destabilisation in food-related partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions that generally causes thickening of the emulsion, reduced functionality and phase separation. Partial coalescence is particularly exacerbated by shear, temperature fluctuations and air incorporation. Each of which the food product may be exposed to during manufacture, storage, transport or end use leading most often to deleterious effects. One notable example of partial coalescence being desirable is during the manufacture of ice cream. In order {{to better understand the}} factors affecting partial coalescence and their interactions, a systematic series of studies was undertaken on the shear stability of a model food-related partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsion. Shear-induced aggregation of 35 wt% partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions was studied under conditions causing jamming of partially coalesced fat globule aggregates formed under steady shear. Emulsions with different interfacial compositions and solid fat content (~ 25 – 90 %) were studied to probe their effect on the generation of a jamming transition over a range of shear rates (500 – 2000 s- 1). By displacing adsorbed sodium caseinate from the oil-water interface using Tween 20, partial coalescence sensitive emulsions were prepared with either mixed sodium caseinate-Tween 20 or Tween 20 dominated interfacial film compositions using 0. 5 or 1. 5 wt% Tween 20 respectively. Quiescently, the emulsions were stable with 0. 5 wt% Tween 20 regardless of solid fat content. At 1. 5 wt% or above, stability decreased with increasing solid fat content and Tween concentration. Under shear, partial displacement of adsorbed sodium caseinate by Tween 20 generally resulted in the formation of relatively stable aggregates whereas high displacement of protein {{led to the formation of}} less stable aggregates under shear. The aggregation time of emulsions with Tween 20 dominated interfaces decreased with increasing solid fat content whereas for mixed sodium caseinate-Tween 20 emulsions it increased with increasing solid fat content. The extent of fat globule aggregation at low solid fat content was relatively low irrespective of Tween concentration, whereas at high solid fat content, the extent of aggregation varied considerably when interfacial composition was altered. Cryo-TEM micrographs of the fat globules revealed a relatively smooth surface regardless of composition indicating that fat crystal protrusion was not a major factor affecting the stability. These findings showed that interfacial protein functions both to regulate the formation of partially crystalline aggregates as well as the aggregate stability under shear. Furthermore, high solid fat content emulsions although low in liquid oil content were shown to be highly susceptible to partial coalescence when the adsorbed protein load was low. The effect of polyoxyethylene <b>sorbitan</b> fatty acid <b>esters</b> (Tween) alone or in combination with <b>sorbitan</b> fatty acid <b>esters</b> (SPAN) on the shear stability of partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions (35 wt% fat) was studied. Low molecular weight emulsifiers like Tweens and SPANS are often used to regulate the susceptibility of partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions to aggregation and partial coalescence. It was found that emulsion stability increased with increasing chain length of the saturated Tween emulsifiers, while unsaturated Tween 80 was comparatively much more unstable than the saturated types of Tween. The effect of 1 wt% SPAN (SPAN 20, 40, 60 and 80) in the dispersed phase of emulsions containing different concentrations of Tween 80 (0. 2 – 0. 6 wt%) was also investigated. The emulsions showed sharp stability transitions from stable to unstable over the range of Tween 80 concentrations tested. All SPAN containing emulsions with 0. 2 wt% Tween 80 were stable under shear however all emulsions with 0. 6 wt% Tween 80 immediately aggregated when shear was applied. At 0. 4 wt% Tween 80, the saturated long fatty acid chain length emulsifiers (SPAN 40 and 60) were in general much more stable compared to SPAN 20 and 80 containing emulsions. This study indicated that oil soluble SPAN emulsifiers with low and high melting points were similarly poor at preventing partial coalescence. Therefore, phase transitions were likely not a major contributing factor to emulsion stability. Finally, the effects of Tween 20, 40, 60 and 80 on the stability of partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions prepared with and without 1 wt% sodium caseinate were studied. Generally, 1 wt% sodium caseinate emulsions with the unsaturated emulsifier Tween 80 were the most unstable followed by the saturated emulsifiers Tween 20, 40 and 60 in order of increasing fatty acid chain length. Long chain saturated Tween emulsifiers (Tween 40 and 60) improved emulsion stability regardless of whether sodium caseinate was present indicating that alone these emulsifiers form more robust interfacial films compared to the shorter chain length Tween 20 and the unsaturated Tween 80. The Tween type dependent effect on supercooling and fat crystallization caused by interfacial heterogeneous nucleation was also studied using pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance. With sodium caseinate, the degree of supercooling decreased and the crystallization rate diminished with increasing saturated fatty acid chain length but only negligible changes were found without sodium caseinate. These findings indicate that long chain saturated Tweens improve emulsion stability by forming robust interfaces but with sodium caseinate also improve stability through interfacial heterogeneous nucleation. These novel findings provide guidance on how combinations of proteins and emulsifiers can be used to modify and control the stability of partially crystalline oil-inwater emulsions through their combined effects on fat crystallization and interfacial film properties...|$|R
