50|$|An {{understanding}} of this effect can be gained from observation of a <b>stress-strain</b> <b>diagram</b> with exaggerated features. The units of stress are force per unit area, while strain has units of length per length. Any area covered by integrating each instant of a loading and unloading cycle will then be in terms of force times length per volume, which is equivalent to energy per unit volume. This energy represents the amount of mechanical energy being converted to heat in a volume of material resulting in damping.|$|E
50|$|Toughness {{can also}} be defined with respect to regions of a <b>{{stress-strain}}</b> <b>diagram.</b> Toughness {{is related to the}} area under the stress-strain curve. In order to be tough, a material must be both strong and ductile. For example, brittle materials (like ceramics) that are strong but with limited ductility are not tough; conversely, very ductile materials with low strengths are also not tough. To be tough, a material should withstand both high stresses and high strains. Generally speaking, strength indicates how much force the material can support, while toughness indicates how much energy a material can absorb before rupturing.|$|E

[...] The study aimed to analyze the behavioral rheology of 2 wood specimens, the Sitka Spruce and Japanese Birch.

To analyze the rheology, the stress was restricted to uniaxial compression in the longitudinal direction and the post-linear behavior was analyzed using plasticity theory.

The experimental test plan contained uniaxial tensile test experiments performed at room temperature (25 Â°C) at three different strain rates (30, 150 and 750 μm min− 1). The in-situ images and in-situ videos collected by the SEM were correlated with the stress-strain diagrams created with the tensile experiments, in order to relate the {{failure mechanism}} to the features found in the <b>stress-strain</b> <b>diagram.</b> No significant strain rate dependency of the failure mechanism was observed when working with strain rates up to 750 μm min− 1 and working at room temperature.

The HPB-b-PMMA pure diblock copolymer was prepared via controlled living anionic polymerization. Four copolymers, {{in terms of}} the molecular weights of the hydrogenated polybutadiene (HPB) and PMMA sequences (22, 000 - 12, 000, 63, 300 - 31, 700, 49, 500 - 53, 500, and 27, 700 - 67, 800), were used. We demonstrated with the <b>stress-strain</b> <b>diagrams,</b> in combination with scanning electron microscopy observations of deformed specimens, that the interfacial adhesion had a predominant role in determining the mechanism and extent of blend deformation. The debonding of PMMA particles from the LDPE matrix was clearly observed in the compatibilized blends in which the copolymer was not efficiently located at the interface. The best HPB-b-PMMA copolymer, resulting in the maximum improvement of the tensile properties of the compatibilized blend, had a PMMA sequence that was approximately half that of the HPB block. Because of the much higher interactions encountered in the PMMA phase in comparison with those in HPB (LDPE), a shorter sequence of PMMA (with respect to HPB but longer than the critical molecular weight for entanglement) was sufficient to favor a quantitative location of the copolymer at the LDPE/PMMA interface.
