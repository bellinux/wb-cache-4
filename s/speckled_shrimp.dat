40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify the potential of new deep-sea fisheries in the Colombian Caribbean Sea determining their biomass and spatial distribution in order to advice management and conservation strategies, based on ecosystem approach to fisheries management. First, I examine morphological characteristics of the shallow water pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus notialis to investigate stock differentiation, presenting biological data such as size at 50 % sexual maturity. The data onF. notialis were obtained from samples collected from June to December 2004, on board of commercial fishing vessels and from a time series of historic landings of catch and effort data. I did not find morphometric variability between the studied regions, which indicates the existence of a single population of F. notialis from a morphometric point of view. This study provides the first complete view, to date, of the stock structure and fishery dynamics of the pink shrimp F. notialis in the Colombian Caribbean Sea. This fishery is a typical case in which high exploitation, combined with non-existent fisheries management, have resulted in the significant depletion of stock. In response to this, I investigate possible new fishing areas, exploring the poorly understood deep sea habitats in the Colombian Caribbean Sea, to determine the potential for a viable deep-sea crustacean fishery. The sampling area extended from 100 m the isobaths to 600 m depth. I found high abundances ofthe giant red shrimp (Aristaeomorpha foliacea), the royal red shrimp (Pleoticus robustus), the pink <b>speckled</b> deep-sea <b>shrimp</b> (Penaeopsis serrata) and the deep-sea lobster (Metanephrops binghami) obtained in two experimental trawl surveys carried out in November and December 2009, all of which are important commercially. The highest biomassess of these deep-sea crustaceans species were found mainly in the northern zone of the Colombian Caribbean Sea, where the local oceanography is modulated by high productive seasonal upwelling. However, further scientific assessment is necessary to determine population life cycle parameters of these deep-sea crustaceans and associated biodiversity before initiating a new commercial fishery. Studies of deep-sea biodiversity are necessary {{in order to understand the}} degree of stability and vulnerability of deep-sea environments and enable comparison of conditions before and after exploitation of the fishery. This will enable a better understanding of the ecosystem, to advise ecosystem-based conservation and fisheries management strategies. The aim of thislaststudy was to identify deep-sea fish assemblages across a depth range of 200 - 550 m from the Colombian Caribbean Sea and their implications for an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Classification (Cluster analysis) and ordination (non-parametric multidimensional scaling NMDS) were performed to identify deep-sea fish assemblages. A total of 102 species (13 Chondrichthyes and 89 Teleosteans) and 58 families (9 Chondrichthyes and 49 Teleosteans) of deep-sea fish were sampled. This study reveals the existence of three deep-sea fish assemblages and demostrates that depth plays an important role in ichthyofaunal differentiation. I conclude that, the management of the shallow shrimp fishery and the potential new deep-sea crustacean fishery should be based on an ecosystem approach that considers population dynamics and structure, the optimum allocation of catches and effort, protection of nursery and spawning areas, the development of monitoring strategies and the care of ecosystems...|$|R
50|$|Butter catfish and Wallago attu are {{the most}} common type of fish found in the lake. 11 species of fish, 5 species of prawn and 2 crab species are commercially {{important}}. The commercially important prawn are giant tiger prawn (Metapenaeus monoceros), Indian prawn (Penaeus indicus), Metapenaeus monoceros (<b>Speckled</b> <b>shrimp),</b> Metapenaeus affinis (Pink prawn) and Metapenaeus dobson (Kadal shrimp). Mangrove crab is the most important commercial crab. Fish landings in the lake, which fluctuated in the past, have recorded a remarkable recovery after the opening of the new mouth and dredging of silt -choked old mouth Magarmukh in 2000-2001, resulted in a better intermixing of the tidal influx from the sea and freshwater inflow from rivers. Against an all time lowest landing of fish and prawn of 1269 t in 1995-96, the all-time high is reported to be 11878 t during 2001-2002 resulting in an estimated per capita income for the fisher folk of Rs 19,575 (about US$392) during the year. Recently, the Government of Odisha have issued a notification banning the lease of Chilika Lake for Culture Fishery.|$|E

40|$|Tropical shrimp {{fisheries}} {{are characterized}} by various interactions with their natural environment and with other fisheries. These latter interactions {{can be explained by}} the high quantity of bycatch taken by industrial trawler fleets, which has a significant impact on fish populations associated with shrimps and thus also on finfish fisheries. Bycatch also includes emblematic species, which are subject to strict conservation measures decided by the international community. It seems important to identify and assess the biological and economic consequences of different mitigation measures (increase of mesh size, turtle excluder devices and bycatch reducing devices). This communication is based on case studies undertaken on the Indian white prawn (Fenneropenaeus indicus) and <b>speckled</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Metapenaeus monoceros) fisheries in Madagascar and on the brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus subtilis) and pink spotted shrimp (Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis) fishery in French Guiana. A review of the impacts of these fisheries on resources and ecosystems is made and some results of experiments on mitigation devices given. Finally, the results of simulations obtained using a multi-species, multi-fleet, age-structured bioeconomic model, including modifications of catchability and costs related to the adoption of these devices, is presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{fragments}} of white spot virus (Systemic Ectodermal and Mesodermal Baculovirus:SEMBV) were detected in various natural aquatic organisms by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique. The suspected carriers (shrimps, crabs, fish, benthic organisms and planktons) {{were collected from}} sources near shrimp farms (East coast and West coast in southern of Thailand) during October 1997 to September 1998. First step amplification of the DNA extracted from samples consistently yielded 643 basepairs PCR product as expected. Second step amplification PCR product containing SEMBV DNA yielded an expected 330 basepairs. Specific DNA {{fragments of}} SEMBV were detected in 6 species of wild shrimp (Krill Acetes sp. and Euphausia sp., snapping shrimp Alpleus euphrosyne, banana shrimp Penaeus merguiensis, <b>speckled</b> <b>shrimp</b> Metapenaeus monoceros and dwarf prawn Macrobrachium equideus). It was also detected in 2 species of wild crab (merder's mangrove crab Sesarma merderi and hermit crab Eupagurus bernberdus) and 3 species of fish (mud skipper Periophthalmus sp., goby fish Gnathogobius aliceae and blue panchax Aplocheilus panchax). Gastropod (Family Cerithidae), benthic polychaete and planktons (copepods, rotifers, moinas, nauplius and oscillatoria) were also positive for the SEMBV DNA fragments detection. Thers aquatic organisms {{were found to be}} reservoir hosts of SEMBV. Using both techniques demonstrated that the virus was found in carriers similar to SEMBV in the cultured shrimp Penaeus monodon with white spot syndrome. The prevalence of SEMBV in different carriers ination to seasonal cycle and localities is discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} survey the {{prevalence}} of some infectious diseases e. g. Taura syndrome virus (TSV) and Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) in white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) populations and {{to assess the impact}} of such infectious agents to indigenous aquatic animals in Thailand. Samples of both larval and juvenile or adult shrimp from each region of the country were collected and screened for TSV and IHHNV using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Viruses isolated from affected shrimp were used for determine the susceptibility to infection of some aquatic species native to Thailand. A total of 163 samples of larval shrimp from hatcheries were screened. The results showed infection with TSV and IHHNV in 3. 68 and 44. 17 %, respectively. As high as 7. 32 % TSV infection was detected in shrimp samples collected from the South Eastern coast, followed by the Eastern and Central regions with percentages of 5. 56 and 4. 53, respectively. Shrimp with the highest rate of IHHNV infection, 55. 56 % were collected from the Eastern region. A total of 192 samples of shrimp reared in grow-out ponds were also collected. The results showed shrimp were infected with TSV and IHHNV with percentages of 6. 67 and 67. 19, respectively. The highest prevalence of IHHNV (up to 90 %) was found in samples collected from the lower Southern region. The highest prevalence of TSV infection (11. 29 %) was reported in shrimp from the Central region. A study of the susceptibility to TSV and IHHNV infection of some indigenous aquatic species of Thailand was also carried out. The results showed many aquatic species native to Thailand e. g. black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), <b>speckled</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Metapenaeus monoceros), dwarf prawn (Macrobrachium equideus), krill (Acetes sp.), mantis lobster (Chloridopsis immaculatus), freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium lanchesteri and M. rosenbergii), mangrove crab (Sesarma sp.) and mud crab (Scylla serrata) were susceptible to viruses and died due to infection. The mortality of affected species associated with a causative agent was confirmed in most species, except the mud crab and freshwater prawn (Marcrobrachium rosenbergii). However, viral particles can be still detected in surviving animals 10 days after infection. The results of this study will be a helpful tool employed in establishing measures on disease control and reduction of risk with the importation of white shrimp broodstock...|$|E
