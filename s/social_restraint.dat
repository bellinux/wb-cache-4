40|$|A new {{dimension}} may {{be added to}} the study and teaching of a second language by the development of contrastive sociolinguistics. Sociolinguistics is defined here as the study of how a person relates to another person in terms of language, and is concerned with relational utterances rather than factual statements. Relational utterances are those that assume the existence of a listener, to whom the speaker is relating himself. Such utterances vary in tone and style, depending on the variables of sex, age, status, and familiarity. These variables make it socially, not linguistically, obligatory for certain relational utterances to be selected over others. The necessity of teaching the differences in relational utterances is illustrated {{in the case of the}} Japanese, who cannot confortably use English imperatives or invectives because of the <b>social</b> <b>restraint</b> on such usage in Japanese.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} recent {{phenomenon}} of premarital stag party tours made to Eastern European cities by groups of British men. It {{is based on}} ethnographic field research in Krakow, Poland, conducted {{over the course of}} one year. The use of qualitative methods, primarily participant-observation, allows for the exploration of the in situ meanings and social interactions which define the stag weekend. The thesis argues that the behaviour of stag tour groups offers considerable insight into masculinity and that the meanings attributed to such behaviour reveal complex construction of contemporary British masculinities. It is argued that the Eastern European stag tour is both sold and consumed on the premise that it represents a distinct physical, social and symbolic space and time within which masculine behaviour can be enacted. This is seen as a liminal space within which an exaggerated hyper-masculinity based on a carnivalesque social transgression becomes possible and desired. It is argued that the stag tour is both performative and embodied. The male body plays a central role through the consumption of alcohol, its effects upon the body and the use of bodies by stag tourists to foster an ethos of playfulness and enact a transgressive release from <b>social</b> <b>restraint.</b> Intimacy, sociability and group cohesion {{play a significant role in}} shaping the meaning of the stag weekend for tour participants. The thesis concludes that the stag tour represents a meaningful and symbolic moment for its participants, which is mediated by notions of masculinity and homosociality. While the stag tour represents a manifestation of hegemonic masculinity in a narrow sense, it also highlights the adaptability, rather than „crisis‟, of masculinity for the men involved.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to explore for the {{possible}} existence of value orientations as factors operative in the social work judgment process. The study first tested for differences in value orientation between social workers. The {{extent to which these}} value orientations dominate the pre-disposing attitudes of the social worker was to be determined for the case of diagnosis of families in crisis. Utilized as a test for value orientation were five constructs developed by Charles Morris. These constructs as characterized by their titles were: A. <b>Social</b> <b>Restraint</b> and Self-Control; B. Enjoyment in Action; C. Withdrawal and Self-Sufficiency; D. Receptivity and Sympathetic Concern; E. Self -Indulgence (or Sensuous Enjoyment). The study was designed to scale the ratings in responses from a sample of social workers. Its purpose was to obtain information showing relative preference for each of the five value orientations so that a relationship could be tested for with a similar scaling of the importance each respondent attached to diagnostic criteria of family crisis. The items used to test for preferred diagnostic criteria were evolved by adapting a problem area list developed by Brim, Fairchild and Borgatta. The original items were modified and appropriately revised by testing them with a special group of respondents whose evaluation of the original list was the basis for developing the final list of items. A questionnaire consisting of three parts was sent to 300 social workers selected randomly from the Directory of members of the National Association of Social Workers. One hundred fifty-eight usable responses were received. Personal information such as age, sex, marital status, religion, place of employment and work background was obtained along with ratings and rankings of the aforementioned value orientations and diagnostic criteria items. A listing of the ranking of value orientation in its relationship with the employment setting of the social worker showed some differences between sub-groups of the sample. Administrators and Community Organizers tended to emphasize Construct A: <b>Social</b> <b>Restraint</b> and Self-Control, while social workers seeing individuals and families as part of their work tended to emphasize Construct C: Withdrawal and Self-Sufficiency.. Variations along lines of age, sex, marital status and religion also were identified but in more complex combinations. Scores were developed for the ratings of value orientation items and diagnostic criteria items. These were on a seven point scale. A factor analysis of the resultant matrix of correlations between these thirty-one items produced nine dimensions. An orthogonal rotation was used in the factor analysis. The nine factor dimensions are characterized by their titles as follows: (1) External as Opposed to Internal Influences on Family Functioning; (2) Communication between Members in the Family; (3) Focus on Over Descriptive Characteristics; (4) Focus on Family Unity and Loyalty; (5) Focus on Self-awareness and Introspection; (6) Focus on Group Activity; (7) Focus upon Static as Opposed to Dynamic Attributes; (8) Focus upon Responsiveness to Environment; (9) Focus on Current Circumstances of the Crisis Situation. The value orientation items were represented particularly in Factor (5) with a focus on self-awareness and introspection. Factor 4 (8) was a low preference dimension and emphasized the value orientation favoring receptivity and sympathetic concern. Practitioners of social work with families tended to prefer items favoring the individual above the social order. They tended to prefer value orientations that emphasized self-awareness and permitted gratification. The study disclosed four value dominated factors in diagnosis: (1), (5), (7), and (8) as listed above. Factors (2), (3), and (9) were found to be 2 ̆ 2 value free 2 ̆ 2 factors in diagnosis. Factors (4) and (6) seemed to be value tinged in that only a mild loading on a single philosophy construct emerged in the factor analysis on both of these factors...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a demyelinating {{autoimmune disease}} {{that affects the}} central nervous system (CNS) in humans. Several studies have shown a strong correlation between stressful events and the onset and exacerbation of MS in patients. Based on this information, similar studies have been undertaken in mice. CNS demyelination is induced in mice by infecting them with Theiler?s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). After the initial encephalitis phase, the virus persists in susceptible mice strains and demyelination of the CNS occurs, creating a useful model of MS. Using this model, several types of stress ? <b>social,</b> <b>restraint,</b> and handling ? have been utilized, either prior to infection or concurrently, to study the effects in virus-induced demyelination in mice. However, these studies have primarily focused on the effects of chronic stress, while the effects of acute stress on a MS model have, for the most part, been ignored. The objectives of this experiment are to examine the differences in immune response between chronically and acutely stressed mice. Mice in the acute stress group are hypothesized to experience an enhanced immune response, which should lead to: better viral clearance, smaller and fewer lesions in the CNS, and better physical coordination than the chronic stress group. Mice will be separated into three groups. One group will undergo chronic stress, another will undergo acute stress, and the last group will serve as the control. Mice will be infected with TMEV and monitored for effects. Weight measurements and behavioral scoring will be utilized as a way of monitoring disease progression in live mice. Continual monitoring will continue as TMEV is allowed to persist into the chronic, demyelinating phase. The mice will be terminated to collect tissue and serum samples during this phase. Since studies comparing immunological effects of acute versus chronic stress have consistently shown that immunosuppression is associated with chronic stress, while immunoenhancement is associated with acute stress, polar results are also expected in this experiment. Following TMEV infection and subsequent CNS demyelination, different results between the chronically and acutely stressed mice seem likely...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} created as a {{response}} to the growing interest among small and medium-sized business-to-business software developers to internationalise in order to grow their businesses. The initial study of the problem lead to the insight that a strategic mix of communication channels is a key success factor for an internationalisation. The purpose of this thesis was therefore determined to be to explore what and how different factors influence the effectiveness and efficiency of a business-to-business marketing communication mix strategy that leverages the brand, in the context of internationalisation of software developing small and medium-sized enterprises. Academic literature within three areas, related to the purpose of the thesis, was identified and discussed and presented in a frame of references. The first area concerned the development process of a strategic business-to-business marketing communication mix. Following this, the culture factor, including how communication is affected by cultural differences, was considered as a relevant area to study and add to the frame of references. Finally, the internationalisation process of business-to-business small and medium-sized enterprises was studied. Based on the study of academic theory, an analytical model was constructed and targeted issues for each area identified for the subsequent empirical study. An explorative case study approach was found to be suitable for the purpose of the thesis. It was performed by conducting qualitative interviews with representatives of the studied case company as well as a selection of its customers. Additional secondary data was withdrawn to triangulate with the primary data for the analysis of culture. By applying the analytical model to analyse the empirical evidence, using the academic theories and models from the frame of references, insights were generated and conclusions could be drawn. The analysis found that a key success factor is to build credibility in the eyes of prospects, regardless of where they are on the journey from being unaware of the company to becoming loyal customers. This is due to the risk avert nature of business-to-business decision makers. The most important factor for establishing credibility is to be able to show strong customer references, which makes nurturing present customer relationships a critical activity for success. Further, it was firmly established that the particularly long sell cycle that characterises the software industry in which the studied case company operates in, requires the communication channels to be integrated in order to be effective for the whole customer journey. Channels through which the communication can be adapted to suit a specific audience should be prioritised. Also, cultural differences and similarities should be considered, especially when it comes to views on power and the level of <b>social</b> <b>restraint</b> in the country to which the internationalisation is directed. The digitalisation of communication is a trend that evidently has a significant impact on the effectiveness of a marketing communication strategy. Digital communication channels are becoming increasingly relevant and suitable for communicating customer references, demonstrating product features and conveying corporate brand messages. By developing a business-to-business digital marketing communication strategy that is culturally adapted, the preconditions for the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises are improved. On a final note, this Master’s thesis has identified a number of factors that influence the effectiveness and efficiency of a business-to-business marketing communication mix strategy that leverages the brand, in the context of internationalisation of software developing small and medium-sized enterprises. While this has contributed to academic theory, the findings concerning how these factors influence the effectiveness and efficiency provide practitioners with actionable insights. It is therefore the belief of the authors of this Master’s thesis that the content of this report can help managers of internationalising software developing small and medium-sized enterprises in their communication strategy development process...|$|E
40|$|It {{cannot be}} said that Adam Smith has {{developed}} a systematic commercial theory. But the influence that the classical Schools' economic theories have had on commercial theory cannot be easily ignored. In addition, the commercial theories developed in recent literatures have been derived largely from the value and price theories advanced by the School. Therefore, it is quite natural that the re-consideration of the economic theories {{should be given to}} the concepts formulated by the Classical Schools. In general Smith, Say, Ricardo, M'Culloch and Senior did not regard commercial theory as a separate and distinct discipline. (The Classical economists commonly used the term "commerce", instead of the term "marketing".) Smith's explanation of the economics of commerce stems mainly from the concept of "specialization", which is a major consideration in the thought of the Classical economists. Thus, commerce is drawn directly into the picture by the Classical writers and in the words of Smith : "Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes in some measure a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a commercial society. " The theory of commerce is, I believe, essentially a part of economics. However, most students of commerce (marketing) have shown little interest in commercial studies as an economic phenomenon. But recently the need for the economic analysis of distribution has been gradually felt by some students, especially by such English economists as M. Hall and H. Smith. This article aims to contribute to the formulation of a theory of commerce by tracing the development of theories of retail price determination. The first half of this article is devoted to a consideration of the ideas of commerce which were incorporated by A. Smith, J. B. Say and J. R. M'Culloch. Smith emphasizes the functions and the economic significance of the nature and process of commerce on grounds commonly accepted today, though his definition of commerce is very broad. He also justifies the existence of retailers and wholesalers on the basis of services they perform, considering them as the convenient sources of goods to the ultimate consumers. Furthermore he insists that the commercial activity is productive because it creates time and place utilities to commodities, and so retailing is looked upon as {{part of the process of}} production. In the latter half, of this article I shall try to explain the approach of the theory of commerce propounded by the Classical School. Smith asserted that perfect competition did prevail even in the retail market and that prices would exactly cover the costs of production, that is to say, retailer's margins would just cover the expences incurred. In fact, the retail trade in those times was carried out under conditions of perfect competition. Accordingly, he argued that it would be folly for government to regulate retail prices or numbers of retailers. In sum Smith acknowledged the following conditions as essential to competition; 1. Competitors act independently, not jointly. 2. The number of competitors is sufficient to eliminate extraordinary gains. 3. The economic units possess sufficient knowledge of the market opportunities. 4. There is freedom from <b>social</b> <b>restraint</b> in order to act on this knowledge. 5. Sufficient. time elapses for the resources to flow in the directions and quantities desired by their owners. We all recognize that the basic assumption of perfect competition has played a most important role in the establishment and the development of theoretical economics. In this way, the simplifying devices of assumption and abstraction are commonly used to aid generalization, as J. S. Mill indicates this premise is the first step toward the analysis of economic activities. But I should like to emphasize that if traditional economics holds too closely to such assumptions, it cannot fail to meet many difficulties in the advanced stages of analysis of economic reality. This is the reason that modern economists such as J. Robinson and E. H. Chamberline have offered new tools to analyse the complicated problems in the field of commerce by connecting separate area of pure competition with complete monopoly. Under perfect competition. As Smith thought, merchants could not have any active role in the exchange process in retail markets. This means that there is no room for an individual merchant to establish the price of a commodity by himself. Thus it would not be possible to detect the proper field of commerce. Smith's viewpoint of commerce nevertheless contains many implications that facilitate researches in this field...|$|E
