5|$|The game {{includes}} a research function. When new objects are {{encountered in the}} game, especially enemies, their organs can be collected and, when combined with chemicals found in <b>storage</b> <b>rooms,</b> the player can research the enemies and thus improve their damage against them. Similarly, some exotic weapons and items can only be used after being researched. OSA agents effectively have a separate weapons tree available to them. Psionic powers can be learned, such as invisibility, fireballs, and teleportation.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartment}} {{on the second floor}} consisted of six residential rooms in addition to a foyer, kitchen, buffet, three servant's rooms, a bathroom, two toilets, and two <b>storage</b> <b>rooms.</b> There were also four wine cellars on the same level. The cellars belonged to the apartments on the upper levels. On the third floor, the apartment consisted of eight residential rooms, a foyer, a kitchen, dish washing room, two rooms for servants, a bathroom, and two toilets. This apartment was placed slightly lower than the level of Bankova Street, from the front entrance.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> of agricultural products cooled by snow. The changes of physical properties and nutrition ingredient of stored vegetables in each <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> were compared after Chinese cabbages, cabbages, Japanese radishes, carrots, tomatoes, and spinets were stored in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> of cooled by snow or the electric refrigerator. Significant differences in moisture and temperature between the two storage systems were not observed. The hardness of cabbages and Japanese radish among examined vegetables tended to be held in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> cooled by snow. The decrease of the moisture level of Japanese cabbages, cabbages and carrot was slightly inhibited in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> of cooled by snow. The vitamin C level of Japanese radishes and tomatoes tended to be held in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> cooled by snow compared to the electric refrigerator. The sugar levels of Japanese cabbages, cabbages, and Japanese radishes was same in the two storage systems. Lycopene and β- carotene levels were higher in tomatoes stored in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> of cooled by snow than in those stored in electric refrigerator, however, β- carotene level of carrots stored in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> cooled by snow was lower than that stored in the electric refrigerator. Thus, the uncommon problem was not observed in storage of vegetables using the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> cooled by snow, although the changes of physical properties and nutrition ingredient in vegetables stored in each storage systems were slightly different. Therefore, the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> of agricultural products cooled by snow may be available in an area of high snowfall...|$|R

5|$|The grandest apartment, which {{belonged to}} Horodecki, {{consisted}} of a study, a great room and a living room, a dining room, a boudoir, a bedroom, a children's room, a room for a governess, a guest room, three rooms for servants, a kitchen, dishwashing room, bathroom, two toilets, and two <b>storage</b> <b>rooms.</b> On the floor above was an apartment similar in size and design to Horodecki's apartment. The apartment {{on the top floor}} had one less room; to make up for this, there was a connecting terrace which provided a panoramic view of the city.|$|E
5|$|Further {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of a 128mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four {{of them as a}} Flakvierling quad mount. The 128mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing {{that it would have been}} mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller <b>storage</b> <b>rooms,</b> a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E
5|$|Only a few {{necessary}} {{projects were}} funded, including an underground headquarters bunker, {{improvement of the}} garrison hospital and new training areas. It {{was not until the}} increased tension in Europe following Adolf Hitler's rise to power, Benito Mussolini's March on Rome and the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War that focus once again was put on military readiness and prepared fortifications. Improvements were made to fortifications in many parts of Sweden during the last years of the 1930s following the German annexation of Austria and occupation of Czechoslovakia. In Boden, this included building underground <b>storage</b> <b>rooms</b> for ammunition and food, replenishing already existing stocks, increasing protection for other important supply functionssuch as the waterworksas well as further military planning and also preparations for destruction offor an advancing enemyimportant bridges and roads.|$|E

The first story also contains two bathrooms, four small storage closets, and a central hall, as well as a large stairwell leading up to the second floor. The second story contains three classrooms, with the same features as those downstairs, along with an office and three small <b>storage</b> <b>rooms.</b> A metal fire escape door is located {{in the center of the}} west wall of the second story. The schoolhouse also has a partial basement, which contains a large storage room, a coal room, and a disused coal furnace.|$|E

25|$|Cylinder seals {{were used}} to {{authenticate}} documents like sales, and to control access by sealing a lump of clay on doors of <b>storage</b> <b>rooms.</b> The use of cylinder seals increased significantly during the ED period, suggesting an expansion and increased complexity of administrative activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} {{designed}} as a minelayer but was not particularly good at it due to its slow speed, bad seakeeping qualities and inadequate storage space. During peacetime, Louhi or M1 was used as depot ship with its <b>storage</b> <b>rooms</b> refitted as crew quarters.|$|E
50|$|Pasteurization {{of cream}} began in 1922. An 11-horsepower boiler heated {{the water in}} the water jacket; then the cream was cooled by placing ice and salt in four 18-inch metal pipes which ran from floor to ceiling in the butter <b>storage</b> <b>room.</b> In 1928, the first cork-insulated <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> was built, cooled by an ammonia compressor.|$|R

25|$|Houses {{generally}} {{faced the}} south. Plaza areas were almost always girt with edifices of sealed-off rooms or high walls. Houses often stood {{four or five}} stories tall, with single-story rooms facing the plaza; room blocks were terraced to allow the tallest sections to compose the pueblo's rear edifice. Rooms were often organized into suites, with front rooms larger than rear, interior, and <b>storage</b> <b>rooms</b> or areas.|$|E
