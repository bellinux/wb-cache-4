The veins were generally not less than [...] thick, and dipped at an average angle of 35 to 40 degrees, so that less shoveling was necessary than at Grass Valley, and less waste had to be handled. There was no specimen ore. The concentrates averaged about 6% of the ore and carried about 30% of the value. The ground was heavy and cost of timbering was high. Modified <b>square</b> <b>setting</b> was used. The life of timbers {{was said to be}} not over a year and a half. Long working drifts had to be watched and the ground taken frequently, and caution was needed in the stopes. According to Weed, the developments at the Champion group up to 1917 had not been satisfactory, the average yield not paying for operation in 1916.
