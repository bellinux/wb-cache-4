50|$|High {{production}} volume chemicals, {{also referred to}} as HPV chemicals, are produced or imported into the United States in quantities of 1 million pounds or 500 tons per year. In OECD countries, HPV chemicals are defined as being produced at levels greater than 1,000 metric tons per producer/importer per year in at least one member country/region. A list of HPV chemicals serves as an overall priority list, from which chemicals are selected to gather data for a <b>screening</b> <b>information</b> dataset (SIDS), for testing and for initial hazard assessment.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987, member {{countries}} of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development decided to investigate existing chemicals. In 1991, they agreed to begin by focusing on High production volume (HPV) chemicals, where production volume {{was used as a}} surrogate for data on occupational, consumer, and environmental exposure. Each country agreed to [...] "sponsor" [...] the assessment of a proportion of the HPV chemicals. Countries also agreed on a minimum set of required information, the <b>screening</b> <b>information</b> dataset (SIDS). Six tests are: acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, developmental toxicity/reproductive toxicity, mutagenicity, ecotoxicity and environmental fate. Using SIDS and detailed exposure data OECD's High Production Volume Chemicals Programme conducted initial risk assessments to screen and to identify any need for further work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: One {{problem with}} {{controlling}} remote PCs via small mobile {{devices such as}} cellular phones {{is the difference between}} PC GUIs and mobile device UIs (screen sizes, input devices etc.). To solve the problem, we propose a method for transforming PC GUIs into mobile device UIs. The essence of our method is to read GUI screens in order to obtain current PC <b>screen</b> <b>information</b> with a GUI accessibility method. The <b>screen</b> <b>information</b> data is transformed into email/HTML-formatted textual data so that users can browse the data with an emailer or a Web browser. Users can send their input operations to PCs by email replies or Web operations (hyperlink selection/form inputs). Because the PC screen data transferred to mobile devices are not images but textual data, our method requires less data transfer time and lower cost than other image-based methods. In addition, our method enables users to interact with PC applications more efficiently than others because annoying screen zoom in/out operations are not required...|$|R
50|$|The District {{engages in}} {{identification}} procedures {{to ensure that}} eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. When a child experiences difficulty within the classroom, <b>screening</b> <b>information</b> will be gathered by a Multi-Disciplinary Team located within the child’s school to determine his or her specific needs. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening {{results suggest that the}} student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible make a written request for a multidisciplinary evaluation to the building principal.|$|E

40|$|Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{screening}} rates remain low among low-income {{and minority}} populations. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether providing patients with <b>screening</b> <b>information,</b> activating them to ask for a screening test, and telephone barriers counseling improves CRC screening rates compared with providing <b>screening</b> <b>information</b> only. Methods: Patients were randomized to CRC <b>screening</b> <b>information</b> plus patient activation and barriers counseling (n 138) or CRC <b>screening</b> <b>information</b> (n 132). Barriers counseling was attempted among activated patients if screening was not completed after one month. CRC screening test completion was determined by medical record review at two months after the medical visit. Logistic regression was used to determine whether activated patients were more likely to complete CRC screening, after adjustment for confounding factors (e. g., demographic characteristics and CRC knowledge). Results: Patients were African American (72. 2 %), female (63. 7 %), had annual household incomes less than $ 20, 000 (60. 7 %), no health insurance (57. 0 %), and limited health literacy skills (53. 7 %). In adjusted analyses, more patients randomized to the activation group completed a screening test (19. 6 % vs. 9. 9 %; OR 2. 35, 95 % CI: 1. 14 – 5. 56;P 0. 020). In addition,more activated patients reported discussing screeningwith their provider (54. 4 %vs. 27. 5 %,OR 3. 29, 95 %CI: 1. 95 – 5. 56;P< 0. 001) andhadmore screening tests ordered (39. 1 %vs. 17. 6 %; OR 3. 40, 95 % CI: 1. 88 – 6. 15; P < 0. 001) compared with those in the control group. Conclusion: Patient activation increased CRC screening rates among low-income minority patients. Impact: Innovative strategies are still needed to increase CRC screening discussions, motivate providers to recommend screening to patients, as well as assist patients to complete ordered screening tests.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{design and}} user-test a ‘gist-based’ {{colorectal}} cancer <b>screening</b> <b>information</b> leaflet, which promotes {{comprehension of the}} screening offer. MethodsTwenty-eight individuals approaching screening age were recruited from organisations in deprived areas of England. Using a between-subjects design, we tested iterations of a newly-designed gist-based information leaflet. Participants read the leaflet and answered 8 ‘true’ or ‘false’ comprehension statements. For the leaflet to be considered fit-for-purpose, all statements had to be answered correctly by at least 80 % of participants in each round. Alterations were made if this threshold was not met and additional rounds of testing were undertaken. ResultsAt round 1, answers to 2 / 8 statements {{did not meet the}} threshold. After changes, answers in round 2 did not reach the threshold for 1 / 8 statements. In round 3, all answers were adequate and the leaflet was deemed fit-for-purpose. Qualitative data offered solutions such as language and layout changes which led to improved comprehension of the leaflet. ConclusionUser-testing substantially improved the design and subsequent comprehensibility of a theory-driven gist-based colorectal cancer <b>screening</b> <b>information</b> leaflet.
