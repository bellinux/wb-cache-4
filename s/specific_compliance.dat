Mitchell Bronchial {{compliance and}} wall structure during development of the immature human and pig lung. P. K. McFawn, H. W. Mitchell. ERS Journals Ltd 1997. ABSTRACT: Maturational changes in the <b>specific</b> <b>compliance</b> could potentially con-tribute to the development or clinical presentation of respiratory diseases in infants and children. Changes in the <b>specific</b> <b>compliance</b> during development and its struc-tural basis have been well characterized, but changes in bronchial compliance and the mechanisms involved have received little attention. Semistatic pressure-volume curves were generated for isolated bronchial seg-ments from late-term foetal, immature and adult pigs. A small number of bronchi from human infants were also studied. The amount of cartilage in the bronchial wall of pigs of different ages was measured histologically, and morphometric changes in the wall of inflated bronchi were investigated. The <b>specific</b> <b>compliance</b> of bronchi approximately halved from 1 to 4 weeks of age. No change in <b>specific</b> <b>compliance</b> was observed either between 4 week old and adult pigs, or between late-term foetal and 1 week old pigs. Changes in the total wall and cartilage areas did not correlate with changes in <b>specific</b> <b>compliance.</b> Inflation to 20 cmH 2 O transmural pressure reduced the total wall area of bronchi from 1 week old pigs. Significant changes in bronchial distensibility occur during the early postnatal period. These changes in <b>specific</b> <b>compliance</b> are not caused {{by an increase in}} the amount of cartilage. The increase in luminal volume during inflation of bronchial segments occurs, partially, by compression of the airway wall against the cartilage layer...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} new reference values and predictive variables for dynamic and static pulmonary compliance in men. The investigation was conducted as a prospective study in healthy, non-smoking men with normal pulmonary function parameters including spirometry, bodyplethysmography and CO diffusing capacity. The esophageal pressure method was used to measure dynamic <b>compliance</b> (Cdyn), <b>specific</b> dynamic <b>compliance</b> (Cdyn/ITGV), static <b>compliance</b> (Cstat) and <b>specific</b> static <b>compliance</b> (Cstat/ITGV). Lung recoil pressures were recorded at different levels of total lung capacity (TLC). A total of 208 men aged 20 – 69 years were included in the study. The mean values for the compliance parameters were: Cdyn: 2. 91 ± 1. 08 L/kPa; Cdyn/ITGV: 0. 71 ± 0. 30 kPa− 1; Cstat: 3. 34 ± 1. 04 L/kPa; Cstat/ITGV: 0. 82 ± 0. 31 kPa− 1. Cdyn, Cdyn/ITGV and Cstat/ITGV were significantly correlated with age and Cstat was related to height, but in multiple regression analyses the predictability for compliance parameters was very low. Lung recoil pressures at all TLC levels significantly decreased with ageing. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the contribution of anthropometric variables to the regression equations of pulmonary compliance was low. With ageing the static pressure–volume curve of the lung shifted to the left without substantial alteration of the slope...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{establishes}} {{a novel approach}} of robust active compliance control for a robot hand via an Integral Sliding Mode Controller (ISMC). The ISMC allows us to intro-duce a model reference approach where a virtual mass-spring damper system {{can be used to}} design a compliant control. In order to allow for practical grasping, we consider the shape of the object to be grasped. Hence, the work exploits a grasping technique via Cylindrical and Spherical coordinate systems due to their simplicity and geometric suitability. The control uses the operational space approach. Thus, the control is split into a task control and a particular optimizing posture control. The experimental results show that target trajectories can be easily followed by the task control despite the presence of friction and stiction while the posture controller maintains a desired finger posture. When the object is grasped, the compliant control will automatically adjust to a <b>specific</b> <b>compliance</b> level. Once a <b>specific</b> <b>compliance</b> model has been achieved, the fixed compliance controller can be tested for a specific scenario. The experimental results prove that the BERUL hand can automatically and successfully attain different compliancy levels for a particular object via the ISMC. I...|$|E
30|$|Another crucial {{element of}} {{compliance}} programs is compliance training. We did not manipulate training, which is unrealistic {{in the setting}} of an experiment, but used variation, which occurred ‘naturally’ among participants. Our results indicate that more compliance training sessions prior to the study lead to higher intentions to report misconduct but did nothing for the managers’ own ethical intent, when relevant control variables were included. This is also the case for more <b>specific</b> <b>compliance</b> training sessions, which are leading to a higher willingness to report misconduct. Comparing these effects of compliance training nicely illustrates a well-known dilemma in empirical studies on norms: training increases awareness about the problem of ethical (mis-)conduct and the scrutiny regarding the behavior of others, but does not really affect the own behavior.|$|E

40|$|How can {{international}} organizations shape national welfare states? The answer depends on why national governments comply with international organization mandates.
