30|$|Practitioners {{implementing}} {{prescribed burning}} to support bighorn <b>sheep</b> <b>face</b> many challenges. The unpredictable nature of weather patterns makes optimal timing of burns difficult, with post-fire recovery {{heavily dependent on}} ever-increasing stochastic tendencies in climate regimes, particularly drought (Engle and Bultsma 1984). We recommend conducting prescribed fires before bighorn reintroductions, or conducting prescribed burns on a relatively small scale and rotational basis to avoid potentially impeding foraging options. Moreover, if objectives are set to support bighorn populations by opening habitats restricted by timber encroachment, mechanical treatments such as clear-cut logging {{have been shown to}} increase habitat use by bighorns to a higher degree than burning alone (Smith et al. 1999).|$|R

40|$|The {{suitability}} of face recognition was investigated as a biometric-based identifier for sheep using a holistic analysis of face images {{by the independent}} components technique. Algorithm training was performed independently on several normalized face images from 50 sheep (sets of two, three, and four training images per sheep). The performance of this technique was assessed on a separate set of images (three normalized <b>face</b> images per <b>sheep)</b> using the cosine distance classifier. When 180 to 200 components were extracted, the recognition rate was as high as 95. 3 % to 96 %. As expected, fewer independent components reduced the recognition rate, while a higher number of training images per sheep improved it. Although our results have demonstrated the potential of face recognition as a non-invasive, inexpensive, and accurate novel biometric identifier of sheep, further work should aim at improving recognition rates on a larger set of <b>sheep</b> <b>faces...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sheep {{are one of}} {{the most}} studied farm species in terms of their ability to process {{information}} from faces, but little is known about their face-based emotion recognition abilities. We investigated (a) whether sheep could use images of <b>sheep</b> <b>faces</b> taken in situation of varying valence as cues in a simultaneous discrimination task and (b) whether the valence of the situation affects their learning performance. To accomplish this, we photographed <b>faces</b> of <b>sheep</b> in three situations inducing emotional states of neutral (ruminating in the home pen) or negative valence (social isolation or aggressive interaction). Sheep (n[*]=[*] 35) first had to learn a discrimination task with colored cards. Animals that reached the learning criterion (n[*]=[*] 16) were then presented with pairs of images of the face of a single individual taken in the neutral situation and in one of the negative situations. Finally, sheep had to generalize what they had learned to new pairs of images of faces taken in the same situation, but of a different conspecific. All sheep that learned the discrimination task with colored cards reached the learning criterion with images of <b>faces.</b> <b>Sheep</b> that had to associate a negative image with a food reward learned faster than sheep that had to associate a neutral image with a reward. With the exception of sheep from the aggression-rewarded group, sheep generalized this discrimination to images of faces of different individuals. Our results suggest that sheep can perceive the emotional valence displayed on faces of conspecifics and that this valence affects learning processes...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for {{localisation}} of facial landmarks on human and sheep. We introduce a new feature extraction scheme called triplet-interpolated feature used at each iteration of the cascaded shape regression framework. It is able to extract features from similar semantic location given an estimated shape, even when head pose variations are large and the facial landmarks are very sparsely distributed. Furthermore, we study the impact of training data imbalance on model performance and propose a training sample augmentation scheme that produces more initialisations for training samples from the minority. More specifically, the augmentation number for a training sample is made to be negatively correlated {{to the value of}} the fitted probability density function at the sample's position. We evaluate the proposed scheme on both human and sheep facial landmarks localisation. On the benchmark 300 w human face dataset, we demonstrate the benefits of our proposed methods and show very competitive performance when comparing to other methods. On a newly created <b>sheep</b> <b>face</b> dataset, we get very good performance despite the fact that we only have a limited number of training samples and a set of sparse landmarks are annotated.

40|$|Faces {{are highly}} emotive stimuli {{and we find}} smiling or {{familiar}} faces both attractive and comforting, even as young babies. Do other species with sophisticated face recognition skills, such as sheep, also respond to the emotional significance of familiar faces? We report that when sheep experience social isolation, the sight of familiar <b>sheep</b> <b>face</b> pictures {{compared with those of}} goats or inverted triangles significantly reduces behavioural (activity and protest vocalizations), autonomic (heart rate) and endocrine (cortisol and adrenaline) indices of stress. They also increase mRNA expression of activity-dependent genes (c-fos and zif/ 268) in brain regions specialized for processing faces (temporal and medial frontal cortices and basolateral amygdala) and for emotional control (orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex), and reduce their expression in regions associated with stress responses (hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus) and fear (central and lateral amygdala). Effects on face recognition, emotional control and fear centres are restricted to the right brain hemisphere. Results provide evidence that face pictures may be useful for relieving stress caused by unavoidable social isolation in sheep, and possibly other animal species, including humans. The finding that sheep, like humans, appear to have a right brain hemisphere involvement in the control of negative emotional experiences also suggests that functional lateralization of brain emotion systems may be a general feature in mammals...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was the {{isolation}} of both E. coli O 157 and non-O 157 in sheep. Verotoxins (VT) 1, 2 and eae genes were tested for this propose. <b>Sheep</b> <b>faces</b> are an important source of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 is a highly virulent food-borne pathogen and threat to public health. Rectal swab samples from sheep were collected during 2009 - 2010. Conventional plating and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were carried out according to virulence factors (Stx 1, Stx 2 and eae A). There significant differences between prevalence of STEC and session were observed. It was at highest in spring and late summer. Six (3. 92 %) sheep carcasses were contaminated by E. coli O 157 :H 7. Only six samples were positive by PCR specific for the VT 2 gene and produced verocytotoxin VT 2, whereas all isolates were negative for the presence of VT 1 and eae virulence genes considered. Geographical variations and season may be influenced in the prevalence rate. The composition of the gastrointestinal flora may be changed by different diet and, therefore O 157 STEC rate in sheep and lamb was different. Iranian sheep indicated as a natural host of E. coli O 157 strains therefore, may be potentially pathogenic for humans. This is the first report of E. coli O 157 detection from sheep in Iran...|$|R

40|$|Culture {{affects the}} way people move their eyes to extract {{information}} in their visual world. Adults from Eastern societies (e. g., China) display a disposition to process information holistically, whereas individuals from Western societies (e. g., Britain) process information analytically. In terms of face processing, adults from Western cultures typically fixate the eyes and mouth, while adults from Eastern cultures fixate centrally on the nose region, yet face recognition accuracy is comparable across populations. A potential explanation for the observed differences relates to social norms concerning eye gaze avoidance/engagement when interacting with conspecifics. Furthermore, {{it has been argued}} that faces represent a ‘special’ stimulus category and are processed holistically, with the whole face processed as a single unit. The extent to which the holistic eye movement strategy deployed by East Asian observers is related to holistic processing for faces is undetermined. To investigate these hypotheses, we recorded eye movements of adults from Western and Eastern cultural backgrounds while learning and recognizing visually homogeneous objects: human <b>faces,</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>faces</b> and greebles. Both group of observers recognized faces better than any other visual category, as predicted by the specificity of faces. However, East Asian participants deployed central fixations across all the visual categories. This cultural perceptual strategy was not specific to faces, discarding any parallel between the eye movements of Easterners with the holistic processing specific to faces. Cultural diversity in the eye movements used to extract information from visual homogenous objects is rooted in more general and fundamental mechanisms...|$|R
