5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high <b>school</b> <b>play</b> or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E
