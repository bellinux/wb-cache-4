25|$|Goodale & Milner {{themselves}} have proposed {{the analogy of}} tele-assistance, {{one of the most}} efficient schemes devised for the remote control of robots working in hostile environments.

30|$|Another {{challenging}} issue {{associated with}} the high velocity is that data are often nonstationary [13], i.e., data distribution is changing over time, which needs the learning algorithms to learn the data as a stream. To tackle this problem, the potential superiority of <b>streaming</b> <b>processing</b> theory and technology [97] have been found out compared with batch-processing paradigm, as they aim to analyze data {{as soon as possible}} to derive its results. Representative <b>streaming</b> <b>processing</b> systems include Borealis [98], S 4 [99], Kafka [100], and many other recent architectures proposed to provide real-time analytics over big data [101, 102]. A scalable machine learning online service with the power of <b>streaming</b> <b>processing</b> for big data real-time analysis is introduced in [103]. In addition, the professor G. B. Giannakis have paid more attention to the real-time <b>processing</b> of <b>streaming</b> data by using machine learning techniques in recent studies; more details can be referred to in [87, 104].|$|R

25|$|Although Windows Driver Model (WDM) was {{available}} starting with Windows 98, few audio card manufacturers used it. Due to internal buffering, KMixer introduced significant processing latency (30 ms on then-current systems). Windows 98 {{also includes a}} WDM streaming class driver (Stream.sys) to address these real time multimedia data <b>stream</b> <b>processing</b> requirements. When the sound card uses a custom driver for use with the system supplied port class driver PortCls.sys or implements a mini-driver for use with the streaming class driver, applications can bypass the KMixer completely and use the kernel streaming interfaces instead to reduce latency.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team recognised {{the differences}} between creating a game for the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation 3. Lovegrove said that designing the game for the Vita's smaller screen {{made it easier to}} develop, alleviating [...] "old problems" [...] with designing a game targeted for an HD screen, but the studio had to ensure that the game could run at any resolution. Roberts agreed, saying that [...] "it [...] less of a headache for artists" [...] who wanted to tweak lighting effects. Asked about major differences between the PlayStation 3's RSX Reality Synthesizer graphics processing unit (GPU) and the PlayStation Vita's ARM architecture, Roberts said that the [...] "most obvious" [...] difference was the Vita's lack of <b>stream</b> <b>processing</b> units (SPU). He said that most of Wipeout HD SPU code was directed towards GPU support, which included features such as geometry culling, lighting effects and rendering. According to Roberts, the Vita's GPU and ARM architecture were more capable and handled Wipeout 2048 [...] "very well". Lovegrove, who had worked with ARM architecture on the BBC Micro, said that the team did not have to optimise anything to accomplish their goals and it was enjoyable to see the same architecture running the game.|$|E

In this paper, we propose an intermediary framework with multiple cloud environments to provide streaming big data computing service with lower cost per load, {{in which a}} cloud service intermediary rents the cloud service from multiple cloud providers and provides <b>streaming</b> <b>processing</b> service to the users with multiple service interfaces. In this framework, we also propose a pricing strategy to maximize the revenue of the multiple cloud intermediaries.
