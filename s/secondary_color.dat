25|$|When {{one of the}} {{components}} has the strongest intensity, the color is a hue near this primary color (reddish, greenish or bluish), and when two components have the same strongest intensity, then the color is a hue of a <b>secondary</b> <b>color</b> (a shade of cyan, magenta or yellow). A <b>secondary</b> <b>color</b> is formed by the sum of two primary colors of equal intensity: cyan is green+blue, magenta is red+blue, and yellow is red+green. Every <b>secondary</b> <b>color</b> is the complement of one primary color; when a primary and its complementary <b>secondary</b> <b>color</b> are added together, the result is white: cyan complements red, magenta complements green, and yellow complements blue.|$|E

For a period early in their history, the team used a kit similar to FC Barcelona's, but after a series of losses in that uniform, the team president swore never to wear those colors again. In the 1940s, yellow was introduced, and would eventually become the team's primary color, replacing white altogether; black would become the <b>secondary</b> <b>color,</b> used in their alternate kit.|$|E
25|$|Lettered {{companies}} (troops and {{batteries in}} the cavalry and field artillery respectively) of battalions (squadrons in the cavalry) have guidons displaying the branch insignia, the company letter, and the battalion and regimental numbers. The base {{color of the}} guidon is the first named color of the applicable branch, e.g. scarlet for field artillery, with the letters, numerals and insignia applied in the second named color of the branch, e.g. yellow for field artillery. For companies of separate battalions, the branch insignia is centered on the guidon between the battalion number above and the company letter below. For companies of battalions of regiments, the number above the insignia {{is that of the}} regiment; the number of the battalion is vertically centered between the insignia and the hoist. Groups use diagonal stripes of the branch's <b>secondary</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2000–2001 season {{brought to}} an end to Bob Costas' direct role with the NBA on NBC (although Costas would work playoff games {{for the next two}} seasons and would return to host NBC's {{coverage}} for the 2002 NBA Finals). Costas deferred to Marv Albert, allowing Albert to again be the lead broadcaster for the NBA, and stayed on only to deliver interviews and special features. On the studio front, Hannah Storm left her position as studio host to go on maternity leave, with Ahmad Rashād taking over for Storm; Isiah Thomas left NBC to become coach of the Indiana Pacers. Joining Ahmad Rashād were former Phoenix Suns player Kevin Johnson and former NBA coach P. J. Carlesimo. Marv Albert joined Doug Collins as the primary broadcast team, and the two broadcast the 2001 NBA Finals, which had the highest ratings for a Finals match since 1998. After the season, Collins was hired away from NBC by the Washington Wizards, which forced the network to move the longtime <b>secondary</b> <b>color</b> duo of Steve Jones and Bill Walton to the lead broadcast team with Albert.|$|E

25|$|Critics, {{such as the}} American Council of the Blind, {{note that}} U.S. bills are {{relatively}} hard to tell apart: they use very similar designs, they are printed in the same colors (until the 2003 banknotes, in which a faint <b>secondary</b> <b>color</b> was added), {{and they are all}} the same size. The American Council of the Blind has argued that American paper currency design should use increasing sizes according to value and/or raised or indented features to make the currency more usable by the vision-impaired, since the denominations cannot currently be distinguished from one another non-visually. Use of Braille codes on currency is not considered a desirable solution because (1) these markings would only be useful to people who know how to read Braille, and (2) one Braille symbol can become confused with another if even one bump is rubbed off. Though some blind individuals say that they have no problems keeping track of their currency because they fold their bills in different ways or keep them in different places in their wallets, they nevertheless must rely on sighted people or currency-reading machines to determine the value of each bill before filing it away using the system of their choice. This means that no matter how organized they are, blind people still have to trust sighted people or machines each time they receive US banknotes.|$|E

2500|$|By 1950, Green Bay {{had changed}} its colors to hunter green and gold. Navy blue was kept as a <b>secondary</b> <b>color,</b> seen {{primarily}} on sideline capes, but was quietly dropped on all official materials shortly thereafter.

No significant changes took place in the design of the logo except for the replacement of colour yellow with gold from 2009. This logo also had a dotted white circle around the RC emblem. The team also uses an alternate logo for the Game for Green matches where the green plants surround the logo and the text Game for Green is placed below the logo. The logo was redesigned in 2016 with the inclusion of black as a <b>secondary</b> <b>color.</b> The lion emblem in the crest was enlarged and the shield was omitted in the new design.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, an {{ownership}} {{group led}} by Paul Brown was granted a franchise in the American Football League. Brown named the team the Bengals in order [...] "to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati". Another Bengals team had existed {{in the city and}} played in three previous American Football Leagues from 1937 to 1942. The city's world-renowned zoo was also home to a rare white Bengal tiger. However, possibly as an insult to Art Modell, or possibly as a homage to his own start as a head coach to the Massillon Tigers, Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the <b>secondary</b> <b>color.</b> Brown chose a very simple logo: the word [...] "BENGALS" [...] in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 and which is still in use to this day; however, that design featured yellow stripes on a turquoise helmet which were more uniform in width.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} other {{techniques}} use mixtures of differently colored probes. A range of colors in mixtures of fluorescent dyes can be detected, so each human chromosome can be identified by a characteristic color using whole-chromosome probe mixtures {{and a variety of}} ratios of colors. Although there are more chromosomes than easily distinguishable fluorescent dye colors, ratios of probe mixtures can be used to create <b>secondary</b> <b>colors.</b> Similar to comparative genomic hybridization, the probe mixture for the <b>secondary</b> <b>colors</b> is created by mixing the correct ratio of two sets of differently colored probes for the same chromosome. This technique is sometimes called M-FISH.|$|R

5000|$|The same physics {{that make}} {{a variety of colors}} {{possible}} for M-FISH can be used for the detection of translocations. That is, colors that are adjacent appear to overlap; a <b>secondary</b> <b>color</b> is observed. Some assays are designed so that the <b>secondary</b> <b>color</b> will be present or absent in cases of interest. An example is the detection of BCR/ABL translocations, where the <b>secondary</b> <b>color</b> indicates disease. This variation is often called double-fusion FISH or D-FISH. In the opposite situation—where the absence of the <b>secondary</b> <b>color</b> is pathological—is illustrated by an assay used to investigate translocations where only one of the breakpoints is known or constant. Locus-specific probes are made for one side of the breakpoint and the other intact chromosome. In normal cells, the <b>secondary</b> <b>color</b> is observed, but only the primary colors are observed when the translocation occurs. This technique is sometimes called [...] "break-apart FISH".|$|E
