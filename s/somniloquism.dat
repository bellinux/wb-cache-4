40|$|A prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, {{controlled}} {{clinical trial}} was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and safety of the homeopathic product ZinCyp- 3 - 02 in children with sleep disorders for >= one month compared to glycine. Children <= six years old received either ZinCyp- 3 - 02 (N = 89) or comparator glycine (N = 90). After treatment for 28 days, total sleep-disorder-associated complaints severity scores decreased in both groups from median 7. 0 (out of maximum 11. 0) points to 2. 0 (ZinCyp- 3 - 02) and 4. 0 (glycine) points, respectively, with overall higher odds of showing improvement for ZinCyp- 3 - 02 (odds ratio: 4. 45 (95 % CI: 2. 77 - 7. 14), p < 0. 0001, POM overall treatment related effect). Absence of individual complaints (time to sleep onset, difficulties maintaining sleep, sleep duration, troubled sleep (<b>somniloquism),</b> physical inactivity after awakening, restlessness for unknown reason, and sleep disorders frequency) at study end were significantly higher with ZinCyp- 3 - 02 (all p values < 0. 05). More children with ZinCyp- 3 - 02 were totally free of complaints (p = 0. 0258). Treatment effectiveness (p < 0. 0001) and satisfaction assessments (p < 0. 0001) were more favorable for ZinCyp- 3 - 02. Few nonserious adverse drug reactions were reported (ZinCyp- 3 - 02 : N = 2, glycine: N = 1) and both treatments were well tolerated. Treatment with the homeopathic product ZinCyp- 3 - 02 was found to be safe and superior to the comparator glycine in the treatment of sleep disorders in children...|$|E
