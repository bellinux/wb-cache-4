5|$|Like Pluto, Makemake appears red in {{the visible}} spectrum, and {{significantly}} redder than the surface of Eris (see colour comparison of TNOs). The near-infrared <b>spectrum</b> <b>is</b> marked {{by the presence of}} the broad methane (CH4) absorption bands. Methane is observed also on Pluto and Eris, but its spectral signature is much weaker.|$|E
5|$|Panavision 3D was {{a system}} for {{presenting}} 3-D film in a digital cinema. It was a passive stereoscopic 3D system that utilized spectral comb filters produced using thin-film optics technology. In such systems, the visible <b>spectrum</b> <b>is</b> broken into alternate bands of light that evenly span the entire visible spectrum.|$|E
30|$|Melting {{points were}} {{measured}} with an Electrothermal IA 9100 digital melting point apparatus. Optical rotations were {{measured with a}} JASCO P- 1030 digital polarimeter. UV <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> recorded on an Analytik Jena SPEKOL 1200 spectrophotometer. IR <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> taken on a Bruker ALPHA spectrometer. NMR <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> recorded on a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer. ESITOF mass <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> measured with a Bruker micrOTOF mass spectrometer.|$|R
30|$|NIR <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> {{obtained}} from the cross and radial section of wood blocks and tablet samples for each sample by the NIR integrating sphere diffuse reflectance accessory of the PerkinElmer Spectrum 100  N system (PerkinElmer Co., USA). The <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> collected for wavenumbers of 10, 000 – 4000  cm− 1 at a spectral resolution of 16  cm− 1, and 32 scans were averaged per scan. For wood block samples, 12 <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> acquired on the heartwood and sapwood in cross and radial sections respectively, namely, 48 <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> obtained per sample. For tablet samples, 12 <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> acquired per sample. Thus, 960 and 240 <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> collected from wood block and tablet samples, respectively. Before the multivariate analysis, the original <b>spectrum</b> <b>was</b> second derivatized by Savitzky–Golay filter smoothing to nine points with fifth order function [17].|$|R
30|$|The FTIR <b>spectrum</b> <b>was</b> {{taken in}} the mid-IR region of 400 – 4, 000  cm− 1. The <b>spectrum</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} using ATR (attenuated total reflectance) technique. The dried sample was mixed with the KBr (1 : 200) crystal, and the <b>spectrum</b> <b>was</b> recorded in the transmittance mode.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Spectrum</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} a Zilog Z80 A CPU running at 3.5MHz (or NEC D780C-1 clone). The {{original}} model has 16KB (16×1024 bytes) of ROM and either 16KB or 48KB of RAM. Hardware design was by Richard Altwasser of Sinclair Research, and the outward appearance was designed by Sinclair's industrial designer Rick Dickinson.|$|E
5|$|The defects can be {{detected}} by different types of spectroscopy, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), luminescence induced by light (photoluminescence, PL) or electron beam (cathodoluminescence, CL), and absorption {{of light in the}} infrared (IR), visible and UV parts of the spectrum. Absorption <b>spectrum</b> <b>is</b> used not only to identify the defects, but also to estimate their concentration; it can also distinguish natural from synthetic or enhanced diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Based on spectroscopic observations, {{the primary}} {{component}} of the material on Pallas's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include olivine and pyroxene, which are found in CM chondrules. The surface composition of Pallas {{is very similar to}} the Renazzo carbonaceous chondrite (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type. The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 {{and is one of the}} most primitive meteorites known. Pallas's visible and near-infrared <b>spectrum</b> <b>is</b> almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.|$|E
50|$|Crocetane {{was first}} {{studied in the}} late 1920s and early 1930s for the {{structural}} identification of crocetin, which is its polyunsaturated diacid analogue. The infrared <b>spectrum</b> <b>was</b> reported in 1950, the mass <b>spectrum</b> <b>was</b> described in 1968 and the 1H and 13C NMR <b>spectra</b> <b>was</b> obtained in 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} {{approximate}} point spectrum and residual <b>spectrum</b> <b>are</b> not necessarily disjoint (however, the point spectrum and the residual <b>spectrum</b> <b>are).</b>|$|R
30|$|Absorption <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> {{measured}} using a SPECORD M 40 and an OLIS Cary 14 double beam spectrophotometers. Bare glass plate {{served as a}} reference. Fluorescence <b>spectra</b> <b>were</b> collected using a SPEX Fluorolog 1680 double spectrometer, with a Xe lamp as a light source. The excitation wavelength was selected at 468  nm. Absorption <b>spectra</b> <b>are</b> given below as normalized to their maximum in order to compare their spectral features, and the PL <b>spectra</b> <b>are</b> given corrected for {{the sensitivity of the}} registering system and normalized to the sample absorption at the excitation wavelength, i.e., the PL <b>spectra</b> <b>are</b> presented in terms of the relative QY of the sample emission.|$|R
5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent. This has often been used to {{characterize}} doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened {{the possibility of using}} the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence <b>spectrum</b> <b>is</b> known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It {{is also known}} to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, NASA {{launched}} the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements {{showed that the}} CMB frequency <b>spectrum</b> <b>is</b> an almost perfect blackbody with no deviations {{at a level of}} 1 part in 104, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 105. John C. Mather and George Smoot were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared <b>spectrum</b> <b>is</b> useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the radio galaxy 3C 324. First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The <b>spectrum</b> <b>is</b> unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E
5|$|The {{aspect of}} the {{colouring}} which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the Libyan Sibyl and the Prophet Daniel, which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>is</b> a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, {{there is no such}} gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including the hose of the young man in the Mathan lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.|$|E
