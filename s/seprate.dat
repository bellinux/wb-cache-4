40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{structural}} characterization of {{a new series of}} smectogens the molecules of which contain three distinct parts, a cyanobiphenyl aromatic core, a central paraffin chain and a siloxane endgroup. Incompatible with one another, these parts tend to locate themselves in three <b>seprate</b> sub-layers superposed in a partially bilayered smectic A structure. Because the siloxane endgroups have an important lateral extension as compared with the other two molecular moieties, the head to head association of the cyano endgroups is smaller than usual and the smectic layering of the aromatic cores closer to a single layer arrangement. This behaviour illustrates the necessity for the sub-layers to adapt their internal structure so as to be adequate for superposition...|$|E

In this paper, an automatic method based on FCM clustering and Otsu thresholding is introduced {{in order to}} extract {{quantitative information}} from FMI images. All pixels are clustered using FCM clustering algorithm at the first step. The second step uses KNN for other clustering. Then, uncovered columns of FMI image and image inequality are removed. Finally, the Otsu thresholding method is investigated for improving pixel-clustering step.

The 14 q+ chromosome (in addition to other chromosomal abnormalities) was present in 8 (57 %) of the 14 patients; 6 of these 8 patients had t(8; 14) (q 24;q 32). One of the remaining 2 patients had a # 8 chromosome deleted, whereas the second had 2 normal-appear-ing # 8 chromosomes. Other numerical and structural abnor-malities were frequent. No correlation between type or frequency of abnormality and clinical status or survival was found. Within cells of the same tumor aspirate, the karyotype abnormalities were generally similar.

40|$|Using sheep {{cerebellum}} microsomes previously {{loaded with}} 45 Ca 2 + or 90 Sr 2 +, we measured {{the dependence of}} inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3) -induced efflux of these ions on Ca 2 + or Sr 2 + on the cytosolic side. At a low InsP 3 concentration, Ca 2 + in the submicromolar range only poorly activated 45 Ca 2 + or 90 Sr 2 + efflux, and higher Ca 2 + concentrations were inhibitory. In contrast, Sr 2 + in the micromolar range activated release efficiently, while only very high Sr 2 + concentrations were inhibitory. Experiments were repeated {{in the presence of}} a high InsP 3 concentration, which allowed increasing free Ca 2 + to micromolar concentrations without inducing complete inhibition of the InsP 3 -dependent efflux. Under these conditions, micromolar Ca 2 + was found to activate efflux to a large extent, similar to that previously found with Sr 2 + Optimal activation by Ca 2 + of the InsP 3 -dependent channel occurs at micromolar rather than submicromolar free Ca 2 + concentrations, but at too low an InsP 3 concentration, Ca 2 +-induced activation is counteracted by Ca 2 +-induced inactivation. <b>Seprate</b> measurements of [3 H]-InsP 3 binding at a low concentration showed that Sr 2 + and Ca 2 + did not enhance the amount of bound [3 H]-InsP 3, implying that the activating effect of Sr 2 + and Ca 2 + in cerebellar microsomes is mediated by an increase in the channel opening probability and not by an increase in the receptor's affinity for InsP 3. A similar relationship also holds in the case of the activating effect of nucleotides. © 1995. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Although {{echocardiography}} is {{ideally suited}} for repetitive use on a patient {{for evaluation of}} left ventricular function, {{the value of this}} application is minimised by the uncertainty as to whether changes in left ventricular dimensions observed on a patient at different times or by different observers are real or result from the ultrasonic beam penetrating the left ventricle at different angles. Accordingly, an instrument was designed and constructed in our laboratory to improve the reproducibility of echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular dimensions. The instrument represents an orthogonal reference frame by means of which the spatial orientation of the ultrasonic beam relative to the chest is determined and reproduced in subsequent studies, while the point of entrance of the beam is marked on the chest wall. Using this instrument, left ventricular echograms were initially recorded on a group (I) of 23 subjects with or without heart disease and the study was repeated 8 hours to 49 (mean 7) days later by the same observer and also, in 16 cases, by an independent observer. The average values from 2 to 6 (mean 4) heart cycles were used for the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (Dd), end-systolic (Ds) dimension, and their difference (delta D). Differences in all three variables between studies were random and statistically insignificant, never exceeding 3 - 5 mm for Dd or Ds, and 4 mm for deltaD. For comparison, left ventricular internal dimensions were also obtained in a <b>seprate</b> group (II) of 14 subjects by the standard method of using the mitral valve as an internal landmark, without the benefit of this instrument. All 14 subjects had the initial study repeated within 8 hours to 11 (mean 3 - 8) days later by the same and also by an independent observer. Though in the group as a whole {{there was no significant difference}} in left ventricular dimensions between studies, individual variations reached 11 mm for Dd, 9 mm for Ds, and 9 mm for deltaD, and the degree of scatter was significantly larger than in group I. This initial experience indicates that the use of this instrument improves the reproducibility and enhances the reliability of estimates of echocardiographic left ventricular dimensions and function on a patient examined at different times by the same or independent observers...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{several questions}} on the computational power of PP, the class of sets accepted by polynomial time-bounded probabilistic Turing machines with two-sided unbounded error probability. In particular, we consider the questions whether PP is as powerful as PSPACE and whether PP is more powerful than PH (the polynomial-time hierarchy). These questions have remained open. In fact, only a few results have been shown even in the relativized case. In the present paper {{we deal with the}} above questions {{in a manner similar to}} Long (1985), Balcázar (1986), and Long and Selman (1986). We introduce a quantitative restriction on access to a given oracle for probabilistic oracle machines. The restriction, denoted as PRR(·), allows polynomial time-bounded probabilistic oracle machines to query only polynomially many positive strings but exponentially many negative strings in its computation tree. We show that for every oracle A that PPR(NP) (A) is included in PP(A). This strengthens the result shown recently by Biegel (1989). In fact, we have their result as an immediate consequence. We next show some positive relativization results on the above questions. We show that <b>seprating</b> PP from PSPACE with some sparse oracle implies the separation of PP from PSPACE in the nonrelativized case. We also show that separating PP from PH with some sparse oracle implies the separation in the nonrelativized case. We also compare D # P and with PH. In particular, we show that D # P = PH iff D # (S) = PH (S) for some sparse oracle set S. Thus, the inequality D # P ≠ PH can also be relativized for all sparse oracle sets...|$|R
