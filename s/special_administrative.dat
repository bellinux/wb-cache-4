5|$|Hong Kong {{used to be}} a British colony {{with the}} {{perpetual}} cession of Hong Kong Island from the Qing Empire after the First Opium War (1839–1842). The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and acquired a 99-year lease of the New Territories from 1898. Hong Kong was later occupied by Japan during the Second World War until British control resumed in 1945. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed between the United Kingdom and China in 1984 paved way for the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, when it became a <b>special</b> <b>administrative</b> region of the People's Republic of China {{with a high degree of}} autonomy.|$|E

5|$|On 1 July 1997, the {{transfer}} of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China took place, officially marking the end of Hong Kong's 156 years under British colonial governance. As the largest remaining colony of the United Kingdom, the loss of Hong Kong effectively represented {{the end of the}} British Empire. This transfer of sovereignty made Hong Kong the first <b>special</b> <b>administrative</b> region of China. Tung Chee-Hwa, a pro-Beijing business tycoon, was elected Hong Kong's first Chief Executive by a selected electorate of 800 in a televised programme.|$|E
5|$|The British Nationality Act 1981 {{reclassified}} Hong Kong into a British Dependent Territory {{amid the}} reorganisation of global territories of the British Empire. All residents of Hong Kong became British Dependent Territory Citizens (BDTC). Diplomatic negotiations began with China and eventually concluded with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. Both countries agreed to transfer Hong Kong's sovereignty to China on 1 July 1997, when Hong Kong would remain autonomous as a <b>special</b> <b>administrative</b> region {{and be able}} to retain its free-market economy, British common law through the Hong Kong Basic Law, independent representation in international organisations (e.g. WTO and WHO), treaty arrangements and policy-making except foreign diplomacy and military defence.|$|E
5|$|Other flags {{used in the}} People's Republic of China use a red {{background}} to symbolize the revolution {{in conjunction with other}} symbols. The flag of the People's Liberation Army uses the gold star with the Chinese characters 8-1 (for 1 August, the date of the PLA's founding). The flag of the Communist Party of China replaces all of the stars with the party emblem. Due to government regulations, cities and provinces of China cannot have their own flags; the only sub-national flags that exist are those of the Hong Kong and Macau <b>Special</b> <b>Administrative</b> Regions. Despite this, at least two cities have adopted flags after the law was passed. The cities of Kaifeng and Shangrao adopted their flags in March 2006 and March 2009 respectively. This implies that the law is either repealed or not enforced.|$|E

To attract and protect the local Greek Orthodox population, he granted it special privileges, such as <b>special</b> <b>administrative</b> status as a waqf (a religious endowment) of the Sharif of Mecca, tax exemptions and the prohibition of Ottoman troops from passing through the town. He also endowed it with both a mosque (destroyed after the Greek annexation of Thessaly in 1881) and a church, St Nicholas Turahan, which survives to this day. Turahan also endowed many other public buildings such as mosques, monasteries, madrasas, schools, caravanserais, bridges and baths across the province. He also took care to maintain and foster the Thessalian cotton, silk and wool textile industry, to the extent that later generations attributed to him the introduction of new dye techniques based on yellow berries, madder and the kali plant, used in the manufacture of potash.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} time and cost of the principal 2 ̆ 7 s role {{in the administration of}} special education instructional programs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the time and cost as they relate to different exceptionality groups, different delivery service models, and different administrative functions. ^ The population of the study consisted of eighty-four principals from a seven-county area of Southwest Iowa. The instrumentation was designed by the researcher and validated in a pilot study. Principals recorded time spent in <b>special</b> education <b>administrative</b> activities during the months of March and April of 1982. The time was equated on a monetary expenditure based on the average hourly compensation of the participants. A simple one-way analysis of variance yielded significant differences in time and cost factors related to exceptionality groups, delivery service models, and administrative functions. ^ The findings of this study suggest that principals spend 4. 86 hours each week or in excess of eleven percent of their work week in <b>special</b> education <b>administrative</b> activities. When this time is equated with a monetary expenditure, the data would suggest that school districts could expect to expend 74. 45 each week for <b>special</b> education <b>administrative</b> services. The data suggest that principals spend more time in programs for the mentally disabled and learning disabled than they do in programs for the emotionally disabled. There were also significant differences found when mainstreamed programs were compared to self-contained classrooms. In addition, the data suggest that principals devote the majority of their time to the administrative functions of conferences with professional staff, conferences with parents, and written work. ^ The recommendations from this study would indicate a need for replication in multiple settings to develop a body of findings that can be examined for general implications. The issues of principal efficiency and the full range of special education administration costs need to be explored. Traditional funding procedures may need to be reconsidered. A final recommendation would involve the importance of cost analysis in comparing local expenditures to state and federal procedures. ...|$|R
