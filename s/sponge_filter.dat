25|$|Sponge {{filters and}} corner filters (sometimes called box filters) work by {{essentially}} the same mechanism as an internal filter. Both generally work by airlift, using bubbles from an air pump rising in a tube to create flow. In a <b>sponge</b> <b>filter,</b> the inlet may only be covered by a simple open-cell block of foam. A corner filter is slightly more complex. These filters are often placed in the corner {{on the bottom of}} the aquarium. Water enters slits in the box, passes through a layer of medium, then exits through the airlift tube to return to the aquarium. These filters tend to only be suitable for small and lightly stocked aquaria. The <b>sponge</b> <b>filter</b> is especially useful for rearing fry where the sponge prevents the small fish from entering the filter.|$|E

50|$|The {{methods of}} {{spawning}} this {{fish in the}} aquarium is similar to spawning most other Corydoras species. The spawning tank can be as small as 2.5 gallons (10 L), but at least a 5-gallon (20 L) tank is recommended with aged water, a <b>sponge</b> <b>filter</b> and some plants. Fish should be conditioned with large amounts of live foods such as Tubifex and whiteworms, during which time the females will become noticeably plumper. Since C. hastatus may spawn as a school, the whole group can be conditioned for spawning at the same time, and for best results, there {{should be at least}} two males for every female.|$|E

Three visible filamentous algae were sampled from scrapings taken from microbial mats submerged beneath the water surface. Approximately 90 l of water from the Great Bath was filtered through a custom-made filter-stack at 3 positions around the Great Bath (the water entry point, exit point and opposite). The custom filter stack comprised of an acrylic tube with a coarse 3 mm mesh metal filter, a <b>sponge</b> <b>filter</b> and a Whatman GF fine filter paper.

These are most often of the greenish-brown variety, but the red variant is fairly common among enthusiasts. Captive Triops are frequently kept in aquariums and fed a diet consisting mainly of carrots, shrimp pellets and dried shrimp. Often they are also given living shrimp and daphnia as live prey. Because they can feed on just about anything, they are also fed lunch meat, potatoes, crackers, etc. They will often feed themselves by grazing on algae and other grunge from the bottom and sides of the tank and on small particles clinging to <b>sponge</b> <b>filters</b> or to Marimo moss balls, which are often cultured alongside Triops.|$|R
40|$|Sponges are {{suspension}} feeders {{that use}} flagellated collar-cells (choanocytes) to actively filter {{a volume of}} water equivalent to many times their body volume each hour. Flow through sponges {{is thought to be}} enhanced by ambient current, which induces a pressure gradient across the sponge wall, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Studies of sponge filtration have estimated the energetic cost of pumping to be 0. 75) with the ambient current velocity. During short bursts of high ambient current the <b>sponges</b> <b>filtered</b> two-thirds of the total volume of water they processed daily. Our model indicates that the head loss across the <b>sponge</b> collar <b>filter</b> is 10 times higher than previously estimated. The difference is due to the resistance created by a fine protein mesh that lines the collar, which demosponges also have, but was so far overlooked. Applying our model to the in situ measurements indicates that even modest pumping rates require an energetic expenditure of at least 28 % of the total in situ respiration. We suggest that due to the high cost of pumping, current-induced flow is highly beneficial but may occur only in thin walled sponges living in high flow environments. Our results call for a new look at the mechanisms underlying current-induced flow and for reevaluation of the cost of biological pumping and its evolutionary role, especially in sponges...|$|R
40|$|Genomic and transcriptomic {{analyses}} {{show that}} sponges possess a large repertoire of genes associated with neuronal processes in other animals, {{but what is}} the evidence these are used in a coordination or sensory context in sponges? The very different phylogenetic hypotheses under discussion today suggest very different scenarios for the evolution of tissues and coordination systems in early animals. The sponge genomic 'toolkit' either reflects a simple, pre-neural system used to protect the <b>sponge</b> <b>filter</b> or represents the remnants of a more complex signalling system and sponges have lost cell types, tissues and regionalization to suit their current suspensionfeeding habit. Comparative transcriptome data can be informative but need to be assessed in the context of knowledge of sponge tissue structure and physiology. Here, I examine the elements of the sponge neural toolkit including sensory cells, conduction pathways, signalling molecules and the ionic basis of signalling. The elements described do not fit the scheme of a loss of sophistication, but seem rather to reflect an early specialization for suspension feeding, which fits with the presumed ecological framework in which the first animals evolved...|$|E
40|$|Fibrous and <b>sponge</b> <b>filtering</b> media {{usually have}} complex microstructures. In all applications, the {{morphology}} of the filtering media influences its performance {{in one way}} or another. This is especially true for surface activated filtering media. Understanding the flow, transport and reaction/adsorption processes at the pore scale is important for explaining and interpreting the overall performance of such filtering media. In certain cases an effective media approach, which accounts for the membrane morphology in an average way (e. g., via porosity) can provide useful information. However, increasing the filtration efficiency needs a more detailed knowledge {{of the impact of the}} microstructure. Mathematical modelling and computer simulations are useful approaches, supporting researchers and manufacturers in their work on designing better filtering media and on selecting appropriate ones for a particular application. Here we present simulation results for sponge functionalized membranes and for surface activated fibrous web. Navier-Stokes equations are used to describe the flow, the solute/contaminant transport is described by a convection-diffusion equation with reactive boundary conditions. The surface adsorption/reaction is modeled with Henry or Langmuir isotherms. Results from computer simulations are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Filter {{feeding of}} microalgae {{is known to}} be a source of {{nutrients}} in sponges, but the relationship between <b>sponge</b> morphology and <b>filter</b> feeding rates have not been investigated. The demosponges Haliclona ecbasis, Ophlitaspongia pennata, and Mycale hispida of class Demospongiae are commonly found in the San Juan Islands, and were used in a comparison study of <b>sponge</b> morphology and <b>filter</b> feeding rates. <b>Sponge</b> samples were collected from two sites, one intertidal and one subtidal, and were treated with a microalgae monoculture of Nannochloropsis. Water samples were taken at regular intervals and measured by spectrophotometer at λ 440 nm for absorbance. Post ANOVA statistical analysis samples from the intertidal site were found to not show any variance within species at any collection point. Specimens from the subtidal site failed to produce conclusive data possibly due to contamination of sponges by other organisms inhabiting the sponges or weakness in the methodology. Therefore, the results of this study conclude that the three species Haliclona ecbasis, Ophlitaspongia pennata, and Mycale hispida of class Demospongiae may not have significantly different filter feeding efficiencies even though each species exhibit different morphotypes...|$|R

Culturable heterotrophic bacteria (22 °C), total culturable bacteria (37 °C) and vibrios densities were measured on marine agar 2216, plate count agar and TCBS agar, respectively. Total and fecal coliforms, as well as fecal streptococci, were determined by the most probable number method (MPN). H. perlevis was able to accumulate all of the six microbiological groups. Bacterial groups differed in their resistance to digestion by H. perlevis.

40|$|Marine sponges {{are known}} to host large and diverse {{microbial}} communities, with densities as high as 10 ^ 8 cells/mL representing 15 bacterial phyla. These bacteria are suggested {{to play an important}} role in the metabolism of the host sponge. These <b>sponges</b> feed by <b>filtering</b> microorganisms out of vast amounts of water. As a result of this <b>filtering,</b> <b>sponges</b> very effectively integrate their environment. Given this pumping ability and the sensitivity of the bacterial communities to even minute environmental changes, sponges are excellent candidates as biological indicators of environmental degradation in their habitat. In order to determine the effects of varying nutrient levels on sponges and their associated microbial communities, we placed nutrient addition devices (NAD) at Netarts Bay in Netarts, Oregon for six weeks to increase the nutrient load. To assess sponge abundance and diversity we analyzed video transects, and we assessed bacterial abundance and diversity using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and examining bacterial DNA extracted from sponge tissue samples using gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), respectively. In addition, we collected ambient and exhalent water samples in order to assess the nutrient flux through the sponge. We found a significant decrease in sponge abundance and a decrease in bacterial diversity after six weeks of treatment. In addition, we found significant changes in nitrate and total nitrogen fluxes between control and NAD treated sponges, suggesting that bacterially-mediated nitrogen cycling was significantly modified by the nutrient addition. Thus, increased nutrient loads appear to detrimentally affect sponges and their associated microbial communities. As sponge communities seem to show a predictable response to excess nitrogen, they remain excellent candidates for use as bioindicators...|$|R
