40|$|Ceramic fibers for {{high-tech}} applications require intensive developments concerning precursor synthesis {{and fiber}} spinning. The spinning process starts at laboratory scale with only few filaments {{and needs to}} be upscaled to pilot plant and industrial scale with hundreds or even thousands of filaments. Due to the significant interaction of filaments and surrounding inert atmosphere, the behavior in the <b>spinning</b> <b>tower</b> completely changes with higher numbers of filaments. How these effects are incorporated in a model of the gas flow including its influence by the filament spinning will be described. In 2 examples for melt- and dry-spinning of ceramic fibers it will be demonstrated how characteristic properties derived from experiments on a laboratory scale can be efficiently transferred to a pilot plant scale by use of simulations. For both applications the <b>spinning</b> <b>tower</b> was built according to the conditions derived from the simulation results, and experimentally proven to work...|$|E
40|$|I review {{recent work}} on massive higher (s> 1) spins in {{constant}} curvature (deSitter) spaces. Some {{of the novel}} properties that emerge are: partial masslessness and new local gauge invariances, unitarily forbidden ranges of mass, correlation between fermions/bosons and nagative/positive cosmological constant Λ and finally the consistency requirement that {{in the limit of}} infinite <b>spin</b> <b>towers,</b> Λ must tend to zero. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1989, Lieb proved two theorems {{about the}} Hubbard model. One {{showed that the}} ground state of the {{attractive}} model was a spin singlet state ($S= 0 $), was unique, and was positive definite. The other showed that the ground state of the repulsive model on a bipartite lattice at half-filling has a total spin given by $|(N_A-N_B) / 2 |$, corresponding to the difference {{of the number of}} lattice sites on the two sublattices divided by two. In the mid to late 1990 's, Shen extended these proofs to show that the pseudospin of the attractive model was minimal until the electron number equaled $ 2 N_A$ where it became fixed at $J=|(N_A-N_B) / 2 |$ until the filling became $ 2 N_B$, where it became minimal again. In addition, Shen showed that a <b>spin</b> <b>tower</b> exists for the spin eigenstates for the half-filled case on a bipartite lattice. The <b>spin</b> <b>tower</b> says the minimal energy state with spin $S$ is higher in energy than the minimal energy state with spin $S- 1 $ until we reach the ground-state spin given above. One long standing conjecture about this model remains, namely does the attractive model have such a <b>spin</b> <b>tower</b> for all fillings, which would then imply that the repulsive model has minimal pseudopsin in its ground state. While we do not prove this last conjecture, we provide a quick review of this previous work, provide a constructive proof of the pseudospin of the attractive model ground state, and describe the challenges with proving the remaining open conjecture.

40|$|We {{consider}} the one-parameter generalization S^ 4 _q of 4 -sphere with a conical singularity due to identification τ=τ + 2 π q in one isometric angle. We compute {{the value of}} the spectral zeta-function at zero z(q) = ζ(0, q) that controls the coefficient of the logarithmic UV divergence of the one-loop partition function on S^ 4 _q. While {{the value of the}} conformal anomaly a-coefficient is proportional to z(1), we argue that in general the second c = C_T anomaly coefficient is related to a particular combination of the second and first derivatives of z(q) at q= 1. The universality of this relation for C_T is supported also by examples in 6 and 2 dimensions. We use it to compute the c-coefficient for conformal higher spins finding that it coincides with the "r=- 1 " value of the one-parameter Ansatz suggested in arXiv: 1309. 0785. Like the sums of a_s and c_s coefficients, the regularized sum of z_s(q) over the whole tower of conformal higher spins s= 1, 2, [...] . is found to vanish, implying UV finiteness on S^ 4 _q and thus also the vanishing of the associated Re'nyi entropy. Similar conclusions are found to apply to the standard 2 -derivative massless higher <b>spin</b> <b>tower.</b> We also present an independent computation of the full set of conformal anomaly coefficients of the 6 d Weyl graviton theory defined by a particular combination of the three 6 d Weyl invariants that has a (2, 0) supersymmetric extension.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{spectrum of}} D = 6, N = 4 b supergravity with n tensor multiplets compactified on AdS 3 × S 3 is determined. The D = 6 theory {{obtained from the}} K 3 compactification of Type IIB string requires that n = 21, but we let n be arbitrary. The superalgebra that underlies the symmetry of the resulting supergravity theory in AdS 3 coupled to matter is SU(1, 1 | 2) L × SU(1, 1 | 2) R. The theory also has an unbroken global SO(4) R × SO(n) symmetry inherited from D = 6. The spectrum of states arranges itself into a <b>tower</b> of <b>spin</b> 2 supermultiplets, a <b>tower</b> of <b>spin</b> 1, SO(n) singlet supermultiplets, a <b>tower</b> of <b>spin</b> 1 supermultiplets in the vector representation of SO(n) and a special spin 1 2 supermultiplet also in the vector representation of SO(n).

50|$|The {{middle point}} of the Dutch grid {{reference}} system is situated in the tower. From origin the <b>tower</b> <b>spin</b> {{was the middle of}} the grid with x = 0 and y = 0. This grid system was set up in the period 1885-1904. The coördinates where also called Amersfoort coördinates. The Zero-point was moved in the period 1960-1978, it moved 155 km Westwards and 463 km Southwards (120 km Southeast of Paris, 1 km East of La Celle-Saint-Cyr). The coördinates of the middle point since then are X = 155 000, Y = 463 000. Advantage of this new Zero-point is that there are no negative coördinates anymore and the X values differ from the Y values so mistakes shall not occur anymore.|$|R
50|$|Taipei 101, {{like many}} of its neighbours, shows the {{influence}} of feng shui philosophy. An example appears {{in the form of}} a large granite fountain at the intersection of Songlian Road and Xinyi Road near the tower's east entrance. A ball at the fountain's top <b>spins</b> toward the <b>tower.</b> As a work of public art the fountain offers a contrast to the tower in texture even as its design echoes the tower's rhythms. The fountain also serves a practical function in feng shui philosophy. A T intersection near the entrance of a building represents a potential drain of positive energy, or ch'i, from a structure and its occupants. Placing flowing water at such spots is thought to help redirect the flow of ch'i.|$|R
5000|$|In 1956 WDR {{broadcaster}} {{established the}} first shortwave transmitter near Mersch, and {{in subsequent years}} this site was expanded. On 1 September 1961 this site was {{handed over to the}} Deutsche Bundespost (German Federal Post) to establish the German foreign broadcasting service, [...] "Deutsche Welle". In time 10 transmitters of 100 kilowatts were installed. These were transmitting antennas with enormous dipole arrays between free standing steel framework towers which were installed. Today these transmitters are rented predominantly to non-German broadcasting organisations. In the 1990s a mediumwave transmitter was installed on the site, using a long wire antenna which is <b>spun</b> at a <b>tower</b> on the transmitter site. It was intended to be used for transmission of the programmes of [...] "Radio Viva" [...] on 702 kHz, but it never went into regular service for this broadcaster.

5000|$|Calling Noir a “melodic genius”, The Guardian‘s Dave Simpson {{described}} the album as “a {{cross between a}} classic 1960s album and half-forgotten children's TV themes”, “rich {{in the sort of}} melodies you'd think went out with Simon and Garfunkel and Smile-era Beach Boys.” In similar vein, PopMatters’ Dan Raper {{described the}} album as “sophisticated pop music with broad appeal” that “hums with 60s pop brilliantine and a slightly uncomfortable childhood nostalgia”. Speaking about notable influences on the album, Raper wrote that “Jim Noir casually allows the history of pop music to inform his arrangements; luckily, he never allows them to overwhelm his natural sense of melody. Somehow, these sweet songs still sound fresh.” He further praised the album for retaining “a sunny optimism that’s difficult to resist. For that reason alone Tower of Love is worth a listen.” In his review, Allmusic’s Tim Sendra especially noted the album’s “catchy and richly constructed tunes”, predicting that listeners “will be hard-pressed to keep from walking around all day grinning like a fish once you give the album an airing. In fact, doctors should prescribe a <b>spin</b> of <b>Tower</b> of Love to chase the blues away. The only problem with the record is that it paints Noir into a corner, as {{it will be hard to}} top.” In his review, Drowned In Sound’s Dom Gourlay concluded that “although not strictly an album in that it wasn't created for the purpose of such ..., it still wipes the floor with most other albums of a similar genre released this, or indeed any other year in the last ten. … Tower Of Love is a tasty entree that merely whets the appetite for the first album proper.” ...|$|R
500|$|The cables were spun on-site using a reel {{because of}} the {{problems}} which had arisen using a bundle on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark. This also allowed for cost savings, as the reels could be used two times. The cables were spun using air spinning with controlled tension, which allowed spinning with little space and with a crew with limited spinning experience. This involved installing a carrier which shuttles forward and back over the catwalk; it spins the upper side of the cable in the one direction and the lower side in the other direction. The system has two reel racks, each with four reels of wire. Each rack only uses one reel at a time, allowing for minimum down-time when changing reels. Wires were connected using pressure casing. The balance in the system is kept in place using a counterbalance <b>tower.</b> <b>Spinning</b> of the main cable started on 2 March 2000 and was concluded on 14 April. In all [...] of steel wire were used to create the cables. The two bridges were {{the first time that}} on-site spinning was chosen in Norway, and it gave a cost saving of NOK10 to 11 million.|$|R
50|$|Amanda Thompson, Geoffrey's eldest {{daughter}} and {{a director of the}} park for over 15 years took over the whole Pleasure Beach business. Nicholas Thompson became the Deputy managing director and Fiona Giljé (née Thompson), a fundamental architect became a senior company director. Amanda had previously risen to prominence as the founder and president of Stageworks Worldwide Productions, which produced numerous high-profile shows at both the Pleasure Beach and across the world. Like her father and grandmother, Amanda was appointed an OBE for her contribution to tourism. During Amanda's reign, the park has seen vast redevlopment, including the introduction of mass branding, as well as the removal of numerous rides including The Whip, Space Invader 2, Turtle Chase, <b>Spin</b> Doctor, Trauma <b>Towers,</b> Noah's Ark, Black Hole, Bling and Super Bowl. In 2005, the family decided to close Pleasureland Southport which despite extensive investment and development had not turned a profit for several years. This move coincided with the closure of Pleasure Beach's Log Flume, Drench Falls and resulted in the introduction of Infusion, the park's first new roller coaster in 13 years. Infusion was relocated from Pleasureland, where it had operated under the name of Traumatizer since 1999, and was built {{on the site of the}} Log Flume.|$|R

The proposed VTP200 would be a 200 metre tall [...] "VerTiPlex", the tallest observation tower in Britain, has been designed by RTKL to be a [...] "bold and dynamic icon for Birmingham and the West Midlands in the 21st Century". The tower would consist of three rides including an eight-person vertical drop free falling lift, a see-saw peering over the edge of the tower at 125 meters high and 20 flight trainers <b>spinning</b> around the <b>tower</b> 110 meters up it. As well as rides other extreme activities are proposed including a [...] "Walk of fear", the ability to climb to the top of the tower, a sky jump descending 100 metres and the UK's highest controlled bungee jump. In its first year the VTP200 would hope to receive 1.05 million visitors.|$|R
