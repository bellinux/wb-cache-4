ASF virus does not produce any detectable effect on macrophages from humans, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters or rats, whereas ASF virus-infected chicken macrophages show an enhancement of cellular DNA synthesis and an intense cytopathic effect. ASF virus, adapted to grow in VERO cells, produces a strong cytopathic effect in human macrophages leading to cell destruction. This effect is not associated with the synthesis of infectious virus, cellular or virus DNA nor with the formation of detectable virus-related structures...|$|R

40|$|The Exaltation of Newcastle disease virus (END) {{phenomenon}} is {{induced by the}} inhibition of type I interferon in pestivirus-infected cells in vitro, via proteasomal degradation of cellular interferon regulatory factor (IRF) - 3 with {{the property of the}} viral autoprotease protein N-pro. Reportedly, the amino acid residues in the zinc-binding TRASH motif of N-pro determine the difference in characteristics between END-phenomenon-positive (END) and END-phenomenon-negative (END-) classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> <b>viruses</b> (CSFVs). However, the basic mechanism underlying this function in bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has not been elucidated from the genomic differences between END+ and END- viruses using reverse genetics till date. In the present study, comparison of complete genome sequences of a pair of END+ and END- viruses isolated from the same virus stock revealed that there were only four amino acid substitutions (D 136 G, I 2623 V, D 3148 G and D 3502 Y) between two viruses. Based on these differences, viruses with and without mutations at these positions were generated using reverse genetics. The END assay, measurements of induced type I interferon and IRF- 3 detection in cells infected with these viruses revealed that the aspartic acid at position 136 in the zinc-binding TRASH motif of N-pro was required to inhibit the production of type I interferon via the degradation of cellular IRF- 3, consistently with CSFV...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-three pigs {{in three}} groups of nineteen, ten, and four pigs were {{infected}} with three different African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> (ASF) <b>virus</b> isolates, respectively.

Sera collected at various intervals were tested for antibody activity by the immunoelectroosmophoresis, agar gel diffusion precipitin, and complement-fixation tests using a modified Kolmer technique. Results clearly indicated that the immunoelectroosmophoresis test is a rapid (30 minute) and accurate method with extreme sensitivity and superior to the complement-fixation and agar gel diffusion precipitin tests in detecting antibody against ASF virus. Possible use of this method in detecting ASF virus infection is suggested...|$|R

40|$|DNA from African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> (ASF) <b>virus</b> was {{isolated}} and {{was characterized by}} two restriction enzymes, SmaI and EcoRI.

The molecular weight of ASF DNA, based on size estimates of DNA fragments from cleavage patterns, ranged from 93 x 106 to 100 x 106. Virus genome heterogeneity was observed in uncloned, cell culture-adapted ASF isolates as well as in a plaque-purified virus after serial passage in Vero cells.
