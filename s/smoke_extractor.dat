The affected monitor was replaced. This event was classified as INES 0.|$|E

2500|$|The tobacco {{industry}} {{has focused on}} proposing ventilation {{as an alternative to}} smoke-free laws, though this approach has not been widely adopted in the U.S. because [...] "in the end, it is simpler, cheaper, and healthier to end smoking". The Italian smoke-free law ban permits dedicated smoking rooms with automatic doors and <b>smoke</b> <b>extractors.</b> Nevertheless, few Italian establishments are creating smoking rooms due to the additional cost.|$|R
500|$|In 2002, the French car {{manufacturer}} Peugeot designed an electric fire engine with a futuristic appearance. It is a [...] fuel cell battery vehicle {{that is designed}} halfway between a twenty-first century automobile and an ordinary gasoline fire engine. The front part carries two firemen, and the rear is a large water-tank with a ladder on top. The state-of-the-art vehicle makes its own hydrogen and oxygen needed to supply the fuel cell battery that operates the vehicle, water pump, <b>smoke</b> <b>extractors,</b> and electronic equipment.|$|R
50|$|The most {{significant}} {{cause for the}} continuing delays has been the fire protection and alarm system. In the terminal building, the system was not built according to the construction permit, and failed the mandatory acceptance test necessary to open the airport. FBB proposed an interim solution employing up to 700 human fire spotters which the building supervision department of the local Dahme-Spreewald district rejected. Inspectors have uncovered flaws in the wiring, programming {{and implementation of the}} highly complex system designed by Siemens and Bosch which automatically controls sprinklers, <b>smoke</b> <b>extractors</b> and fire doors. For aesthetic reasons, designers decided that the terminal would have smoke extraction ducts in its ceiling, but they would not exhaust on its rooftop. In a fire, smoke would be pumped from the ceiling into a shaft running down and through the basement below the structure, requiring the natural rising behavior of hot air in the shaft to be reversed. Achieving this on the scale necessary for this airport is a unique undertaking and, thus far, this elaborate smoke extraction system has not worked as planned. To meet the acceptance test requirements, large scale reconstruction work of the fire system might be needed.|$|R

5000|$|A {{farmhouse}} {{kitchen is}} an architectural {{term for a}} kitchen room designed for food preparation, dining and a sociable space. Typical of poorer farmhouses throughout the Middle Ages where rooms were limited, wealthier households would separate the smoke of the kitchen from the dining and entertaining areas.
