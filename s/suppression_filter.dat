However, recognition errors {{are likely to be}} produced when background noise surrounds the command spoken into the speech recognition microcontrollers. In this paper, a speech enhancement strategy is proposed to develop noise <b>suppression</b> <b>filters</b> in order to improve the accuracy of speech recognition microcontrollers. It uses a universal estimator, namely a neural network, to enhance the recognition accuracy of microcontrollers by integrating better signals processed by various noise <b>suppression</b> <b>filters,</b> where a global optimization algorithm, namely an intelligent particle swarm optimization, is used to optimize the inbuilt parameters of the neural network in order to maximize accuracy of speech recognition microcontrollers working within noisy environments. The proposed approach overcomes the limitations of the existing noise <b>suppression</b> <b>filters</b> intended to improve recognition accuracy. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated by a speech recognition microcontroller, which is used in electronic products with speech control functions.

5000|$|The camera has a Leica {{designed}} Vario-Summicron of f2.0 aperture, and f 2.8 {{at maximum}} zoom of 3 x. The lens {{was built by}} Panasonic to Leica standards. This lens is also used on the Panasonic DMC-LC5, DMC-L40, Toshiba PDR-M70, and Canon G2-5. The camera itself sold for around $1500 (2011 dollars) of which the lens is estimated to have cost 50% of the total camera cost. A unique feature of the Digilux 1 (and Panasonic DMC-LC5) versus all other Digilux cameras, is that the sensor uses a complementary filter, CMYG rather than the RGB of later models. This filter had two benefits: The range of wavelengths of light captured by the sensor was much greater - it captures about 2/3 of the visible spectrum versus RGB which captures only 1/3 of the visible spectrum, so that the colors, especially reds and blues are more saturated. This is a benefit for landscapes especially. The second benefit is that the CMYG filter allows the passage of twice the photons, so that the camera is inherently 2 x more sensitive to light at the base ISO of 100 - this means that exposure times are half that of a comparable camera with RGB filter array. The camera has a 3 x zoom lens from f2.0 at the widest 35mm equivalent focal length, and f2.8 at the 100 mm equivalent focal length. Compared with modern compact cameras that usually have an f 3.5 - f 5.6 maximum aperture, the Digilux 1 at f 2.8 at 100mm, is 3 f stops faster ( [...] 2 f stops due to f2.8 vs f5.6 and one f stop due to its 2 x sensitivity.) To match exposure time under this focal length at max available aperture requires the second camera to be set to ISO 800 while the Digilux 1 is at ISO 100 cameras side by side.Digilux 1 images are not noise suppressed as much as modern cameras, so it is always necessary to use a noise <b>suppression</b> <b>filter</b> in post processing when shooting above the base ISO of 100. If this is done, then ISO 400 images can be quite acceptable. AT ISO 400 and f 2.0, the exposure times {{will be the same}} as a compact camera with an f 3.5 lens at ISO 2400, and the noise levels on the Digilux 1 will be much less after post-processing.|$|E

However, they have a limitation in common in that recognition errors {{are likely to be}} produced when background noise surrounds the spoken command, thereby creating potential dangers for the disabled if recognition errors exist in the control systems. In this paper, a hybrid noise <b>suppression</b> <b>filter</b> is proposed to interface with the commercial speech recognizers in order to enhance the recognition accuracy under variant noisy conditions. It intends to decrease the recognition errors when the commercial speech recognizers are working under a noisy environment. It is based on a sigmoid function which can effectively enhance noisy speech using simple computational operations, while a robust estimator based on an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system is used to determine the appropriate operational parameters for the sigmoid function in order to produce effective speech enhancement under variant noisy conditions. The proposed hybrid noise <b>suppression</b> <b>filter</b> has the following advantages for commercial speech recognizers: (i) {{it is not possible to}} tune the inbuilt parameters on the commercial speech recognizers in order to obtain better accuracy; (ii) existing noise suppression filters are too complicated to be implemented for real-time speech recognition; and (iii) existing sigmoid function based filters can operate only in a single-noisy condition, but not under varying noisy conditions.

The period- 3 property in exons of eukaryotic gene sequences enables signal processing based time-domain and frequency-domain methods to predict these regions. Identification of the period- 3 regions helps in predicting the gene locations within the billions long DNA sequence of eukaryotic cells. Existing non-parametric filtering techniques are less effective in detecting small exons. This paper presents a Harmonic <b>Suppression</b> <b>filter</b> and parametric Minimum Variance Spectrum estimation technique for gene prediction.
