5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E
5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E

40|$|Three {{dimensionality}} of 3 D pulsed second <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> in He II {{emitted from}} a finite size heater is experimentally investigated and theoretically studied based on two-fluid model in this study. The detailed propagation of 3 D pulsed second <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> is presented and reasonable {{agreement between the}} experimental and theoretical results is obtained. Heater size has a big influence on the profile of 3 D second <b>sound</b> <b>wave.</b> The counterflow between the superfluid and normal fluid components becomes inverse in the rarefaction of 3 D second <b>sound</b> <b>wave.</b> The amplitude of rarefaction decreases due to the interaction between second <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> and quantized vortices, which explains the experimental results about second <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> near [Phys.

5|$|Corythosaurus {{is known}} from many {{complete}} specimens, including the nearly complete holotype found by Brown in 1911. The holotype skeleton is only missing {{the last section}} of the tail, {{and part of the}} forelimbs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. Corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests. The crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a trombone, <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> would travel through many chambers in the crest, and then get amplified when Corythosaurus exhaled. A Corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits: Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the subject began with the {{development}} in the 19th century of wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the Doppler effect. The effect is named after Christian Doppler, who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842. The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> by the Dutch scientist Christophorus Buys Ballot in 1845. Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all waves, and in particular suggested that the varying colors of stars {{could be attributed to}} their motion with respect to the Earth. Before this was verified, however, it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star's temperature, not motion. Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations.|$|E
5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{nonlinear}} <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> equation for a bubbly {{liquid in}} conjunction with an equation for bubble pulsation, we predict and experimentally demonstrate {{the appearance of a}} gap in the frequency spectrum of a <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> propagating in a cavitation cloud comprising bubbles. For bubbles with an ambient radius of 100 μm, the calculations revealed that this gap corresponds to the phenomenon of <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> localization. For bubbles with an ambient radius of 120 μm, this spectral gap relates to a forbidden band of the <b>sound</b> <b>wave.</b> In the experiment, we observed the predicted gap in the frequency spectrum in soda water; however, in tap water, no spectral gap was present because the bubbles were much smaller than 100 μm.

5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his success}} in Sydney, Jackson was tapped to direct the audio design and {{production}} at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directed the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. His sound design for BC Place Stadium did not have loudspeakers at ground level aimed up at the seating areas—Jackson determined that this approach would produce too much uncontrolled reverberation from <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> bouncing off the ceiling. Instead, he configured two rings of loudspeakers {{hung from the ceiling}} 100ft (30m) above the ground, aimed downward. The inner ring held 8 arrays each composed of 12 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers and the outer ring held 12 arrays of 7 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers, augmented by 16 subwoofers. The lot was powered by 160 Lab.gruppen amplifiers which were also hung from the ceiling, and were networked via Dante in a triple-redundant configuration. Two DiGiCo D5 digital mixing consoles served as main and backup for the main audience sound, and two Yamaha PM1Ds handled main and backup duties for monitor mixing. Other equipment included dual-redundant Optocore fibre connections, two Dolby Lake Processors, and time code generated by two pairs of Fairlights which also handled audio cues timed to the action on the field.|$|E
5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E

40|$|Acoustic {{metamaterials}} have exhibited extraordinary possibilities {{to manipulate}} the propagation of the <b>sound</b> <b>wave.</b> Up to now, {{it is still a}} challenge to control the propagation of the <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> in an arbitrary pathway of a network. Here, we design a symmetry breaking cross-shape metamaterial comprised of Helmholtz resonant cells and a square column. The square column is eccentrically arranged. The <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> can quasi-lossless transmit through channels along the eccentric direction with compressed spaces, which breaks through the general transmission phenomenon. This exotic propagation characteristic is verified by the band structure and the mode of the metamaterial. Two acoustic networks, including a 2 x 2 network and an 8 x 8 network, show that the <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> can quasi-lossless propagate along various arbitrary pathways, such as the Great Wall shape, the stair step shape and the serpentine shape, by reconfiguring eccentric directions.
