5|$|On 27 October 1912 Mawson {{outlined}} the summer <b>sledging</b> program. Of the seven <b>sledging</b> parties that would depart from Cape Denison, three would head east. The Eastern Coastal Party, {{led by the}} geologist Cecil Madigan, was charged with exploring beyond the Mertz Glacier tongue; they would initially be supported by the Near Eastern Party led by Frank Stillwell, which would then turn to mapping the area between Cape Denison and the glacier.|$|E
5|$|After Nimrods departure, the sea ice broke up, {{cutting off}} the party's route to the Barrier and thus making preparatory <b>sledging</b> and depot-laying impossible. Shackleton decided to give the {{expedition}} impetus by ordering an immediate attempt to ascend Mount Erebus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the dozen}} years {{following}} the disaster, more than 30 monuments and memorials were set up in Britain alone. These ranged from simple relics (e.g., Scott's <b>sledging</b> flag in Exeter Cathedral) to {{the foundation of the}} Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge. Many more were established {{in other parts of the}} world, including a statue sculpted by Scott's widow for his New Zealand base in Christchurch.|$|E

5|$|Discovery {{departed}} London on 31 July 1901, {{arriving at}} the Antarctic coast, via Cape Town and New Zealand, on 8 January 1902. After landing, Shackleton took part in an experimental balloon flight on 4 February. He also participated, with the scientists Edward Wilson and Hartley Ferrar, in the first <b>sledging</b> trip from the expedition's winter quarters in McMurdo Sound, a journey which established a safe route on to the Great Ice Barrier. During the Antarctic winter of 1902, {{in the confines of}} the iced-in Discovery, Shackleton edited the expedition's magazine The South Polar Times.|$|E
5|$|The expedition, {{named after}} its supply ship, {{was a private}} venture, financed by public {{contributions}} augmented by a government grant. It had further backing from the Admiralty, which released experienced seamen to the expedition, and from the Royal Geographical Society. The expedition's team of scientists carried out a comprehensive scientific programme, while other parties explored Victoria Land and the Western Mountains. An attempted landing and exploration of King EdwardVII Land was unsuccessful. A journey to Cape Crozier in June and July 1911 was the first extended <b>sledging</b> journey {{in the depths of}} the Antarctic winter.|$|E
5|$|Under Hall's command, the Polaris {{departed}} from New York City in June 1871. By October, {{the men were}} wintering {{on the shore of}} northern Greenland, making preparations for the trip to the Pole. Hall returned to the ship from an exploratory <b>sledging</b> journey, and promptly fell ill. Before he died, he accused members of the crew of poisoning him. An exhumation of his body in 1968 revealed that he had ingested a large quantity of arsenic {{in the last two weeks}} of his life.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the <b>sledges.</b> The rear-most <b>sledge,</b> which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, {{and they decided to}} abandon it. The {{remaining}} supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two <b>sledges.</b> Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a <b>sledge</b> down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital <b>sledge.</b> As the rear <b>sledge</b> was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned <b>sledge</b> and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.|$|R
50|$|Daughters of Broadway tap dancer Edwin <b>Sledge</b> (1923-1996) {{and actress}} Florez <b>Sledge</b> (1928-2007), Debbie <b>Sledge</b> (born July 9, 1954), Joni <b>Sledge</b> (September 13, 1956 - March 10, 2017), Kim <b>Sledge</b> (born August 21, 1957) and Kathy <b>Sledge</b> (born January 6, 1959) were given vocal {{training}} by their grandmother Viola Williams, a former lyric soprano opera singer and protégé {{of civil rights}} leader Mary McLeod Bethune. Under Viola’s guidance they regularly sang at their family church, Williams Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal (CME) until forming a band and performing at charity and political events throughout Philadelphia, aptly named ‘Mrs Williams’ Grandchildren’.|$|R
5|$|Auroras {{departure}} from Australia was delayed {{by a series}} of organisational and financial setbacks, and the party did not arrive in McMurdo Sound until 16 January 1915—very late in the season for depot-laying work. Mackintosh, who believed that Shackleton might attempt to cross the continent in that first season, insisted that <b>sledging</b> work should begin without delay, with a view to laying down supply depots at 79° and 80°S. Joyce opposed this; more time, he maintained, should be set aside to acclimatise and train men and dogs. However he was overruled by Mackintosh, who was unaware that Shackleton had ruled out a crossing that season.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was {{inducted}} into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000, in the first annual induction of two players since the inaugural ten members were announced in 1996. In 2009, Harvey was one of the 55 inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. Harvey vociferously called for Shane Warne and Mark Waugh to be banned from cricket after it was revealed that they accepted money from bookmakers to give pitch and weather information and the ACB privately fined them. He lamented the decline in player conduct in the modern era, also criticising the modern advent of <b>sledging.</b>|$|E
5|$|The expedition's {{scientific}} staff {{consisted of}} six persons, including Bruce. The zoologist was David Wilton who, like Bruce, {{had been a}} member of the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition. He had acquired skiing and <b>sledging</b> skills during several years living in northern Russia. Robert Rudmose-Brown, of University College, Dundee, and formerly an assistant in the Botany Department at the British Museum, was the party's botanist. Dr James Harvie Pirie, who had worked in the Challenger office under John Murray, was geologist, bacteriologist, and the expedition's medical officer. Robert Mossman directed meteorological and magnetic work, and Alastair Ross, a medical student, was taxidermist.|$|E

5|$|A snow groomer is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers {{were used by}} residents of rural areas to compress the snow close to their homes, and consisted of a heavy roller hauled by oxen which compacted the snow to make a smooth surface for <b>sledging.</b> With {{the invention of the}} motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at ski resorts, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or snowcat and then hauled across the area to be groomed.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Mawson had {{accompanied}} Ernest Shackleton's 1907–09 British Antarctic Expedition. Along with Edgeworth David and Alistair Mackay, {{he had been}} part of a man-hauled <b>sledging</b> expedition, the first to reach the area of the South Magnetic Pole. Upon his return from Antarctica, he recommenced to his post as geology lecturer at the University of Adelaide. Despite an offer from Robert Falcon Scott to join his Terra Nova Expedition to reach the Geographic South Pole, Mawson began planning his own Antarctic expedition. Mawson's plan, which led to the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, envisaged three bases on the Antarctic continent, collectively surveying much of the coast directly south of Australia. He approached Shackleton, who not only approved of his plan but was prepared to lead the expedition himself. Although Shackleton withdrew from the expedition in December 1910, he continued to assist Mawson with publicity and fund-raising.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the living}} hut were two small ante-rooms, one {{used as a}} {{photographic}} darkroom, the other for taxidermy. Within the main accommodation area daylight was admitted via a double-glazed and shuttered window and through a small square pane high on the northern wall. Bunks were fitted around the outer walls, and a table and stove dominated {{the centre of the}} hut. During the few brief weeks before winter set in, members of the party made trial <b>sledging</b> journeys on the sea ice in nearby Robertson Bay, during which they surveyed the coastline and collected specimens of birds and fish. They also slaughtered seals and penguins for food and fuel. Outside activities were largely curtailed in Mid-May, with the onset of severe winter weather.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the position of a <b>sledge</b> hockey player in their <b>sledge</b> using measurements of knee angle, seat height, and stability. Prior to this study, <b>sledge</b> hockey coaches and athletes used trivial methods to position a player in their seat. Proper positioning can enhance performance and function of the athlete. Nine different positions were evaluated using two on-ice <b>sledge</b> hockey specific tests. Four experienced male <b>sledge</b> hockey players from the London Blizzard who compete in the Ontario <b>Sledge</b> Hockey Association participated in this study.

5|$|On 27 October 1912, Mawson {{outlined}} the summer <b>sledging</b> program. Mertz and Ninnis {{were assigned to}} Mawson's own party, which would use the dogs to push quickly {{to the east of}} the expedition's base in Commonwealth Bay, towards Victoria Land. The party departed Cape Denison on 10 November, heading first to Aladdin's Cave, and from there south-east towards a massive glacier encountered by Aurora on the outward journey. Mertz skied ahead, scouting and providing a lead for the dogs to chase; Mawson and Ninnis manoeuvred the two dog teams behind. They reached the glacier on 19 November; negotiating fields of crevasses, it was crossed in five days. The party made quick progress once on the plateau again, but they soon encountered another glacier, far larger than the first. Despite strong winds and poor light, Mertz, Mawson and Ninnis reached the far side on 30 November.|$|E
5|$|Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor sledge was a {{converted}} fixed-wing aircraft {{taken on the}} 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, the first plane {{to be taken to}} the Antarctic. Expedition leader Douglas Mawson had planned to use the Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane as a reconnaissance and search and rescue tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in Adelaide, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer Frank Bickerton spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a sledge, fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on 15November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer <b>sledging</b> parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sledging</b> {{is common}} at most {{levels of the}} game in Australia, but one Australian with a {{particular}} reputation for <b>sledging</b> was former fast bowler Merv Hughes. His intimidating and aggressive bowling style was often accompanied by a mixture of humorous witticisms, and vitriolic abuse. On occasions he crossed the line from <b>sledging</b> to insulting; however, there are numerous occasions of classic sledges delivered by Hughes.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2005 Lloyd became {{chairperson}} of the British <b>Sledge</b> Hockey Association.

25|$|There is {{debate in}} the cricketing world as to whether this {{constitutes}} poor sportsmanship or good-humoured banter. <b>Sledging</b> is sometimes interpreted as abuse, and it is acknowledged some comments aimed as sledges do sometimes cross the line into personal abuse, however, {{this is not always}} the case. <b>Sledging</b> can sometimes be a humorous attempt at distraction. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh referred to the practice as 'mental disintegration'.|$|E
