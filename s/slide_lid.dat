40|$|ABSTRACT: Sample {{preparation}} {{is a major}} bottleneck in many biological processes. Paramagnetic particles (PMPs) are a ubiquitous method for isolating analytes of interest from biological samples and are used {{for their ability to}} thoroughly sample a solution and be easily collected with a magnet. There are three main methods by which PMPs are used for sample preparation: (1) removal of fluid from the analyte-bound PMPs, (2) removal of analyte-bound PMPs from the solution, and (3) removal of the substrate (with immobilized analyte-bound PMPs). In this paper, we explore the third and least studied method for PMP-based sample preparation using a platform termed <b>Sliding</b> <b>Lid</b> for Immobilized Droplet Extractions (SLIDE). SLIDE leverages principles of surface tension and patterned hydrophobicity to create a simple-to-operate platform for sample isolation (cells, DNA, RNA, protein) and preparation (cell staining) without the need for time-intensive wash steps, use of immiscible fluids, or precise pinning geometries. Compared to other standard isolation protocols using PMPs, SLIDE is able to perform rapid sample preparation with low (0. 6 %) carryover of contaminants from the original sample. The natural recirculatio...|$|R
500|$|Ben Burtt, {{the sound}} effects supervisor, made {{extensive}} use of traditional foley work in yet another of the production's throwbacks to days of the Republic serials. He selected a [...]30-30 Winchester rifle {{for the sound of}} Jones' pistol. Sound effects artists struck leather jackets and baseball gloves with a baseball bat to create a variety of punching noises and body blows. For the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence, fingers running through cheese casserole and sponges sliding over concrete were used for the slithering noises. The <b>sliding</b> <b>lid</b> on a toilet cistern provided the sound for the opening of the Ark, {{and the sound of the}} boulder in the opening is a car rolling down a gravel driveway in neutral. Burtt also used, as he did in many of his films, the ubiquitous Wilhelm scream when a Nazi falls from a truck. In addition to his use of such time-honored foley work, Burtt also demonstrated the modern expertise honed during his award-winning work on Star Wars. He employed a synthesizer for the sounds of the Ark, and mixed dolphins' and sea lions' screams for those of the spirits within.|$|R

60|$|It did not appear, however, {{that there}} was {{anything}} remarkably tremendous about this strange Barbara, who having lived a very quiet life, blushed very much and was quite as embarrassed and uncertain what she ought to say or do, as Kit could possibly be. When he had sat for some little time, attentive to the ticking of the sober clock, he ventured to glance curiously at the dresser, and there, among the plates and dishes, were Barbara's little work-box with a <b>sliding</b> <b>lid</b> to shut in the balls of cotton, and Barbara's prayer-book, and Barbara's hymn-book, and Barbara's Bible. Barbara's little looking-glass hung in a good light near the window, and Barbara's bonnet was on a nail behind the door. From all these mute signs and tokens of her presence, he naturally glanced at Barbara herself, who sat as mute as they, shelling peas into a dish; and just when Kit {{was looking at her}} eyelashes and wondering--quite in the simplicity of his heart--what colour her eyes might be, it perversely happened that Barbara raised her head a little to look at him, when both pair of eyes were hastily withdrawn, and Kit leant over his plate, and Barbara over her pea-shells, each in extreme confusion at having been detected by the other.|$|R
60|$|Peggotty and I {{were sitting}} one night by the parlour fire, alone. I {{had been reading}} to Peggotty about crocodiles. I must have read very perspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for I {{remember}} she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, {{that they were a}} sort of vegetable. I was tired of reading, and dead sleepy; but having leave, as a high treat, to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbour's, I would rather have died upon my post (of course) than have gone to bed. I had reached that stage of sleepiness when Peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large. I propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers, and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work; at the little bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread--how old it looked, being so wrinkled in all directions!--at the little house with a thatched roof, where the yard-measure lived; at her work-box with a <b>sliding</b> <b>lid,</b> with a view of St. Paul's Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted on the top; at the brass thimble on her finger; at herself, whom I thought lovely. I felt so sleepy, that I knew if I lost sight of anything for a moment, I was gone.|$|R

40|$|There is {{provided}} a {{kit of parts}} for an exhaled breath condensate collection device. The kit comprises a mouthpiece module 100 comprising a breath passageway defined in the mouthpiece module 100 providing fluid conduction from a mouthpiece breath inlet port 122 for receiving exhaled breath to a mouthpiece breath outlet port 124 in use. The kit further comprises a collection vessel 300 for insertion into the device for cooling in use. The collection vessel 300 defines a sealed and resealable chamber for collecting exhaled breath condensate in use. The collection vessel has a vessel breath inlet 326 for admitting exhaled breath into the chamber. The kit of parts is configured such that the collection vessel 300 is: insertable into the device into a sample collection configuration in which the vessel breath inlet 326 is unsealed and in fluid communication with the mouthpiece breath outlet port 124 of the mouthpiece module 100; and removable from the device in a sample containment configuration in which the collection vessel chamber is resealed. One or more parts of the kit of parts is configured and/or operable such that the collection vessel 300 is caused to be resealed into the sample containment configuration after sample collection before the collection vessel 300 is fully removed from the device. The vessel inlet may be sealed with a film seal wherein the mouthpiece outlet port is moveable to penetrate the film on coupling of the mouthpiece breath outlet port in fluid communication with the vessel breath inlet. The resealing mechanism may be a <b>sliding</b> <b>lid</b> 322 which when in the sealed configuration covers and seals the vessel breath inlet...|$|R
40|$|Microgravity {{can provide}} a diffusion-dominated {{environment}} for double-diffusion and diffusion-reaction experiments otherwise disrupted by buoyant convection or sedimentation. In sliding solvent diffusion cells, a diffusion interface between two liquid columns is achieved by aligning two offset sliding wells. Fluid {{in contact with the}} <b>sliding</b> <b>lid</b> of the cavities is subjected to an applied shear stress. The momentum change by the start/stop action of the well creates an additional hydrodynamical force. In microgravity, these viscous and inertial forces are sufficiently large to deform the diffusion interface and induce hydrodynamic transfer between the wells. A series of KC- 135 parabolic flight experiments were conducted to characterize these effects and establish baseline data for microgravity diffusion experiments. Flow visualizations show the diffusion interface to be deformed in a sinusoidal fashion following well alignment. After the wells were separated again in a second sliding movement, the total induced liquid transfer was determined and normalized by the well aspect ratio. The normalized transfer decreased linearly with Reynolds number from 3. 3 to 4. 0 % (w/v) for Re = 0. 4 (Stokes flow) to a minimum of 1. 0 % for Re = 23 to 30. Reynolds numbers that provide minimum induced transfers are characterized by an interface that is highly deformed and unsuitable for diffusion measurements. Flat diffusion interfaces acceptable for diffusion measurements are obtained with Reynolds numbers on the order of 7 to 10. Microgravity experiments aboard a sounding rocket flight verified counterdiffusion of different solutes to be diffusion dominated. Ground control experiments showed enhanced mixing by double-diffusive convection. Careful selection of experimental parameters improves initial conditions and minimizes induced transfer rates...|$|R

6000|$|... "It was at {{this point}} that the {{sensation}} of the evening arose--a sensation so dramatic that it can never have been paralleled in the history of scientific gatherings. Professor Challenger raised his hand in the air as a signal, and at once our colleague, Mr. E. D. Malone, was observed to rise and to make his way {{to the back of the}} platform. An instant later he re-appeared in company of a gigantic negro, the two of them bearing between them a large square packing-case. It was evidently of great weight, and was slowly carried forward and placed in front of the Professor's chair. All sound had hushed in the audience and everyone was absorbed in the spectacle before them. Professor Challenger drew off the top of the case, which formed a <b>sliding</b> <b>lid.</b> Peering down into the box he snapped his fingers several times and was heard from the Press seat to say, 'Come, then, pretty, pretty!' in a coaxing voice. An instant later, with a scratching, rattling sound, a most horrible and loathsome creature appeared from below and perched itself upon the side of the case. Even the unexpected fall of the Duke of Durham into the orchestra, which occurred at this moment, could not distract the petrified attention of the vast audience. The face of the creature was like the wildest gargoyle that the imagination of a mad medieval builder could have conceived. It was malicious, horrible, with two small red eyes as bright as points of burning coal. Its long, savage mouth, which was held half-open, was full of a double row of shark-like teeth. Its shoulders were humped, and round them were draped what appeared to be a faded gray shawl. It was the devil of our childhood in person. There was a turmoil in the audience--someone screamed, two ladies in the front row fell senseless from their chairs, and there was a general movement upon the platform to follow their chairman into the orchestra. For a moment there was danger of a general panic. Professor Challenger threw up his hands to still the commotion, but the movement alarmed the creature beside him. Its strange shawl suddenly unfurled, spread, and fluttered as a pair of leathery wings. Its owner grabbed at its legs, but too late to hold it. It had sprung from the perch and was circling slowly round the Queen's Hall with a dry, leathery flapping of its ten-foot wings, while a putrid and insidious odor pervaded the room. The cries of the people in the galleries, who were alarmed at the near approach of those glowing eyes and that murderous beak, excited the creature to a frenzy. Faster and faster it flew, beating against walls and chandeliers in a blind frenzy of alarm. 'The window! For heaven's sake shut that window!' roared the Professor from the platform, dancing and wringing his hands in an agony of apprehension. Alas, his warning was too late! In a moment the creature, beating and bumping along the wall like a huge moth within a gas-shade, came upon the opening, squeezed its hideous bulk through it, and was gone. Professor Challenger fell back into his chair with his face buried in his hands, while the audience gave one long, deep sigh of relief as they realized that the incident was over.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In many {{problems}} in commonsense reasoning and intelligent manufacturing, {{we need to}} reason about cutting, joining, and folding sheets of materials such as cardboard and metal. In this paper we intro-duce a first-order ontology of shape (called BoxWorld) that can support these applications. We reuse an existing ontology of shape for object recognition with 2 D shapes (called CardWorld) and extend the axioms to three-dimensional shapes in the BoxWorld Ontology. A distinguishing characteristic of these ontologies is that they use only the notions of inci-dence and betweenness rather than Euclidean geometry as axiomatized by Hilbert and Tarski. Prelude When Alice {{went to the kitchen}} for her breakfast cereal, she opened the box by removing the tab from the slot {{at the top of the}} box. Discovering it empty, she reached for a new box, which she opened by detaching one side of the lid from the other. She closed the box by opening the slot on one <b>slide</b> of the <b>lid</b> and then inserted the tab into the slot. After breakfast, she disassembled the old box and dropped it into the recycling bin. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{division}} of Engineering Materials at Linköping University, department of Management and Engineering, conducted {{a research project}} concerning Fatigue life of thermal barrier coatings during 2009. During this project equipment to provoke these fatigue failure by rapidly heating and cooling test subjects in cycles, was ordered. Design and manufacturing of the equipment was handled internally at LIU. The equipment was built using a furnace that is lowered and raised over the table where the test subject is placed. To keep {{the temperature of the}} furnace a <b>lid</b> <b>slides</b> in place to close the downward facing opening of the furnace when it is in the raised position. On this door there is nozzle that is used to cooling of the test subject by air. To make sure that the equipment can work independently you need an automation controller that can evaluate if movement can occur without danger of collisions. The control system also needs to monitor that all elements are performed according to plan. This degree project is based on a modular system from OPTO 22 and includes the configuration of a PLC that will be supplied with logic and a user interface. The degree project resulted in a graphic interface in which a user can set desired values for different parameters and get information about current values for them. Using the interface the user could also start and stop the running of cycles. An analog interface consisting of a start and stop button is also handled in the project. Logic has been created and tested using simulations of incoming signals. During these tests it managed to transform the equipment from standby to starting position for running cycles, running cycles that can be adapted by the user and to put the equipment in standby position when the user want to power down the system. Apart from this there is also routines to monitor that movements is actually done according to plan and communicates with external systems capable of sending signals. A routine that both transform digital alarms and translate numerical values representing different choices to text messages in the graphic interface has been created...|$|R
