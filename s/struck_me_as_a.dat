500|$|After the war, the Duke {{admitted}} {{in his memoirs}} that he admired the Germans, but he denied being pro-Nazi. Of Hitler he wrote: [...] " [...] Führer <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> somewhat ridiculous figure, with his theatrical posturings and his bombastic pretensions." [...] In the 1950s, journalist Frank Giles heard the Duke blame British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden for helping to [...] "precipitate the war through his treatment of Mussolini... that's what [...] did, he helped to bring on the war... and of course Roosevelt and the Jews". During the 1960s the Duke said privately to a friend, Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross, [...] "I never thought Hitler was such a bad chap." ...|$|E
500|$|Amanda Tapping {{admitted}} {{that it had}} been easier to establish relationships with her co-stars {{at the beginning of the}} series, comparing Nemec's situation to [...] "being the new kid in school; we're still trying to make [...] comfortable, but it's not the same". Nevertheless, the StargateSG-1 actors and producers complimented Corin Nemec and the character. Richard Dean Anderson was impressed with Nemec's performance in [...] "Meridian", saying [...] "he really <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bright guy, very respectful of the dynamic of the set, but with an awareness of what he wanted to bring." [...] Don S. Davis (General Hammond) noted during the filming of season6 that [...] "Corin is a wonderful [...] young man with a tremendous personality and he's had a great deal of experience in the business", agreeing with writer Robert C. Cooper that Nemec had done a [...] "fine" [...] and [...] "wonderful" [...] job.|$|E
500|$|Some critics, however, were displeased {{with the}} film's long running time {{and lack of}} action scenes. [...] "The film gets mired in the {{inevitable}} red tape of police investigations," [...] wrote Bob Longino of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, who also felt that the film [...] "stumbles to a rather unfulfilling conclusion" [...] and [...] "seems to {{last as long as}} the Oscars." [...] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer felt that [...] "Mr. Fincher's flair for casting is the major asset of his curiously attenuated return to the serial-killer genre. I keep saying 'curiously' with regard to Mr. Fincher, because I can't really figure out what he is up to in Zodiac – with its two-hour-and-37-minute running time for what <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shaggy-dog narrative." [...] Christy Lemire wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that [...] "Jake Gyllenhaal is both the central figure and the weakest link... But he's never fleshed out sufficiently to make you believe that he'd sacrifice his safety and that of his family to find the truth. We are told repeatedly that the former Eagle Scout is just a genuinely good guy, but that's not enough." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{must confess}} the {{poisoning}} of Pyecraft <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> immense undertaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{no more of}} him. But {{though his}} views were adverse to the best {{advanced}} thought, he <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> interesting person: I should like {{to find out if}} he has produced any literary works.--Yours, etc., [...] "Paul Nickolaiovitch." ...|$|R
6000|$|The broker {{glanced at}} him reflectively. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it's not my business, but {{you must have had}} a pile last year. Of course, you were over in the Old Country, but you could afford it, and you never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> extravagant man." ...|$|R
2500|$|It {{was also}} at Terry's {{suggestion}} that Violet, on starting a theatrical career, had adopted the stage name Vanbrugh. Irene did the same. Violet's early success encouraged Irene to follow her into the theatrical profession. Sir John Gielgud described the two:The Vanbrugh sisters were remarkably alike in appearance. Tall and imposing, beautifully spoken, they moved with grace ... They were elegantly but never ostentatiously dressed, entering and leaving the stage with unerring authority ... Violet never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> natural comedienne, as Irene was.|$|E
2500|$|Dani first {{appeared}} in the 1999 song [...] "Californication", which includes the lyrics [...] "Teenage bride with a baby inside/Gettin' high on information" [...] although the girl's name is not specified. She was next mentioned in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2002 single [...] "By the Way" [...] as [...] "Dani the girl". Kiedis commented: [...] "When this funky groove came up it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> perfect place to actually tell a story. It sort of revealed itself to me that it's been the same character, just kind of developing. At first I didn't realize that I was writing about the same girl." ...|$|E
2500|$|Noel Murray at The Onion's The A. V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{qualified}} approval with a B rating. [...] According to Murray, [...] "The serial killer stuff in 'Inner Child was fairly pat—with elements swiped wholesale from Thomas Harris and Michael Connelly—and the 'keep Lil’ O away from Eliot' operation <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> little sloppy, if not actively implausible. But the episode was fast paced and creepy, {{with a few}} good Walter lines (my favorite being a tie between 'Agent Dunham knows what a penis looks like' and 'obviously I {{was sitting on the}} toilet') and the return of his wonderfully ridiculous mad scientist device, 'the neural stimulator.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Poppleton I {{had known}} before slightly. I {{used to see}} him at the club. In club {{surroundings}} he always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ineffable young ass, loud and talkative and perpetually breaking the silence rules. Yet I {{have to admit that}} in his summer flannels and with a straw hat on he can do things that I can't.|$|R
5000|$|.....to {{love the}} Lord our God {{with all our}} heart, all our words and all our deeds, and love our {{neighbour}} <b>as</b> ourselves <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> instruction, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> plea, and actually, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> necessity. Considering how to do to that, how to forsake all and follow God out of love has provided me my greatest challenge in life.|$|R
5000|$|McQueen said [...] "An {{official}} set of Royal Mail stamps <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> intimate but distinguished way of {{highlighting the}} sacrifice of individuals in defence of our national ideals. The stamps would focus on individual experience without euphemism. It would form an intimate reflection of national loss that would involve {{the families of the}} dead and permeate the everyday - every household and every office." ...|$|R
60|$|Which <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very {{remarkable}} sentiment, {{coming from}} the Hon. Mrs. Drayton, nee the elder Miss Lovell.|$|E
60|$|Edwin arrived {{early in}} the afternoon, and was shut into the kitchen. He <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{handsome}} cat, but nervous.|$|E
60|$|This <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mighty happy {{solution}} of everybody's troubles, but I {{felt it was}} too good to be true.|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{remember}} our {{hopes and fears}} the day we first put in the share. Many things have happened since," [...] he said, [...] "but once more the harvest means {{a great deal to}} both of us. Miss Lorimer--and we are now more fortunate, Ralph, than we were then--you will imagine yourself an ancient priestess, and bless the soil for us. That always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> appropriate custom." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{spoke to}} {{me for the first}} time. He spoke slowly and formally, and his accent <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being <b>a</b> little foreign.|$|R
5000|$|In an interview, Ishiguro said, [...] "It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{intriguing}} idea. ... I am a big {{believer in}} musicals and I see no reason why my novel shouldn't make a good one. Stephen Sondheim's A Little Night Music shows you can set an unlikely story to music. ... This is a small scale thing and I might feel more cautious about it if the film version hadn't been such serious, faithful adaptation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Curtis, you can't think--Jernyngham {{was my best}} friend!" [...] Then {{he laughed}} indignantly. [...] "You always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{sensible}} man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I said before, it is a {{delicate}} question, but I did not think so. Her husband <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> particularly poor sample, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, though I saw her but for {{a moment}} yesterday, she <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very {{intelligent}} person, and I am sure she has opinions." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> odd {{coincidence}} that I {{should see the}} man again in London, so soon after I had met with him in Yorkshire. This was all I thought about it, at the time. If I had known then, what I know now, I might have dreamed, let us say, of throwing that priest into the lake at Vange, and might have reckoned the circumstance among the wisely-improved opportunities of my life.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well,' cried her husband, crossly, 'don't {{strangle}} me for that! He never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> such <b>a</b> marvellous treasure. There {{is no need}} to be frantic!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be true," [...] he said, [...] "of a {{good many}} of us. Wrayson, however, never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being <b>a</b> {{particularly}} secretive sort of chap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Boyne Iron Works has {{the firm}} of Wading, Fowndes and Ripon behind it," [...] {{asserted}} Mr. Scherer, with what <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> magnificent faith.|$|E
60|$|It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{singular}} {{implication that}} you couldn't {{be out of}} a counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to his experience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur Gratiot, behold my commissary-general, my strategist, my financier." [...] And Monsieur Gratiot smiled. He <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man {{who never}} let himself go {{sufficiently}} to laugh.|$|E
50|$|Cecile Pineda’s debut novel, Face, {{which won}} the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction awarded by the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, proposes a protagonist who suffers a catastrophic facial accident. It {{addresses}} issues {{having to do with}} identity. “When I read Face in 1985, it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary achievement, all the more extraordinary for being a first novel. Rereading it has not changed my estimate....Face continues to haunt me.” —J.M. Coetzee, Nobel Prize, 2003.|$|R
5000|$|Burns Singer {{wrote in}} Encounter: [...] "Repeatedly, {{whenever}} I have met him, Mr Stuart Holroyd has <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> unusually intelligent, modest, and cultivated young man. His book, unfortunately, displays {{none of these}} qualities, unless it be in homeopathic doses." [...] Singer continued: [...] "Mr Holroyd's mind is quite obviously {{of the kind that}} can absorb a good deal of experience, that needs years to mature. In this he differs from the figure with whom he will inevitably be compared, Mr Colin Wilson. ... But he does need these years." ...|$|R
50|$|Their {{discipline}} and smartness were impressive, {{and they were}} more obviously {{at home in the}} jungle than any troops I had yet seen... I was at once struck by two things. First, by the horde of unarmed porters who were needed to carry supplies, ammunition, baggage and the heavier weapons, and secondly by the large number of white men in a unit, fifty or sixty to <b>a</b> battalion. Accustomed <b>as</b> I was to Indian battalions in the field with usually only seven or eight Europeans, it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> unnecessarily generous supply.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can readily}} imagine you should find {{yourself}} in sympathy with Mr. Malthus," [...] returned the Prince. [...] "He <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man of a very original disposition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{foolish and}} inconsiderate little person. But {{why should you}} and your wife take to heart so {{strongly}} mere folly--or even a want of consideration?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{they may}} find the gold mine; and Carsluith Maxwell {{is by no means}} an idiot," [...] she said. [...] "Indeed, he always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shrewd, {{determined}} man." ...|$|E
6000|$|In German parks {{separate}} {{roads are}} devoted to the different orders of the community, and no one person, at peril of liberty and fortune, may go upon another person's road. There are special paths for [...] "wheel-riders" [...] and special paths for [...] "foot-goers," [...] avenues for [...] "horse-riders," [...] roads for people in light vehicles, and roads for people in heavy vehicles; ways for children and for [...] "alone ladies." [...] That no particular route has yet been set aside for bald-headed men or [...] "new women" [...] has always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> omission.|$|R
6000|$|... "Geminy! Don't that towel {{remind you}} of home?" [...] said Joe, when the colonel had gone. [...] "From the looks of things, Colonel Zane means to have comfort here in the wilderness. He <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being <b>a</b> fine man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Mr. Dodge," [...] {{interrupted}} the soi-disant Sir George, [...] "I {{think that most}} be an error. I have been at Brussels, and I declare, now, it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> lying <b>a</b> good deal {{on the side of}} a very steep hill!" ...|$|R
