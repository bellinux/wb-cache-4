5|$|The weaker {{members of}} the party—Arnold Spencer-Smith and Mackintosh himself—were by this time showing signs of {{physical}} breakdown, as the long march south began from Bluff Depot towards Mount Hope at 83°30S, where the final depot was to be laid. The party was reduced to six when three men were forced to turn back because of a Primus stove failure. With Mackintosh and Joyce in the final party were Spencer-Smith, Ernest Wild (younger brother of Frank), Dick Richards and Victor Hayward. With four dogs they trekked southward, increasingly afflicted by frostbite, <b>snow</b> <b>blindness</b> and, eventually, scurvy. Spencer-Smith collapsed, and thereafter had to be carried on the sledge. Mackintosh, barely able to walk, fought on until the final depot was laid at Mount Hope. On the homeward journey the effective leadership of the party fell increasingly to Joyce, as Mackintosh's condition deteriorated until, like Spencer-Smith, {{he had to be}} carried on the sledge. The journey became a protracted struggle which eventually cost the life of Spencer-Smith and took the others to the limits of their endurance. Mackintosh suffered further physical and mental collapse, and had to be left in the tent while Joyce, himself suffering from severe <b>snow</b> <b>blindness,</b> led the rest to the safety of Hut Point. He and Ernest Wild then returned for Mackintosh, and the five survivors were all back at Hut Point on 18 March 1916.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer <b>snow</b> <b>blindness.</b> Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{survivors}} was Beck Weathers, an American client of New Zealand-based guide service Adventure Consultants. Weathers was left for dead about 275 metres (900 feet) from Camp 4 at 7,950 metres (26,085 feet). After spending {{a night on the}} mountain, Weathers managed to find his way to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and vision impaired due to <b>snow</b> <b>blindness.</b> When he arrived at Camp 4, fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{subsistence}} {{activity for}} the Yup'ik is fishing, though hunting supplements {{the food supply}} and provides skins for clothing. The Yup'ik fur and skin clothing, like other Eskimo groups, is {{a key factor in}} ensuring their survival in the northernmost reaches of the globe. The raw materials of traditional Yup'ik clothing are skin (hide) and fur (pelt), intestine (gut), sinew, and grass. The raw material resources are sea and land mammals, birds, fish and plants. Traditionally, skins of birds, fish, and marine and land animals were used to make clothing. Hunting clothes were designed to be insulated and waterproof. Fish skin and marine mammal intestines were used for waterproof shells and boots. Grass was used to make insulating socks, and as a waterproof thread. Wastefulness being disrespectful, Yup'ik elders made use of every last scrap from hunts and harvests: seal guts became warm, waterproof, and breathable parkas; the skins of fish were fashioned into waterproof mittens, while their heads and entrails were stored in naturally refrigerated pits as insurance against future famine. Dried grasses became anything from insulating socks to bedding to sled rope, or even goggles to protect against <b>snow</b> <b>blindness.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 26 April 1940 Lieutenant Colonel Dannevig was {{informed}} that the Germans were about to capture the town of Otta, cutting off the Otta Valley. The commander of the 2nd Division, General Jacob Hvinden Haug, authorized Dannevig to do as he saw best with the forces at his command. Dannevig decided to evacuate the camp and march his troops and prisoners over the mountains to join the Norwegian 4th Division in Sogn. All the prisoners were taken along, while {{about half of the}} Norwegian soldiers were dismissed because of insufficient skiing skills. The march westwards began at 1000hrs on 27 April, the German prisoners dragging ski sleds across the snow-clad mountains. The first night was spent at Krosbu. Many prisoners soon suffered from <b>snow</b> <b>blindness</b> and exhaustion, some having to be left behind at the hotel Turtagrø, where the column spent the second night, to be retrieved later by snow sleds. Over several days the prisoners were brought by boat to Vadheim in Sogn. By the time the prisoners reached Vadheim resistance in the southern parts of Norway was ending and the Germans were left to themselves. Dannevig's militia unit was disbanded on 1 May 1940.|$|E
500|$|The gamble at the icefall succeeded, {{and the men}} {{reached their}} depot two days later. However, they had great {{difficulty}} navigating down the glacier. Lashly wrote: [...] "I cannot describe the maze we got into and the hairbreadth escapes {{we have had to}} pass through." [...] In his attempts to find the way down, Evans removed his goggles and subsequently suffered agonies of <b>snow</b> <b>blindness</b> that made him into a passenger.|$|E
500|$|The party {{set out on}} 2 November 1902. The march was, Scott wrote later, [...] "a {{combination}} of success and failure". A record Farthest South latitude of 82°17' was reached, beating the previous record established in 1900 by Carsten Borchgrevink. The journey was marred by the poor performance of the dogs, whose food had become tainted, and who rapidly fell sick. All 22 dogs died during the march. The three men all suffered at times from <b>snow</b> <b>blindness,</b> frostbite and, ultimately, scurvy. On the return journey, Shackleton had {{by his own admission}} [...] "broken down" [...] and could no longer carry out his share of the work.|$|E
500|$|After {{his return}} to New Zealand Joyce was hospitalised, mainly {{from the effects of}} <b>snow</b> <b>blindness,</b> and {{according}} to his own account had to wear dark glasses for a further 18months. During this period he married Beatrice Curtlett from Christchurch. He was now probably unfit for further polar work, although he attempted, unsuccessfully, to rejoin the Navy in 1918. In September 1919 he was seriously injured in a car accident, which led to months of convalescence followed by a return to England.In 1920 he signed up for a new Antarctic expedition to be led by John Cope of the Ross Sea party, but this venture proved abortive. He continued to maintain his claims to financial compensation from Shackleton, which caused a breach between them, and he was not invited to join Shackleton's Quest expedition which departed in 1921. He applied to join the British [...] Mount Everest [...] expedition of 1921–22, [...] but was rejected.|$|E
500|$|Briefly {{stopping}} in Japan and Hong Kong, Crowley reached Ceylon, {{where he met}} with Allan Bennett, who was there studying Shaivism. The pair {{spent some time in}} Kandy before Bennett decided to become a Buddhist monk in the Theravada tradition, travelling to Burma to do so. Crowley decided to tour India, devoting himself to the Hindu practice of raja yoga, from which he claimed to have achieved the spiritual state of dhyana. He spent much of this time studying at the Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madura. At this time he also composed and also wrote poetry which was published as The Sword of Song (1904). He contracted malaria, and had to recuperate from the disease in Calcutta and Rangoon. In 1902, he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers: Guy Knowles, H. Pfannl, V.Wesseley, and Jules Jacot-Guillarmod. Together the Eckenstein-Crowley expedition attempted K2, which had never been climbed. On the journey, Crowley was afflicted with influenza, malaria, and <b>snow</b> <b>blindness,</b> and other expedition members were also struck with illness. They reached an altitude of [...] before turning back.|$|E
500|$|Scott, Wilson and Shackleton left on 2 November 1902 {{with dogs}} and {{supporting}} parties. Their goal was [...] "to {{get as far}} south {{in a straight line}} on the Barrier ice as we can, reach the Pole if possible, or find some new land". The first significant milestone was passed on 11 November, when a supporting party passed Borchgrevink's Farthest South record of 78°50′. However, the lack of skill with dogs was soon evident, and progress was slow. After the support parties had returned, on 15 November, Scott's group began relaying their loads (taking half loads forward, then returning for the other half), thus travelling three miles for every mile of southward progress. Mistakes had been made with the dogs' food, and as the dogs grew weaker, Wilson was forced to kill the weakest as food for the others. The men, too, were struggling, afflicted by <b>snow</b> <b>blindness,</b> frostbite and symptoms of early scurvy, but they continued southwards in line with the mountains to the west. Christmas Day was celebrated with double rations, and a Christmas pudding that Shackleton had kept for the occasion, hidden with his socks. On 30 December 1902, without having left the Barrier, they reached their Furthest South at 82°17′S. Troubles multiplied on the home journey, as the remaining dogs died and Shackleton collapsed with scurvy. Wilson's diary entry for 14 January 1903 acknowledged that [...] "we all have slight, though definite symptoms of scurvy". Scott and Wilson struggled on, with Shackleton, who was unable to pull, walking alongside and occasionally carried on the sledge. The party eventually reached the ship on 3 February 1903 after covering [...] including relays, in 93days' travel at a daily average of just over [...]|$|E

2500|$|Despite finding heavier-than-expected ice, the {{expedition}} pressed on. Leaving Discovery to winter at Lady Franklin Bay, Alert pressed on a further [...] through the Robeson Channel, establishing her winter quarters at Floeberg Beach. [...] Spring 1876 saw considerable activity by sledge, charting {{the coasts of}} Ellesmere Island and Greenland, but scurvy had begun to take hold, with Alert suffering the greatest burden. On 3 April the second-in-command of Alert, Albert Hastings Markham, took a party north to attempt the Pole. [...] By 11 May, having made slow progress, they reached their greatest latitude at 83° 20' 26"N. Suffering from <b>snow</b> <b>blindness,</b> scurvy and exhaustion, they turned back.|$|E
2500|$|Kayaks {{were also}} used for hunting at water {{crossings}} during annual migration. [...] Wounded animals were tied together, brought ashore, and killed there to avoid the struggle of dragging dead animals. Every part of the caribou was important.

Hides were used also for tents, tools, and containers.|$|E
