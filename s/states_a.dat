30|$|Now the {{question}} {{that needs to be}} addressed is why is <b>state</b> <b>A</b> 7 not the finishing point of the 2008 analysis? The answer is that <b>state</b> <b>A</b> 7 (or B 11) are actually the equilibria, but <b>state</b> <b>A</b> 3 is a very considerable transition state. This nuclear conflict is very complicated since the DMs have changed their decisions on several occasions. That is why the conflict moved from <b>state</b> <b>A</b> 7 to A 3 in the 2008 conflict (Table 4).|$|R

50|$|Because each {{government}} is supreme, it can enact whatever statutes it wishes. Thus, <b>State</b> <b>A</b> {{would have the}} power to make a law which, for example, made it an offence to smoke in the streets of <b>State</b> B, <b>a</b> neighbouring <b>state.</b> <b>State</b> <b>A</b> could employ officers and equip them with cameras. These officers could then collect evidence in State B and, when its citizens returned home, <b>State</b> <b>A</b> could prosecute them for breach of the law. But <b>State</b> <b>A's</b> law could not be directly effective in State B because that would make State B less than sovereign. Similarly, <b>State</b> <b>A</b> could not seek the extradition of its own citizens from State B unless State B was formally to consent (usually through the negotiation of a treaty including the particular offence).|$|R

In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel.

Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam.
