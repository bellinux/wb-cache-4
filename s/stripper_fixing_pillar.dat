50|$|H.F.S. Morgan's 1909 Runabout used sliding pillar suspension, an {{independent}} front suspension system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide {{up and down a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>pillar</b> that also acts as the kingpin and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tire and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the <b>pillar</b> is <b>fixed</b> and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.|$|R

5000|$|A {{drawback}} of {{the sliding}} pillar {{system is that}} the track changes with differential suspension movement, such as when one wheel rises over an obstacle (as {{can be seen in}} the diagram above). This is particularly an issue where the track is narrow (as for cyclecars) in relation to suspension travel. The effective track is the hypotenuse AC or AD of the triangle ABC, where AB is the <b>fixed</b> <b>pillar</b> spacing. However, many types of suspension, such as the swing axle have similar issues. Track variation is usually considered less important than changes in wheel camber, which is almost nonexistent in a sliding pillar system (see suspension geometry).|$|R

Honour to victorious Analysis; nevertheless, {{out of the}} Workshop and Laboratory, what thing was victorious Analysis yet known to make? Detection of incoherences, mainly; {{destruction}} of the incoherent. From of old, Doubt was but half a magician; she evokes the spectres which she cannot quell. We shall have 'endless vortices of froth-logic;' whereon first words, and then things, are whirled and swallowed. Remark, accordingly, as acknowledged grounds of Hope, at bottom mere precursors of Despair, this perpetual theorising about Man, the Mind of Man, Philosophy of Government, Progress of the Species and such-like; the main thinking furniture of every head. Time, and so many Montesquieus, Mablys, spokesmen of Time, have discovered innumerable things: and now has not Jean Jacques promulgated his new Evangel of a Contrat Social; explaining the whole mystery of Government, {{and how it is}} contracted and bargained for,--to universal satisfaction? Theories of Government! Such have been, and will be; in ages of decadence. Acknowledge them in their degree; as processes of Nature, who does nothing in vain; as steps in her great process. Meanwhile, what theory is so certain as this, That all theories, were they never so earnest, painfully elaborated, are, and, by the very conditions of them, must be incomplete, questionable, and even false?

60|$|Let us remark, meanwhile, how {{indispensable}} everywhere a King is, in all {{movements of}} men. It is strikingly shown, {{in this very}} War, what becomes of men when they cannot find a Chief Man, and their enemies can. The Scotch Nation was all but unanimous in Puritanism; zealous and of one mind about it, as in this English end of the Island was always {{far from being the}} case. But there was no great Cromwell among them; poor tremulous, hesitating, diplomatic Argyles and such like: none of them had a heart true enough for the truth, or durst commit himself to the truth. They had no leader; and the scattered Cavalier party in that country had one: Montrose, the noblest of all the Cavaliers; an accomplished, gallant-hearted, splendid man; what one may call the Hero-Cavalier. Well, look at it; on the one hand subjects without a King; on the other a King without subjects! The subjects without King can do nothing; the subjectless King can do something. This Montrose, with a handful of Irish or Highland savages, few of them so much as guns in their hands, dashes at the drilled Puritan armies like a wild whirlwind; sweeps them, time after time, some five times over, from the field before him. He was at one period, for a short while, master of all Scotland. One man; but he was a man; a million zealous men, but without the one; they against him were powerless! Perhaps of all the persons in that Puritan struggle, from first to last, the single indispensable one was verily Cromwell. To see and dare, and decide; to be a <b>fixed</b> <b>pillar</b> in the welter of uncertainty;--a King among them, whether they called him so or not.|$|R

They lived in one house, on the {{outskirts}} of the great city, amid heaps of saltpetre, rotten bricks, herds of kine, and a <b>fixed</b> <b>pillar</b> of dust caused by the incessant passing of the beasts to the river to drink. In the evening the children of the City came to the waste place to fly their kites, and Ephraim's sons held aloof, watching the sport from the roof, but never descending to take part in them. At the back of the house stood a small brick enclosure, in which Ephraim prepared the daily meat for his people after the custom of the Jews. Once the rude door of the square was suddenly smashed open by a struggle from inside, and showed the meek bill-collector at his work, nostrils dilated, lips drawn back over his teeth, and his hands upon a half-maddened sheep. He was attired in strange raiment, having no relation whatever to duster coats or list slippers, and a knife was in his mouth. As he struggled with the animal between the walls, the breath came from him in thick sobs, and the nature of the man seemed changed. When the ordained slaughter was ended, he saw that the door was open and shut it hastily, his hand leaving a red mark on the timber, while his children from the neighbouring house- top looked down awe-stricken and open-eyed. A glimpse of Ephraim busied in one of his religious capacities was no thing to be desired twice.|$|R

40|$|Tunability and {{programmability}} {{are highly}} demanded for silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs) {{to expand their}} applications in the next-generation photonics. The main objective of this thesis is to develop several reconfigurable and programmable photonic crystal (PC) devices. In Chapter 2, we developed a relatively general nanofabrication process for integrating PC devices with movable mechanical components on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. We also investigated grating coupling technology, to facilitate coupling lights {{into and out of}} PC devices. In Chapter 3, we developed an all-optical programmable PC device that integrates digital micromirror device (DMD), photo-responsive LC, and PC technologies. We demonstrated the functionality and programmability of the device, by forming a point-defect cavity, a straight waveguide, and a waveguide bend on the single device. In Chapter 4, we developed two types of reconfigurable PC devices by leveraging the strengths of optical nanobeam and nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) technologies. The first device consists of an array of movable nanobeams. Each nanobeam is an electrostatically tunable photonic element in a PC waveguide. We demonstrated the capability of the device to engineer different photonic bandgaps, by tuning one unit in group of two neighboring nanobeam units, tuning one or two in group of three units, and forming two reconfigurable PCs, on the single device. To achieve a higher-level integration, we also theoretically studied another reconfigurable PC integrating an array of mechanical tunable nanobeams with an array of <b>fixed</b> <b>pillars</b> into the top silicon layer of a SOI wafer. In Chapter 5, we developed two tunable photonic crystal-cantilever cavity (PC 3) resonators. The first device has an NEMS cantilever embedded into a L 6 cavity in a PC slab. The second device has a similar cantilever to insert into a nanobeam-base waveguide. We studied bending characteristics of the cantilever and optical characteristics of these two devices at different applied voltages. In Chapter 6, we conducted theoretical investigation on a nano-opto-mechanical reconfigurable PIC device consisting of an array of silicon plugs and a 2 D PC slab. We theoretically demonstrated that a point-defect cavity, a line-defect waveguide, and a waveguide bend can be configured in the PC slab, by inserting different plugs into an air hole, a straight line of holes, and an L-shape line of holes...|$|R
5000|$|The Skyrail sets {{introduced}} yellow girders and beams, different colored {{window and}} door panels and battery powered red or blue [...] "Sky Cars" [...] that ran on monorail steel rails from building to building.The sets came in two sizes: a single red car set (17), and the bigger two-car set that contained the blue car (18). The sets {{that came in}} the upright storage containers were Set No. 30 (one car) and Set No. 31 (two cars) There were no switches, so the layout was either a completed circuit (circle), or a single line, (red end of line bumpers were included to prevent the car(s) from flying off). Unique to these sets (besides the 50ish future monorail cars, and the metal rails) was the red clip that fit onto the girders {{to hold up the}} metal rails, and some green signs that were only for the Monorail that would seem out of place on the conventional Girder/Panel sets. Holes in the non-conductive rubber between the upper and lower metal rail parts, fit over the clips. This allowed the rails to be tilted in some pretty imaginative angles. The rails fit together with two protruding pins, that fit into the next rail, and so on. Unlike other Monorail Toys, the Skyrail sets had no <b>fixed</b> <b>pillars</b> holding up the rails, the buildings that were made by assembling the girder/panel sets would accept the 'clips' and the height, width, and complexity of the layout rested solely on the child's imagination.

40|$|Although the {{importance}} of substrate surface topography in colloidal and bacterial adhesion is widely recognized, how it affects the adhesion process has been a controversial topic. In this study, the impact of surface topography on adhesion of biological (i. e., bacteria) and non-biological colloids was investigated using natural and engineered surfaces with well-defined surface topographic patterns. Adhesion experiments using carboxylate modified latex (CML) microspheres of 4 μm in diameter and Psudomonas Aeruginosa on the taro leaf of Colocasia esculenta, a plant known for its self-cleaning property {{similar to that of}} the lotus leaf, in a 100 mM NaCl solution at pH 4 under submerged conditions showed that nanoscale surface structures on the papilla of the Colocasia esculenta leaf surface resisted adhesion by both CML and P. Aeruginosa. This resistance to adhesion was found to be independent of the wetting condition of the surface, suggesting that the surface superhydrophobicity was not the reason for the observed lack of adhesion. Interfacial force mapping by atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed markedly lower adhesion forces over the surface area covered by these nano-structures where adhesion resistance was observed. Adhesion experiments were also performed using 6 μm CML particles on engineered micro-patterns fabricated on silicon wafers. The micro-patterned surfaces consisted cuboid pillars or pits of a wide range of sizes arranged at various spacings. Adhesion of CML particles on all micro-patterned surfaces was significantly less than on the smooth control surface. In general, adhesion decreased with decreasing pillar or pit size and spacing between the features. Adhesion was minimum on the micro-patterned surface when the dimension (pillar size) of patterns is close to/smaller than the size of the colloid when spacing between <b>pillars</b> was <b>fixed</b> to a size a bit smaller than the particle size; while the adhesion on patterns with <b>fixed</b> <b>pillar</b> size (a bit smaller than the particle size) was low for a wide range of spacings. Analysis of the spatial distribution of adhered particles on the pillar-patterned surfaces showed that more than 98 % of the particles adhered on the edge of the pillars (between the pillars) when the spacing between pillars was smaller than the particle diameter; the particles adhered in the valley close to the pillars when the spacing was larger than the particle diameter. The characteristic adhesion distribution of the colloidal particles on the micro-patterned surfaces was also validated by the AFM adhesion force mapping: when spacing between pillars was smaller than the particle size, adhesion force was larger on the edge of the pillars; when spacing between pillars was larger than the particle size, adhesion force was larger on the valley. However, the AFM results could not explain the reduced adhesion on the patterned surface compared to the smooth surface...|$|R

For experiments that require production of a specific higher charge state than the one produced by the LINAC, the beam stripper must remain intact during the experimental campaign over a long period of time. Numerical simulations have confirmed that a <b>fixed</b> <b>stripper,</b> which is continuously irradiated at the same spot, cannot be used and we propose an alternative scheme in which a wheel shaped aluminum stripper rotating at a rate of 2000 rpm is used. The thermal load on the material is substantially reduced because a much larger area is now irradiated and our first test of simulations show that a steady state temperature, which is safely below the melting temperature of aluminum, is achieved due to heat conduction and radiation losses from the heated material. 2012 Elsevier B.

The process of ushering people into the presence of the Sultan was devious and formal involving entry through semipublic places to private chambers to the audience hall. The debate on whether the Hazara [...] Sutan Palace cited as existing during Allauddin Khalji reign and also during Togluq's time {{are one and the same}} palace, has not been conclusive. A plausible hypothesis is that the stone hall of the palace was built by Allauddin Khalji while the tower adjoining the stone buildings was surely built by Mohammed bin Toghluq.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the region}} of science itself, again, Diderot {{foresees}} as great a change as in the relations between science and philosophy. [...] "We touch the moment of a great revolution in the sciences. From the strong inclination of men's minds towards morals, literature, the history of nature and experimental physics, I would almost venture to assert that before the next hundred years are over, {{there will not be}} three great geometers to be counted in Europe. This science will stop short where the Bernouillis, the Eulers, the Maupertuis, the Clairauts, the Fontaines, the D'Alemberts, the Lagranges have left it. They will have <b>fixed</b> the <b>Pillars</b> of Hercules. People will go no further." [...] Those who have read Comte's angry denunciations of the perversions of geometry by means of algebra, and of the waste of intellectual force in modern analysis,[210] will at least understand how such a view as Diderot's was possible. And no one will be likely to deny that, whether or not the pillars of the geometrical Hercules were finally set a hundred years ago, the great discoveries of the hundred years since Diderot have been, as he predicted, in the higher sciences. The great misfortune of France was that the supremacy of geometry coincided {{with the opening of the}} great era of political discussion. The definitions of Montesquieu's famous book, which opened the political movement in literature, have been shown to be less those of a jurisconsult than of a geometer.[211] Social truths, with all their profound complexity, were handled like propositions in Euclid, and logical deductions from arbitrary premises were treated as accurate representations of real circumstance. The repulse of geometry to its proper rank came too late.|$|R
50|$|Bijay Mandal is a {{building}} with a layout plan of 74 mx82 m dimensions, with a well proportioned square dome. It cannot be categorized as a tower or a palace. It is a typical Toghlaqi structure with an octagonal plan built in rubble masonry (with massive battered sloping walls on east, west and southern directions) on a raised platform with door ways in each cardinal direction. The purpose of this unusual structure and {{the ruins of the}} Sar Dara Palace was described by Ibn Battuta as the palace with multiple chambers and the large public audience hall as the famed Hazar Sutan Palace. It was also interpreted as serving as an observation tower to monitor the activities of his troops. The ambience of the place presented it as place to relax and enjoy the scenic view of the environs. The inclined path around the monument was a walkway leading to the apartments of the Sultan. Two large openings in the living rooms of the floor were inferred as leading to the vaults or the treasury. On the level platform, outside the building in front of the apartment rooms, small holes equally spaced are seen, which have been inferred to be holes used to <b>fix</b> wooden <b>pillars</b> to hold a temporary shamiana (pavilion) or cover. The process of ushering people into the presence of the Sultan was devious and formal involving entry through semi - public places to private chambers to the audience hall. The debate on whether the Hazara Sutan Palace cited as existing during Allauddin Khilji reign and also during Togluq's time {{are one and the same}} palace, has not been conclusive. A plausible hypothesis is that the stone hall of the palace was built by Allauddin Khilji while the tower adjoining the stone buildings was surely built by Mohammed bin Toghluq.|$|R

A window is located to left of door to the cell. The cell also has traces of painting. The half cell has a bench. The second dwelling has a middle room, a half cell to the left, and a cell, reached from the right of the half cell. The middle room has a bench. The half cell has a recess in its back wall, along with a bench. A grooved door leads from the half-cell to the cell, which also has a bench. A window in the right cell overlooks in to the middle room. In front of the doorway is a bench. The third and largest of the three dwellings consists of a middle hall. At the back wall of the hall there are two cells and two seat recesses. Along the right and rear walls runs a bench. The right cell as well as the left cell have grooved doorways, a window {{to the left of the}} doorway and a bench along each of their rear walls. In front of the hall door is a bench. In front of the broken veranda are holes for <b>fixing</b> wooden <b>pillars.</b> To the left of the veranda are two cisterns. Between cave 17 and cave 18, there are three other cisterns. In the recess of the first cistern, an inscription reads translated: [...] "A meritorious gift of a cistern by Saghaka a goldsmith, son of Kudira of Kalyana." [...] Another inscription in the recess of the second cistern reads translated: [...] "A meritorious gift of a cistern by Lachhinika (wife) of Torika the Na daka [...] Nadabalika, wife of Isimulasami." ...|$|R
