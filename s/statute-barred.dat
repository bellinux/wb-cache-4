This meant that other claims against the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 would only be admissible {{if they had been}} lodged by 10 July 1996 (i.e. six years from the House of Lords' decision of 9 July 1990 granting Factortame interim relief), if not such claims were <b>statute-barred.</b> The judge therefore rejected claims by Factortame in respect of other fishing vessels which had been refused registration under the 1988 Act, but which had not formed part of the original claim lodged in 1988, nor had been claimed before July 1996.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} the controversial proceedings against Baltasar Garzón, Spain’s best-known judge. These proceedings and Garzón's own {{investigations of the}} crimes of the Franco era have thrown up {{a large number of}} issues about the retrospective application of justice to conflicts, such as the Spanish Civil War, apparently consigned to history. After examining the historical record of the crimes of the Franco regime this article goes on to look at the 2007 law of Historical Memory as Spain’s first transitional measure to face up to this past. It then {{considers the}} grounds both in international and domestic law for Garzón’s investigation of these crimes as crimes against humanity. The three major obstacles to such a prosecution — retroactivity of international crimes not clearly defined at the time, the issue whether the crimes are <b>statute-barred</b> and the application of the 1977 Amnesty Law are considered in turn. This constitutes the background to the current prosecution of Garzón for prevaricación, misuse of judicial powers, and the question whether Spanish amnesty can be overcome by prosecutions in other countries, e. g. Argentina, under their rules of universal jurisdiction...|$|E
40|$|The {{destination}} of the twopart dissertation is, the Grass-research, and {{the activity of}} the GDR-Ministry of Security (MfS), on this work. The aim is to complete the contempoary historic research. The analysis of the methods of the MfS to take influence on the literary life in the Federal Republic of Germany from 1950 till 1989 shows, that there was an influence in two different ways: By "skimmin" and "decomposition". Therefore it's necessary to evaluate the documents of the "Bundesbeauftragter für die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik (BStU) " where being collect around 500 -pages concerning Grass. The problem to get allowance for research is detailed described in the report of activity of the BstU in 2001. It's necessary, that every concerning person must be informed before starting research. In case of "Grass" was hold out a prospect by the BStU in 2002. But the highest court in Germany has decided in the prejustice case of "Helmut Kohl" on 8. of March 2002, that without allowance by the concerning person research in these documents is impossible. The inquiry therefore is concentrated on the facts described in documents of the federal archives. In this way it's possible to evaluate direct influence. But it is remarkable, that the documents and there describing never give an objective picture of the real life, because conditional by oppression of state a subjective influenced behavior of the police-spy is veritable. If the subject of investigation is reduced to the formulation "writers and state security in the FRG" reference can be made to a parallel examination "Sicherungsbereich Literatur (security sector literature) " published in 1996 including the subtitle "writers and state security in the GDR". Specific questions are discussed followed by investigations of facts: - Is there any intervention from the Stasi (state security service) evident on Grass in his novel "Ein weites Feld (A Wide Field) "? - Which of the Unofficial Collaborators (IM) of the ministry of state security and its leading IMs (FIM) had an influence on Grass according to their security political interest and organizations of the GDR by using which means and methods? In which space of time? What was their result? What was their aim? - How does Grass document in his novel his political outlook towards the ministry of state security? Three main sources of investigation were used. Is any punishment against his informers feared by Grass according to the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court from 15. 05. 1995 relevant or <b>statute-barred?</b> Which further documents are stored up in the "Foundation Archives of the parties and mass organizations of the GDR in the Federal Archives" (SAPMO) in Berlin-Lichterfelde besides those stored up in the BStU? The investigations at this institution followed the maxim to examine 96 if ever possible 96 records of different origin and perspective to shed light on historical facts. The third source of investigations were the archives of the arts academy containing the archives of G. Grass. It was to sort out if and in how far Grass was a victim, offender, or fellow traveller of the ministry of state security. Concerning the question of being an offender first of all the supposition of innocence was applied. -= Grass was considered to be a "hostile negative" writer; was he manipulated as such? -= If {{at the end of the}} novel Fonty reconciles (778) with Hoftaller, does this mean the same for Grass and his informers? Dealing with Dieter Stolz, Germanist and under cover investigator of Grass, is to demonstrate the connection between the political and the germanistic character of the dissertation. The investigation of literature was carried out by Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) and by search machine Google at the university library...|$|E
