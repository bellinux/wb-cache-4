40|$|A 52 -year-old Japanese woman {{complaining}} of horizontal double vision for 10 days {{was admitted to}} our hospital. Neurological examination revealed left abducent nerve palsy and muscle swelling in her thighs. Brain MRI showed obstruction in the spinal fluid space of the left Dorello 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>canal,</b> which transmits {{a portion of the}} abducent nerve. In Ga- 67 -enhanced citrate scintigraphy, wide accumulation was seen in her bilateral thighs, lower legs, and gluteus muscles. Muscular MRI showed a star-shaped central structure on short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images, and the three stripes sign on T 2 -weighted images. These MRI findings indicated nodular-type muscular sarcoidosis. A muscle biopsy from the quadriceps femoris showed granulomatous epithelioid giant cells and non-necrotizing chronic lymphadenitis, which also indicate sarcoidosis. Her condition was considered to be caused by sarcoid granulomas obstructing Dorello 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>canal.</b> She was treated with oral prednisolone (1 mg·kg- 1 ·day- 1) and her symptoms and MRI findings improved. This is the first known report of abducent nerve impairment in Dorello 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>canal,</b> other than fetal hypoplasia. Brain MRI, muscular MRI, and muscle biopsy are useful for the diagnosis of abducent nerve palsy, and {{it is important to consider}} Dorello 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>canal</b> obstruction by sarcoidosis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{demonstrate}} {{the organization of}} the spiral ganglion in the mammalian species. METHODS: Temporal bone (TB) specimens from man (n = 2), monkey (n = 2), lion (n = 2) and cat (n = 20) were stained, decalcified and dissected according to the Sudan black B method of Rasmussen. These TB specimens were examined under a Zeiss operating microscope and photographed with a Canon 100 camera interfaced with the microscope. RESULTS: Spiral ganglion cells occurred in clusters within Rosenthal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>canal</b> in all four species. The location of the clusters was marked by the interface between axon and dendritic bundles as well as groups of ganglion cells. In monkey and man the clusters were more separated than in lion and cat. CONCLUSIONS: These observations indicate that the spiral ganglion forms clusters of neurons within Rosenthal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>canal</b> at the basal cochlear turn in the mammals investigated here.

40|$|Proper {{structural}} {{organization of}} spiral ganglion (SG) innervation {{is crucial for}} normal hearing function. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental formation of this precise organization remain not well understood. Here, we report in the developing mouse cochlea that deleted in colorectal cancer (Dcc) contributes to the proper organization of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) within the Rosenthal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>canal</b> and of SGN projections toward both the peripheral and central auditory targets. In Dcc mutant embryos, mispositioning of SGNs occurred along the peripheral auditory pathway with misrouted afferent fibers and reduced synaptic contacts with hair cells. The central auditory pathway simultaneously exhibited similar defective phenotypes as in the periphery with abnormal exit of SGNs from the Rosenthal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>canal</b> towards central nuclei. Furthermore, the axons of SGNs ascending into the cochlear nucleus had disrupted bifurcation patterns. Thus, Dcc is necessary for establishing the proper spatial organization of SGNs and their fibers in both peripheral and central auditory pathways, through controlling axon targeting and cell migration. Our results suggest that Dcc {{plays an important role}} in the developmental formation of peripheral and central auditory circuits, and its mutation may contribute to sensorineural hearing loss...|$|R

Although the river mouth is breached during floods, {{most of the time}} the normal flow is diverted through an artificially dug canal and only reaches the ocean at Crookhaven Heads.

40|$|Tis essay {{examines}} U. S. {{efforts to}} control the mosquito vectors of malaria and yellow fever during {{the construction of the}} Panama Canal. Before the discovery that mosquitoes transmitted malaria and yellow fever, most observers assumed these diseases were an entrenched part of tropical nature. But when the United States entered Panama in 1904 to begin their turn at canal building, they came not only with their own ideas about the tropics, but also as beneficiaries of the vector discoveries and thus with new tools for fighting tropical fevers. Te result was a sanitary effort, led by William Gorgas and supported by a growing community of sanitarians and entomologists, which rid the canal zone of yellow fever and reduced the incidence of malaria. American officials and observers claimed that their sanitary efforts provided an object lesson in how to conquer the tropics. But a closer look at mosquito control in Panama reveals a different story. Sanitarians and entomologists noted that mosquito control usually involved attacking breeding grounds created by the environmental and social changes that came with U. <b>S.</b> <b>canal</b> building.
