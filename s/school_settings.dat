25|$|Traditional job {{roles for}} school psychologists {{employed}} in <b>school</b> <b>settings</b> have focused mainly on assessment of students to determine their eligibility for special education services in schools, and on consultation with teachers and other school professionals to design and carry out interventions on behalf of students.

25|$|While {{psychological}} {{knowledge is}} often {{applied to the}} assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. The majority of psychologists are involved {{in some kind of}} therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or <b>school</b> <b>settings.</b> Many do scientific research {{on a wide range of}} topics related to mental processes and behavior, and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings (e.g., medical schools, hospitals). Some are employed in industrial and organizational settings, or in other areas such as human development and aging, sports, health, and the media, as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of law.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} over the relative strengths {{of different types of}} research. Because randomized trials provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes. In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments. Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods. On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective, or the difficulty of assuring rigid control of the independent variable in fluid, real <b>school</b> <b>settings.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Counseling at the Crossroads: The {{perspectives}} and promise {{of school counselors}} in American education, the largest survey {{of high school and}} middle school counselors in the United States (over 5,300 interviews), was released by the College Board's National Office for School Counselor Advocacy, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the American School Counselor Association. The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, and how many of them, especially in urban and rural <b>school</b> <b>settings,</b> are not given the chance to focus on what they were trained to do, especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. School counselors made strong suggestions about their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that school counselors can be key players in student success. Implications for public policy and district and school-wide change are addressed. The National Center for Transforming School Counseling at The Education Trust released a brief, Poised to Lead: How School Counselors Can Drive Career and College Readiness, challenging all schools to utilize school counselors for equity and access for rigorous courses for all students and ensuring college and career access skills and competencies be a major focus of the work of school counselors K-12.|$|E

2500|$|The {{costs of}} youth {{exclusion}} {{can be measured}} in terms of its multi-dimensional nature. This includes how the intersection of race, gender, class and social location affect youth's ability to access employment, education or other social networks that are imperative to their transition to adulthood. Exclusion can preserve negative prejudices or stereotypes within a culture. Urban youth in America face greater prejudice in environments in which ethnic minorities face minimal intergroup contact in peer settings like school. Gendered differences continue to be problematic in this situation as well. Girls prove to be more sensitive to recognizing racial exclusion among their peers since they also face gender discrimination in <b>school</b> <b>settings.</b> Cultural norms associated with gender play a pivotal role in the perpetuation of the division between excluders and the excluded, creating unequal opportunities among youth. Barriers to social organizations and opportunities can result in unwanted consequences including crime and violence. There are many examples in which youth have formed groups that oppose oppressive and exclusionary governments through violent demonstrations, especially among African nations. These violent reactions also lead to concerns about youth politics, youth identity and the future well-being of nations facing this type of conflict with their youth populations. Indian youth experiencing [...] "timepass" [...] also show signs of increased aggression. Specifically this aggression has been directed towards women, since young men feel powerless in their current state of unemployment.|$|E
2500|$|Calorie-dense, {{prepared}} snacks {{are available}} in many locations frequented by children. [...] As childhood obesity has become more prevalent, snack vending machines in <b>school</b> <b>settings</b> have been reduced by law in {{a small number of}} localities. [...] Some research suggests that the increase in availability of junk foods in schools can account for about one-fifth of the increase in average BMI among adolescents over the last decade. Eating at fast food restaurants is very common among young people with 75% of 7th to 12th grade students consuming fast food in a given week. [...] The fast food industry is also at fault for the rise in childhood obesity. This industry spends about $4.2 billion on advertisements aimed at young children. McDonald's alone has thirteen websites that are viewed by 365,000 children and 294,000 teenagers each month. In addition, fast food restaurants give out toys in children's meals, which helps to entice children to buy the fast food. Forty percent of children ask their parents to take them to fast food restaurants on a daily basis. To make matters worse, out of 3000 combinations created from popular items on children's menus at fast food restaurants, only 13 meet the recommended nutritional guidelines for young children. Some literature has found a relationship between fast food consumption and obesity. [...] Including a study which found that fast food restaurants near schools increases the risk of obesity among the student population.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper employs sociological {{literature}} on risk and the commodification {{of education to}} explain current schooling practices {{in a context of}} increased concerns about students’ behaviour and results on standardised tests of achievement. Drawing upon teacher and student learning practices in three school sites in south-east Queensland, Australia, the article reveals how specific tests, packages and programmes have been employed as technologies of governance to minimise the risk of adverse student behaviour, maximise student outcomes on standardised tests, and provide teachers with discrete learning experiences construed as improving such outcomes. The sum total of these foci is the construction of education as an increasingly ‘risky business’ which employs a myriad of products and tests to manage perceived and actual risks. The paper also reveals how these products and processes constitute student misbehaviour and inadequate teacher and student learning as ‘risk objects’ requiring constant intervention, but which also inhibit inclusion in <b>schooling</b> <b>settings,</b> and challenge teachers’ professionalism...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in health promotion interventions which seek to change behaviour through local cultural diffusion by trained opinion-formers. This study adapted {{this approach to}} <b>schools</b> <b>settings.</b> Popular pupils in years 8 and 9 (aged 12 to 14) were recruited for intensive training by specialist staff on how to intervene effectively in everyday situations to promote smoking cessation and prevention of smoking uptake among their peers. Data on smoking behaviour, plus saliva samples for cotinine testing, were collected pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and three months post-intervention in two intervention and two control schools. Most differences in behaviour between intervention and control schools were not statistically significant. However, baseline ex-smokers (11 per cent of the sample and a larger group than baseline regular smokers) {{were significantly more likely}} still to be abstinent in the intervention, as opposed to the control, schools. Given the relative paucity of evidence of effective anti-smoking programmes in schools, these results are sufficiently encouraging to justify a full-scale randomised controlled trial evaluation...|$|R
