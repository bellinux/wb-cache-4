In a live video chat with his fans via Ustream, Moss stated, [...] "I wanna play football. Your boy is going to come back here and play some football, so I'm really excited.

2500|$|As soon as {{the results}} of the March 9, 2008 {{primaries}} were announced, NPP's Second Vice President, Miriam Ramírez de Ferrer, announced her immediate resignation, saying [...] "Effectively right now I am no longer the Second Vice President of this party. You will not see me ever again involved in active politics, party reunions or party meetings, as I now plan to become a private citizen. There's a lot of things I haven't done I want to do, and I'll also do <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have to do to help the statehood cause". Ramírez was a candidate for Resident Commissioner in the primaries and was openly supporting Rosselló. She lost to Fortuño's candidate, Pedro Pierluisi, and to another Rosselló supporter who was also defeated, former Senate President, Charlie Rodríguez. When Ramírez was asked by the media if she will vote for Fortuño, she replied [...] "My vote is secret".|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} album with the Chicago Sun-Times, Fiasco has stated: [...] "Lasers {{is a great}} album. I'm {{actually}} happy with the record. I feel I got to say what I wanted even with -- It doesn't make up for {{what it took to}} get through it. It's still being argued and debated upon. ... The climate of this record was very weird, in some instances surreal. I became very abstract. I had to create this commercial art that appeases the corporate side. I had to acquiesce to certain forces. Hopefully within that I snuck in <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> actually wanted to say any way I can." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, Fiasco has expressed that during the recording process of the album he has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts: [...] "It was mentally destructive. I say it with a certain laissez-faire now because I'm past it [...] I was super-depressed, lightly suicidal, at moments medium suicidal – and if not suicidal, willing to just walk away from it all completely." ...|$|E

2500|$|Omm Seti {{had once}} said [...] "Death holds no terror for me...I'll just {{do my best}} to get through the Judgment. I'm going to come before Osiris, who will {{probably}} give me a few dirty looks because I know I've committed <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't have." [...] Because the Muslims and Christians wouldn't let [...] "a heathen" [...] be buried in their graveyards, Omm Sety built her own underground tomb decorated with a false door. Through this door the Ka was believed to travel between this world and the next, and it was engraved with an offering prayer in conformance with ancient beliefs. The staff of Chicago House gave her an imitation Shawabti figurine to place in the tomb. On 10 April 1981 she gave away her two cats as her condition deteriorated. On 15 April she received a letter from Olivia Robertson confirming that Omm Sety had been enrolled in the Fellowship of Isis, an interfaith spiritual movement focused on the goddess, on 23 March. On 21 April 1981 Omm Sety died in Abydos. The local health authority refused to allow her to be buried in the tomb she had constructed, so she was interred in an unmarked grave, facing the west, in the desert outside a Coptic cemetery.|$|E
