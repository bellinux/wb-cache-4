25|$|In 2005, Volvo {{presented}} {{the second generation}} of Volvo C70, which came with extra stiff door-mounted inflatable <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> (the {{first of its kind}} in a convertible) dubbed 'DMIC'.|$|E
25|$|Drop Head Coupé: Often {{abbreviated}} to DHC. Generally a European term {{referring to a}} 2-door, 4 place automobile with a retractable canvas / cloth top with both a padded headliner and rollup windows (as opposed to <b>side</b> <b>curtains).</b>|$|E
25|$|Roadster: Originally a two-seat open {{car with}} minimal weather {{protection}} — without top or side glass — though possibly with optional hard or soft top and <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> (i.e., without roll-up glass windows). In modern usage, the term means simply a two-seat sports car convertible, {{a variation of}} spyder.|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2001 model year, <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags became {{available}} as an optional feature. The optional <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags were only {{available on the}} 2001 to 2002 model Saturn SL1 and SL2 sedans.|$|R
5000|$|In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's frontal {{offset test}} the Colorado (extended version) {{is given a}} [...] "Good" [...] overall score, however the crew cab is rated [...] "Acceptable". In the side impact test, the Colorado crew cab is rated [...] "Poor" [...] with or without <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags. [...] <b>Side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags were made {{standard}} on all 2010 models; side torso airbags are not offered.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) the Cobalt {{receives}} an overall top score of [...] "Good" [...] for front collisions.However, it receives a [...] "Poor" [...] overall score for side impacts without <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags, and an [...] "Acceptable" [...] overall score with <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags. In 2008 <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags became standard but the Cobalt's structure {{remains the same}} and consequently in structure/safety category of the IIHS's side impact test the Cobalt receives a [...] "Marginal" [...] score. Side airbags are limited to the curtain type, torso type side airbags are unavailable. According to the IIHS's injury measurements taken from the side impact test the driver's torso is given a [...] "Marginal" [...] score.|$|R
25|$|The D.8 was a {{tailless}} four bay unstaggered biplane {{with its}} wings swept at 32°. Its constant chord wings were built up around two spruce spars, the forward one forming the leading edge. To help achieve stability the incidence and interplane gap decreased outboard, the former becoming negative. This washout on tips well behind {{the centre of}} gravity provided longitudinal stability {{in the same way}} as a conventional tailplane, set at lower incidence than the wings. Camber increased outwards. Simple, near parallel, pairs of interplane struts joined the spars. The outer interplane struts were enclosed with fabric, forming fixed <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> that provided directional (yaw) stability. Wing tip elevons were used for control, operated by a pair of levers, one either side of the pilot. The D.8 initially used just a pair of these, mounted on the upper wing, a rectangular cutout in the <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> allowing for their movement as on the D.5. Large parts of the aircraft were built by Short Brothers.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, the KR200 Kabrio {{model was}} released, {{featuring}} a cloth convertible top and fixed side window frames. This {{was followed by}} the KR201 Roadster without window frames, using a folding cloth top, a windscreen, and removable <b>side</b> <b>curtains.</b> A Sport Roadster was later offered with no top and with the canopy fixed into place so that the driver would have to climb in and out {{at the top of the}} car.|$|E
25|$|The framed tent (1965–1967). This is {{the largest}} and most {{colorful}} of the Westfalia side tents. It's different from the earlier small and large awning-based tents in two important ways: the addition of large, screened windows on the <b>side</b> <b>curtains,</b> and a free-standing frame that allows the tent to be left at the campsite while the bus is driven away for groceries or side trips. The tent also has a rear door that can be zipped closed at such times. Both front and rear flaps can be rolled up and held open by cloth ties or (on later models) straps with lift-the-dot fasteners.|$|E
50|$|The Silverado comes {{standard}} with four-wheel ABS. StabiliTrak and <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags are optional {{on certain}} trim levels.|$|R
50|$|The NHTSA {{stated that}} Coda Automotive must replace both <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags {{in all of}} the 117 cars sold.|$|R
50|$|There are {{essentially}} {{two types of}} side airbags commonly used today: the side torso airbag and the <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbag.|$|R
25|$|The car is spartan, {{although}} it features inflatable lumbar support and adjustable seats. Along with {{the absence of}} exterior door handles, the vehicle lacks side windows and a roof. Although a soft top cover was available, it was designed primarily for indoor vehicle storage. <b>Side</b> <b>curtains</b> of fabric and clear plastic operated by zippers can be inserted into the door and hand-bolted when needed. All of these decisions were made to reduce weight. The battery {{is located in the}} sealed compartment over the rear wheels to increase rear-end weight and traction. The car shipped with a tonneau cover and video tape on soft-top assembly (the soft top is removable and folds to fit in the trunk). In 1994 the car came, {{for the first time since}} release with several options available to the buyer. These included air conditioning, adjustable suspension, larger diameter wheels to accommodate larger brakes, and a fiberglass hardtop for the roof.|$|E
2500|$|The Eardley Billing Tractor Biplane replica {{flown by}} David Watson {{appeared}} in two guises, in {{more or less}} authentic form, impersonating an early German tractor biplane, and also as the Japanese pilot's mount, modified with boxkite-like <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> over the interplane struts, a covered fuselage, and colourful [...] "oriental" [...] decorations.|$|E
2500|$|The Zonda Roadster F debuted at the 2006 Geneva auto show. It {{was similar}} to the coupé, but with a {{removable}} carbon fibre roof and canvas <b>side</b> <b>curtains,</b> weighing just [...] more than the coupe, and output increased to [...] and [...] [...] Production of the Roadster F was limited to 25 units.|$|E
50|$|For 2008, Ford added <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags {{across the}} Explorer range. Also, the {{optional}} satellite navigation system was also upgraded with voice control.|$|R
50|$|The Yeti {{could be}} ordered {{with up to}} 9 airbags (dual front, front side torso, rear <b>side</b> torso, <b>side</b> <b>curtain,</b> and driver's knee airbag).|$|R
50|$|The Tacoma comes {{standard}} with anti-lock brakes, brake assist, {{and electronic}} brakeforce distribution. For 2008, a rollover sensor was added which would deploy the <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags {{in the event}} of rollover in Tacomas equipped with the optional side airbags. Beginning with the 2009 model year, all Tacomas feature Toyota's Star Safety System which added Vehicle Stability Control and traction control. Front row side torso airbags and <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags for both rows also become standard as well as active head restraints.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was judged a success and Voisin manufactured {{a number of}} examples. There are variations between the individual production aircraft: the two examples flown in the French military aircraft trials in 1911 had a wingspan of [...]; one was powered by a [...] Renault and the second by a [...] Gnome. [...] The number of sets of <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> varied, some aircraft having two or even three sets.|$|E
2500|$|SO-23 deluxe camper (1958–1965). Two tent {{options were}} {{available}} during this period. One {{was similar to}} the 1952–1958 awning, with the addition of removable <b>side</b> <b>curtains,</b> and the other was a small vestibule or foyer that only covered the side door area. These had no names other than [...] "large tent" [...] and [...] "small tent," [...] and the larger one seems to have been available with and without a bathroom as described below.|$|E
2500|$|... "The CSR is {{not built}} for long-distance highway travel. Although the ride quality {{falls short of}} punishing, I had {{strongly}} discourage using the car for emergency surgery. The otherwise comfy seats move fore and aft, but the rake is fixed, which can be-and was for me-a real pain. Speaking of driver discomforts, there's no dead pedal for your left foot, and your right thigh gets a good grilling from the aluminum transmission tunnel. The snap-shut <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> cannot be raised or lowered like conventional windows, so you're either freezing or sweltering." ...|$|E
50|$|Canadian Mazda3s {{received}} standard {{seat mounted}} side-airbags and body shell mounted <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags across the model range. Previously both airbag types were not available.|$|R
50|$|Safety {{equipment}} includes standard dual front airbags, front side-impact airbags, <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags, anti-lock brakes, traction control, electronic stability control, and a tire-pressure monitoring system.|$|R
5000|$|Seven {{standard}} airbags [...] include dual-stage front airbags, driver's knee airbag, front seat-mounted side airbags, 2-row <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags {{and fuel}} pump cut-off switch with airbag deployment.|$|R
2500|$|The Green {{engine was}} later {{replaced}} by an [...] 7-cylinder Gnome rotary engine. [...] This engine also powered the second aircraft, which was a two-seater with the pilot placed {{just ahead of the}} wing leading edge and the passenger (who had dual control) at the trailing edge. [...] There were now control surfaces on both upper and lower wings, the <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> having a pair of tapered notches to allow them to move. Each of the upper wings carried a pair of elevons, nearly doubling the control surface area.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fasten the <b>side</b> <b>curtains,</b> Phil; I'll {{help with}} the chains!" [...] sang out Dave, and while the shipowner's son and Bert {{fastened}} the curtains, so as {{to keep out the}} driving rain, our hero aided Roger.|$|E
60|$|As it {{was quite}} warm, Clayton had left the <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> thrown back over the roof, and as they sat, like Turks, upon their blankets, Lady Alice, {{straining}} her eyes into the darkening shadows of the wood, suddenly reached out and grasped Clayton's arms.|$|E
5000|$|... "Top safety pick" [...] {{from the}} Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for its {{standard}} safety technology: safety canopy <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> {{air bags and}} AdvanceTrac with roll stability control ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1989: Manac {{begins its}} {{expansion}} towards {{a wide range}} of products and launches two brand new products to the market: <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> flatbeds and steel walls chip vans.|$|R
50|$|A {{woman who}} has {{suffered}} brain injury talks about <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags and explains that before her crash she knew nothing about them, whilst now she is an expert.|$|R
6000|$|They {{drove to}} the birch grove on the south shore of Lake Minniemashie. Dave Dyer was his most clownish self. He yelped, jigged, wore Carol's hat, dropped an ant down Fern's back, and when they went {{swimming}} (the women modestly changing {{in the car with}} the <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> up, the men undressing behind the bushes, constantly repeating, [...] "Gee, hope we don't run into poison ivy"), Dave splashed water on them and dived to clutch his wife's ankle. He infected the others. Erik gave an imitation of the Greek dancers he had seen in vaudeville, and when they sat down to picnic supper spread on a lap-robe on the grass, Cy climbed a tree to throw acorns at them.|$|E
6000|$|They put McNutt on {{the back}} seat with Louise, cautioned him to be quiet, and then drove away. Dan Brayley's place was two miles distant, but in answer to Peggy's earnest inquiry if she knew the way Beth {{declared}} she could find it blind-folded. In a few moments Louise had engaged the agent in a spirited discussion of the absorbing [...] "mystery" [...] and so occupied his attention that he paid no heed to the direction they had taken. The back seat was hemmed in by <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> and the canopy, so it would be no wonder if he lost all sense of direction, even had not the remarks of the girl at his side completely absorbed him.|$|E
60|$|There {{were many}} {{thoughtful}} features which fitted the Touricar {{for use in}} camping--extra-sized baggage-box whose triangular shape made the car more nearly streamline, special folding silk tents, folding aluminum cooking-utensils, electric stove run by current from the car, electric-battery light attached to a curtain-rod. But the distinctive feature, the one which Carl could patent, was {{the means by which}} a bed was made up inside the car as Pullman seats are turned into berths. The back of the front seat was hinged, and dropped back to horizontal. The upholstery back of the back seat could be taken out and also placed on the horizontal. With blankets spread on the level space thus provided, with the extra-heavy top and <b>side</b> <b>curtains</b> in place, and the electric light switched on, tourists had a refuge cleaner than a country hotel and safer than a tent....|$|E
5000|$|... 2002: <b>Side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags {{were made}} {{available}} as standard {{equipment for the}} 2002 model year for the sedan models only. The Saturn L100 was discontinued after the 2002 model year.|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} C4 Picasso has six airbags by default, with adjustable pressures; two airbags for the front, two lateral for the passengers, and two <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags to prevent head injuries.|$|R
25|$|All models come {{standard}} with side torso airbags, <b>side</b> <b>curtain</b> airbags, {{anti-lock braking}} and electronic brakeforce distribution. For the 2010 model the previously optional Vehicle Stability Control and traction control systems became standard.|$|R
