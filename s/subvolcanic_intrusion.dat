40|$|The term ldquomud volcano systemrdquo is coined to {{describe}} the set of structures associated with a constructional edifice (mud volcano) and feeder complex that connects the volcano to its source stratigraphic unit. Three-dimensional (3 -D) seismic data from the South Caspian Basin are used to investigate the structural elements and evolution of these systems. Mud volcano systems initiate via early, kilometer-scale, biconic edifices termed ldquopioneerrdquo cones. These are fed by fluidization pipes tens of meters in width. Subsequent kilometer-scale mud volcanoes grew via persistent extrusion, fed by numerous additional fluidization pipes injected in the country rock. This <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>intrusion</b> complex creates a densely intruded, cylindrical zone, similar in cross section to gryphon swarms observed at an outcrop onshore. Wall rock erosion and compaction of the intruded zone leads {{to the collapse of}} a downward-tapering cone enveloping the cylindrical zone, capped by ring faults that define a kilometer-scale caldera that downthrows the overlying mud volcano. Mud volcanoes get buried during basin subsidence and can look like intrusive laccoliths at first glance on seismic data. Reactivation of mud flow through a conduit system generates a stack of superimposed mud volcanoes through time. Large volcanoes continue to dewater during burial and may locally remobilize. This model of mud volcano evolution has similarities with igneous and salt tectonic systems. To reduce drilling and geologic uncertainty, mud volcano system extent and impacts on a reservoir can be assessed on 3 -D seismic data...|$|E

The acid <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>intrusion,</b> which is in contact or close to sever-al altered domains, mainly consists of porphyritic granodiorite and trondhjemite. The Pu-kala intrusion was emplaced into volcanic sequence in an island-arc or fore-arc setting be-fore or {{during the early stages}} of the main regional deformation phase of the Svecofennian orogeny. On the basis of the geochemical data, the Pukala intrusion is a peraluminous vol-canic-arc granitoid. After crystallisation at 1896 ± 3 Ma, multiphase deformation and meta-morphism caused alteration, recrystallisation, and orientation of the minerals, and tilted the intrusion steeply towards south. The 1851 ± 5 Ma U-Pb age for titanite is connected to the late stages of the Svecofennian tectonometamorphic evolution of the region. Several hydrothermally altered domains are located in the felsic and intermediate meta-volcanic rocks of the Tampere Belt within less than one kilometre south of the Puka-la intrusion. Alteration is divided into three basic types: partial silica alteration, chlorite-sericite±silica alteration, and sericite alteration in shear zones. The fi rst two types probably formed during the emplacement and crystallisation of the Pukala intrusion, and the third is linked to late shearing. Intense sericitisation and comb quartz bands in the contact of the intrusion and the altered domain at Kutemajärvi suggest that the hydrothermal system was driven by the Pukala intrusion...|$|E

The intrusion of a laccolith of stratiform dolerite in partially consolidated marly sediments at quite shallow depths below the ocean floor {{took place during the}} intracontinental rifting phase of the Subbetic zone of the Betic Cordilleras. In the first stage, contact metamorphism caused the crystallization of calc-silicate consisting of grossular andradite garnet, diopside, vesuvianite and titanite for which the upper temperature limit was 500 °C. Phyllosilicates are found in a network of veins cross-cutting the carbonate and calc-silicate matrix, indicating their formation during a process of hydrothermal alteration superimposed on the contact aureole. In the area closest to the subvolcanic rocks, saponite is the main phyllosilicate although some dispersed chlorite is found. In the zone furthest from the contact, corrensite together with saponite and beidellitic smectites were observed. The presence of low-temperature phases (saponite) in the area closest to the laccolith reveals the evolution of the hydrothermal system toward cooler conditions. In the early stage, the circulation of a hot hydrothermal fluid caused the crystallization of chlorite in the area surrounding the subvolcanic body and corrensite in the more distal area, which might have begun even during the contact metamorphism stage. A cooling phase followed, resulting in the crystallization of saponite in the host rocks, and the crystallization of dioctahedral and trioctahedral smectites inside the subvolcanic body.

The modeling provides insight into {{the evolution of the}} hydrothermal system and evaluates key geologic parameters and their influence on fluid-flow, hydrothermal circulation, and the genesis of massive sulfide orebodies. The model simulates important aspects of the Panorama massive sulfide district, such as temperature distribution, relative alteration zonation, and the size and distribution of orebodies. Predicted temperatures ranging from 150 ºC {{at the top of the}} volcanic pile to 400 ºC at the andesite-diorite interface are comparable to temperature estimates based on previously published oxygen isotope mapping. Modeled fluid discharge temperatures are highest for the Sulphur Springs deposit (300 º– 400 ºC) and lower for the Kangaroo Caves and other deposits (250 º– 350 ºC). The most favorable conditions to reproduce the orebodies and their related alteration zonation occur at anisotropic rock permeabilities comparable to the upper oceanic crust (10 – 15 – 10 – 14 m 2) and higher fault permeabilities (10 – 14 – 10 – 13 m 2) with a specific fault arrangement similar to that mapped in the field.

40|$|A {{multiple}} {{basic to}} intermediate sill is {{reported for the}} first time in the south-eastern Iberian Ranges. It is composed of several tabular to irregular levels intercalated within the fluvial sediments of the Alcotas Formation (Middle-Upper Permian). The sill could represent the youngest Paleozoic <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>intrusion</b> in the Iberian Ranges. The igneous rocks are classified as basaltic andesites. They show a subophitic microstructure constituted by plagioclase (An 62 – An 6), augite (En 48 Wo 44 Fs 7 –En 46 Wo 39 Fs 15), pseudomorphosed olivine, minor amounts of oxides (magnetite and ilmenite) and accessory F-apatite. According to the mineralogy and whole-rock composition, their geochemical affinity is transitional from subalkaline to alkaline. Radiometric dating of the sill is not feasible due to its significant alteration. Field criteria, however, suggest an emplacement coeval to the deposition of the Alcotas Formation (Middle-Upper Permian). This hypothesis is supported by the transitional affinity of these rocks, similar to other Middle-Upper Permian magmatisms in the western Tethys, e. g., from the Pyrenees. Taking into account their isotopic signature (εSr: - 6. 8 to - 9. 2; εNd:+ 1. 7 to + 8. 3), an enriched mantle source with the involvement of a HIMU component has been identified. This interpretation is supported by the trace element contents. Some of these HIMU characteristics have been recognised in the Middle-Upper Permian magmatisms of the Central Pyrenees (Anayet Basin) and the High Atlas (Argana Basin). However, none of these source features are shared with other Middle-Upper Permian magmatisms of the western Tethys (Catalonian Coastal Ranges, Corsica-Sardinia and southern France), nor with the Lower Permian magmatism of the Iberian Ranges.

[...] Banded sphalerite-chalcopyrite-galena mineralisation generally overlies massive pyritite; the former two minerals are also common in the siliceous stockwork. Galena and tennantite become more common towards the hangingwall, apparently at the expense of chalcopyrite, while arsenopyrite is sporadically distributed.

[...] Tight to isoclinal folding, with faulting parallel to the axial planes, is the best developed phase (D 1) of the three documented deformation episodes. Recumbent folding is inferred to pre-date D 1 since the stratigraphy is inverted. Mobilisation of the more plastically deformed sulphides accompanied the development of the SI schistosity.
