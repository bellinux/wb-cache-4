30|$|Liquid-phase {{methods are}} {{inadequate}} for obtaining of electrode materials {{because of the}} high content of impurities in powders [5, 6]. Since the usual synthesis process comes from the formation of nickel hydroxide suspension [5, 6, 14, 15, 21 - 24], obtained powders contain a high concentration of sodium and potassium impurities. The use of tetra methyl ammonium and tetra ethyl ammonium instead of NaOH allowed the authors of papers [5, 6] to decrease sodium content in nickel powder from 95 to 8.7 to 9.5  ppm but simultaneously led to an increase of carbon content. In addition, the decrease of the particle size of powders in liquid-phase methods can be achieved by the addition of dispersants - polar organic compounds [3, 4, 14, 15, 21, 23, 25 - 27] or ammonia or <b>sodium</b> salts of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> [22, 26 - 28]; these lead to a rise of carbon in powder content from 1.5 to 4 wt. %.

During the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials with dilute acid, however, various kinds of inhibitors, especially large amounts of <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> will be produced, which substantially decrease the fermentability of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. To overcome the inhibitory effects of <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> it is critical to understand their impact on the growth and lipid accumulation of oleaginous microorganisms. Results In our present work, we investigated {{for the first time the}} effect of ten representative <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in lignocellulosic hydrolysates on the growth and lipid accumulation of oleaginous yeast Trichosporon fermentans cells. In contrast to previous reports, we found that the toxicity of the <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> to the cells was not directly related to their hydrophobicity. It is worth noting that most <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> tested were less toxic than aldehydes to the cells, and some could even stimulate the growth and lipid accumulation at a low concentration. Unlike aldehydes, most binary combinations of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> exerted no synergistic inhibitory effects on lipid production. The presence of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> decelerated the consumption of glucose, whereas it influenced the utilization of xylose in a different and complicated way. In addition, all the <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> tested, except furoic acid, inhibited the malic activity of T. fermentans. Furthermore, the inhibition of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> on cell growth was dependent more on inoculum size, temperature and initial pH than on lipid content. Conclusions This work provides some meaningful information about the effect of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> in lignocellulosic hydrolysates on the lipid production of oleaginous yeast, which is helpful for optimization of biomass hydrolysis processes, detoxified pretreatment of hydrolysates and lipid production using lignocellulosic materials. </p...|$|R

Formic to acetic acid ratios (F:A), previously an indicator of terrestrial versus marine sources of these <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> were similar for all back-trajectories reflecting anthropogenic impacts on F:A locally and regionally. The ratios of malonic to succinic acids (M:S), also an indicator of sources for these acids, indicated direct anthropogenic sources for terrestrial back-trajectories and secondary processes for marine back-trajectories. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{total of}} 120 {{finishing}} pigs ([Yorkshire×Landrace]×Duroc) {{with an average}} body weight (BW) of 49. 72 ± 1. 72 kg were used in 12 -wk trial to evaluate the effects of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal micro flora, meat quality and fecal gas emission. Pigs were randomly allotted {{to one of three}} dietary treatments (10 replication pens with 4 pigs per pen) in a randomly complete block design based on their initial BW. Each dietary treatment consisted of: Control (CON/basal diet), OA 1 (basal diet+ 0. 1 % <b>organic</b> <b>acids)</b> and OA 2 (basal diet+ 0. 2 % <b>organic</b> <b>acids).</b> Dietary treatment with protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends linearly improved (p< 0. 001) average daily gain during 0 to 6 week, 6 to 12 week as well as overall with the increase in their inclusion level in the diet. The dry matter, N, and energy digestibility was higher (linear effect, p< 0. 001) with the increase in the dose of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends during 12 week. During week 6, a decrease (linear effect, p = 0. 01) in fecal ammonia contents was observed with the increase in the level of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends on d 3 and d 5 of fermentation. Moreover, acetic acid emission decreased linearly (p = 0. 02) on d 7 of fermentation with the increase in the level of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends. During 12 weeks, linear decrease (p< 0. 001) in fecal ammonia on d 3 and d 5 and acetic acid content on d 5 of fermentation was observed with the increase in the level of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends. Supplementation of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends linearly increased the longissimus muscle area with the increasing concentration of <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> Moreover, color of meat increased (linear effect, quadratic effect, p< 0. 001, p< 0. 002 respectively) and firmness of meat showed quadratic effect (p = 0. 003) with the inclusion of increasing level of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> in the diet. During the 6 week, increment in the level of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends decreased (linear effect, p = 0. 01) Escherichia coli (E. coli) counts and increased (linear effect, p = 0. 004) Lactobacillus counts. During 12 -wk of experimental trial, feces from pigs fed diet supplemented with <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends showed linear reduction (p< 0. 001) of E. coli counts and the tendency of linear increase (p = 0. 06) in Lactobacillus count with the increase in the level of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends. In conclusion, 0. 2 % protected <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> blends positively affected growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal gas emission and meat quality in finishing pigs without any adverse effects on blood parameters...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Potassium is an {{essential}} element for plant growth and exists as four forms in soils: soluble, exchangeable, non-exchangeable, and mineral. Soluble and exchangeable K are considered as readily available and non-exchangeable K as slowly available. <b>Organic</b> matters and <b>acids</b> {{play an important role}} in increasing the bioavailability of nutrients especially potassium in the soils. <b>Organic</b> <b>acids</b> are low-molecular weight CHO containing compounds which are found in all organisms and which are characterized by the possession of one or more carboxyl groups. Depending on the dissociation properties and number of these carboxylic groups, <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> can carry varying negative charge, thereby allowing the complexation of metal cations in solution and the displacement of anions from the soil matrix. The ability of an <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> to release K from soils depends on some factors such as: diffusion rate of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> in soil, the diffusion capability of organic acid-element complexes, the contact time of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> on a mineral surface, the ionization of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid,</b> the functional group of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> and its position, and the chemical affinity between the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> and the mineral elements. This study was conducted in order to evaluate the effect of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> and vermicompost on transformation of K in some selected soils of Fars Province, southern Iran. Materials and Methods: In this study, nine soils with enough diversity were selected from different parts of Fars Province. The experiment was done as a completely randomized design with three replications, consisting of three incubation times (5, 15 and 60 days) and four organic compounds (including 2...|$|R

40|$|Weak <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> are {{frequently}} {{used as an}} inexpensive and effective intervention to reduce number and prevalence of bacterial pathogens on food products. Of all <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> evaluated in the literature, acetic and lactic acid {{are found to be}} the most acceptable. Mechanism of Inactivation The mechanism of inactivation by weak <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> lays down in the ability of undissociated form of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> to penetrate through the cell membrane, and to dissociate inside the cell, resulting in decreased intracellular pH value, which is essential for the control of ATP synthesis, RNA and protein synthesis, DNA replication and cell growth (Booth, 1985). Beside the decrease in intracellular pH, the perturbation of the membrane functions by <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> molecule might be also responsible for the microbial inactivation. The high concentration of anions (due to dissociation) inside the cells might result in an increased osmolarity and consequently to the metabolic perturbation (Hirshfield et al., 2003). As for other non-thermal inactivation treatments, the microbial sub-lethal injury might occur when the decontamination with <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is applied (Lee et al., 2002; Liao et al., 2003). Alexandrou et al. (1995) reported that weak <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> such as acetic and lactic acid showed greater ability to inflict the subpopulation of sub-lethal injured cells than stronger hydrochloric acid Factors affecting The efficiency of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions also increased with the decrease of pH in the solution (Van Netten et al., 1994).

30|$|Application of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> as {{preservative}} {{agents and}} disinfectants {{is a common}} practice in drug, cosmetic and food industries (Rico et al. 2007). Moreover, particular interest for different <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is continuously increasing worldwide creating thereby a necessity for production of huge quantities of these chemicals. From economical point of view, {{it is more important}} to produce concentrated as opposed to diluted acids because of the direct impact on the handling and transportation costs. However, handling and transportation of concentrated <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is extremely hazardous and special security means must be taken to avoid any poisoning risk and injuries. Moreover, the receiving industry must have special storage and adequate managing conditions for these chemicals. In this context, handling and managing of salts of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is suitable and easier because of the high level of safety and facility of storage and handling (Yoo et al. 2010; Luttrell 2012). Although the reactivity of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is higher than that of the conjugated salt, it is possible to convert a salt of an <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> to the acid form so as to obtain the desired reactivity. In this context, electrochemical activation (or simply “electro-activation”) of salt of an <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> allows its conversion to the acid form under safe conditions.|$|R
