In a coal fired power plant, <b>soot</b> <b>blowing</b> operation is commonly used as a cleaning mechanism inside the boiler.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a detailed investigation into fouling in biomass fired boilers according to fuel mixture, combustion conditions, transportation of particles by the flue gas and {{the probability of}} particles impinging and sticking onto heat transfer tubes. The effects of fouling on overall boiler performance and the efficacy of <b>soot</b> <b>blowing</b> are also investigated. Both theoretical simulations and practical experiments on a 157 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler are presented. The deposit thickness on and around a heat exchanger tube is shown to be mainly dependent on the ash particle size, as particles larger than 10 µm (Stokes number larger than 0. 1) mainly impinge on the windward side of tubes. The study also shows that fuel containing small amounts of chlorine and zinc – common elements in recycled wood – may cause both higher deposit growth rates and rapid increases in corrosion rates. These elements (chlorine and zinc), together with alkali metals from the biomass {{have the potential to}} form sticky compounds that increase the deposit growth rate. Reducing deposits by <b>soot</b> <b>blowing</b> is very effective at removing loose deposits but the hard sintered part of the deposits is almost unaffected. The use of recycled wood has a larger impact on the deposit growth rate than the <b>soot</b> <b>blowing</b> interval. Numerical simulations show that deposits on the superheater tubes redistribute the heat transfer rate from the superheaters to reheater 1 and partially redistribute turbine power from the high pressure turbine to the intermediate pressure turbin...|$|E

40|$|Fly ash {{components}} in the flue gas can stick onto heat exchanger tubes and cumulate into solid deposits. This fouling phenomenon is a common issue in fluidized bed boilers, where challenging fuels with possibly high and challenging ash content are often fired in. Basic characteristics of the phenomenon are discussed briefly, followed by a short review {{of research on the}} methods of modelling and predicting fouling tendency. A method to examine fouling through heat transfer calculations was tested in this thesis. Primary aim was to verify applicability of this selected method in real large-scale boilers via performing a retrospective analysis on earlier measurement data. Reference clean state heat transfer coefficients of certain heat exchangers were compared to calculated states by using data from control system log files, and the comparisons were formulated into thermal resistances of the deposit layer. The control system log files contained data from earlier measurement campaigns. Calculated thermal resistances increased along cumulating deposition, until a cleansing <b>soot</b> <b>blowing</b> pulse is actuated. Slopes of these rising thermal resistance curves were extracted, forming estimates of fouling rates per each fouling period. Calculated thermal resistance build-ups matched <b>soot</b> <b>blowing</b> operation times well with only a few exceptions, and so the selected method seemed to express actual fouling decently in general. Calculated resistances and fouling rates were compared to other operational factors, including main steam power, fuel feed variation and measured flue gas pressure change at studied heat exchangers. Certain findings were made, even though available data was not completely sufficient. While decent correlation with slight steam power changes was not identifiable, studying the flue gas pressure change showed very evident relation with thermal resistances. Fuel mixture appeared to affect the fouling rates, but not consistently with small changes in the fuel feed.

40|$|The present thesis {{studies the}} {{possibility}} of using metal foam in diesel exhaust aftertreatment systems. The introductory section describes the properties of the metal foam and makes a comparison with the ceramic materials used as substrates of aftertreatment devices. In order to introduce the non-familiar reader, the first chapter includes a short description of the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) and the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). The second section studies the use of metal foam as a substrate for DOC applications. For this purpose, a customized small scale experimental setup was used for fundamental investigations. The effect of exhaust flow rate on catalytic activity and the capacity of hydrocarbon adsorption was thoroughly investigated. Experimental research went on to clarify the effects of coating characteristics (Pt and washcoat loading, pore size, coating method) on conversion efficiency. The experience from fundamental investigations was used to develop a number of prototype foam catalysts. The prototypes were experimentally evaluated on an engine bench to define the effect of exhaust flow rate on catalytic activity and a direct comparison was done with a cordierite flow through DOC. Various catalytic coatings were evaluated to select the most suitable for DOC applications. Finally, the prototypes and the ceramic DOC are evaluated on a diesel vehicle over legislated driving cycles. The next section studies the use of metal foam as a substrate for DPF applications. Fundamental investigations were carried out regarding the filtration efficiency, pressure drop, soot loading distribution, <b>soot</b> compression and <b>blow</b> off. Based on that experience, a number of prototype foam filters were developed. All prototypes were tested according to the same evaluation procedure for comparison reasons. The target of the evaluation was to characterize the filters in terms of filtration efficiency, pressure drop, soot compression and maximum soot loading for safe regeneration. A first attempt was done to find an inverse calculation of soot loading given the exhaust flow rate, temperature and the pressure drop of the filter. In order to reduce NO 2 slip, a new filter design was implemented and tested. All prototypes were tested to evaluate their catalytic efficiency. The same evaluation procedure was carried out with two SiC wall flow filters for comparison. Finally, the foam and ceramic filters were installed on a modern diesel vehicle and were tested over legislated driving cycles. Selected prototypes were tested on real road driving conditions. The last chapter of the thesis focuses on the evaluation of a complete foam aftertreatment system which consisted of a close coupled precatalyst and an underfloor particulate filter. This system replaced the original one (which had precatalyst and a main catalyst) on a Euro 4 diesel vehicle without any engine modifications. The target was to investigate the ability of the foam system to reduce the gaseous and soot emissions below the Euro 4 and Euro 5 limits. Emission measurements were carried out over NEDC driving cycles according to the legislated method, but also complementary instantaneous measurements were done regarding both gaseous and particle mass and number emissions. The main points of attention are the CO and hydrocarbon reduction efficiency, the effect of the new system on NO 2 /NOx ratio and total NOx emissions, precatalyst and filter ΔP and fuel consumption. The most important aspect of the evaluation measurements was the soot mass and number emissions due to the very low limit that will be set by the Euro 5 standards. After the end of evaluation over the driving cycles, the foam system was tested under real road driving conditions in comparison with a SiC wall flow filter. ...|$|R

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the concept of PIvap for a existing hardwood mill producing kraft pulp and compare the results with the ones from an earlier study of a softwood model mill.

40|$|Pulverised coal {{combustion}} {{continues to be}} one of the main conventional methods of producing electricity over the last several decades. Mineral matter present in coal is usually present as free ions, salts, organically bound inorganic and hard minerals. During {{coal combustion}} these minerals partly vaporized, coalesce or fragment. The mineral matter in coal transforms into ash during combustion and deposition on wall surfaces causing problems such as fouling and slagging. The deposited lumps called clinkers, mainly in radiation zone directly exposed to flame radiation resulting to slagging, while sintered deposit in convection zone not directly exposed by flame radiation called fouling. The scope of this work encompasses identification of slagging and clinker formation areas in a typical 330 MW boiler using commercial code FLUENT and several available empirical indices. The propensity of the slagging with the used coal is calculated by several thermal indices. Temperature distributions, velocity profiles and particle trajectories were analysed and utilised to predict the most probable zones likely to experience clinker formation. Most probable spots for slagging were found in the radiation zone near to the nose of furnace and left-top side of superheater tube sections which agrees closely with the plant observations. However, the propensity of deposited ash obtained from the plant is seemed low to medium using several indices. Results from the current investigation demonstrate the usefulness of modelling approach in identifying the probable zones of clinker formation which can prove to be valuable for power utilities to adopt corrective measures for <b>soot</b> <b>blowing</b> to clean the ash deposits before it grows bigger in size...|$|E

The concept of PIvap has been evaluated for a Eucalyptus mill producing bleached kraft market pulp in Portugal and the results were compared to the ones from an earlier model mill study of a soft wood mill. In the eucalyptus mill there were, theoretically, 0. 86 GJ/ADt of excess heat suitable for a PIvap besides the 2. 6 GJ/ADt of pinch violations. The pinch violations could be transferred to excess heat, but some pinch violations were cost effective to solve. A suggestion where 1. 1 GJ/ADt of pinch violations are solved and 1. 6 GJ/ADt of excess heat are extracted is presented. If the excess heat is used in a 7 effect PIvap with integrated stripper and increased dry solids content, steam savings of 2. 7 GJ/ADt could be made in the evaporation plant. Together with the pinch violations and opportunities for improved <b>soot</b> <b>blowing,</b> the total steam savings from the suggested measures were 4. 5 GJ/ADt or 35 %. The amount of steam savings and associated costs were similar to the ones in the soft-wood model-mill. Hence, no significant differences could be found for the opportunities to implement PIvap in the hardwood mill compared to in the soft wood mill. The existence of a pre-evaporation plant, however, showed to hinder introduction of PIvap, since a pre-evaporation plant uses excess heat, and uses it ineffectively compared to a PIvap. Hence, the pre-evaporation has been removed in the suggestion for integration presented here. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamic model}} is {{presented}} for a biomass-fired circulating fluidized bed boiler. The model {{is based on}} energy and mass balances for the components in the boiler and on a combustion model for the fluidized bed. The main purpose of the model is to simulate how deposits affect the boiler efficiency and performance. The model is verified against the municipal circulating fluidized bed boiler in Västerås, Sweden, which produces 157 Â MW. The distribution of deposits on the surfaces in the boiler is well known from inspections. These observations are used as inputs to the model to simulate their effects on boiler performance. The heat exchanger most affected by fouling is Superheater 2, {{which is the first}} heat exchanger in the flue gas channel. Deposits typically reduce the heat transfer rate by half over a season despite <b>soot</b> <b>blowing.</b> This and other fouling scenarios are simulated and presented in this article. The simulations show that fouling on superheaters redistributes the heat transfer rate from the superheaters to Reheater 1 and partially redistributes turbine power from the high pressure turbine to the intermediate pressure turbine. If the boiler is running at maximum load, water injection to Reheater 1 has to increase to maintain temperatures below the permitted limit. The dynamic effects of fouling are small and the total efficiency of the boiler is only marginally affected. Fouling on evaporating surfaces has major dynamic effects and dramatically decreases the boiler efficiency. A decrease in fuel rate flow is needed to maintain temperatures in the fluidised bed and in the flue gas channel within acceptable limits.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have defined {{the phenomenon of}} 'slagging' as the deposition of ash in the radiative section of a boiler, while 'fouling' refers to the deposition of ash in the convective-pass region. Among the important parameters affecting ash deposition {{that need to be}} studied are ash chemistry, its transport, deposit growth, and strength development; removability of the ash deposit; heat transfer mechanisms; and the mode of operation for boilers. The heat transfer at the walls of a combustor depends on many parameters including ash deposition. This depends on the processes or parameters controlling the impact efficiency and the sticking efficiency. For a slagging combustor or furnace, however, the temperatures are so high that much of the coal particles are melted and the molten layer, in turn, captures more particles as it flows. The main problems with ash deposition are reduced heat transfer in the boiler and corrosion of the tubes. Common ways of dealing with these issues are <b>soot</b> <b>blowing</b> and wall blowing on a routine basis; however, unexpected or uncontrolled depositions can also complicate the situation, and there are always locations inaccessible to the use of such techniques. Studies have indicated that slag viscosity must be within a certain range of temperatures for tapping and the membrane wall to be accessible, for example, between 1300 C and 1500 C, the viscosity is approximately 25 Pa {center_dot} s. As the operating temperature decreases, the slag cools and solid crystals begin to form. In such cases the slag should be regarded as a non-Newtonian suspension, consisting of liquid silicate and crystals. A better understanding of the rheological properties of the slag, such as yield stress and shear-thinning, are critical in determining the optimum operating conditions. To develop an accurate heat transfer model in any type of coal combustion or gasification process, the heat transfer and to some extent the rheological properties of ash and slag, especially in high-temperature environments need to be understood and properly modeled. The viscosity of slag and the thermal conductivity of ash deposits are among two of the most important constitutive parameters that need to be studied. The accurate formulation or representations of the (transport) properties of coal (and biomass for co-firing cases) present a special challenge of modeling efforts in computational fluid dynamics applications. In this report, we first provide a brief review of the various approaches taken by different researchers in formulating or obtaining a slag viscosity model. In general, these models are based on experiments. Since slag behaves as a non-linear fluid, we discuss the constitutive modeling of slag and the important parameters that must be studied...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} at Mondi kraft {{pulp and paper}} mill located in Sweden, Kramfors Dynäs due to the low return rate of condensate. Currently, the return rate is only at 65 - 75 %. This is problematic as the demineralization process is operating on full capacity and thus requires a reduced make-up water need. The production of demineralized water is an expensive process due to large requirements of chemicals and pump-energy, but also due {{to the cost of}} raw water and maintenance. Therefore the purpose of the work was to investigate the possibility to increase the condensate return rate and thus reduce the need of make-up water. The investigation was performed during normal production rates to simplify the interpretations. The steam and condensate system was mapped and extracted flows were identified, measured and marked on map. The extracted flows were investigated in more detail and characterized as either consumed in a process or lost to sewer or atmosphere. In the work, both minor and major improvements were investigated. Minor improvements are accomplished with small intervention measures and could be done with small or no investments costs. Major improvements require large investments costs and further investigations. Six different processes were found to constitute the total production of make-up water. These are the free blowing of excess steam, <b>soot</b> <b>blowing</b> steam, paper machine 6, de-aerating process in the feed water tanks, digester process and steam- & condensate leaks along the pipe network. Improvements with the category of minor were found to reduce steam and condensate consumption by 22 - 23 ton/h. This implies a reduction by 30 - 32 % of the added make-up water, including an annual financial benefit of 3, 3 - 3, 9 MSEK. Additionally 0, 41 - 0, 82 MSEK could be gained annually by improving the insulation on the cylinder dryer heads. The make-up water would be further reduced if insulation jackets and inspection programs were implemented on equipments along the steam lines. Two major improvements are recommended. The first major improvement involves elimination of the free blowing of excess steam. This could be accomplished by drying the bark before combustion. The added make-up water would be reduced by 25 % and with the possibility to sell the dried bark during low steam production. The second major improvement involves the digester process, where the consumptions of medium pressure steam could be reduced by replacing steam with liquor-steam from the strong liquor accumulator. Medium pressure steam could instead be converted into electricity by the turbine...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{combustion}} can be {{an economic}} way {{to contribute to the}} reduction of CO 2 emissions, which are a main suspect of the so-called greenhouse effect. In order to promote a widespread utilization of biomass combustion, operational problems like fuel treatment, slagging, fouling and corrosion have to be solved. There are few research initiatives focused on the improvement of design and operation, for example combustion modeling, material research or equipment optimization. In this work, two aspects are considered: performance improvement due to the optimization of cleaning cycles to reduce slagging and the use of predictive dynamic models as an aid for control and equipment design. These objectives can be accomplished by using process models that share a number of characteristics. The first part includes the development and application of an online process-monitoring tool to recognize deposit phenomena during biomass combustion. Slagging and fouling refers to deposits of solids on heat exchanger surfaces. Since slagging and fouling is a local process highly dependent on time and temperature, the analysis of the heat transfer diagrams is used to study the deposit tendency in an early stage of the process. In this work, heat transfer transients of the evaporator, the economizer and the superheaters are analyzed {{on the basis of a}} physical model. Measured data from a biomass-fired power plant, e. g. from an acoustic pyrometry and the process control system, were used as input for the monitoring. A thermodynamic steady state model was developed and validated with data from several boiler types, i. e. pulverized fuel, fluidized bed and grate. The monitoring campaign was combined with fuel and ash measurements. The fuel from the power plants showed clear slagging tendencies. Measured material properties were analyzed and used to improve the modelâs accuracy. Deposits on the heat exchangers could be accurately detected and the overall <b>soot</b> <b>blowing</b> strategy could be optimized, something not possible without a process-monitoring model. The model has been verified and validation of the results proved the correct diagnosis of the deposit status inside the furnace. A predictive dynamic model was developed, based on the steady state results and is presented in the second part of this thesis. The steam boiler is one of the most complex components of a thermal power plant as far as the process control is concerned. A common boiler configuration is the once-through arrangement and this is the type of boiler considered in this work. A problem in two-phase systems modeling is the correct calculation of the phase boundary, because the position of the phase transition changes rapidly, depending on load conditions and temperature distribution along the walls. The prediction of the correct spatial distribution of the phases is crucial with respect to the accuracy of the model.
