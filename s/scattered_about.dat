5|$|On April29, 1963, {{less than}} half a year after Karen, Typhoon Olive caused {{extensive}} damage in Guam and the Mariana Islands. With many residents living in tents, and debris from the storm still <b>scattered</b> <b>about,</b> severe damage was anticipated. Schools, churches, and other structures were opened as shelters in order to protect those without homes. Ultimately, Guam was spared the worst of the storm though much of Saipan was devastated. The island was again devastated in 1976 by Typhoon Pamela which buffeted the island with destructive winds for 36hours. Though weaker than Karen, the longer lasting impact of Pamela was regarded as more destructive.|$|E
5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are <b>scattered</b> <b>about</b> the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} first {{pointed out}} by Tully and Fisher between the luminosity of spiral galaxies and their maximum rotation velocity, {{as measured by the}} 21 cm line-width, continues {{to be one of the}} best methods available to measure relative distances. At infrared wavelengths, the observational <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> this relation is typically 0. 35 to 0. 50 magnitudes, permitting relative distance estimates with an accuracy of about 20 percent. The Malmquist bias in a magnitude-limited sample is 1. 38 σ ², and while the solution to the general problem is complex, it is clear that reducing the <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> the Tully-Fisher relation by even a factor of two would make a large difference in our ability to determine the local velocity field from distances and velocities of individual galaxies. In this dissertation we discuss the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation at infrared wavelengths, and look for ways to reduce that dispersion through the inclusion of additional observational parameters. The data for this study are derived from a CCD survey of 244 spiral galaxies in twenty clusters falling in the redshift range 3, 000 to 11, 000 km s⁻¹. From surface brightness profiles and elliptical aperture photometry, we obtained isophotal and total magnitudes at B, R, and I, isophotal diameters, mean and nuclear surface brightnesses, and a concentration parameter indicative of the bulge-to-disk ratio. These quantities were then combined with colors and HI-content measures taken from the literature in a search for correlations with Tully-Fisher residuals. None of the trial second-parameters resulted in a substantial decrease in the <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> the fiducial Tully-Fisher relation. An examination of the properties of the cluster samples shows that many of the clusters exhibit considerable substructure. While it is possible that the implied depth effects are important to the <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> the magnitude/line-width relation, calculated lower limits to the dispersion in depth turn out to be rather small...|$|R
5|$|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I was keen to {{lure the}} Elector back into the Imperial fold after he had {{switched}} allegiance to fight for King Louis XIV before the war. Given this duplicity, Marlborough thought {{the best way to}} secure Bavaria for the Alliance was to negotiate from a position of strength by invading the Elector's territories, hoping to persuade him to change sides before he could be reinforced. By 22 June Marlborough's army had linked up with elements of the Margrave of Baden's Imperial forces at Launsheim; by the end of June their combined strength totalled nearly 80,000 men (see map on right).

40|$|We {{examine the}} X-ray {{luminosity}} scaling relations of 31 nearby galaxy clusters from the Representative XMM-Newton Cluster Structure Survey (REXCESS). The objects are selected only in X-ray luminosity, optimally sampling the cluster luminosity function. Temperatures range from 2 to 9 keV, {{and there is}} no bias toward any particular morphological type. To reduce measurement scatter we extract pertinent values in an aperture corresponding to R 500, estimated using the tight correlation between (the product of gas mass and temperature) and total mass. The data exhibit power law relations between bolometric X-ray luminosity and temperature, and total mass, all with slopes that are significantly steeper than self-similar expectations. We examine the possible causes for the steepening, finding that structural variations have little effect and that the primary driver appears to be a systematic variation of the gas content with mass. <b>Scatter</b> <b>about</b> the relations is dominated in all cases by the presence of cool cores. The natural logarithmic <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> the raw X-ray luminosity-temperature relation is about 70 per cent, and about the X-ray luminosity- relation it is 40 per?cent. Systems with more morphological substructure show similar <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> scaling relations than clusters with less substructure, due to the preponderance of cool core systems in the regular cluster subsample. Cool core and morphologically disturbed systems occupy distinct regions in the residual space with respect to the best fitting mean relation, the former lying systematically at the high luminosity side, the latter lying systematically at the low luminosity side. Simple exclusion of the central regions serves to reduce the <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> the scaling relations by more than a factor of two. The scatter reduces by a similar amount {{with the use of the}} central gas density as a third parameter. Using as a total mass proxy, we derive a Malmquist bias-corrected local luminosity-mass relation and compare with other recent determinations. Our results indicate that luminosity can be a reliable mass proxy with controllable scatter, which has important implications for upcoming all-sky cluster surveys, such as those to be undertaken with Planck and eROSITA, and ultimately for the use of the cluster population for cosmological purposes. <br/...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{probability}} distribution function (PDF) of the mass density in simulations of supersonic turbulence with properties appropriate for molecular clouds. For this study we use Athena, a new higher-order Godunov code. We find there are surprisingly similar relationships between {{the mean of the}} time-averaged PDF and the turbulent Mach number for driven hydrodynamic and strong-field MHD turbulence. There is, however, a large <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> these relations, indicating a high level of temporal and spatial variability in the PDF. Thus, the PDF of the mass density is unlikely to be a good measure of magnetic field strength. We also find that the PDF of decaying MHD turbulence deviates from the mean-Mach relation found in the driven case. This implies that the instantaneous Mach number alone is not enough to determine the statistical properties of turbulence that is out of equilibrium. The <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> the mean-Mach relation for driven turbulence, along with the large departure of decaying turbulence PDFs from those of driven turbulence, may illuminate one factor contributing to the large observed cloud-to-cloud variation in the star formation rate per solar mass...|$|R

40|$|We use X-ray {{morphological}} {{measurements and}} the <b>scatter</b> of clusters <b>about</b> observed and simulated scaling relations {{to examine the}} impact of merging and core-related phenomena on the structure of galaxy clusters. We use a range of X-ray and near-infrared (near-IR) scaling relations; all observed scaling relations constructed from emission-weighted mean temperature and intracluster medium mass, X-ray luminosity, isophotal size, and near-IR luminosity show a separation between clusters identified as cool core (CC) and those identified as non-cool core (NCC). We attribute this partially to a simple temperature bias in CC clusters and partially to other cool core-related structural changes. Scaling relations constructed from observables that are largely independent of core structure show smaller separation between CC and NCC populations. We attempt to minimize CC-related separation in scaling relations via two methods: by applying a uniform scale factor to CC cluster temperatures and determining the scale factor for each relation that minimizes the separation between CC and NCC populations, and by introducing cluster central surface brightness as a third parameter in observable-temperature scaling relations. We find an average temperature bias factor of 1. 07 +/- 0. 02 between the CC and NCC populations; the three-parameter approach reduces scatter in scaling relations more than a simple CC temperature scaling. We examine the <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> the best-fit observable-temperature-brightness scaling relations and compare the intrinsic scatter within subsamples split by CC/NCC and four different morphological merger indicators. CC clusters and clusters with less substructure generally exhibit higher <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> scaling relations. The larger structural variations in CC clusters are present well outside the core, suggesting that a process more global than core radiative instability is at work. Simulations without cooling mechanisms also show no correlation between substructure and larger <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> scaling relations, indicating that any merger-related scatter increases are subtle. Taken together, the observational and simulation results indicate that cool core-related phenomena-not merging processes-are the primary contributor to scatter in scaling relations. Our analysis does not appear to support the scenario in which clusters evolve cool cores over time unless they experience major mergers...|$|R

25|$|The {{presence}} of Corsican expatriates {{in the vicinity}} of Rome is attested since at least the 9th century, when a small Corsican colony existed in Porto near Fiumicino during the pontificate of Pope Leo IV (r. 847–55); the existence of a Corsican nunnery along the Appian Way is known from the same period. In more recent times, Corsican emigration to Rome slowly began {{after the end of the}} Avignon papacy during the 15th century, at which point the city again offered job opportunities to immigrants. Previously, the traditional emigration areas of the Corsicans, pushed to leave their country by the poverty and anarchy reigning in Corsica during the Middle Ages, had been Liguria and Pisa, but during the 15th century Corsicans began to settle in Sienese and Latial Maremma, and from there in Rome. Initially, they were living <b>scattered</b> <b>about</b> in the city's rioni. However, at the onset of 16th century, they were concentrated on Tiber Island and in the part of Trastevere lying between the harbour of Ripa Grande and the church of San Crisogono. The center of their community was the now disappeared Piazza dell'Olmo ("Elm square"). San Crisogono became the national church and cemetery basilica of the Corsican nation in Rome, and over the centuries was used as the burial place of several Corsican military officers. Originally, the Corsicans were only able to find humble jobs in the city and its surroundings, mostly in the areas of sheep breeding and wine trading (the island's wines were much sought after during that period). The only exceptions to the aforementioned trades included becoming a priest, a servant in the Vatican palaces, or a soldier in the employ of the Pope or the Roman baroni; consequently, they did not become well integrated into Roman society.|$|E
25|$|A {{localized}} but damaging tornado outbreak produced 11 tornadoes {{in eastern}} North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota {{on the evening}} of August 26, 2007. A large EF3 tornado passed near Rugh Lake, North Dakota, destroying garages and outbuildings on three farms, tossing grain bins, and snapping numerous trees. Gravel roads were deeply scarred by flying debris, five bison were killed, and two heavy combines were thrown and smashed to pieces by the tornado. The strongest tornado of the outbreak was a large, rain-wrapped EF4 wedge that devastated the town of Northwood, North Dakota. This multiple-vortex tornado began to the southwest of town, snapping numerous trees and striking the Northwood Muni-Vince Airport at EF1 strength, where several planes were damaged. A metal storage building and a small airplane hangar were reduced to bare slabs at that location. The tornado grew to nearly a mile wide and reached EF3 strength as it struck Northwood directly. Of the roughly 460 homes in Northwood, 90% of them sustained some type of damage. The local health center, bank, fire station, school, supermarket, and grain elevator were all damaged. Near the grain elevator, several rail cars were knocked off the tracks. Hundreds of trees were snapped, uprooted, or damaged throughout town, and one person was killed in a mobile home park that was destroyed at the north edge of town. A small area of EF4 damage was noted as the tornado exited at the northeast corner of town. An agricultural company, a construction company, and a car dealership were completely destroyed in this area. The construction company was entirely flattened, with steel beams twisted and thrown into nearby fields. A large metal storage tank that originated in this area was found 1.5 miles away in a corn field. Numerous vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from the car dealership, many of which were mangled beyond recognition. Farm fields in this area were heavily scoured, and mature corn stalks in one field were snapped at the base and flattened to the ground, with husked ears of corn found <b>scattered</b> <b>about.</b> EF1 damage was observed further to the northeast before the tornado dissipated. In addition to the fatality, 18 other people were injured in Northwood. Later that evening, an EF2 tornado touched down near Reynolds, North Dakota, snapping numerous trees near the Red River, and flattening a flag pole and an antique windmill to the ground. The tornado crossed into Minnesota, where a quonset hut and a pole shed were destroyed before the tornado dissipated near Eldred. Eight other weak tornadoes occurred that evening as well.|$|E
