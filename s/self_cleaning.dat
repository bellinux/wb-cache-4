The highest priority strategies for waste management, there is certainly the prevention and reduction of waste generation, which can also be re – used or from them we obtain the energy. The least desirable goal, in the context of the strategies of waste management is the disposal in designated landfills. We must not forget the wastewater treatment, which is often the theme to which we do not pay enough attention. Water is an important resource which can, if do not treat it properly, quickly starts to run low. Wastewater must be collected and vented through the appropriate sewage systems. The strategy used for cleaning water are mechanical, chemical, physically – chemical and biological treatment. From the cleaning of wastewater, we must not forget that nature itself is able to clean almost all of the wastewater and plant cleaning plants are mimicking this <b>self</b> – <b>cleaning</b> ability of nature.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To {{ascertain}} whether interdental cleaning behaviours of Australian adults {{were associated with}} lower levels of plaque, gingivitis and periodontal disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Survey of Adult Oral Health 2004 – 06. Outcome variables were three indicators of oral hygiene outcomes (the presence or not of dental plaque, dental calculus and gingivitis) and two of periodontal disease (the presence or not of at least one tooth with a periodontal pocket or clinical attachment loss of ‡ 4 mm). The independent variable was classified into the following three groups: regularly clean interproximally _at least daily_ (daily+); _less than daily_ (< daily); and _do not regularly clean interproximally_ (reference group). Poisson regression with robust variance estimation was used to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95 % confidence intervals(95 % CIs) relative to the reference group, adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: Regular <b>self</b> interdental <b>cleaning</b> was associated with less dental plaque (< daily, PR = 0. 89, 95 % CI = 0. 84, 0. 95; and daily+, PR = 0. 89, 95 % CI = 0. 82, 0. 96), less dental calculus (< daily, PR = 0. 88, 95 % CI = 0. 80, 0. 97; and daily+, PR = 0. 79, 95 % CI = 0. 70, 0. 89) and lower levels of moderate/severe gingivitis (daily+, PR = 0. 85, 95 % CI = 0. 77, 0. 94). Periodontal pocketing was less likely for the< daily group (PR = 0. 61, 95 % CI = 0. 46, 0. 82), but was not associated with daily+ cleaning (PR = 0. 99, 95 % CI = 0. 663, 1. 49). There was not a significant association between interdental cleaning and clinical attachment loss (< daily, PR = 0. 90, 95 % CI = 0. 77, 1. 05; and daily+, PR = 1. 17, 95 % CI = 0. 95, 1. 44). CONCLUSIONS: Regular interdental cleaning was associated with better oral hygiene outcomes, such as dental plaque and gingivitis, although there was no significant association between regular interdental cleaning and clinical attachment loss.

40|$|Aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the study}} of the {{physicochemical}} properties of photocatalytic <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> construction materials with Titania (TiO 2). The work is focused on the production and study of (a) mortars and pastes made of white cement and titania, (b) masonry mortars produced with white cement and titania and (c) restoration mortars produced with lime and titania. Initially, paste and mortar samples of white cement mixed with titania (in powder form) were produced and studied according to standard EN 196. Consequently, paste hydration and evolution of pore size distribution were determined with NMR, SEM and Mercury Porosimetry, while a tribological study on paste surface was also realized. According to the study, titania exhibits a similar behaviour to that of a filler as it improves cohesion and homogeneity of pastes and mortars. However, {{due to the lack of}} hydraulic properties, cement hydration does not benefit from titania, neither do strength development and porosity evolution. It was proven that titania’s hydrophilic properties play a major role on the matter, as TiO 2 particles adsorb water molecules needed for hydration. Because of this, cement grains hydrate with a slower rate when titania is present. In addition, the tribological study revealed the evolution of surfacial roughness, as defined through the hydration process. Moreover, <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> masonry mortars were produced with white cement, lime, sand, perlite and titania. Limited application of titania lead to the creation of mortars with satisfactory properties as defined by standard EN 1015. Titania’s effect was observed in this case as well, yet in a lesser degree. Finally, <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> restoration mortars were produced with lime and titania. Combination of the two materials lead to the creation of improved <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> construction materials, as it was proven that carbonation benefits greatly from the photocatalytic process and in specific from the production of CO 2 due to decomposition of organic pollutants. Hence, the materials produced exhibit <b>self</b> <b>cleaning</b> properties as well as improved physicochemical characteristics and can contribute greatly in the effective protection both of built heritage and of our environment. ...|$|E
