40|$|A {{detailed}} study {{of the effect of}} polyester resin structural parameters on the mechanical properties of <b>sheet</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> has been carried out. The investigation involved the synthesis and mechanical testing of a series of unsaturated polyester resins and the incorporation of these resins into <b>sheet</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> (SMC) with their subsequent testing. Two main structural parameters were varied, firstly the degree of unsaturation of the resin (i. e. maleic:phthalic ratio), and secondly the amount of diol excess added to the reaction vessel during the resin synthesis thereby varying the hydroxyl value of the resin. It was found that the properties of the resins, both structural and mechanical, were interdependent. Altering the maleic:phthalic ratio was found to effect the hydroxyl value, notch sensitivity, shrinkage, and modulus of the resin. Low resin hydroxyl values were found to give SMC with low tensile strength and low fracture toughness. Unusually high hydroxyl values enhanced the toughness but the SMC did not show the expected increase in tensile strength. Surprisingly the toughness of SMC appears insensitive to the notch sensitivity of the resins despite the relatively wide range of resins used and their range of notch sensitivities. It was concluded that debonding was the predominant mechanism by which failure occurred in these composites and that the bond strength was enhanced by the use of a matrix resin with a suitably high hydroxyl value.

40|$|AbstractThe {{demand for}} fuel {{efficient}} aircraft {{led to the}} development of innovative lightweight constructions and the use of lightweight materials, such as carbon fibre reinforced plastics. In the same manner competences in new production technologies have been built up in the aerospace industry.

Furthermore the used raw materials, such as carbon fibres and resin, are very expensive.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{excellent}} properties of carbon fibres (CF) and the growing demand for multi-functional materials e. g., electrically conductive composites, engineering thermosets with carbon fibres are highly attractive. Similarly, electrically conductive fillers are of great importance. Engineering thermosets constitute an important group of polymers commonly used as matrices for polymeric matrix composites (PMCs). Requirements for these materials, particularly mechanical properties, fire resistance and high-temperature performance, are steadily increasing. Two thermosets offering particularly advantageous properties are melamine-formaldehyde (MF) and phenol-formaldehyde (PF). Composites based on MF and PF are studied here. Novel composites of MF reinforced with carbon fibres and MF with carbonaceous fillers (carbon black and mineral-carbon shungite) were prepared and investigated {{in terms of their}} microstructure, mechanical and electrical properties. A non-vented manufacturing technique resembling film stacking was developed based on MF <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> with cellulose. CF veils were impregnated with a suspension of alumina trihydrate (ATH) in aqueous MF, dried and processed similarly to <b>sheet</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> (SMCs). Also up-scaled production by injection moulding was used to prepare CF/PF composites. Carbon fibres improve stiffness and strength of MF composites compared to glass reinforcement. Interfacial CF/MF adhesion is low judging from the interfacial shear and transverse tensile strengths. Functional grading in the form of flexibilized MF coating applied to dispersed fibres improves both strength and strain at break by providing more favourable conditions during processing and crack propagation. Using softer ZnS pigment replacing hard Ti 0 2 also improves mechanical properties. For injection moulded PF composites, particularly rubber modified grades, post-curing (proprietary) improves stiffness retention and fatigue performance. Short carbon fibre composites (proprietary) show improved stiffness, strength and fatigue performance, but reduced strain at break, as compared to glass reinforcement. During fatigue, these composites show a linearly decreasing cyclic modulus up to failure. This may enable the prediction of fatigue lifetimes from shorter-time tests, given that the final fatigue modulus can be established. However defects such as undispersed fibre bundles introduce significant scatter in fatigue lifetimes, making such predictions difficult. Fibre breakage occurred in both carbon- and glass fibre composites during quasi-static tensile loading and fatigue. Composites of MF/cellulose and carbon black exhibit electrical conductivity and improved stiffness at low average loadings of the filler, this attributed to the concentration of CB along the cellulose fibres. Composites of MF/cellulose and shungite filler exhibit electrical conductivities in the dissipative range. Compared to CB, shungite is easier to handle and water-ethanol instead of pure ethanol may be used during sonication. Mechanical properties are however rather poor, indicating weak shungite/MF interfaces...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{interest}} {{has grown in}} the use of composite components within the automotive industry. Fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) components are of particular interest to the industry, since lower tooling costs and part consolidation can be utilised, whilst lighter, stiffer components can be produced. Several methods are available to produce FRP components at high volumes, including compression moulding (using dough and <b>sheet</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds),</b> reinforced reaction injection moulding (RRIM) and liquid moulding processes (resin transfer moulding (RTM) and structural reaction injection moulding (SRIM)). RTM is a closed mould process, which is widely used to produce components economically in low volumes using matched moulds to produce two good surfaces. The absence of a high volume manufacturing technology, however, has impeded the acceptance and advance of RTM within the automotive industry. A research programme was established at the University of Nottingham to address the problems {{associated with the use of}} RTM for high volume manufacture. This programme has considered the topics of process technology, processing characteristics of polyester resin systems and fibre preforms, fibre wet-out and interfacial bonding, mould design, microwave pre-heating of reactive resin systems and process modelling. This thesis concerns the research which was undertaken to identify the causes of void formation during the impregnation and polymerisation stages of RTM, and methods of reducing the final void content within the component. The impregnation phase of the RTM process was identified as being the stage where the majority of voids were formed. A study of oil impregnation (having a similar viscosity to that of resin) into reinforcement was undertaken to determine the reasons for uneven flow and air entrapment. The dry reinforcements were studied to assess the microstructure of the preforms in order to determine reasons for obstruction of the resin flow. Fabric stitching, thermoplastic binder and size deposits were identified as potential causes of flow impediment. Fibre orientation and preform stacking were also assumed to assist in the development of uneven flow, leading to air entrapment. A major factor determining the formation of microvoids within fibre bundles was identified as the transverse impregnation of resin into high Tex fibre bundles. The major moulding process variables of injection pressure, vent pressure, fibre volume fraction, mould temperature and resin pre-heating have been assessed, to determine their effect on the void content within unidirectional and CFRM reinforced polyester laminates. It was observed that vacuum assistance during impregnation reduced void formation, although higher exotherm pressures and the possibility of monomer boiling arise from its use. A simple impregnation model was developed to assess the microscopic impregnation rates between fibre bundles, in the capillary between fibres and transversely into fibre bundles. The results from this model were compared with actual moulding histories. The findings of the overall work are discussed and suggestions proposed for the reduction of void content in RTM automotive components...|$|R

Within {{the project}} {{for the first time}} the mass and energy {{consumption}} related to the production, use and recycling of a CFRP fuselage and a conventional aluminium fuselage was analysed, modelised and compared. For the analysis of the aluminium and CFRP production lines the main process steps from the mining of the raw materials to the final product were identified and connected to a process chain with modules, which contain single processes or accumulated processes representing a complete production step. As a result, it can be stated that the primary energy demand for both process chains is roughly on the same level. The analysis of the aluminium and CFRP production chains revealed some major energy and material intensive steps that offer potential for more economic operations some of which are about to be applied in the near future. The use of CFRP in the considered fuselage components of the single aisle reference airliner could reduce its weight to approximately 30 % in comparison to the conventional aluminium fuselage. The resulting fuel saving amounts to 4 % during service life time. For additional weight reduction and fuel saving the total airliner should be taken into consideration. At the moment it is not possible to assess the advantages or disadvantages of the two considered materials in respect to maintenance and repair because the expenditure of repair depends on the extent and place of the damages. In the context of this study only the production residues are considered, the recycling of new parts rejected due to defect, exchange spare parts or the fate of the complete fuselage are neglected up to now. Mostly CFRP residues are deposited. Recycling technologies for residues of CFRP, fibres and resins are still in the beginnings. At present the material is normally shreddered to particles of defined size and used as admixture in secondary polymeric products like e. g. <b>sheet</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds.</b> It can be stated that currently partly recycling and pyrolysis seem to be the most interesting ways for the recycling of CFRP residues.

Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> were prepared using a two-roll mill and a conventional extrusion processes respectively. It was possible to injection mould PVOH urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> with a urea content of up to 90 wt % which had been compounded using a two-roll mill. Using the conventional extrusion process, it was also possible to <b>compound</b> and injection <b>mould</b> EVA urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> containing up to 70 wt % urea. The effects on composition variables on the properties of the <b>moulding</b> <b>compound</b> were studied and compared to those of the existing “cooked” urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compound</b> (Benchmark). The mechanical properties were characterised using the three-point bending test and Charpy impact test. The thermal properties were determined using simultaneous differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (SDTA/TGA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The thermo-mechanical and visco-elastic properties were determined using a dynamic mechanical analyser. A scanning electron microscope was used to study the surface texture of the mouldings. The EVA urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> showed two endothermic melting peaks and multiple exothermic crystallisation peaks in the DSC curves. The peak at ca. 55 - 66 °C corresponds to the melting of the wax/EVA blend, while the large peak at 130 - 132 °C corresponds to the melting of the urea. The DSC heating curve of the PVOH urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> showed two endothermic peaks. The small peak corresponds to the melting of the wax, while the large peak corresponds to the melting of the urea/PVOH blend. PVOH urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compound</b> had better mechanical properties than the industrial benchmark. The mechanical properties of the EVA urea-based compound were generally lower. The effect of the wax and polymer content on the mechanical properties was as follows: Increasing polymer content produced weaker but tougher <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds.</b> Increasing wax content improved the strength and stiffness but gave compounds that were less tough. Two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) indicated significant polymer-wax interactions. The urea content determined the stiffness (elastic modulus) of the compounds. PVOH mouldings had superior stiffness compared with the EVA and cooked urea-based mouldings. The Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) results confirmed the result obtained from the modulus of elasticity determination in the three-point bending test. The impact strength increased with an increase in polymer content and reduced with an increase in wax content. The linear thermal expansion coefficient decreased as the urea content was increased. Measured values (100 to 156 x 10 - 6 °C) were comparable to those of the benchmark. The cooked urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compound</b> had the lowest melt viscosity at 110 °C, as indicated by its melt flow index (MFI). Fluidity increased with the polymer content. The thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) results confirmed that both the PVOH and EVA urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compounds</b> decomposed readily and left less than 1 wt % ash after combustion. From the SEM results apparent surface roughness appeared to increase with wax content. The EVA urea-based <b>moulding</b> <b>compound</b> had an irregular surface texture. Based on the criteria of cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness, the synthesis of PVOH urea-based patterns is preferable. The use of a conventional extrusion process to prepare PVOH urea-based patterns is recommended. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Chemical Engineeringunrestricte...|$|R
