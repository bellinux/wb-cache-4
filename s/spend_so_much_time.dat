25|$|The {{practice}} is now generally discouraged since {{it affects the}} educational performance of school children. Top fighters can fetch up to 100 pesos (US$ 2), making the sport lucrative for children. They could <b>spend</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> hunting and training spiders that lessons and homework are neglected. Adults also play the sport {{but in a way}} similar to cockfighting. Derbies are also held and bets could go as high as 50,000 pesos (about US$1,000). The cheaper maintenance cost of raising spiders compared to raising fighting cocks caused some players to switch to spider fighting.|$|E

500|$|ANN {{noted that}} the second anime season tends to overdramatize, {{especially}} {{in the last three}} episodes. ANN also describes the second season as [...] "more embarrassing and shoujo-ai oriented" [...] than the first season, but that the solid characterization is still a strength of the series. Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime appreciated the focus on characters other than Yumi and Sachiko for the second season, regarding Shimako's loss of Sei and befriending Noriko as being [...] "one of the more moving" [...] arcs of Printemps. ANN regarded the OVA season as the best of the first three seasons, citing the improved production standards and the less melodramatic storylines. ANN notes that the fourth season is [...] "a return to dramatic form" [...] after the relaxation of the OVA series, but it is not as melodramatic as the second season, due to the increased maturity of the cast. [...] Chris Beveridge, writing for Mania.com, found it odd that Yumi and Sachiko did not <b>spend</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> together in the fourth season, and felt that the series needed an epilogue, but enjoyed seeing Yumi taking on some [...] "adult responsibilities." ...|$|E

[...] She is the new head of Section 20, replacing Hugh Collinson from the first series. Mealing described Grant as [...] "hard as nails," [...] "very contained, very direct," [...] and [...] "very driven." [...] Grant is also very distant from her team; [...] "she commands so she is not their pal but, at the same time, the guys are like her family.

[...] The actress called her role [...] "the best role I've ever had," [...] adding [...] "when I'm doing action scenes like flying in helicopters, the hardest thing is to keep a serious face as all I want to do is scream for joy." [...] She researched for her role by taking advice from a female officer in a similar high-ranking position as Grant is.

[...] Studies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of gamers engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to be an important reason for PewDiePie's popularity. In 2015, PewDiePie was included on Time's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, cementing his influence as an internet personality. Later in 2015, PewDiePie was featured on the cover of Varietys [...] "Famechangers" [...] issue, with the magazine ranking him as the [...] "#1 Famechanger", or [...] "those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest".
