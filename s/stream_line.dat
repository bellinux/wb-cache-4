50|$|The {{smoother}} {{surface of}} a carvel boat gives the impression at first sight that it is hydrodynamically more efficient. The lands of the planking are not there to disturb the <b>stream</b> <b>line.</b> This distribution of relative efficiency between the two forms of construction is an illusion because for given hull strength, the clinker boat is lighter {{because it does not}} rely upon the compressive forces of the caulking and the resulting friction to bind the skin together. It therefore displaces less water so it has less to push aside while moving. The reduced displacement could be used to make the lines finer so as to make the passage through the water easier still. Of course, displacement was increased as cargo was loaded but still, the clinker vessel had the advantage in efficiency as the structure can be less bulky. Therefore, for a given internal volume, there was a smaller external one, meaning that a bulkier cargo could be carried if need be, given sufficient freeboard.|$|E
50|$|Following {{infection}} and {{establishment of an}} endosymbiotic relationship, the new cyanobionts {{will no longer be}} free living and autonomous, but rather begin to dedicate their physiological activities in tandem with their hosts'. Over time and evolution, the cyanobiont will begin to lose portions of their genome in a process known as genome erosion. As the relationship between the cyanobacteria and host evolves, the cyanobiont genome will develop signs of degradation, particularly in the form of pseudogenes. A genome undergoing reduction will typically have a large proportion of pseudogenes and transposable elements dispersed throughout the genome. Furthermore, cyanobacteria involved in symbiosis will begin to accumulate these mutations in specific genes, particularly those involved in DNA repair, glycolysis, and nutrient uptake. These gene sets are critical for organisms that live independently, however as cyanobionts living in symbiosis with their hosts, there may not be any evolutionary need to continue maintaining the integrity of these genes. As the major function of a cyanobiont is to provide their host with fixed nitrogen, genes involved in nitrogen fixation or cell differentiation are observed to remain relatively untouched. This may suggest that cyanobacteria involved in symbiotic relationships can selectively <b>stream</b> <b>line</b> their genetic information in order to best perform their functions as cyanobiont-host relationships continue to evolve over time.|$|E

LIAMA, as they are commonly referred to, often book shows at the Plainview Old-Bethpage Public Library, to help to alleviate the problems created in local scenes form the shortage of underground supportive venues and booking agencies.Employment for musicians has always been a challenging pursuit on Long Island, which is largely considered to be an overly saturated competition pool. The Advent of talent directories has helped <b>stream</b> <b>line</b> the relationships between venue owners and the bands that seek to play them. The days of mailing unwanted and unsolicited demos and flyers to venue owners are fast becoming a thing of the past. The reason is simple to understand when you consider the range of choices a single internet search can bring. Entire musical programs can be created and booked in less time than it takes to open and discard an unsolicited and often inappropriate demo mailing. There are many talent search engines that operate on a national platform and feature searches by region. The problem with these search engines is that they often return results based on a geographic net-throw. This usually means that a search for something local, especially on Long Island, can return results for band located in Connecticut and New England if it happens to be placed within 50 - 100 miles. There are some quality local search engines like Local Band For Hire.com http://www.localbandforhire.comwho specialize in entertainment local only to Long Island and Metro NY.|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} for interactive vector field visualization using {{large numbers of}} properly illuminated <b>stream</b> <b>lines</b> is presented. Taking into account ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection terms as well as transparency, we employ a realistic shading model which significantly increases quality and realism of the resulting images. While many graphics workstations offer hardware support for illuminating surface primitives, usually no means for an accurate shading of line primitives are provided. However, we show that proper illumination of lines can be implemented by exploiting the texture mapping capabilities of modern graphics hardware. In this way high rendering performance with interactive frame rates can be achieved. We apply the technique to render large numbers of integral curves in a vector field. The impression of the resulting images can be further improved by making the curves partially transparent. We also describe methods for controlling the distribution of <b>stream</b> <b>lines</b> in space. These methods enable us to use illuminated <b>stream</b> <b>lines</b> within an interactive visualization environment. ...|$|R

The division then rapidly rolled back to the Delvinaki-Fitóki Potamós <b>stream</b> <b>line.</b> Attacks and counter-attacks continued with the increasing odds against Italians, until the entire left flank of the Ferrara division was defeated 20 November 1940. At this point, the remnants of division held only a small sliver of Greek territory near Vesania and were ordered to retreat from increasingly untenable positions to Pontikates area. But these positions were abandoned too 26 November 1940, and {{the remnants of the}} Ferrara division were pushed south, out of Greece to the Drino river, making a stand at Radat and all along the way. The Ferrara division suffered a severe defeat at Radat 27 November 1940, and was relieved from the front line duty as 37th Infantry Division Modena has come as reinforcements 3 December 1940. The Ferrara division was temporarily relocated to Gjirokastër, but soon was forced back to fight as rearguard of defeated Modena division. 6-7 December 1940, it fought a defensive battle south of Tepelenë, at the confluence of the Aoös and Drino rivers. 14-16 December 1940, the Greek were able to capture a dominant height of Maja e Buzë Derrit, forcing the Ferrara to perform a costly counter-attacks until the height was re-captured. Until 10 January 1941, the fighting remained dynamic, although no particular gains were recorded on either side. Following a successful skirmish 10 January 1941, the Greek have renewed their onslaught 21 January 1941. By the 27 January, when the 58th Infantry Division Legnano has arrived to the Italian side, a number of positions were lost, but Italian reinforcements have stabilized the situation, resulting in gradual reduction of military activities during February, 1941. 7 March 1941, Greek forces have tried to attack at Lekël, but were repulsed.|$|E
5000|$|Determining the {{thermodynamic}} {{state of}} the stagnation point is more difficult under an equilibrium gas model than a perfect gas model. Under a perfect gas model, the ratio of specific heats (also called [...] "isentropic exponent", adiabatic index, [...] "gamma" [...] or [...] "kappa") {{is assumed to be}} constant along with the gas constant. For a real gas, the ratio of specific heats can wildly oscillate as a function of temperature. Under a perfect gas model there is an elegant set of equations for determining thermodynamic state along a constant entropy <b>stream</b> <b>line</b> called the isentropic chain. For a real gas, the isentropic chain is unusable and a Mollier diagram would be used instead for manual calculation. However, graphical solution with a Mollier diagram is now considered obsolete with modern heat shield designers using computer programs based upon a digital lookup table (another form of Mollier diagram) or a chemistry based thermodynamics program. The chemical composition of a gas in equilibrium with fixed pressure and temperature can be determined through the Gibbs free energy method. Gibbs free energy is simply the total enthalpy of the gas minus its total entropy times temperature. A chemical equilibrium program normally does not require chemical formulas or reaction-rate equations. The program works by preserving the original elemental abundances specified for the gas and varying the different molecular combinations of the elements through numerical iteration until the lowest possible Gibbs free energy is calculated (a Newton-Raphson method is the usual numerical scheme). The data base for a Gibbs free energy program comes from spectroscopic data used in defining partition functions. Among the best equilibrium codes in existence is the program Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) which was written by Bonnie J. McBride and Sanford Gordon at NASA Lewis (now renamed [...] "NASA Glenn Research Center"). Other names for CEA are the [...] "Gordon and McBride Code" [...] and the [...] "Lewis Code". CEA is quite accurate up to 10,000 K for planetary atmospheric gases, but unusable beyond 20,000 K (double ionization is not modelled). CEA can be downloaded from the Internet along with full documentation and will compile on Linux under the G77 Fortran compiler.|$|E
