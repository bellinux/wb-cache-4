5|$|After the trial, Boone {{returned}} to North Carolina {{to bring his}} family back to Kentucky. In the autumn of 1779, a large party of emigrants came with him, including (according to tradition) the family of Abraham Lincoln's grandfather. Rather than remain in Boonesborough, Boone founded the nearby settlement of Boone's Station. He began earning money at this time by locating good land for other <b>settlers.</b> Transylvania land claims had been invalidated after Virginia created Kentucky County, so <b>settlers</b> needed to file new land claims with Virginia. In 1780, Boone collected about $20,000 in cash from various <b>settlers</b> and traveled to Williamsburg to purchase their land warrants. While he was sleeping in a tavern during the trip, the cash was stolen from his room. Some of the <b>settlers</b> forgave Boone the loss; others insisted he repay the stolen money, which took him several years to do.|$|E

40|$|<b>Settler</b> {{colonialism}} is exemplary of {{the processes}} of biopower theorised by Giorgio Agamben and Michel Foucault. However, <b>settler</b> colonialism remains naturalised within theories of biopower and theories of its relation to coloniality. White supremacist <b>settler</b> colonisation produces specific modes of biopolitics that sustain not only in <b>settler</b> states but also in regimes of global governance that inherit, extend, and naturalise their power. I extend Patrick Wolfe's theory that a 'logic of elimination' constitutes <b>settler</b> colonialism in the genocide and amalgamation of Indigenous peoples, by indicating that this also indigenises and naturalises white <b>settler</b> nations as projections of the West. Agamben's work illuminates how Indigenous peoples are eliminated {{in a state of}} exception to Western law, which by functioning to erase consanguinity [...] -as the patriarch in Roman law eliminates the defiant son [...] -explains Indigenous peoples' seemingly contradictory incorporation within and excision from the body of white <b>settler</b> nations. This biopolitical process specific to <b>settler</b> colonialism also structures the manner in which white <b>settler</b> societies demonstrably universalize Western law, both within their bounds and in global arenas. My call to denaturalise <b>settler</b> colonialism in social theory is but a first step towards broader study of how the biopolitics of <b>settler</b> colonialism structure current modes of biopower and require concerted critique at the intersections of Indigenous and <b>settler</b> colonial studies...|$|R

5|$|As {{the first}} <b>settlers</b> of the municipality, the Islanders and their {{descendants}} were designated hidalgos. The established <b>settlers</b> resented the Islanders for their new titles and exclusive privileges within the city government.

Unlike the established <b>settlers,</b> who relied on ranching, the Islanders were primarily farmers, and their refusal to build fences led to many disagreements when livestock trampled the fields. By the early 1740s, however, intermarriage and the need for closer economic ties had helped to alleviate some of the infighting, and the original <b>settlers</b> were given permission to serve as magistrates and council members.|$|E

40|$|Mobilities across contested terrains {{are key to}} the {{formation}} of <b>settler</b> societies. This paper explores how safety bicycles were drawn into the Australian <b>settler</b> project {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, just as the six independent colonies were federating into the Commonwealth of Australia. As recently imported objects, bicycles afforded <b>settler</b> men unprecedented mobility across remote landscapes that had not been smoothed by the infrastructures of the ‘old world’. In those years of national formation, bicycles were received as objects that could fill ‘empty’ land with people, things, activities and stories, at the same time as they generated masculine, <b>settler</b> subjectivities. A practice approach to <b>settler</b> mobilities helps to tease out the entanglements between bicycle ‘overlanding’ and two fundamental imperatives of settlerism: transforming indigenous places into <b>settler</b> places and creating ‘nativised’ <b>settler</b> subjectivities...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{suggests}} that an appraisal {{of a narrative}} deficit (and, specifically, {{an exploration of the}} structural differences separating colonial and <b>settler</b> colonial narrative forms), can contribute to explaining particularly contested traditions of decolonization in <b>settler</b> polities.

5|$|In March 1839, white <b>settlers</b> {{arrived from}} Adelaide, {{the capital of}} the colony of South Australia, to {{establish}} Port Lincoln on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula. There were significant clashes between <b>settlers</b> and Aboriginal people in the years that followed, as <b>settlers</b> spread out to establish pastoral runs around the township. In 1842, soldiers were sent to Port Lincoln from Adelaide to help protect the <b>settlers,</b> but the remoteness from Adelaide, and the vaguely defined powers and limited policing resources of the Government Resident, the local representative of the colonial government, meant that there were serious limitations on the rule of law in the region. This was especially true with respect to Aboriginal people, who were supposed to be treated as British subjects {{in the same way as}} the <b>settlers.</b> In common with other areas of South Australia, and Australia as a whole, <b>settlers</b> on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with Aboriginal resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially these revolved around keeping them at a distance using threats of violence, but they soon escalated to terrorising Aboriginal people to stop them interfering with stock and other property, tactics which sometimes resulted in violent clashes. Violence by <b>settlers</b> towards Aboriginal people often went unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in 1847 for murdering an Aboriginal man, the only such sentence in South Australia's pioneer history. This frontier violence has been described as an undeclared covert war between <b>settlers</b> and Aboriginal people.|$|E

40|$|Including a {{reactive}} <b>settler</b> {{model in}} a {{wastewater treatment plant}} model allows representation of the biological reactions {{taking place in the}} sludge blanket in the <b>settler,</b> something that is neglected in many simulation studies. The idea of including a reactive <b>settler</b> model is investigated for an ASM 1 case study. Simulations with a whole plant model including the non-reactive Takacs <b>settler</b> model are used as a reference, and are compared to simulation results considering two reactive <b>settler</b> models. The first is a return sludge model block removing oxygen and a user-defined fraction of nitrate, combined with a non-reactive Takacs <b>settler.</b> The second is a fully reactive ASM 1 Takacs <b>settler</b> model. Simulations with the ASM 1 reactive <b>settler</b> model predicted a 15. 3 % and 7. 4 % improvement of the simulated N removal performance, for constant (steady-state) and dynamic influent conditions respectively. The oxygen/nitrate return sludge model block predicts a 10 % improvement of N removal performance under dynamic conditions, and might be the better modelling option for ASM 1 plants: it is computationally more efficient and it will not overrate the importance of decay processes in the <b>settler...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} {{an examination}} and {{articulation of the}} colonial dynamics of <b>Settler</b> people, collectives, societies, and nations in the <b>settler</b> colonial northern bloc. It is geographically situated, demonstrating that <b>settler</b> colonialism transforms spaces and claims places in powerful, consistent ways, leaving observable patterns across five centuries and a vast continent. Canadian and American citizens today are revealed to be much like their trans-Atlantic forbears, while even radically-transformative <b>Settler</b> social movements are shown to often leave colonial structures and legacies intact. This project constitutes a preliminary search for libratory, decolonising potentiality within <b>Settler</b> understandings of place, currently situated {{in the framework of}} <b>settler</b> colonialism and other forms of colonising, expansive powers, each possessed of distinct geographical imaginations. The goal of this project is to render visible long-standing dynamics at the root of on-going colonisation, situating collective <b>Settler</b> relationships as the primary location of <b>settler</b> colonisation in the northern bloc. This is not intended as an accusation, but as a creative deconstruction: revealing the intimate workings of <b>settler</b> colonialism and identifying the inherent weaknesses and contradictions in colonial spaces is the necessary first step in fundamental decolonisation of the people and places of the northern bloc...|$|R
40|$|Appraising the {{evolution}} of <b>settler</b> colonial forms {{during the second half}} of the twentieth century can contribute to an appraisal of decolonisation processes. This is both because <b>settler</b> colonial forms have existed in a variety of sites of European colonial expansion (and have survived in a number of postcolonial polities), and because, contrary to other colonial forms, <b>settler</b> colonialism has been remarkably resistant to decolonisation. This article calls for integrating two non-communicating discursive fields: adding an appraisal of <b>settler</b> colonialism to discussions of decolonisation, and introducing decolonisation to analyses of <b>settler</b> colonial contexts. It briefly outlines a history of decolonizing <b>settler</b> colonial structures, and it reflects on the intellectual and historiographical shifts that have accompanied these processes. This paper also suggests that an appraisal of a narrative deficit - a specific difficulty associated with conceptualising <b>settler</b> decolonisation - can contribute to explaining widespread reluctance in enacting meaningful postcolonial passages...|$|R

40|$|Part of {{a larger}} project {{dedicated}} to a theoretical appraisal of <b>settler</b> colonial phenomena, this paper {{draws attention to the}} need to develop interpretative categories capable of accounting for the specificity of the <b>settler</b> colonial ‘situation’. In the first section, the paper suggests that <b>settler</b> colonialism establishes inherently triangular relations. It then goes on to argue that a fundamental disavowal of indigenous presences informs settler-indigenous relations. The final section suggests that <b>settler</b> colonialism is characterised by a libidinal economy that is ultimately incompatible with a colonial one. These structuring differentiations, it is argued, highlight the inherent difference between encounters in a colonial setting and encounters in a <b>settler</b> colonial one. While this ‘situation’ should not be seen as characteristic of a particular period or location, or necessarily restricted to the past (<b>settler</b> national independence, of course, does not discontinue <b>settler</b> colonial structures), this very cursory outline is primarily intended as a call for further research...|$|R
