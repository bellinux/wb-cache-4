In 1967, a paper-made bikini was introduced in France, which disintegrated when in water. Italian sportswear designer Emilio Pucci produced bikinis in <b>soft</b> <b>silk</b> jersey in his signature style.

60|$|He {{was sure}} of himself. As she walked, the <b>soft</b> <b>silk</b> of her dress--she wore a blue shantung, full-skirted--blew away from the sea and flapped and clung to her legs. She wished it would not. Everything seemed to give her away, {{and she could not}} rouse herself to deny, she was so confused.|$|E
50|$|And it <b>soft</b> as <b>silk</b> remains.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{he will be}} {{your husband}} in three months,' {{answered}} the queen, ordering the prince's presents to be brought in. The princess was very pleased with them, and admired them greatly, but the queen noticed that all the while her eyes constantly strayed from the <b>softest</b> <b>silks</b> and most brilliant jewels to the portrait of the prince.|$|R
6000|$|But {{when the}} levee rose, and all was bustle [...] In the {{dissolving}} circle, all the nations' [...] Ambassadors began as 't were to hustle [...] Round {{the young man}} with their congratulations. [...] Also the <b>softer</b> <b>silks</b> were heard to rustle [...] Of gentle dames, among whose recreations [...] It is to speculate on handsome faces, [...] Especially when such lead to high places.|$|R
60|$|We took Lucy {{into another}} room, which had by now been prepared, and laid her {{in bed and}} forced {{a few drops of}} brandy down her throat. I noticed that Van Helsing tied a <b>soft</b> <b>silk</b> {{handkerchief}} round her throat. She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] breathed the girls, {{crowding}} about Aunt Olivia, as {{she lifted}} out {{the box and}} cut the cord around it. Inside was lying a dress of <b>soft</b> <b>silk,</b> {{that had once been}} white but was now yellowed with age, and, enfolding it like a mist, a long, white bridal veil, redolent with some strange, old-time perfume that had kept its sweetness through all the years.|$|E
60|$|Then I lashed {{the tiller}} and went below {{to my own}} chest, where I got a <b>soft</b> <b>silk</b> {{handkerchief}} of my mother's. With this, and with my aid, Hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh, and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy, he began to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder and clearer, and looked in every way another man.|$|E
60|$|As {{he sat in}} {{his room}} with his face buried in his hands {{shutting}} out the light of the splendid sunset, he saw her as she sat among her <b>soft</b> <b>silks</b> and dainty flowers. Her lovely eyes and the exquisite texture of her skin grew more and more wonderful to him. The touch of his lips to hers came to seem an act of pollution, almost of envenoming, as he brooded on his unworthiness.|$|R
5000|$|Sylvie and Jeanne Boué took an {{interest}} in design at a very early age. In a 1922 article in Arts & Decoration magazine, Jeanne wrote: From our earliest childhood Madame Montegut and myself have craved the beautiful: our desire first took shape in the collecting of dainty ribbons, <b>soft</b> <b>silks,</b> all luxurious materials, flowers, laces - everything that expressed beauty in form and color. We began by dressing our dolls in the prevailing mode and later found an outlet for our love of the beautiful in creating our own attire.|$|R

6000|$|Her {{face was}} aflame, {{and the heavy}} coils of her black hair fell about her shoulders. The folds of the <b>soft</b> <b>silk</b> robe she wore {{streamed}} from her and floated in the rhythm of her advance. She drew nearer and nearer, and his heart was beating fast. All his doubts were gone. The shadow of the doorway fell athwart her face and she was near him. [...] "You have not betrayed us?" [...] she cried. [...] "You are with us?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was shown}} {{into the same}} room as before; but it was much darkened with blinds and curtains. The Princess was not there, but she {{presently}} entered, dressed in a loose wrap of some <b>soft</b> <b>silk,</b> in color a dusky orange, her head again with black lace floating about it, her arms showing themselves bare from under her wide sleeves. Her face seemed even more impressive in the sombre light, the eyes larger, the lines more vigorous. You might have imagined her a sorceress who would stretch forth her wonderful hand and arm to mix youth-potions for others, but scorned to mix them for herself, having had enough of youth.|$|E
60|$|The {{little fellow}} {{snatched}} a <b>soft</b> <b>silk</b> scarf from the basket, {{and held it}} towards Monna Brigida, that she might use it as her guardian angel desired. Her anger and mortification were fast giving way to spiritual alarm. Monna Berta and that cloud of witnesses, highly-dressed society in general, were not looking at her, and she was surrounded by young monitors, whose white robes, and wreaths, and red crosses, and dreadful candour, had something awful in their unusualness. Her Franciscan confessor, Fra Cristoforo, of Santa Croce, was not at hand to reinforce her distrust of Dominican teaching, and she was helplessly possessed and shaken by a vague sense that a supreme warning was come to her. Unvisited by the least suggestion of any other course that was open to her, she took the scarf that was held out, and rubbed her cheeks, with trembling submissiveness.|$|E
60|$|So he bade her to arise--though {{he still}} held {{her by the}} hair (all warm, it was, and as <b>soft</b> as <b>silk</b> and very fragrant) and the lady stood up, {{trembling}} before him.|$|R
60|$|Elsie {{clapped her}} hands with girlish delight as {{he held up a}} fine {{buckskin}} dress, beautifully adorned with beads and quills. It was exquisitely tanned, as <b>soft</b> as <b>silk,</b> and a deep cream color.|$|R
6000|$|As Ben told Dickey Spry, {{when they}} got home that night, it [...] "jest took the eyes outer Mother Green an' Nelly to see them lookin' as <b>soft</b> as <b>silk</b> an' fine as fiddlers." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{this was}} clever of her, {{even in a}} woman, for Cyril Waring, as he fondly imagined, was {{travelling}} that line that day disguised as a stock-broker. In other words, there was none of the brown velveteen affectation about his easy get-up. He was an artist, to be sure, but he hadn't assiduously and obtrusively dressed his character. Instead of cutting his beard to a Vandyke point, or enduing his body in a Titianesque coat, or wearing on his head a slouched Rembrandt hat, stuck carelessly just a trifle on one side in artistic disorder, he was habited, {{for all the world}} like anybody else, in the grey tweed suit of the common British tourist, surmounted by the light felt hat (or bowler), to match, of the modern English country gentleman. Even the <b>soft</b> <b>silk</b> necktie of a delicate aesthetic hue that adorned his open throat didn't proclaim him at once a painter by trade. It showed him merely as a man of taste, with a decided eye for harmonies of colour.|$|E

At Glogau, at Breslau, {{there had been the}} due inspecting: Friedrich got to Neisse on the 23d (Bathyani just stirring in that Bavarian Business, Vilshofen and the Hessians close ahead); and on the 27th, had dismissed Old Leopold, with thanks and sympathies,--sent him home, [...] "to recover his health." [...] Leopold's health is probably suffering; but his heart and spirits still more. Poor old man, he has just lost--the other week, [...] "5th February" [...] last--his poor old Wife, at Dessau; and is broken down with grief. The <b>soft</b> <b>silk</b> lining of his hard Existence, in all parts of it, is torn away. Apothecary Fos's Daughter, Reich's Princess, Princess of Dessau, called by whatever name, she had been the truest of Wives; [...] "used to attend him in all his Campaigns, for above fifty years back." [...] "Gone, now, forever gone!"--Old Leopold had wells of strange sorrow in the rugged heart of him,--sorrow, and still better things,--which he does not wear on his sleeve. Here is an incident I never can forget;--dating twelve or thirteen years ago (as is computable), middle of July, 1732.|$|E

Kora cotton sarees are priced between [...] to [...] The sales of kora cotton sarees have seen a decline over the last three decades due to change in dressing preferences of women. <b>Soft</b> <b>silk</b> sarees look grander and colorful with designer blouses. Lower demand and higher remunerations for weaving <b>soft</b> <b>silk</b> sarees have led to weavers switching to weaving silk sarees. The GI tag helped increase sales by 15% in 2014-15. But the spike in demand was able to convince weavers to switch back to weaving kora sarees and the sales declined the following year. The Government of Tamil Nadu sells the sarees through government run Co-optex stores.|$|E

And on the thrones were seated two of the sweetest and fairest little maidens that mortal man had ever beheld. Their lovely hair was fine as a spider's web; their eyes were kind and smiling, their cheeks soft and dimpled, their mouths shapely as a cupid's bow and tinted like the petals of a rose. Upon their heads were set two crowns of fine spun gold, worked into fantastic shapes and set with glittering gems. Their robes were <b>soft</b> <b>silks</b> of pale yellow, with strings of sparkling emeralds for ornament.|$|R
