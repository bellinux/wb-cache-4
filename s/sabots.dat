500|$|Oppenheimer {{assembled}} a {{team at the}} Los Alamos Laboratory to work on plutonium gun design that included senior engineer Edwin McMillan and senior physicists Charles Critchfield and Joseph Hirschfelder. Critchfield had been working with <b>sabots,</b> which Oppenheimer believed would be required by the Thin Man to achieve the high muzzle velocities that critical assembly would require. Hirschfelder {{had been working on}} internal ballistics. Oppenheimer led the design effort himself until June 1943, when Navy Captain William Sterling Parsons arrived and took over the Ordnance and Engineering Division and direct management of the [...] "Thin Man" [...] project.|$|E
2500|$|Slugs for shotgun shells {{are also}} {{commonly}} cast from pure lead by handloaders, for subsequent reloading into shotgun shells. [...] Although roll crimps of shotgun hull cases {{are commonly used}} for handloading these cast lead slugs, {{in place of the}} fold crimps that are used when reloading shot into shotgun shells, some published recipes specifically do include fold crimps. [...] For published recipes using fold crimps and shot wads used as <b>sabots,</b> slugs can be easily reloaded using standard shotshell presses and techniques, without requiring any roll crimp tools. [...] Whether roll crimps or fold crimps are used, cast lead slugs are commonly used in jurisdictions where rifles are banned for hunting, under the reasoning that fired slugs will not travel but over short distances, unlike rifle bullets which can travel up to several miles when fired. [...] Use of cast lead slugs is therefore very common when hunting large game near populated areas.|$|E
60|$|There is {{a fashion}} in <b>sabots.</b> Every spring they are freshly painted. One {{district}} fancies an orange yellow, another a red, a third white, suggesting purity and innocence.

Attempting to run in <b>sabots</b> I do not recommend to the beginner.|$|E

50|$|<b>Saboted</b> slugs are shotgun {{projectiles}} {{smaller than}} the bore of the shotgun and supported by a plastic <b>sabot.</b> The <b>sabot</b> is traditionally designed to engage the rifling in a rifled shotgun barrel and impart a ballistic spin onto the projectile. This differentiates them from traditional slugs, which are not designed to benefit from a rifled barrel (though neither does the other any damage). Due {{to the fact that}} they do not contact the bore, they can be made from a variety of materials including lead, copper, brass, or steel. <b>Saboted</b> slugs can vary in shape, but are typically bullet-shaped for increased ballistic coefficient and greater range. The <b>sabot</b> is generally plastic and serves to seal the bore and keep the slug centered in the barrel while it rotates with the rifling. The <b>sabot</b> separates from the slug after it departs the muzzle. <b>Saboted</b> slugs fired from rifled bores are superior in accuracy over any smooth-bored slug options with accuracy approaching that of low-velocity rifle calibers.|$|R
50|$|The Naples <b>Sabot</b> is an 8 ft sailing dinghy. The Naples <b>Sabot</b> was {{designed}} by Roy McCullough and R.A. Violette and the first two were built in Violette's garage during WW II, although official designs were not made available until 1946. The Naples <b>Sabot</b> {{is based on the}} Balboa Dinghy and on Charles MacGregor's <b>Sabot</b> as published in Rudder magazine, April 1939. It takes its name from Naples in Long Beach, California, where it was developed.|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{motion of}} a FSAPDS projectile is affected {{due to the}} propellant gas force, aerodynamic, gravity along with mechanical force, and shockwave forces. In the <b>sabot</b> opening process, the mechanical action takes place and the <b>sabot</b> gets separated due to the shockwave force. In external mechanical action of <b>sabot</b> separation, the maximum stretch of the spring defines the end of third phase of motion. In this paper {{the motion of the}} projectile and its stability during this phase has been presented. The time delay in the <b>sabot</b> opening affects the stability of the projectile is discussed with the help of modified stability parameter...|$|R

50|$|Used {{typically}} in rifled small arms (SLAP, shotguns and muzzleloaders), an expanding cup <b>sabot</b> has a one piece <b>sabot</b> surrounding {{the base and}} sides of a projectile, providing both structural support and obturation. Upon firing, when the <b>sabot</b> and projectile leave the muzzle of the gun, inertia from {{the rotation of the}} projectile, due to barrel rifling, opens up the segments surrounding the projectile, rapidly presenting more surface area to air pressure, quickly releasing it.|$|R

50|$|Between 1941 and 1943, the British {{combined}} the two techniques in the armour-piercing discarding <b>sabot</b> (APDS) round. The <b>sabot</b> replaced the outer metal {{shell of the}} APCR. While in the gun the shot had a large base area to get maximum acceleration from the propelling charge but once outside, the <b>sabot</b> fell away to reveal a heavy shot with a small cross-sectional area. High-velocity armor-piercing (HVAP) rounds were also introduced by the United States Army, and were primarily used by tank destroyers.|$|R
50|$|The Young <b>Sabot</b> Maker is an oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} made by Henry Ossawa Tanner in 1895. Measuring 47 3/8 x 35 3/8 inches (120.3 x 89.9 cm), the painting was purchased by The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in 1995. The painting depicts an older man proudly watching a boy push with his weight against the crossbar handle of a sawhorse to carve a <b>sabot,</b> or wooden shoe. The two figures stand within the <b>sabot</b> maker's workshop, wood shavings scattered around them on the floor.|$|R
