The bass and treble controls on a home stereo are a simple type of equalizer. Equalizers exist in pro sound reinforcement systems in three forms: shelving equalizers (typically for {{a whole range of}} bass and treble frequencies), graphic equalizers and parametric equalizers. Graphic equalizers have faders (vertical <b>slide</b> <b>controls)</b> which together resemble a frequency response curve plotted on a graph. The faders can be used to boost or cut specific frequency bands.|$|E

Use of the <b>slide</b> <b>controls</b> (commonly the joystick [...] "Hat" [...] switch) allows the player to navigate to areas of the map away from their current location. The use of wire-frame models meant that areas at varying distances would appear to mix together when overlapping.

It featured 6 bands with a boost or cut range of 8 dB. It used a slide switch to adjust each band in 1 dB steps. Davis's second graphic equalizer was the Altec Lansing Model 9062A EQ.

A modern controller lacks internal sound-generation, instead {{acting as a}} primary or secondary input for a synthesizer, digital sampler or a computer running a VST instrument or other software sound generator. Many have several user-definable knobs and <b>slide</b> <b>controls</b> which can control aspects of a synthesizer's sound in real-time. Such controllers are much cheaper than a full synthesizer, and are increasingly equipped with Universal Serial Bus, which allows connection to a computer without a MIDI interface. Despite not using MIDI directly, software applications recognize such controllers as a MIDI device. In most cases, a USB-equipped controller can draw necessary power from the interface's 5v line, and does not require an A/C adapter when connected to a computer. Keyboards {{range in size from}} 88 weighted-action keys to portable 25-key models. Controllers, such as Audiocubes, can be used for performance applications (by a trained pianist, for example) or by a DJ to trigger sound samples and rhythm loops.|$|E

The aim of Emotional Information Retrieval (EmIR) {{and of our}} research is to identify knowledge about emotional-laden documents and to use these findings in {{a new kind of}} World Wide Web information service that allows users to search and browse by emotion. Our prototype, called Media EMOtion SEarch (MEMOSE), is largely {{based on the results of}} research regarding emotive music pieces, images and videos. In order to index both evoked and depicted emotions in these three media types and to make them searchable, we work with a controlled vocabulary, <b>slide</b> <b>controls</b> to adjust the emotions’ intensities, and broad folksonomies to identify and separate the correct resource-specific emotions. This separation of so-called power tags is based on a tag distribution which follows either an inverse power law (only one emotion was recognized) or an inverse-logistical shape (two or three emotions were recognized). Both distributions are well known in information science. MEMOSE consists of a tool for tagging basic emotions with the help of <b>slide</b> <b>controls,</b> a processing device to separate power tags, a retrieval component consisting of a search interface (for any topic in combination with one or more emotions) and a results screen.

40|$|When {{the term}} “graphic {{equalizer}} ” was first coined, {{the intent was}} to provide a device that allowed the user to “draw ” the desired frequency response using slider controls on the unit’s front panel. Thus, the Holy Grail of graphic equalizers is a device with a response that truly matches the slider settings. For years, this seemingly unobtainable goal resulted in products based on the fine art of compromise … until the DEQ 60 L. It’s not Constant—not Proportional—It’s Perfect! Digital Signal Processing (DSP) allows filter technology not possible with analog designs. Rane coined the term Perfect-Q ™ to describe the results (U. S. patent 7, 266, 205). The DEQ 60 L is the first true graphic equalizer (i. e., one providing real mechanical front panel <b>slide</b> <b>controls)</b> whose output response precisely matches its front panel settings. Perfect-Q features virtually no band interaction and extremely low ripple between adjacent bands. To keep things flexible, fear not proportional-Q lovers, each channel of the DEQ 60 L is selectable between Perfect-Q or Proportional-Q response.
