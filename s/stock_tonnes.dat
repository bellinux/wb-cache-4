50|$|Diplotaxodon {{species are}} {{important}} food fish around the lake, being collected {{by a number}} of small-scale fishing methods, such as Chirimila seines and baited hooks, as well as by trawling. Although they represent a potentially very large fishery <b>stock</b> (100,000 <b>tonnes),</b> with a potentially sustainable fishery yield of around 20,000 tonnes, their populations are spread thinly in inaccessible deep-water and offshore habitats, making them difficult to exploit economically, although some seasonal fisheries seem to exploit them heavily on traditional breeding grounds. A single species (D. limnothrissa) has occasionally been collected and bred as an aquarium fish.|$|R

The exidoitatlon rate (U) {{is estimated at}} 0. 33 and the total annual <b>stock</b> at 1181 <b>tonnes.</b> The yield curve shows that the fishing mortality can be increased from the present level of 0. 72 to 1. 75 to get increased yield...|$|R
50|$|At 10:17 on 21 September 2001, {{ten days}} after the attacks in the United States, a massive {{explosion}} destroyed the entire AZF facility in Toulouse, killing 29 people, injured over 3000 people and damaged 10,000 buildings, including nearby schools, hospitals, businesses and 600 homes. The explosion measured 3.5 on the Richter scale and windows were blown out over five kilometres away from the epicenter. 1,400 families were left homeless. The blast released an ammonia cloud that eventually settled on nearby suburbs sending many more to hospital. On {{the day of the}} blast, Jandoubi was working in hangar 10, 30 metres from hangar 221 whose <b>stock</b> of 200-300 <b>tonnes</b> of ammonium nitrate exploded.|$|R
40|$|Fisheries {{science is}} {{a branch of}} marine science that deals with studies on the life history and state of fish stocks. The term ‘life history’ refers to the general biology of a fish stock (e. g. when/where do the fish spawn? How fast do they grow?). The term ‘state of a fish stock’ refers to the number and weight of fish in the stock (i. e. current <b>stock</b> biomass in <b>tonnes).</b> The overall aim of {{fisheries}} science is to provide information to managers on the state and life history of the stocks. This information feeds into the decision making process. Fisheries science, economic, social and political considerations all {{have an impact on}} the final management decision.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{hatchery}} and culture techniques of the sea cucumber, Holothuria scabra, from India. Larvae and juveniles were produced {{for the first time}} in 1988 at the Research Centre of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute of Tuticorin on the south eastern coast of India. Large, healthy and uninjured specimens were selected as broodstock. They were <b>stocked</b> in one <b>tonne</b> tanks in the hatchery. Mud from the natural habitat was collected and put at the bottom of the tanks for the sea cucumbers to bury. The seawater in the tank was changed daily and the bottom mud was changed every fortnight. Sea cucumbers were subjected to thermal stimulation during March-May, the major breeding peak, and also during November-December, the minor breeding peak...|$|R
50|$|Overfishing {{continues}} {{despite repeated}} warnings {{of the current}} precipitous decline. In 2007, researchers from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)—the regulators of Atlantic bluefin fishing—recommended a global quota of 15,000 tonnes to maintain current <b>stocks</b> or 10,000 <b>tonnes</b> to allow the fisheries recovery. ICCAT then chose a quota of 36,000 tonnes, but surveys indicated that up to 60,000 tonnes were actually being taken (a third of the total remaining stocks) and the limit was reduced to 22,500 tonnes. Their scientists now say that 7500 tonnes are the sustainable limit. In November 2009, ICCAT set the 2010 quota at 13,500 tonnes and said that if stocks were not rebuilt by 2022, it would consider closing some areas.|$|R
40|$|Tuna {{and tuna}} like fishes of Indian seas which remain largely underexploited at present, held the {{greatest}} promise {{for development of}} fishing Industry In India. The percentage composition of total tunas in the all India marine fish production ranged from 0. 3 In 1970 to 1. 36 In 1984 - 85. Lakshadweep a group of coral Islands in the Arabian Sea has got {{the distinction of being}} the only region In India where an organised fishery for tuna has been established In the small scale mechanised sector. Lakshadweep waters consisting of 20000 sq. kms. of territorial waters and 400000 sq. kms. of exclusive economic zone is potentially rich for tuna and shark. It is estimated that Lakshadweep waters support of fishable <b>stock</b> of 50000 <b>tonnes</b> of skipjack, 50000 tonnes of deep water tuna and allied species and 1 lakh tonnes of shark. Against this the present exploitation is 4807 tonnes of tuna In 1986 forming 87...|$|R
5|$|When the Phoenicians {{first came}} {{to what is now}} Spain, they {{obtained}} so much silver that they could not fit it all on their ships, and as a result used silver to weight their anchors instead of lead. By the time of the Greek and Roman civilizations, silver coins were a staple of the economy: the Greeks were already extracting silver from galena by the 7th century BC, and the rise of Athens was partly made possible by the nearby silver mines at Laurium, from which they extracted about 30 tonnes a year from 600 to 300 BC. The stability of the Roman currency relied to a high degree on the supply of silver bullion, mostly from Spain, which Roman miners produced on a scale unparalleled before the discovery of the New World. Reaching a peak production of 200 tonnes per year, an estimated silver <b>stock</b> of 10000 <b>tonnes</b> circulated in the Roman economy {{in the middle of the}} second century AD, five to ten times larger than the combined amount of silver available to medieval Europe and the Abbasid Caliphate around AD 800. The Romans also recorded the extraction of silver in central and northern Europe in the same time period. This production came to a nearly complete halt with the fall of the Roman Empire, not to resume until the time of Charlemagne: by then, tens of thousands of tonnes of silver had already been extracted.|$|R
50|$|Aquaculture in Uganda is {{recorded}} to have started in 1941 after carp was imported into the country. Fish farming was officially {{proposed by the}} colonial authorities and the Kajjansi Fish Experimental Station established in 1947. However, the introduction of carp, was embroiled in controversies due to differences among the lead scientists on the possible adverse impact of common carp on the indigenous aquatic environment in case they escaped from {{the confines of the}} fishponds. Because of this, it was decided to use tilapia for stocking purposes. A vigorous fish farming extension programme resulted in the construction of 1 500 ponds by 1956; these were concentrated in the central region (Buganda) and the most southwestern part of the country (Kigezi). In 1959-60 an FAO- supported comparative evaluation of carp and tilapia endorsed the use of carp and resulted in further expansion of aquaculture in Uganda. Aquaculture was further promoted under the drive for rural development, and by late 1968 the Department of Fisheries recorded up to 11 000 ponds mostly producing fish for subsistence. However, subsistence farming was largely based on the supply of seed from farmer to farmer and/or from the government station, which hampered the expansion of the aquaculture sub-sector. Changing policies under successive governments also led to uneven support and many farmers abandoned ponds due to lack of stocking materials, limited technical guidance and excessive government regulatory regimes. The Fisheries Master Plan study of 1999 established that Uganda had only 4 500 functioning ponds with only a portion <b>stocked,</b> producing 285 <b>tonnes</b> of fish annually.|$|R
40|$|The stock {{assessment}} of the marine crabs, Portunus (Portunus) sanguinolentus and Portunus (Portunus) pelagicus exploited by the mechanised trawl fishery was made based on the data collected from the commercial catches landed at Mangalore, Malpe and Kanvar; three important fish landing centres in the Karnataka state along the southwest coast of India during 1992 -' 94 and the results presented. In P. (P.) sanguinolentus, the mean values of total mortality coefficient (Z), natural mortality coefficient (M) and fishing mortality coefficient (F) were 4. 2 + 0. 51, 1. 6 and 2. 6 for males and 3. 9 + 0. 42, 1. 5 and 2. 4 for females respectively. In P. (P.) pelagicus, the average values of Z, M and F were 5. 6 + 0. 71, 1. 7 and 3. 9 for males and 4. 9 + 0. 69, 1. 6 and 3. 2 respectively for females. The standing <b>stocks</b> were 308 <b>tonnes</b> for P (P.) sanguinolentus and 161 tonnes for P. (P.) pelagicus. The annual average stocks were 1, 272 tonnes for the former species and 834 tonnes for the latter. The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was 776 tonnes for P. (P.) sanguinolentus and 567 tonnes for P. (P.) pelagicus. Based on the results obtained, it is felt imperative to increase the cod end mesh size of trawl to 40 mm and also to restrict the level of effort at the present level (1, 130 trawlers per day or 234 x lo 3 boat days) which would prevent overexploitation of the stocks of crabs in the coastal fishery sector of Karnataka...|$|R
