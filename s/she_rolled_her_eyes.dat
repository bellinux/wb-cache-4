60|$|The {{young lady}} sighed. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> at Mr. Waddington {{in a manner}} which {{was meant to be}} languishing.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{round the}} young men, {{with a long}} sweep of her painted eyelashes, and flashed her yellow teeth at them. She spoke with a cockney accent, but with an {{affectation}} of refinement which made every word a feast of fun.|$|E
6000|$|Was {{there ever}} {{anything}} so lucky as this? Pamela's situation was fast becoming the cook's situation. The bosom of the vigourous little woman {{began to show}} signs of tender agitation--distributed over a large surface. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> amorously. Benjulia puffed out another mouthful of smoke. [...] "Well," [...] he repeated, [...] "who rewards Pamela?" ...|$|E
60|$|The yelling Ghost {{before him}} stands, See! <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> around, Now <b>she</b> lifts her bony hands, Now her {{footsteps}} shake the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "They notice nothing, these others," [...] he remarked, with {{a little}} wave of the hand. [...] "It is always the woman who counts. You are right, monsieur. She dances like a stick. She has good calves and <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The canaille applaud. It is always like that. Your health, monsieur!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Mike {{is happy}} {{he no longer}} has to pay alimony since Susan is getting remarried. Susan drags Jackson aside {{to tell him how}} much she needs Mike's money, saying, [...] "I'm sorry, but I can't marry you." [...] He points out that he'll be sent back to Canada and <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and says, [...] "It's Canada, not Iran. It's like America with free health insurance." [...] She {{promises}} to talk to Mike {{to see if they can}} [...] "work something out." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gabriel Nash {{introduced}} the new-comers to his companions; but the younger {{of the two}} ladies gave no sign of lending herself to this transaction. The girl was very white; she huddled there, silent and rigid, frightened to death, staring, expressionless. If Bridget Dormer had seen her at this moment she might have felt avenged for the discomfiture of her own spirit suffered at the Salon, the day before, under the challenging eyes of Maud Vavasour. It was plain at the present hour that Miss Vavasour would have run away had she not regarded the persons present as so many guards and keepers. Her appearance made Nick feel as if the little temple of art {{in which they were}} collected had been the waiting-room of a dentist. Sherringham had seen a great many nervous girls tremble before the same ordeal, and he liked to be kind to them, to say things that would help them to do themselves justice. The probability in a given case was almost overwhelmingly in favour of their having any other talent one could think of in a higher degree than the dramatic; but he could rarely refrain from some care that the occasion shouldn't be, even as against his conscience, too cruel. There were occasions indeed that could scarce be too cruel to punish properly certain examples of presumptuous ineptitude. He remembered what Mr. Nash had said about this blighted maiden, and perceived that though she might be inept she was now anything but presumptuous. Gabriel fell to talking with Nick Dormer while Peter addressed himself to Mrs. Rooth. There was no use as yet for any direct word to the girl, who was too scared even to hear. Mrs. Rooth, with her shawl fluttering about her, nestled against her daughter, putting out her hand to take one of Miriam's soothingly. She had pretty, silly, near-sighted eyes, a long thin nose, and an upper lip which projected over the under as an ornamental cornice rests on its support. [...] "So much depends--really everything!" [...] she said in answer to some sociable observation of Sherringham's. [...] "It's either this," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> expressively about the room, [...] "or it's--I don't know what!" ...|$|E
50|$|Room 702 and {{the clients}} {{requested}} Annie Duke for room service rather than Natalie Gulbis. Natalie {{had a hard}} time doing the room service and <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in front of Room 702.|$|E
5000|$|Lawal was {{released}} from Strikeforce following comments he made on Twitter regarding Pat Lundvall after his hearing for his drug test. Lawal said, [...] "She asked if I did research for my training. I didn't get what she meant by the question, and <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and asked, 'Do you speak English? Can you read?' I felt I was disrespected by the woman's comments. How {{are you going to}} ask a college educated, well traveled man if he can speak or read English? I'm speaking English {{right in front of you}} and I've been speaking English right in front of you for the past 15 minutes."After the release, Lawal issued an apology to Lundvall, stating, [...] "I was out of line for calling the woman the b-word and I was wrong for that. I was kind of mad about the comments, I was offended by the comments made towards me and I was out of line. I was too emotional. I apologize for that. With that being said, I still feel that I was offended, but I'm in the wrong for what I said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want to {{talk about}} her. She used to be married to someone, and she {{divorced}} him. And then she was married to someone else, and he divorced her. And I'm certain her hair wasn't that colour two years ago, and I don't think a woman ought to make up like that, and her dress is all wrong for the country, and those pearls can't be genuine, and I hate the way <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> about, and pink doesn't suit her a bit. I think she's an awful woman, and I wish you wouldn't keep on talking about her." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> would <b>roll</b> <b>her</b> big <b>eyes</b> {{and become}} {{in a way}} magnificent, so that Godfrey forgot her ugliness and the {{repulsion}} with which she inspired him.|$|R
5000|$|The video shows Alex Turner, Jamie Cook, Nick O'Malley and Matt Helders in the 'Howl at the Moon' pub in East London, Hoxton Street, {{having a}} drink. The song [...] "Do I Wanna Know?" [...] {{can be heard}} in the background. Wasted, Alex sends {{multiple}} text messages to a girl called Stephanie to get a booty call, without any answer. When he leaves the pub, he walks through the city and hallucinates seeing Stephanie having sex with different men and riding naked {{on the back of a}} man's motorcycle. Eventually, he gets to the wrong house, across the street from Stephanie's, and repeatedly knocks on the door while texting her [...] "I'm outside". The camera shows the girl at her home picking up the phone and seeing 17 missed messages from [...] "Alex band guy". <b>She</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in irritation and decides to ignore his texts.|$|R
40|$|Humming a tune as I {{rounded the}} corner, I plucked a chart {{from the wall}} outside room 14. Carol Todd, a woman of 48, {{had come to see}} me about "cellulitis of the scalp. " My nurse had scrawled a {{question}} mark after her history, and then an exclamation point. I shot a quizzical look into the nurses' pod at her. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> at me and mouthed the words, "You'll see. " I knocked on the door and entered the examination room...|$|E
40|$|Iwent to {{my first}} National Collegiate Honors Council conference just this last yearand {{was sitting in a}} session on {{national}} scholarships when the phrase “learning out-comes ” came up. I turned to the woman behind me with whom I’d been briefly chat-ting before the session began and asked if this kind of evaluative structure was being implemented at her university. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> “We’re all just sick of it, ” she said. “When I list my ‘learn-ing outcomes ’ on my syllabuses, I just want to say, ‘I have no idea what we’ll learn. ’” It is no secret that educational institutions across the nation have in recent years been encouraged, urged, and forced to adopt a lexicon that seems better suited to the worlds of corporations and governments. In fact, according to Charles Miller, the business executive heading up the presidentially-appointed Commission on the Future of Higher Education, “levers ” like the accreditation process can and should be used to push educational reforms that will utilize standardized testing to measure stu-dent learning at all levels of higher education. At the same time that my colleagues in the English Department have decried the use of terms like “clients ” and “cus-tomers ” to describe our students, our upper administration has adopted a “scorecard...|$|E
50|$|After Von Der Pool {{appeared}} on {{an episode of}} Food Network’s Chopped, her behavior {{caused a lot of}} backlash for her reputation. Food Network then released an article calling her a “catty competitor.” The article then stated “Chef Lauren Von Der Pool’s true colors show when <b>she</b> repeatedly <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and calls out contestant Sarah Pouzar.” Many viewers agreed with this article, claiming she had a “nasty attitude,” while others defended Von Der Pool, stating her behavior was merely competitive and perhaps unsportsmanlike at times. This may be an example of fundamental attribution error, when the flaws of members of non-dominant groups (for example, minorities) are attributed to a deficiency in personal character. In contrast, the flaws of members of dominant groups are ascribed to a matter of circumstance. By the article likening Von Der Pool’s behavior to her “true colors” and not circumstance (like the stress of the competition), the article’s characterization of her behavior is an instance of fundamental attribution error.|$|R

5000|$|Bibi P. Luche Dávalos (portrayed by Regina Blandón) is {{considered}} [...] "la rara" [...] (the weird one) of the family, similar to Marilyn Munster from The Munsters. Bibi {{is the only}} [...] "real" [...] child of Ludovico and Federica. Bibi is polite and correct, and has developed a great knowledge from studying, to her parents' despair as they beg her to act [...] "normal." [...] She's very smart and gets good grades; she loves her family but dislikes that they object to her studiousness. She {{is the only one}} in the family with common sense, with exception of Maradonio. She is also the most understanding, but her family thinks otherwise, but as it turns out it is not just her family who object her common sense it is everyone. <b>She</b> always <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> when they deliver their phrase [...] "Por Que No Eres Una Niña Normal?"

60|$|When {{the girls}} had perched {{themselves}} on any available article of furniture, they waited with respectful eagerness, while Sally retired to the hall for a moment, and Julia <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> with <b>her</b> finger on her lips, looking {{as if she could}} tell much if she dared.|$|R
60|$|A moment later, as the demoniacal {{chorus of}} yells, songs, incantations, shrieks, groans, and prayers swelled high, a farmer's wife {{on the left}} uttered a hoarse cry and {{stiffened}} and fell backward upon the ground. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> {{head from side to}} side. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> turned in; <b>her</b> lips wore a maniac's laugh, and her troubled brow made her look like the death mask of a tortured murderer, the hell horror frozen on it.|$|R
5000|$|Snoopy is less helpful, however, when Patty {{complains}} that {{her hair is}} a [...] "mousey blah" [...] style. Snoopy brings in a large red gift box, and inside is a large red curly-haired wig that makes Patty look like Little Orphan Annie.

60|$|Mr. Guppy {{acknowledged}} the receipt by {{taking it out}} of his breast-pocket, putting it to his lips, and returning it to his pocket with a bow. Mr. Guppy's mother was so diverted that <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> head as <b>she</b> smiled and made a silent appeal to Caddy with her elbow.|$|R
50|$|Highlander: The Search For Vengeance {{contains}} two Quickenings {{that occur in}} the same manner as those in the first original Highlander movie. A Japanese woman in the fields undergoes vibrations in her head and slightly <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as <b>she</b> becomes immortal. Colin MacLeod's Quickening by lightning takes place inside an old Stonehenge-like structure and is very similar to Connor MacLeod's Quickening in the Highlands of Scotland.|$|R
50|$|Pain of the Task: Allie and Roxanne did {{not like}} Tammy's theme {{and they were not}} {{focusing}} on the task. Tammy had a discussion with the two in order to get them focused, but Tammy could not control them.

60|$|Anything {{like the}} jocoseness of Mr. Guppy's mother just now, I think I never saw. She made no sound of laughter, but <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> head, and shook it, {{and put her}} {{handkerchief}} to her mouth, and appealed to Caddy with her elbow, and her hand, and her shoulder, and was so unspeakably entertained altogether that it was with some difficulty she could marshal Caddy through the little folding-door into her bedroom adjoining.|$|R
