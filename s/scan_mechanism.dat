5000|$|Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) - SCAT is {{an active}} {{microwave}} device designed and developed at ISRO/SAC, Ahmedabad. It {{will be used to}} determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer {{is an active}} microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a <b>scan</b> <b>mechanism</b> with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.90° and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.60° on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{covers a}} range of issues in the design of latches and {{flip-flops}} for low-power applications. First it revisits, extends, and improves the energy-performance optimization methodology, attempting to make it more formal and comprehensive. The data-switching factor and the glitching activity are taken into consideration, using a formal analytical approach, then a notion of an energy-efficient family of configurations is introduced to make the comparison of different latch styles in the energy-performance space more fair. A recently proposed methodology for balancing hardware intensity in processor pipelines is applied to latch design to facilitate the selection of the objective function for tuning transistor sizes. The power dissipation of the clock distribution is taken into account, supported by simulations of extracted netlists for multibit datapath registers. Practical issues of building a low overhead <b>scan</b> <b>mechanism</b> are considered, and the power overhead of the scannable design is analyzed. A low-power level-sensitive <b>scan</b> <b>mechanism</b> is proposed, and results of a comparative study of scannable latches are shown.
