5|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} allows {{the development of}} an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> alone in forming new attachments.|$|E

5|$|Two main {{aspects of}} adult {{attachment}} have been studied. The organization {{and stability of}} the mental working models that underlie the attachment styles is explored by social psychologists interested in romantic attachment. Developmental psychologists interested in the individual's <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> with respect to attachment generally explore how attachment functions in relationship dynamics and impacts relationship outcomes. The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual's <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested that adults do not hold a single set of working models. Instead, on one level they {{have a set of}} rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general. On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.|$|E

40|$|According {{to direct}} {{perception}} theory (DPT) people understand each other’s <b>minds</b> by way <b>of</b> perceiving each other’s behavioral engagements in the world. I argue that DPT admits of two interpretations. One interpretation {{is found in}} Searle’s social ontology. The other interpretation departs from an enactivist account of social cognition. Both can be employed {{to make sense of}} what it is to perceive other minds, but in two different senses. The first allows for the claim that people can directly perceive <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> shared in a community. In contrast, the second interpretation allows for direct perception <b>of</b> particular individuals’ <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> in the context of participation in social practices. The two interpretations are argued to be compatible.

40|$|The current {{meta-analysis}} {{examines the}} links between unresolved representations of attachment, anomalous parental behavior, and disorganized attachment relationships in 12 studies including 851 families. We found moderate effect sizes for the associations between unresolved <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> and anomalous behavior (r =. 26), unresolved <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> and infant disorganized attachment relationships (r =. 21), and anomalous behavior and disorganized attachment relationships (r =. 34). Sample characteristics, observational context, and observational measure were not associated with differences in effect sizes. Only {{a small part of}} the association between unresolved <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> and disorganized attachment relationships was explained by the mediation of anomalous parental behavior (. 26 *. 34 =. 09).

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} measures of adult attachment, the most common being self-report questionnaires and coded interviews based on the Adult Attachment Interview. The various measures were developed primarily as research tools, for different purposes and addressing different domains, for example romantic relationships, parental relationships or peer relationships. Some classify an adult's <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> with respect to attachment and attachment patterns by reference to childhood experiences, while others assess relationship behaviours and security regarding parents and peers.|$|E

5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism.

Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences.

The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind,</b> a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with {{the intricacies of the}} Arab–Israeli conflict, including the rise of the Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.|$|E

Hostile/Helpless Mental States 2 Hostile/Helpless Mental States 3 In {{a recent}} metaanalysis, only 53 % of disorganized infants were {{predicted}} by parental Unresolved <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) (van IJzendoorn, 1995). The {{goal of this}} study was to identify additional predictors of infant disorganization on the AAI by developing and validating an interview-wide coding system for Hostile/Helpless parental <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> with respect to attachment. Maternal AAI’s were collected from 45 low-income mothers with high rates of childhood trauma when their children were age 7; Strange Situation assessments had been collected at 18 months of age. AAI’s were independently coded using both the Main and Goldwyn coding system and newly developed codes for Hostile/Helpless <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> Results indicated that the Hostile/Helpless coding system displayed discriminant validity in that it did not overlap substantially with the Unresolved, Cannot Classify, or Fearfully Preoccupied by Traumatic Events (E 3) categories in the Main and Goldwyn (l 998) coding system.

5|$|According to a {{traditional}} account, Hanuman went to Valmiki numerous times to hear him sing the Ramayana, but Valmiki turned down the request saying that Hanuman being a monkey was unworthy of hearing the epic. After the victory of Rama over Ravana, Hanuman went to the Himalayas to continue his worship of Rama. There he scripted a play version of the Ramayana called Mahanataka or Hanuman Nataka engraved on the Himalayan rocks using his nails. When Valmiki saw the play written by Hanuman, he anticipated that {{the beauty of the}} Mahanataka would eclipse his own Ramayana. Hanuman was saddened at Valmiki's <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> and, being a true bhakta without any desire for glory, Hanuman cast all the rocks into the ocean, some parts of which are believed to be available today as Hanuman Nataka. After this, Valmiki was instructed by Hanuman to take birth as Tulsidas and compose the Ramayana in the vernacular.|$|E
5|$|As {{the son of}} {{the filmmaker}} Rakesh, Roshan faced the media {{spotlight}} from a young age.

The director Ashutosh Gowariker praised Roshan when he continued filming Mohenjo Daro despite several injuries and being in a troubled <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> Zoya Akhtar, who considers Roshan her favourite actor, and directed him in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, remarks on his ability to display a range of emotions on screen.|$|E

5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
5|$|Single-purpose {{characters}} {{needed a}} distinctive personality trait to quickly establish {{them with the}} player, rather than serving as a disposable item, while major characters had to reflect the player's progression and actions through the game. Mitsoda wrote the characters by thinking about who each character was, assigning them motivations determining why they were where they were, what they thought about the player and what they wanted from them. In accordance with a suggestion by fellow writer Chad Moore, the Malkavian player character has a dialog script distinct {{from that of the}} other eight clans; Mitsoda said {{it was one of the}} simpler aspects of the development cycle. He wrote the Malkavian script last, with time running out on development, and the overwork and lack of sleep contributed to what Mitsoda considered an unhealthy <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> ideal for writing insane dialog. He wanted to highlight their madness, without making it comical. Since the story is set during the Camarilla's takeover of Los Angeles, the team simplified the plot by only allowing the player to belong to one of the LA-based clans.|$|E
5|$|Sonya gives Rodya a cross {{when he goes}} to turn {{himself in}} and symbolizes the burden Raskolnikov must bear. Sonya tells him they will bear the cross {{together}} and is taking part of his burden onto herself, encouraging him to confess. Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses, so originally the cross was Lizaveta's—whom Rodya didn't intend to kill, making it an important symbol of redemption. Sonya's face reminds him of Lizaveta's face, another example of his guilty conscience and symbolizes a shared grief. Self-sacrifice, along with poverty, is a larger theme of the novel. The desperation of poverty creates a situation where the only way to survive is through self-sacrifice, which Raskolnikov consistently rejects, as part of his philosophical reasoning. For example, he rejects Razumikhin's offer of employment and the idea of his sister's arranged marriage. Raskolnikov originally rejects Sonya's offer to accompany him to the confession but, in a feverish <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> sees her following him through the market, and finds power in that idealism.|$|E
