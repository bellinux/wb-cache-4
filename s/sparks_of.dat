5|$|Chadwick {{became a}} Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, with his {{appointment}} as Chaplain in 1946, and in 1950 {{advanced to the}} position of Dean. His rising academic reputation was confirmed in 1953 with the publication of a project which had occupied him since the days of his curacy—his new translation of Origen's Contra Celsum, with introduction and notes. He had by now made himself an expert in Patristic Greek; only an inexactness in philology marking his earlier abandonment of Greek for music. Also in 1953 he was appointed co-editor (with Hedley <b>Sparks)</b> <b>of</b> the Journal of Theological Studies and continued editing it until 1985. He held the university appointment of Hulsean Lecturer from 1954–6.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the early}} <b>sparks</b> <b>of</b> the Italian revolts against Austria was the act of the Austrian {{government}} to double the tariffs of Piemontese wines into the Austrian control lands of Lombardy, Emilia and the Veneto. This had a crippling effect on the Piemontese wine industry, essentially cutting them off from their main export market. In 1846, King Charles Albert of Sardinia spoke to the Piedmontese winegrowers at {{the meeting of the}} Agricultural Congress at Casale Monferrato where he assailed the Austrian oppression. By 1848, Piedmont was at war with Austria in one {{of the early}} events that eventually led to the unification of the Italian peninsula under the rule of Charles Albert's son Victor Emmanuel.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Sparks</b> <b>of</b> Passion reentered {{the stadium}} {{in this segment}} where the largest and tallest Olympic Rings for the Opening Ceremonies would be created. Acrobats could be seen {{maneuvering}} on three ring shaped frames floating up and down along four lattice columns on {{the opposite end of}} the stadium to the stage and the mosh pit. Dancers in red unitards below gyrated to pulsing beats as the theme of passion returned for this segment of the program. While the acrobats descended to the ground, two additional ring shaped frames were raised. The five circular frames were flipped vertically revealing the five Olympic Rings shimmering in light. The rings were then illuminated in the Olympic colours and the structure was lit up in fireworks. The black ring in the centre of the symbol was substituted with white since it is impossible to produce black light.|$|E
500|$|Hasidic Judaism {{believes}} that everyday life is imbued with channels connecting with Divinity, the activation {{of which it}} sees as helping the Divine Presence {{to be drawn into}} the physical world; Hasidism argues that the food laws are related to the way such channels, termed <b>sparks</b> <b>of</b> holiness, interact with various animals. These <b>sparks</b> <b>of</b> Holiness are released whenever a Jew manipulates any object for a holy reason (which includes eating); however, not all animal products are capable of releasing their <b>sparks</b> <b>of</b> holiness. The Hasidic argument is that [...] animals are imbued with signs that reveal the release of these sparks, and the signs are expressed in the biblical categorization of ritually clean and ritually unclean.|$|E

On 18 June 1905, Russian police opened fire on one of the many workers' demonstrations in Łódź, killing approximately ten workers, whose funerals, attended by over 50,000–70,000 people, escalated into major demonstrations on 20 and 21 June.

Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL) called for a general strike on 23 June.|$|E
500|$|Mitford did {{not regard}} {{herself as a}} journalist: nevertheless, her {{articles}} were popular, particularly those she contributed on Paris life to The Sunday Times.

Thompson adds that although Mitford was always a competent writer, it is in her letters, with their freedom of expression and flights of fancy, that her true character emerges. [...] Many have been published within collections; they are, according to The Independents reviewer: [...] "a delight, full of the <b>sparks</b> <b>of</b> an abrasive and entertaining wit, refreshingly free from politeness".|$|E

500|$|Overall, the MediEvil {{series has}} {{received}} positive to mixed reviews from critics. MediEvil and MediEvil 2 were mostly praised upon release, with the atmosphere, visuals and music of both games being the prominently commended aspects. Chris Roper of IGN praised the game's sense of humour and unique presentation, but was sceptical concerning the game's [...] "sloppy" [...] controls, [...] "disjointed" [...] level designs {{and noted that}} the game's graphics did not age well over time, {{in comparison to the}} graphically superior PSP remake. Joe Fielder of GameSpot credited the first MediEvil for its original look and number of unique puzzles, but criticised the camera work. Reviewing MediEvil 2, Doug Perry of IGN praised the graphical advancements of the game, noticing that the sharper detail brings out a more [...] "sophisticated feel" [...] to the story and the new addition of cutscenes create a better sense of continuity and story. Shawn <b>Sparks</b> <b>of</b> Game Revolution similarly praised the improved graphics of the second game, noting that smooth frame rate and sharper graphics brought out the original PlayStation's power despite nearing the end of its lifespan. At the 2000 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards, MediEvil 2 won the best console game category.|$|E
