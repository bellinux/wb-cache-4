40|$|The static {{behaviour}} of an Electrorheological (ER) {{fluid in}} squeeze-flow is investigated both theoretically and experimentally for {{three types of}} loading condition namely single and <b>superimposed</b> <b>loading</b> when the fluid in energised by a constant potential, and <b>superimposed</b> <b>loading</b> when the fluid in energised by a constant field. From the experimental work an empirical equation for yield stress {{as a function of}} field is derived and there are found to be two values of the exponent in squeeze mode {{depending on the type of}} loading. The exponent obtained under single loading is consistent with that commonly quoted for ER fluids in shear mode while the exponent obtained under <b>superimposed</b> <b>loading</b> upon application of a constant potential is seen to be much larger. The theoretical analysis was successfully applied to modelling an ER fluid in static squeeze-flow. Comparison of theoretical and experimental results shows good agreement between them. The distributions of the electric field strength and field lines are investigated for parallel circular electrodes and whilst the value of the field is almost uniform in the middle regions of the inter-electrode space, there is an extremely high field existing around the edges of the space. The existence of this non-uniform edge field causes a back pressure which inhibits the radial movement of the fluid from the space between the electrodes.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the solution of various problems in the plastic collapse of plane structures. In Chapter I the basic problems and theorems of limit analysis are reviewed and formulated in a convenient notation. A pair of superposition principles are developed for limit analysis of structures in Chapter II. These principles lead to upper and lower bounds to the safety factor for a <b>superimposed</b> <b>load</b> system in terms of bounds to the safety factors for the individual loads. In addition several special problems are posed and solved in the second chapter. These include a minimax problem in which a safety factor which is valid for all load systems in a given range is found. Finally an iterative method is given for obtaining bounds to the safety factor for the proportional loading of frames when axial forces as well as bending moments are to be considered. Examples are included {{at the end of the}} chapter. Chapter III reviews three basic methods of solution for linear programming problems. The problem of the plastic collapse of structures is reduced to forms suitable for the application of these three methods. A collapse problem is solved by the several linear programming methods in Chapter IV for demonstration and comparison. A method for obtaining an initial feasible solution for Lemke 2 ̆ 7 s dual method of solving the linear programming problem is given in Appendix C.

40|$|The {{flexural}} strength of masonry is the decisive building material characteristic {{value in the}} design of masonry members loaded orthogonal to the plane, i. e. basement walls under earth pressure, facing masonry under wind loads as well as infill masonry and non-loadbearing internal partition walls. In this paper, the load bearing behaviour at a uniaxial load transfer - parallel and perpendicular to the bed joints - is examined with numerical calculation methods as well as in building component tests, the stress states in the masonry are analysed and calculation approaches for the {{flexural strength}} are derived. The determined fracture mechanical characteristic values and the complete material laws of the masonry units and the bond joints form the essential basis for the examinations on masonry. The examined masonry unit materials show a significantly different behaviour under tensile stress which can be described as “brittle” (brick) up to “distinctly non-linear, ductile” (lightweight concrete) and which is reflected in the sensitivity to notches {{as well as in the}} determined stress-crack opening curves. Nevertheless, it proved possible to describe the examined size effect on the flexural tensile strength of the masonry unit by means of one functional correlation for all types of masonry units. The bond joints are described using a meso model in which the mortar and the interface masonry unit / masonry mortar are modelled in a smeared way. For the bond joints, the complete material laws are determined for different masonry unit / masonry mortar combinations under tensile as well as shear load at a simultaneous compressive load orthogonal to the joint. Especially the tensile load bearing behaviour is significantly influenced by the notch effect resulting from shrinkage effects as well as by the anchoring effect of the mortar bolts in perforated bricks. The experimental investigations prove a considerable influence of the type and quality of the workmanship on the bond strength. The material laws under shear stress can be directly determined with torsion tests on hollow cylinders applying a newly developed test method validated by means of numerical calculations. On solid cylinders, they can be determined applying a derived analytical approach. On the one hand, the numerical investigations on two-unit specimens with rectangular cross-sections illustrate the influence of the stiffness of the mortar joint on the shear stress distribution up to the first crack load. On the other hand, it can be noted that the cross-section is almost completely plastified at the maximum transferable torsional moment. So, for the examined mortars and cross-sectional geometries in the state of failure, the calculational approach of a fully plastified joint on the stress level of the shear strength (adhesion and friction) is reasonable. In order to calculate the load bearing behaviour of a wall under bending stress parallel to the bed joints, where the number of influencing factors is higher and the stress states are more complex due to the head joints as compared to a wall under bending stress perpendicular to the bed joints, a numerical model is developed and calibrated on wall tests. In general, the test and calculation results show a very good correlation. The analysis of the stress states in the masonry units and mortar joints in the numerical investigations and the experimental tests on the masonry walls with extensive deformation measurements make it possible to comprehend the failure mechanisms. With the developed numerical model, comprehensive parameter studies are conducted for the failure cases “unit” and “joint”. In doing so, the material laws of the masonry units and the mortar as well as the geometric properties of the masonry are varied. The influence of the head joint mortar as well as of a <b>superimposed</b> <b>load</b> perpendicular to the bed joint is examined. The investigations on unit failure illustrate that the stress distribution in the masonry unit and hence the flexural strength of the masonry are significantly influenced by the overlap and the unit width (masonry width) as well as by the post-failure behaviour of the unit materials after the first crack formation. The determined stress states in the bed joints are extremely complex and they can obviously not be described by analytical approaches. Therefore, for the determination of the maximum transferable moment in the bed joint, analogous to the torsion tests on two-unit specimens, first a completely plastified bed joint is assumed applying the shear bond strength and the percentage of friction depending on the <b>superimposed</b> <b>load.</b> However, it turns out that the softening behaviour depending on the overlap geometry and the material law must be taken into account for the correct determination of the torsional moment. By mortaring the head joint, the rotation point is displaced from the centre of the overlap area to the edge of the unit. The results of the numerical simulation calculations are analytically described in the form of calculation approaches considering the findings gained in the experimental investigations, partly making simplified assumptions to describe the complex stress states. In parts, simplified assumptions are used to describe the complex stress states. The comparison of the calculation to the test results shows a good correlation especially for the own investigations where the decisive input parameters for the calculation approaches are available. A satisfactory correlation could however also be achieved for previous test results. At a bending load perpendicular to the bed joints, normally a joint failure occurs. The material law of the bond joint under tensile stress which was determined on small-size specimens is decisive. The conducted wall tests illustrate the influence of the scatter of the material properties and of the workmanship on the flexural strength. In principle, the statistic approach of the “weakest-link” theory seems targeted, however, the own tests do not allow for a statistic evaluation due to the number of test specimens. Based on the own examinations it can however be seen that, in addition to the scatter of the material properties, the number of joints and, when indicated, the wall length, also the brittleness of the bond joint must be taken into account as decisive characteristic value in a statistic approach. Summing up, on the one hand, this paper provides essential findings with regard to the material laws of the masonry components “unit” and “mortar joint” as well as to their determination; on the other hand, it illustrates findings regarding the stress distributions in masonry under uniaxial bending load and the failure mechanisms considering the non-linear material behaviour...|$|E

40|$|In the UK, {{household}} buildings insurance generally covers {{loss and}} damage to the insured property {{from a range of}} natural and human perils, including windstorm, flood, subsidence, theft, accidental fire and winter freeze. Consequently, insurers require a reasoned view on the likely scale of losses that they may face to assist in strategic planning, reinsurance structuring, regulatory returns and general risk management. The UK summer 2007 flood events not only provided a clear indication of the scale of potential losses that the industry could face from an individual event, with £ 3 billion in claims, but also identified a need for insurers and reinsurers to better understand how events may correlate in time and space, and how to most effectively use the computational models of extreme events that are commonly applied to reflect these correlations. In addition to the potential for temporal clustering of events such as windstorms and floods, {{there is a possibility that}} seemingly uncorrelated natural perils, such as floods and subsidence, may impact an insurer’s portfolio. Where aggregations of large numbers of new properties are planned, such as in the Thames Gateway, consideration of the potential future risk of aggregate losses due to the combination of perils such as subsidence and flood is increasingly important within the insurance company’s strategic risk management process. Whilst perils such as subsidence and flooding are generally considered independent within risk modelling, the potential for one event to influence the magnitude and likelihood of the other should be taken into account when determining risk level. In addition, the impact of correlated, but distinctive, loss causing events on particular property types may be significant, particularly if a specific property is designed to protect against one peril but is potentially susceptible to another. We suggest that flood events can lead to increased subsidence risk due to the weight of additional water and sediment, or rehydration of sediment under flood water. The latter mechanism may be particularly critical on sites where Holocene sediments are currently protected from flooding and are no longer subsiding. Holocene deposits tend to compress, either under their own weight or under a <b>superimposed</b> <b>load</b> such as made ground, built structures or flood water. If protected dry sediments become flooded in the future, subsidence would be expected to resume. This research project aims to investigate the correlation between flood hazards and subsidence hazards and the effect that these two sources of risk will have on insurance losses in the Thames Gateway. In particular, the research will explore the potential hydrological and geophysical drivers and links between flood and subsidence events within the Thames Gateway, assessing the potential for significant event occurrence within the timescales relevant to insurers. In the first part of the project we have identified flood risk areas within the Thames Gateway development zone which have a high risk of flooding and may be affected by renewed or increased subsidence. This has been achieved through the use of national and local-scale 2 D and 3 D geo-environmental information such as the Geosure dataset (e. g. swell-shrink, collapsible and compressible deposits data layers), PSI data, thickness of superficial and artificial land deposits, and flood potential data etc. In the second stage of the project we will investigate the hydrological and geophysical links between flooding and subsidence events on developed sites; quantify the insurance loss potential in the Thames Gateway from correlated flooding and subsidence events; consider how climate change will affect risk to developments in the Thames Gateway in the context of subsidence and flooding; and develop new ways of communicating and visualise correlated flood and subsidence risk to a range of stakeholders, including the insurance industry, planners, policy makers and the general public...|$|E

40|$|Low-load {{repetitive}} work (LLRW) and mental load are important {{risk factors for}} the development of workrelated muscle pain. The link between these risk factors and the development of pain is still not understood, but stimulation of chemo-sensitive receptors in the muscle probably plays an important role. It has been suggested that sensitising substances may accumulate in the muscle during LLRW, especially when combined with mental load. The overall purpose of this thesis was to try to shed some light on the effects of LLRW on the concentration of sensitising substances (glutamate, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), norepinephrine (NE)) and on metabolism (lactate, pyruvate and oxygenation) in the trapezius muscle of healthy controls (CON) and subjects with trapezius myalgia (TM). A first step was to investigate whether females with TM exhibit higher absolute concentrations of glutamate and PGE 2 in the affected muscle during rest. Using Microdialysis (MD) females with TM and asymptomatic controls were studied during four hours of rest. [Glutamate] and [PGE 2] during rest did not differ between groups. A second step was to investigate, in a simulated occupational setting, the effects of LLRW on the concentration of sensitising substances and metabolism in the trapezius muscle of TM and CON, and whether increased work duration resulted in a progressive effect. Asymptomatic females were studied during baseline rest, 30 versus 60 min work and recovery, using MD and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Subjects with TM were studied during baseline rest, 30 min work and recovery. [Glutamate] and [lactate] increased in response to work, but not progressively with increased work duration. [Glutamate] was at all time points significantly lower in TM. [PGE 2]and oxygenation remained unchanged during work for CON, while for TM oxygenation decreased significantly during work. In TM [pyruvate] increased during both work and recovery, and a significant interaction between groups was found for [pyruvate] during recovery; while moderately increased in CON it increased progressively in TM. The effects of LLRW with and without <b>superimposed</b> mental <b>load</b> on intramuscular [NE], muscle activity and oxygen saturation in the trapezius were also investigated and compared. Using MD, electromyography and NIRS, healthy females were studied on two occasions; during 30 min LLRW and during 30 min LLRW with <b>superimposed</b> mental <b>load.</b> During work [NE], and muscle activity, were increased, while oxygenation decreased, but no differences between occasions. However, recovery of [NE] to baseline was slower after LLRW with <b>superimposed</b> mental <b>load.</b> The findings of the present thesis suggest: (i) no inflammation, or increased interstitial [glutamate] in TM; (ii) LLRW causes an increased anaerobic metabolism in both TM and CON; (iii) no effect of work duration was found; (iv) {{a significant difference in the}} effects of LLRW on the interstitial milieu of the trapezius muscle in TM as compared to CON; (v) LLRW causes a significant increase in [NE], but <b>superimposed</b> mental <b>load</b> does not cause a further increase; (vi) LLRW with a <b>superimposed</b> mental <b>load</b> may result in a slower recovery to baseline [NE] as compared with LLRW alone...|$|R

Before an unqualified. recommendation of the triaxial compression test as a method for determining the shearing. strength of soil can be made, further investigation will be necessary. However, the method of approach has been proved to be satisfactory and the present investigation indicates that the triaxial compression test can be used to evaluate the shearing resistance of some soils...|$|R
40|$|Structures are {{assemblies}} of {{load carrying}} members capable of safely transferring the <b>superimposed</b> <b>loads</b> to the foundations. Their main and most looked after property is {{the strength of the}} material that they are made of. Concrete, as we all know, is an integral material used for construction purposes. Thus, strength of concrete used, is required to be ‘known’ before starting with any kind of analysis. In the recent past, various methods and techniques, called as Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques, are being used for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). The concept of nondestructive testing (NDT) is to obtain material properties of in place specimens without the destruction of the specimen nor the structure from which it is taken. However, one problem that has been prevalent within the concrete industry for years is that the true properties of an in-place specimen have never been tested without leaving a certain degree of damage on the structure. For most cast-in-place concrete structures, construction specifications require that test cylinders be cast for 28 -day strength determination. Usually, representative test specimens are cast from the same concrete mix as the larger structural elements. Unfortunately, test specimens are not an exact representation of in-situ concrete, and may be affected by variations in specimen type, size, and curing procedures...|$|R
40|$|In the {{analysis}} of a continuous prestressed concrete bridge, Dead Load (selfweight of bridge), <b>Superimposed</b> Dead <b>Load</b> (Surfacing and Parapet) and Live Load (HA, HB or combined) are considered as major loadings for bridge structure. However, {{there are other factors}} that should be considered in {{the analysis}} such as Parasitic Moment. The effect from parasitic moment can contribute a significant value in designing a continuous prestressed concrete bridge. This study focuses on the effect of parasitic moment for a three spans continuous prestressed concrete bridge. An analysis of a continuous bridge using Staad Pro software is carried out to determine the parasitic moments of the bridge. The parasitic moments obtained from Staad Pro are slightly higher compared to the parasitic moments from Adapt software with a difference less than 10 percent. The parasitic moment is sagging throughout the whole bridge and the maximum moment is at the second span. A positive value of the parasitic moment will increase the value of the sagging moment at the mid span but will reduce the hogging moment at the support. For the case when parasitic moment effect is considered, the stress at bottom of beam is lower than the stress at top of beam. Whereas, the situation is reverse for the case when parasitic moment effect is not considered. If the same dead <b>load,</b> <b>superimposed</b> dead <b>load</b> and live load proportions are to be considered, the resultant stress at bottom of the beam will exceed the tensile stress limit when the parasitic moment proportion is more than 55 % of the total moment. Hence, the parasitic moment effect should be considered in the design of a continuous prestressed concrete bridge {{especially when it comes to}} the value of moment at the mid span of the bridge...|$|R
40|$|The loading {{conditions}} {{at the tip of}} a notch or a crack in impacted Izod specimens are investigated by means of the shadow optical method of caustics. For the early time range an asymmetric stress field is observed, resulting in a mixed mode-I/mode-II loading condition at the notch tip, only later on, practically undisturbed tensile conditions of loading prevail. Time limits are established from which on mode-II influences can be ignored, furthermore, the influence of the <b>superimposed</b> mode-II <b>loading</b> effects {{at the beginning of the}} impact event are quantified...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of superimposed total strain controlled HCF loadings on TMF life is presented and discussed for several cast Al-Si alloys, the Ni-base superalloy Inconel 617 and the cast iron GJS- 700. Except for GJS- 700, a {{threshold of the}} <b>superimposed</b> HCF <b>loading</b> is observed, below of which TMF life is not significantly affected. The strong decrease of TMF life {{as soon as the}} HCF amplitude exceeds this threshold is due to fundamental changes in the crack propagation mechanisms. The paper closes with a brief overview on lifetime prediction methods for TMF and their application in the case of TMF/HCF loadings...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} formulas for {{the increase}} of creep due to <b>superimposing</b> a cyclic <b>load</b> upon a static load are derived and verified by six different data sets. Cyclic load effects upon both basic creep and drying creep are analyzed. The nonlinear dependence of uniaxial static (non-cyclic) creep upon stress is also quantified. The creep increase due to <b>superimposed</b> cyclic <b>load</b> is understood as the increase beyond the static creep that corresponds to the mean stress rather than the maximum stress. This appears to make the previously uncorrelated measurements of cyclic basic and drying creeps mutually consistent. It is found that load cycling accelerates only the basic creep but not " the additional creep due to simultaneous drying. Since cyclic creep is necessarily a nonlinear phenomenon, a simple description of the nonlinear dependence of creep on stress is also given. Finally, the coefficients of variation of the deviations of formula predictions from the test data are evaluated (for all 80 data sets considered in this six-part study) and the average coefficients of variation to be expected in the predictions are indicated. They are overall much lower than those for the current formulations of CEB-FIP Model Code and ACI Committee 209...|$|R
