AIM To {{evaluate the}} clinical outcomes following non-surgical mechanical therapy of PI with adjunctive {{application of a}} diode laser after an observation period ≥ 2  years. MATERIAL AND METHODS At baseline (BL), 15 patients with 23 implants with a sandblasted and acid-etched (SLA) <b>surface</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with PI were enrolled and treated. PI was defined as presence of probing pocket depths (PPD) ≥ 5  mm with bleeding on probing (BoP) and/or suppuration and ≥ 2 threads with bone loss after delivery of the restoration. Implant sites were treated with carbon fiber and metal curettes followed by repeated application of a diode laser 3 x for 30  s (settings: 810  nm, 2. 5  W, 50  Hz, 10  ms). This procedure was performed at Day 0 (i. e., baseline), 7 and 14. Adjunctive antiseptics or adjunctive systemic antibiotics were not prescribed. RESULTS All implants were in function after 2  years.

40|$|Objectives: This {{clinical}} study aimed {{to evaluate the}} validity of using DIAGNOdent in diagnosing root caries, and to assess the sensitivity and specificity of different cut-off DIAGNOdent values in assessing root caries with reference to visual-tactile criteria. Methods: Exposed root surfaces were assessed by one examiner for root caries on 266 subjects using visual-tactile criteria and DIAGNOdent 2095 after dental scaling. Associations between DIAGNOdent values and visual-tactile diagnosis of root caries were determined. The cut-off level for statistical significance was 0. 05. The sensitivity and specificity of DIAGNOdent with difference cut-off points were analysed compared to visual-tactile diagnosis of root caries. Results: There was significant difference between DIAGNOdent values obtained from sound and carious root surfaces (p < 0. 001). On carious surfaces, active root caries obtained significantly higher DIAGNOdent values than inactive root caries (p < 0. 001). With increasing cut-off point DIAGNOdent values from 5 to 35, sensitivity decreased from 91. 4 % to 16. 2 % and specificity increased from 64. 4 % to 98. 2 %. A cut-off point of DIAGNOdent value between 5 and 10 produced the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: There {{was a significant difference}} in DIAGNOdent values between sound and carious root <b>surfaces</b> <b>diagnosed</b> by visual-tactile criteria supporting the validity of DIAGNOdent for assessing root caries. A DIAGNOdent value between 5 and 10 produced the highest combined sensitivity and specificity when visual-tactile assessment of root caries was regarded as the criterion.

Subjects and Methods: Seventy-seven patients with an image diagnosis of degenerative bone changes of the unilateral condylar surface accompanied with joint symptoms were studied. The bone changes were assessed by panoramic radiographs and classified into two groups: pathologic bone changes (PBC) including erosion, osteophyte and deformity, and adaptive bone changes (ABC) including flattening and concavity. Magnetic resonance imaging {{was performed on the}} subjective TM joints to examine the configuration and position of articular discs. A visual analogue scale was used for evaluation of joint pain. Results: Erosion and deformity showed significantly higher prevalence than the other three kinds of bone changes in the joints with anterior disc displacement without reduction (ADWoR) as compared to those with anterior disc displacement with reduction (ADWR). The cases with the vertical disc position to the condyle ranging from 60 ° to less than 150 ° were more frequent than those ranging from 0 ° to less than 60 ° in the PBC group, whereas the cases with the vertical disc position to the condyle ranging from 0 ° to less than 60 ° were more frequent than those ranging from 60 ° to less than 150 ° in the ABC group. The average degree of joint pain when chewing but not jaw opening was higher in the joints with ADWoR than in those with ADWR, and in the PBC group than in the ABC group.

Materials and Methods: A total of 212 schoolchildren were selected through multistage cluster random sampling method. A pretested self-administered pro forma was used to record demographic data, medical history, and dietary habits. The clinical examination was done to evaluate dental erosion of children using dental erosion index by O'Sullivan. Descriptive analytical tests were used including distribution of erosion, its extent and severity. The findings were compared across the study participants using Chi-square test. Results: The overall prevalence of dental erosion was 34. 12 % with no significant sex difference. Dental erosion was significantly related to the frequency of consumption of fruit juices (67. 07 %) followed by carbonated drinks (64. 47 %).

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic accuracy of a software program that automatically analyzes the liver <b>surface</b> to <b>diagnose</b> significant fibrosis, by comparing it to the subjective analysis of a radiologist and to transient elastography (Fibroscan®). Patients and methodsOne hundred fourteen patients with chronic liver disease were included in the study. They underwent liver biopsy, FibroScan® and ultrasonographic examination of the liver surface. The liver surface was analyzed by a software program that gave a score of surface irregularities. This evaluation was compared to subjective analysis by a radiologist expert in liver imaging and by two general radiologists. ResultsFifty percent of the patients had significant fibrosis according to the METAVIR score. The AUROC for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis by the software program was 0. 80 (95 %CI: 0. 71 – 0. 87), which was equivalent (P= 0. 86) to that of FibroScan® (0. 81; 95 %CI: 0. 71 – 0. 89). Results of the subjective analysis by the expert radiologist were poorer than those of the software analysis (P= 0. 02) (AUROC= 0. 66; 95 %CI: 0. 56 – 0. 75). Interobserver agreement among radiologists was poor (0. 25 <kappa< 0. 37).

One is dental erosion {{defined as the}} progressive loss of hard dental tissues by a chemical process not involving bacterial action. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of dental erosion and its risk factors in 12 -year-old school children. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 483 12 -year-old school children in Mashhad, 2007. Dental erosion was recorded for the labial and palatal surfaces of the upper incisors. For measurement purposes, the O'sullivan's index was adopted, and the results were statistically analyzed by T-student and Chi-Square tests. Results: The prevalence of dental erosion was 38. 1 %, with no significant sex difference. Dental erosion was significantly higher in private school children (P< 0. 001) and in underprivileged areas (P= 0. 005). Matt appearance of the enamel was the most prevalent type of dental erosion (21. 2 % central incisors, 5. 2 % lateral incisors). In most of the involved cases, more than half of their <b>surfaces</b> were <b>diagnosed</b> as affected by erosion (24. 4 % central incisors, 5. 2 % lateral incisors).

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that the influence of midlatitude SST fronts extends through the marine atmo-spheric boundary layer (MABL) into the free atmosphere, with implications for climate variability. To better understand the mechanisms of this ocean-to-atmosphere influence, SST-induced MABL convergence is explored here with the Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale model in an idealized, dry, two-dimensional configuration, for winds crossing from cold to warm SST and from warm to cold SST. For strong cross-front winds, O(10 m s 21), changes in the turbulent mixing and MABL depth across the SST front lead to MABL depth-integrated convergence in the cold-to-warm case and depth-integrated divergence in the warm-to-cold case. The turbulent stress divergence term changes over a shorter length scale than the pressure gradient and Coriolis terms, such that the MABL response directly above the SST front is governed by nonrotating, internal boundary layer–like physics, which {{are consistent with the}} ver-tical mixing mechanism. An important consequence is that the increment in the cross-front <b>surface</b> stress <b>diagnoses</b> the vertical motion {{at the top of the}} MABL. These physics are at variance with some previously proposed SST frontal MABL models in which pressure adjustments determine the MABL convergence. The SST-induced MABL convergence results in vertical motion that excites a stationary internal gravity wave in the free atmosphere, analogous to a mountain wave. For a 15 m s 21 cross-front wind, the gravity wave forced by an SST increase of 38 C over 200 km is comparable to that forced by an 80 -m change in topography. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the latest version of the MODIS LAI/FPAR product (MOD 15 A 2 H), namely Collection 6 (C 6). We {{comprehensively}} evaluate this product through three approaches: validation with field measurements, intercomparison with other LAI/FPAR products and comparison with climate variables. Comparisons between ground measurements and C 6, as well as C 5 LAI/FPAR indicate: (1) MODIS LAI is closer to true LAI than effective LAI; (2) the C 6 product is considerably better than C 5 with RMSE decreasing from 0. 80 down to 0. 66; (3) both C 5 and C 6 products overestimate FPAR over sparsely-vegetated areas. Intercomparisons with three existing global LAI/FPAR products (GLASS, CYCLOPES and GEOV 1) are carried out at site, continental and global scales. MODIS and GLASS (CYCLOPES and GEOV 1) agree better with each other. This is expected because the surface reflectances, from which these products were derived, were obtained from the same instrument. Considering all biome types, the RMSE of LAI (FPAR) derived from any two products ranges between 0. 36 (0. 05) and 0. 56 (0. 09). Temporal comparisons over seven sites for the 2001 – 2004 period indicate that all products properly capture the seasonality in different biomes, except evergreen broadleaf forests, where infrequent observations due to cloud contamination induce unrealistic variations. Thirteen years of C 6 LAI, temperature and precipitation time series data are used to assess the degree of correspondence between their variations. The statistically-significant associations between C 6 LAI and climate variables indicate that C 6 LAI has the potential to provide reliable biophysical information about the land <b>surface</b> when <b>diagnosing</b> climate-driven vegetation responses...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{podzolization}} {{involves the}} migration of metal-humus complexes {{to a depth of}} a few centimetres. In acid soils derived from loess, this process has been diagnosed mainly by morphological observation. We investigated this process in a toposequence of Luvisols and Cambisols on loess using selective extraction and mineralogical data as well as characteristics of the leaf litter. The humus type (O and OAh horizons) is a moder in the three Luvisols and one of the Cambisols, whereas it is a fibrimor in the two other Cambisols. The contents in total alkaline and alkaline-earth cations range from 35 to 60 cmol(c) kg(- 1) in the fibrimor and from 40 to 90 cmol(c) kg(- 1) in the moder humus. In the two Cambisols with fibrimor smectite occurs in the clay fraction of the Ah horizon; Fe-humus complexes seem to have moved, but no more than 9 cm, from the Ah to the AB horizon beneath. Relative to the Ah horizon, {{the upper part of the}} AB has larger tetraborate-extractable Fe/Al ratio and optical density of the oxalate extract. Such features converge to <b>diagnose</b> <b>surface</b> podzolization in the Cambisols with fibrimor. However, they were not detected in the Cambisol and Luvisols with moder. In the two Cambisols with fibrimor, surface podzolization is consistent with (i) their smaller iron content, (ii) their more advanced weathering stage and (iii) their lower acid neutralizing capacity...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{undertook}} a retrospective {{evaluation of the}} effect of sealants on the caries experience of initially sound and incipient permanent first molar pit and fissure surfaces. Methods : Records of children with complete five-year records were obtained from a school-based dental sealant program in a fluoridated community. Sealants were placed on 677 tooth surfaces in 96 children; 120 tooth surfaces in 17 children who received baseline examinations were not sealed because of lack of caregiver consent. Tooth <b>surfaces</b> were initially <b>diagnosed</b> as being sound or having incipient lesions, and evaluated for caries status after five years. Results : For initially incipient surfaces the five-year decay rate was 10. 8 percent (41 of 380 surfaces) for sealed surfaces and 51. 8 percent (29 of 56 surfaces) for nonsealed surfaces with an odds ratio of 8. 88 (95 % Cl= 4. 56, 17. 35). Initially sound surfaces had a decay rate of 8. 1 percent (24 of 297 surfaces) for sealed surfaces and 12. 5 percent (8 of 64 surfaces) for nonsealed surfaces with an odds ratio of 1. 63 (95 % Cl= 0. 63, 4. 08). The two odds ratios were significantly different. Conclusions : Initially sound tooth surfaces were unlikely to become decayed in five years, and did not benefit greatly from the application of sealants. Within the limitations of this study, there were clear efficiencies in sealing incipient, but not sound, surfaces. The targeting of teeth with incipient caries for sealants is therefore recommended...|$|R
40|$|Land {{surface water}} (LSW) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} resources for human survival and development, and it is also a main component of global water recycling. A full understanding of the spatial distribution of land surface water and a continuous measuring of its dynamics can support to diagnose the global ecosystem and environment. Based on the Global Land 30 -water 2000 and Global Land 30 -water 2010 products, this research analyzed the spatial distribution pattern and temporal fluctuation of land surface water under scale-levels of global, latitude and longitude, continents, and climate zones. The Global Land 30 -water products were corrected the temporal inconsistency of original remotely sensed data using MODIS time-series data, and then calculated the indices such as water area, water ration and coefficient of spatial variation for further analysis. Results show that total water area of land surface is about 3. 68 million km(2) (2010), and occupies 2. 73 % of land area. The spatial distribution of land surface water is extremely uneven and is gathered mainly in mid- to high-latitude area of the Northern Hemisphere and tropic area. The comparison of water ratio between 2000 and 2010 indicates the overall fluctuation is small but spatially differentiated. The Global Land 30 -water products and the statistics provided the fundamental information for analyzing the spatial distribution pattern and temporal fluctuation of land <b>surface</b> water and <b>diagnosing</b> the global ecosystem and environment...|$|R

In addition to the temperature charts of targets, rhythmic analysis charts were developed as proposed by Monteiro (1971) to analyse the weather characteristics {{in the days before}} the taking of images. The results showed that the differences in surface temperatures between rural and urban were high in the rainy season. In the dry season, with the dominance of bare soil, the radiative properties of the surfaces were similar, homogenizing temperatures between rural and urban. Este artigo tem como objetivo comparar as intensidades das ilhas de calor superficiais diagnosticadas a partir de imagens termais (banda 10) do satélite Landsat 8, em Presidente Prudente, cidade de porte médio localizada no ambiente tropical, em período seco e chuvoso. Além das cartas de temperatura dos alvos foram elaborados gráficos de análise rítmica, segundo a proposta de Monteiro (1971) para se analisar as características do tempo nos dias que antecederam as tomadas das imagens. Os resultados mostraram que as diferenças das temperaturas superficiais entre o rural e o urbano foram elevadas na estação chuvosa.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{commonly}} utilised methods of <b>diagnosing</b> <b>surface</b> wave plasmas in recent years has involved the measurement of the electric fields surrounding the plasma column. However, such work has almost exclusively been confined to plasmas with generating frequencies typically greater than 200 MHz. The research reported in this thesis represents the first systematic diagnostic investigation of low frequency surface wave plasmas. Three distinct diagnostic methods are employed which have been developed specifically to facilitate the diagnosis of low frequency surface wave plasmas. Each diagnostic technique is comprised of a two-stage process. The first stage involves the measurement of the electric fields surrounding the plasma, from which point determinations of the surface wave wave number are obtained. In the second stage, an axial plasma density gradient is inferred from the wave number values using a theoretical surface wave model. The thesis begins with a general introduction to the characteristics of surface wave plasmas and details the principle research objectives in the present investigation. Previous work in related areas is reviewed and its relevance to the present study highlighted. The equipment employed for the experimental part of the research programme is discussed in detail. The theoretical surface wave model is then developed which serves to interpret the experimental measurements. The design of the Axial and FRD diagnostic techniques is described together with their application for diagnosing the low frequency surface wave plasmas. A new diagnostic tool; the parasitic test-wave technique; has been developed and the results from which serve to validate the data from the Axial and FRD techniques. The thesis concludes with a summary of what has gone before and suggests topics for future research...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a tool to}} determine surface fluxes from atmospheric concentration data {{in the midst of}} distributed sources or sinks over land, the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model, and illustrate the use of the tool with CO 2 data over North America. Anthropogenic and biogenic emissions of trace gases at the surface cause large variations of atmospheric concentrations in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) from the "near field," where upstream sources and sinks have strong influence on observations. Transport in the near field often takes place on scales not resolved by typical grid sizes in transport models. STILT provides the capability to represent near-field influences, transforming this noise to signal useful in <b>diagnosing</b> <b>surface</b> emissions. The model simulates transport by following the time evolution of a particle ensemble, interpolating meteorological fields to the subgrid scale location of each particle. Turbulent motions are represented by a Markov chain process. Significant computational savings are realized because the influence of upstream emissions at different times is modeled using a single particle simulation backward in time, starting at the receptor and sampling only the portion of the domain that influences the observations. We assess in detail the physical and numerical requirements of STILT and other particle models necessary to avoid inconsistencies and to preserve time symmetry (reversibility). We show that source regions derived from backward and forward time simulations in STILT are similar, and we show that deviations may be attributed to violation of mass conservation in currently available analyzed meterological fields. Using concepts from information theory, we show that the particle approach can provide significant gains in information compared to conventional gridcell models, principally during the first hours of transport backward in time, when PBL observations are strongly affected by surface sources and sinks...|$|R
40|$|Aerosols {{affect the}} Earth energy budget {{directly}} by scattering and absorbing radiation and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. However, large uncertainties exist in current estimates of aerosol forcing. In this presentation, {{the impact of}} aerosol on solar and Infra-Red fluxes and the heating rate due to dust over West Africa are investigated using the radiative code STREAMER, as well as satellite observations, space-borne and dropsondes observations gathered during the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis Special Observing Period. Aircraft operations were conducted on 13 and 14 June 2006, over Benin and Niger, {{before and after the}} passage of a mesoscale convective system (MCS). On these days the dust observed over Benin and Niger originated from the Bodélé depression and from West Sudan. In this study, are used aerosol extinction coefficient derived from lidar observations, temperature, pressure, water vapour profiles derived from dropsondes and clouds properties. The <b>surface</b> albedo is <b>diagnosed</b> from MODIS observations. A serie of retrieval is carried out on between 9 and 15 June 2006 to investigate the dust radiative forcing as a function of latitude, from 6 °N to 15 °N, i. e. between the vegetated coast of the Guinea Gulf and the arid Sahel. The retrievals are made both in terrestrial and in solar spectrum and show a maximum heating rate associated with the dust plume on these days was between 1. 5 K/day and 3 K/day, depending on the latitude and the concentration of dust. The maximum heating rate is observed to the North, where a deep plume of dust is detected. This maximum is diagnosed around 3 km where the concentration of dust is significant. Sensitivity studies to surface albedo, aerosol backscatter-to-extinction ratio, temperature, water vapor mixing ratio profiles and cloud properties are also conducted...|$|R
