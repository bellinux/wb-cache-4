25|$|Big-game {{fishing is}} fishing from boats to catch large open-water {{species such as}} tuna, sharks, and marlin. Sport fishing (sometimes game fishing) is {{recreational}} fishing where the primary reward is the challenge of finding and catching the fish rather than the culinary or financial value of the fish's flesh. Fish sought after include marlin, tuna, tarpon, sailfish, <b>shark,</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and many others.|$|E

50|$|Examples of {{ovoviviparous}} {{fish are}} many of the squaliform sharks, which include sand <b>sharks,</b> <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks,</b> nurse sharks, requiem sharks, dog sharks and hammerheads, among others, and the lobe finned coelacanth. Some species of rockfish (Sebastes) and sculpins (Comephoridae) produce rather weak larvae with no egg membrane and are also, by definition, ovoviviparous. Ovoviviparity occurs in most live-bearing bony fishes (Poeciliidae).|$|R
50|$|Sand sharks, {{also known}} as sand tiger sharks, grey nurse sharks or ragged tooth <b>sharks,</b> are <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> of the family Odontaspididae. They are found {{worldwide}} in temperate and tropical waters. The three species are in two genera.|$|R

50|$|In 1964 the {{aquarium}} began to feature six gill sharks. The sharks {{were taken from}} the Puget Sound at 500 feet deep, and were hooked with a long line. The line was tied to a buoy and dressed with ham, raw beef, and lingcod. After the sharks were captured, they lost their appetite and motivation. Griffin entered the tank in a wetsuit to force-feed the <b>sharks</b> <b>mackerel</b> and to push them around. The sharks did not last long, but the presence of the sharks significantly increased aquarium attendance.|$|R

50|$|Drifting FADs are {{widespread}} in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian ocean purse seine fisheries. They catch over 1 million tons of tuna (nearly one-third of the global tuna total) and over 100,000 tons of by-catch {{in the vicinity of}} FADs as of 2005. Skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis, Bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus and yellowfin Thunnus albacares tuna are the three primary tropical tuna species that FADs target. Other fish include albacore, dolphin fish, wahoo, blue marlin, striped marlin, mako shark, silky shark, whitetip shark, galapagos <b>shark,</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and bonito.|$|E
40|$|Dorsal muscle {{phosphatidylcholine}} (PC) {{molecular species}} of sardine, mackerel, big-eyed tuna, brown sole, sand flounder, rock fish, Alaska pollack, chum salmon, blue <b>shark,</b> <b>mackerel</b> shark, carp and rainbow trout were analyzed on HPLC. Flat fish such as brown sole and sand flounder were extremely characteristic, since these fish contained (16 : 0) (20 : 5) {{as the most}} prominent molecular species {{unlike the rest of}} the fish that had (16 : 0) (22 : 6) as the most prominant molecular species. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the PC molecular species suggested that except for sardine dark muscle, chum salmon (feeding migration stage) and rainbow trout, a common correspondant movement against seasonal change in the content of (20 : 5) (20 : 5) was observed in the majority of these fishes...|$|E

50|$|<b>Mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{an order}} which {{includes}} {{some of the}} most familiar species of sharks, such as the great white shark, as well as more unusual representatives, such as the goblin shark and the megamouth shark. Members of the order are distinguished by possessing two dorsal fins, an anal fin, five gill slits, eyes without nictitating membranes, and a mouth extending behind the eyes. <b>Mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> may also refer specifically to the family Lamnidae.|$|R
50|$|Based on {{cytochrome}} b genes, Martin and Naylor (1997) {{concluded the}} thresher sharks form a monophyletic sister {{group to the}} clade containing the families Cetorhinidae (basking <b>shark)</b> and Lamnidae (<b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks).</b> The megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios) was placed as the next-closest relative to these taxa, though the phylogenetic position of that species {{has yet to be}} resolved with confidence. Cladistic analyses by Compagno (1991) based on morphological characters, and Shimada (2005) based on dentition, have both corroborated this interpretation.|$|R
50|$|Cladoselache {{exhibited}} {{a combination of}} derived and ancestral characteristics. It had anatomical features similar to the current <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> of the family Lamnidae.|$|R
50|$|After being shuffled {{between the}} genera Carcharias and Odontaspis {{in the family}} Odontaspididae by various authors, in 1973 Leonard Compagno resurrected Jean Cadenat's 1963 {{subgenus}} Pseudocarcharias from synonymy for this species and placed it within its own family. The morphology of the crocodile shark suggests affinity with the megamouth shark (Megachasmidae), basking shark (Cetorhinidae), thresher <b>sharks</b> (Alopiidae), and <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> (Lamnidae). More recent phylogenetic analyses, based on mitochondrial DNA, {{have suggested that the}} crocodile shark is closely related to either the megamouth shark or the sand sharks (Odontaspididae). Alternately, analysis based on dentition suggests that the closest relatives of the crocodile shark are the thresher sharks, followed by the <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks.</b> Fossil Pseudocarcharias teeth dating to the Serravallian age (13.6 - 11.6 Ma) of the Miocene epoch have been found in Italy, and are identical to those of the modern-day crocodile shark.|$|R

50|$|The {{crocodile}} shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai) is {{a species of}} <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> and the only extant {{member of the family}} Pseudocarchariidae. A specialized inhabitant of the mesopelagic zone, the {{crocodile shark}} can be found worldwide in tropical waters from the surface to a depth of 590 m. It performs a diel vertical migration, staying below a depth of 200 m during the day and ascending into shallower water at night to feed. Typically measuring only 1 m in length, the crocodile shark is the smallest living <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark.</b> It can be distinguished by its elongated cigar-shaped body, extremely large eyes, and relatively small fins.|$|R

50|$|Diagnosis Mercury: Money, Politics and Poison is a 2008 book by Jane Hightower. The book {{explains}} that mercury is a poison {{and that the}} majority of mercury in the environment comes from coal-fired power plants. But the book is mainly concerned with human exposure from the eating of large predatory fish such as swordfish, <b>shark,</b> king <b>mackerel,</b> large tuna, etc. The book also discusses industrial mercury poisonings, such as those in Minamata, Japan, in the 1950s and Ontario, Canada, in the 1970s.|$|R

In fishing villages, it {{is made from}} local fishes, for example sardines, <b>shark,</b> bonito, <b>mackerel,</b> etc. In most cases it is made by mixing two or more kinds of fish.|$|R
5|$|Top/bottom countershading {{is common}} in fish {{including}} <b>sharks,</b> marlin, and <b>mackerel,</b> and animals in other groups such as dolphins, turtles and penguins.
