500|$|Lamont {{gave her}} first conference speech as party leader at Scottish Labour's conference in March 2012, setting out {{an agenda for}} {{rebuilding}} confidence in the party. Later the same month she welcomed {{the passing of the}} Scotland Bill, which devolved further powers to Scotland in accordance with the recommendations of the Calman Commission, praising it as [...] "an important development of devolution". In May 2012 she participated in the Scottish Parliament debate paying tribute to Queen Elizabeth as the UK celebrated her Diamond Jubilee. Lamont commented, [...] "60 years in the one job is good going– I've been in this one for just six months and <b>some</b> <b>days,</b> <b>I</b> have to say, it feels like 60 years– so we recognise the scale of the achievement of the particular, very strong woman." [...] Lamont was a guest on the 7 June 2012 edition of the BBC's political debate programme Question Time.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] {{incorporated}} {{the use of}} the Electronic LinnDrum machine, {{and was one of the}} first songs to effectively use the sound reverbs of the instrument. LinnDrum had been used sparingly in their previous single [...] "Do Your Dance", but in [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] its use was more spontaneous, which Dave Thompson, author of Funk noted as if [...] "it virtually duetted with Dickey, creating one of the most distinctive records of the year—and one of the most imitated of the age." [...] The song was mainly recorded at music contractor Gene Bianco's house, where Rose Royce lead singer Gwen Dickey was present during the recording. Buckmaster recalled: [...] "I was over at [...] place almost every day with Norman, and <b>some</b> <b>days</b> <b>I</b> stayed away to write, or to mix the music. Gene had given me the keys to his apartment, and also let me use the piano to record the song. I didn't want to work on at Miles' because his piano was falling to bits." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{explained}} that Naomi's style was {{harder to get}} right and she worked with the producers, costume and make-up departments {{to find the right}} look. The actress said, [...] "she has {{to have a sense of}} sass and sexuality about her, but she's not cheap and she has worked very hard to shake off her trashy past. What we've come up with is amazing. <b>Some</b> <b>days</b> <b>I</b> put my costume on for a scene and think, 'Oh Naomi, you're outrageous! I could never wear this! Oh well. Go get 'em girl!'" [...] O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her [...] "quite sexual" [...] nature, especially the six-inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be [...] "goofy and funny". She thought Naomi was definitely not as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself. Executive producer Jason Herbison told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Naomi's type of character – a [...] "classic, troublemaking vixen, who underneath it all is just deeply insecure" [...] – had been missing from Neighbours for a few years.|$|E

2500|$|Gallagher briefly {{touched on}} the topic of {{religious}} belief with the statement, [...] "I live for now, not for what happens after I die. If I die and there's something afterwards, I'm going to hell, not heaven. I mean, the devil's got all the good gear. What's God got? The Inspiral Carpets and nuns. Fuck that." [...] However Liam has confessed to going to church, but he claims to not [...] "be looking for guidance". He stated that [...] "some days I don't believe and <b>some</b> <b>days</b> <b>I</b> do believe". Liam claims to have had [...] "a conversation with God one night in a boozer".|$|E
2500|$|Bjelland {{was married}} and {{divorced}} twice and had a son, Henry (born 1999), with her second husband. In 2007 Bjelland had a schizophrenic episode and had received treatment. Bjelland commented on the event, saying: “I don’t know how I’ve progressed musically as such but a major influence in my writing was dealing with my whole schizophrenia episode. I actually haven’t spoken to anyone much about this. Dealing with multiple personalities was extremely difficult because <b>some</b> <b>days</b> <b>I</b> didn't know who I was or where I was at. I was very lucky that Adrian stuck by and helped me through it all. So obviously {{that was going to}} affect some of what I wrote about." [...] She was later told she has a schizoaffective disorder.|$|E

6000|$|... "You can't {{imagine how}} {{impatient}} I am {{to meet my}} father and sister," [...] he said. [...] "Why, <b>some</b> <b>days</b> <b>I</b> get so I can hardly fasten my mind on my studies, and I go in for fun just to help me forget what is on my mind." ...|$|E

60|$|For <b>some</b> <b>days</b> <b>I</b> {{could not}} get over the feeling of having a number of {{deformed}} and grotesque figures lingering about me. The Bright Powers are always beautiful and desirable, and the Dim Powers are now beautiful, now quaintly grotesque, but the Dark Powers express their unbalanced natures in shapes of ugliness and horror.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, I {{instituted a}} {{rigorous}} private {{search for the}} corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his party. The result was that, after <b>some</b> <b>days,</b> <b>I</b> came across an old dry well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the bottom, I discovered what I sought.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, no!" [...] Kate was {{too proud}} of her letter to give it up, and applied herself to it again.--"'Family honours, until I could {{ascertain}} your present address.
