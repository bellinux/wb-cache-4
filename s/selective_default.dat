50|$|Subsequently, though Argentina {{wanted to}} repay some creditors, the {{judgment}} prevented Argentina from doing so, because {{being forced to}} repay all creditors, including the holdouts, would have totaled around $100 billion. The country was therefore categorized as being in <b>selective</b> <b>default</b> by Standard & Poor's and in restricted default by Fitch. The ruling affected New York law Argentine bonds; Argentine bonds issued under Buenos Aires and European law were not affected.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. {{judicial}} {{pari passu}} ruling therefore forced Argentina {{to miss the}} scheduled bond payments being managed from New York, as from July 30, 2014 (bonds issued under Argentine law (paid through Citibank Argentina) and bonds issued under European Law (paid through Euroclear and Clearstream), were not affected.). This in turn caused Argentina to be declared in <b>selective</b> <b>default</b> by Standard & Poor's and in restricted default by Fitch, meaning that some Argentine bondholders were receiving payment while others now weren't.|$|E

40|$|Sovereigns tend to {{selectively}} {{default on}} types of debt that {{are easier to}} restructure than others. We show, within a simple model of sovereign debt with a willingness-to-pay problem and lack of exclusivity, how competition for protection against <b>selective</b> <b>defaults</b> {{may result in a}} sovereign debt that is excessively di ¢ cult to restructure in equilibrium. A bankruptcy regime for sovereigns may alleviate this ine ¢ ciency, but only if it is endowed with far-reaching powers analogous to corporate bankruptcy regimes, in particular the enforcement of seniority and subordination clauses in debt contracts. A bankrupcty regime that makes sovereign debt easier to re-structure without enforcing seniority may decrease global welfare...|$|R
40|$|Europe’s {{efforts to}} {{stabilize}} its finances are failing, {{and the region}} needs to prepare for widespread restructuring of sovereign and bank debt. Peter Boone and Simon Johnson argue that Europe’s financial system has relied on a policy of protecting creditors from default and has thus spread pervasive moral hazard—a presumption by creditors {{that they will not}} take losses on their loans to Greece and other ailing countries. The authors argue that this situation is no longer tenable and examine three possible scenarios for the coming months as the sovereign debt crisis evolves. Under the first scenario, the euro area would try to reassert its commitment to avoid defaults and inflation. This continuation of the moral hazard regime would require severe austerity for Greece and other countries {{on the periphery of the}} euro area. The second scenario involves elimination of the moral hazard regime. The euro area would admit that some sovereigns have too much debt. A series of debt restructurings would follow. The final scenario would be for policymakers to continue to contradict themselves by promising <b>selective</b> <b>defaults</b> or restructurings of some countries’ debts while maintaining that they can ensure the stability of the rest of the euro area. But the authors argue that it is an illusion to believe that selective restructuring would not introduce contagion. Such an approach would result in panic, massive capital flight, and disorderly defaults. The ensuing chaos would in turn lead to a negatively charged political atmosphere that would make consensus nearly impossible. ...|$|R
40|$|The key concept {{underlying}} the Basel II framework for risk measurement and corresponding equity capital standards {{is that the}} existing regulations pertaining to credit risk will be individualised through reference to the internal ratings of banks. In accordance with the regulatory guidelines, Daniel Kaltofen, Stephan Paul and Stefan Stein develop an ‘optimised segmentation approach’ {{with regard to the}} credit default event and measure the implications for regulatory capital requirements. As regards methodology, they present an innovative technique and test it on a data set of approximately 413, 000 motor vehicle loans. By classifying loans according to <b>selective</b> predictors of <b>default,</b> the authors find that banks can achieve significant savings in terms of ensuring a lower regulatory capital requirement. This provides banks with the opportunity to increase lending capacity. The technique overcomes the disadvantages of the more familiar standard methods used in today’s bank risk management and delivers more robust results...|$|R
40|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>default</b> is {{an event}} in which a {{sovereign}} issuer chooses not to meet obligations on a class of bonds, while servicing her other debt. This paper presents unique empirical evidence of <b>selective</b> <b>default</b> risk premium in inflation-linked sovereign bond (ILB) yields of Germany, France and Italy. I identify this effect from the difference of breakeven rates from country pairs. Differencing controls for common components, such as the effect of inflation expectations, monetary policy or interest rate risk. I find that the remaining part in breakeven rates is explained by two systematic risk factors, liquidity and sovereign credit risks- both within and across countries. I link these findings to the ILB-nominal puzzle, which shows that ILBs are underpriced relative to nominal bonds of the same issuer. I show that this underpricing is {{in part due to}} relative risk premia differences between nominal and inflation-linked debt: ILBs are less liquid, moreover investors perceive them to have higher credit risk during the financial and euro crises. This implies an implicit seniority and a subsequent convenience yield in nominal bonds...|$|E
40|$|The Confederate States of America floated {{two small}} bond issues in Europe during the American Civil War; cotton bonds that traded {{primarily}} in England and junk bonds in Amsterdam. The Confederacy serviced the cotton bonds {{for the duration}} of the war and defaulted on the junk bond issue. Evidently the South believed that the cotton bonds provided a financial incentive for England to intervene or give military support. This policy of <b>selective</b> <b>default</b> suggests that reputation spillovers across markets may be smaller than indicated in theoretical models of debt repayment (Cole and Kehoe, 1994) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation {{consists of three}} chapters on the pricing of sovereign debt and inflation-linked products. The first chapter examines the relative pricing of nominal and inflation-linked debt of the three largest Eurozone sovereign issuers. Its main contribution is to present evidence of a <b>selective</b> <b>default</b> premium in real bond yields. The second chapter shifts its focus to the US inflation-linked product markets and quantifies liquidity premium in TIPS and inflation swap rates. The size of this compensation for exposure to asset level and liquidity risk helps to explain {{a large part of}} the TIPS-Treasury puzzle. The third chapter studies whether nominal bond markets are segmented across different maturities and contributes to the policy discussion on long term discount rates of the Solvency II Directive of the European Union...|$|E
40|$|The {{admission}} by the Greek {{government on}} October 18, 2009, of large-scale accounting fraud in its national accounts sparked an unprecedented sovereign debt crisis that rapidly {{spread to the}} Eurozone’s weakest member states. As the crisis increasingly drove a wedge between a seemingly resilient Eurozone core and its faltering periphery, its first collateral victims were the private banks of the hardest-hit sovereigns. They were rapidly followed {{by the rest of}} the Eurozone’s banks as a result of their large exposure to not only their home country’s sovereign debt, but also to the debt securities of other member states. Measuring each bank’s precise exposure to every sovereign issuer became a key issue for credit analysis in the attempt to assess the potential impact of a <b>selective</b> sovereign <b>default</b> if worse came to worst. Yet finding that information in a timely manner is hardly an easy task, as banks are not required to disclose it. Building on the efficient market hypothesis in the presence of informed traders, we tested the sensitivity of each of the largest Eurozone private banks’ CDSs to sovereign CDSs using a simple autoregressive model estimated by time-series regressions and panel regressions, comparing the results to news releases to assess its reliability. Eventually, we used the Oaxaca Blinder decomposition to measure whether the unconventional monetary policies, namely the LTRO and the OMT, that the ECB has implemented to stem the crisis have helped banks directly or whether banks were actually helped by the reduction in sovereign CDS spreads. ...|$|R
40|$|Shared {{memory has}} been widely adopted as the primary system level {{programming}} abstraction on modern multiprocessor systems due to its ease of programming. To assist programmers in understanding program behaviors with respect {{to read and write}} operations originating from multiple processors, many memory consistency models have been proposed. Sequential consistency (SC) memory model is the simplest and most intuitive model, but its strict memory ordering requirements can restrict many hardware and compiler optimizations that are possible in uniprocessors. For higher performance, many manufacturers typically choose to support relaxed consistency models. In these models, memory fence instructions are also provided to permit <b>selective</b> overriding of <b>default</b> relaxed memory access ordering, where strict ordering must be enforced for program correctness. However, memory fences are costly because they cause a processor to stall. Although the underlying memory models or memory fence instructions require a set of memory orderings to be enforced, they are not always necessary at runtime. If reordering of two memory operations executed on one processor is not observed by any other processor, then the reordering is safe as the program will behave the same as if they were not reordered. Thus we observe {{that it is possible to}} relax some of memory orderings that are in general required but are unnecessary in the current execution. The goal of this dissertation is to dynamically identify the necessary memory orderings and thus relax the rest of the required memory orderings. The challenge of achieving this goal is to efficiently identify the necessary memory orderings. This dissertation explores programming, compiler, and hardware support for eliminating unnecessary memory orderings to improve program performance. First, conflict ordering is proposed for implementing SC efficiently, where SC is enforced by explicitly ordering only conflicting memory operations in the global memory order, instead of all memory operations. The approach achieves SC performance comparable to RMO (relaxed memory ordering), without aggressive post-retirement speculation. Next, three approaches (i. e., scoped fence, conditional fence, and address-aware fence) are proposed to relax memory orderings imposed by memory fences, representing different levels of support from programmer, compiler and hardware. These approaches make memory fences lightweight to use...|$|R
40|$|Facilitation of {{emotional}} face recognition is an established phenomenon for audiovisual crossmodal stimulation, {{but not for}} other sensory modalities. The present study used a crossmodal priming task to identify brain systems controlling olfactory–visual interactions during emotion processing. BOLD fMRI was acquired for 44 healthy subjects during an emotional face discrimination task preceded by an emotionally valenced odorant. Behavioral performance showed that recognition of disgusted faces was improved by the presentation of an olfactory stimulus irrespective of its emotional valence. No such facilitation was seen for other facial expressions. The neuroimaging data showed a <b>selective</b> <b>default</b> network responsivity to emotional faces which was modulated by odor condition. Among disgust faces, hypoactivations during trials preceded by odorants indicated the presence of priming effects. Consistent with studies investigating the brain systems associated with audiovisual emotional integration, activity modulations in clusters in fusiform gyrus, middle frontal and middle cingulate gyrus corresponded to the observed behavioral facilitation. Our study further shows modulation of signal in the anterior insula during trials combining negatively valenced odor and disgusted faces, suggesting a modality-specific mechanism for integration of the disgust response and olfaction. These results indicate {{the presence of a}} central network with modality-specific and -unspecific components modulating emotional face recognition...|$|E
40|$|In July 2014, Argentina entered <b>selective</b> <b>default,</b> even as {{the country}} {{remained}} financially solvent. The default stemmed not from economic woes, but rather from protracted international litigation between Argentina {{and a group of}} hedge funds who, for years, refused to negotiate with Argentina over their bond holdings {{in the wake of the}} country’s first default in 2001. These holdouts stalled negotiations and locked Argentina out of international credit markets, damaging the country’s economy and financially harming other creditors and Argentinian citizens alike. Argentina ended up in such a dilemma because of the current sovereign debt restructuring process. No international arbitrator of sovereign debt currently exists. Instead, a country must negotiate with creditors on an ad-hoc basis, gathering support from 100 % of creditors before it can restructure its debt and reenter international credit markets, an extremely inefficient system. This paper will assess the current system of sovereign default renegotiations, identifying inefficiencies in the current system, reviewing past proposals for improvements to the system, and ultimately proposing an international arbitrator for default negotiations. This text uses the development of the US Federal Municipal Bankruptcy Act of 1934 as a guide for an international bankruptcy court. Prior to the passage of the law, municipalities faced many of the same challenges faced by defaulted nations today, including powerful holdouts and a lack of structure in the negotiation system. Given the similarities between the two cases, the Federal Municipal Bankruptcy Act serves as an ideal framework for sovereign default arbitration internationally...|$|E
