5|$|The {{growth or}} proliferative phase, {{during which the}} body {{produces}} cells and protein to heal the puncture and the edges contract around the piercing, forming a tunnel of <b>scar</b> <b>tissue</b> called a fistula. This phase may last weeks, months, or longer than a year.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for breast}} or skin cancer may cause <b>scar</b> <b>tissue</b> to form around the {{treatment}} area. In {{the case of}} breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may occur {{as a result of}} fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E

40|$|We aim {{to explore}} tissue {{heterogeneity}} assessment using T 1 maps generated with the modified Look Locker (MOLLI) sequence {{in patients with}} previous myocardial infarct. Conclusion: Differences between healthy myocardium and <b>scarred</b> <b>tissues</b> can be reliably distinguished from the R 1 values derived from pre-contrast T 1 maps. Potentially, patients without scarred myocardium do not need post-contrast imaging. Inpatients with <b>scarred</b> <b>tissues,</b> &# 916;R 1 value derived from both thepre- and the post-contrast T 1 maps provides better distinction between grey zone and scar core than either pre-contrast or post-contrast R 1 value alone...|$|R
30|$|Discussion: As {{no energy}} source {{is used for}} cutting or coagulation, no dead or <b>scarred</b> <b>tissue</b> is left behind. Thus there is better <b>tissue</b> healing, better <b>scar</b> {{integrity}} and less chances of scar dehiscence.|$|R
5|$|Four minor {{stages of}} OCD have been {{identified}} after trauma. These include revascularization and formation of granulation (<b>scar)</b> <b>tissue,</b> absorption of necrotic fragments, intertrabecular osteoid deposition, and remodeling of new bone. With delay in the revascularization stage, an OCD lesion develops. A lesion can lead to articular-surface irregularities, which in turn may cause progressive arthritic deterioration.|$|E
5|$|PID {{can cause}} {{scarring}} inside the reproductive system, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy (the {{leading cause of}} pregnancy-related deaths in adult females), and other complications of pregnancy. Occasionally, the infection can spread to in the peritoneum causing inflammation {{and the formation of}} <b>scar</b> <b>tissue</b> on the external surface of the liver (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).|$|E
5|$|The Racz {{procedure}} {{employs a}} wire-bound or spring loaded catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve <b>scar</b> <b>tissue,</b> also called epidural adhesions or fibroids, that have formed around the nerve roots, {{and allows for}} local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area. This procedure was assigned a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|Most of <b>Scar</b> <b>Tissue's</b> live {{performances}} were in California, although they toured the United States three times: once as a headliner with opening band Luxt, {{and twice as}} the opening band for 16 Volt.|$|R
30|$|After the {{incision}} of the bladder peritoneum and the dissection of the uterovesical fold, <b>scar</b> <b>tissues</b> were excised and the hysterotomy was closed in two layers. Postoperative course was uncomplicated and controls (ultrasound and hysterography) were satisfying.|$|R
30|$|Long-term {{complications}} {{are related}} to the injected filler itself and delayed host response. These complications include FBG, delayed manifestations of infection including abscess formation, migration of filler, disfiguring nodules and <b>scarring,</b> <b>tissue</b> necrosis and ulcer, and persistent discoloration [40, 66].|$|R
5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid scars can form <b>scar</b> <b>tissue</b> outside of these borders. Keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on {{the trunk of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|In many people, the {{infection}} waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis. Affected tissue {{is replaced by}} scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria, so can spread {{the infection}}. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by <b>scar</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|E
5|$|Candice {{made her}} {{on-screen}} {{return on the}} February 18, 2008 episode of Raw, distracting Beth Phoenix during a match with Maria. She returned to in-ring action on March 17, teaming up with Maria to defeat Jillian Hall and Victoria. During the match, Candice injured her left shoulder by tearing the <b>scar</b> <b>tissue</b> over her previously broken left clavicle. Unlike her previous injury, Candice broke her clavicle in four separate places, in essence, shattering it. As a result, Candice was replaced by Ashley for her scheduled match at WrestleMania XXIV. On March 23, Candice underwent successful surgery on her re-broken clavicle.|$|E
30|$|Most of {{cleft lip}} and palate {{patients}} have the esthetic and functional problems of midfacial deficiencies due to innate developmental tendency and <b>scar</b> <b>tissues</b> from repeated operations. In these cases, maxillary protraction {{is required for}} the harmonious facial esthetics and functional occlusion.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} barriers to the procedure is the inability of nerve tissue to heal properly; <b>scarred</b> nerve <b>tissue</b> does not transmit signals well (this is why a spinal cord injury is so devastating). Research at the Wistar Institute of the University of Pennsylvania involving tissue-regenerating mice (known as MRL mice) may provide pointers for further research as to how to regenerate nerves without scarring. It is possible that a completely clean cut will not generate <b>scarred</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thyromental {{distance}} (TMD) measurement is {{a method}} commonly used to predict the difficulty of intubation and is measured from the thyroid notch {{to the tip of}} the jaw with the head extended. If it is less than 7.0 cm with hard <b>scarred</b> <b>tissues,</b> it indicates possible difficult intubation.|$|R
5|$|Having {{ensured that}} {{sufficient}} tissue {{has been removed}} to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the {{opposite sides of the}} labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of <b>scar</b> <b>tissue</b> that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (<b>scar</b> <b>tissue).</b> In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{wrote to}} every {{club in the}} top two {{divisions}} to inform them he was available on a free transfer, and privately lamented choosing his past clubs for financial rather than footballing reasons. Over the summer he played 11 games in the North American Soccer League for the Tampa Bay Rowdies, a club that shared facilities with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Allardyce subsequently applied in his managerial career many modern practices of American football with regards to training, player management and tactics. He found playing difficult however, due to {{the heat and the}} all-out attacking nature of his teammates, which led to him being frequently exposed at the back, though he found that the club's masseurs managed to cure a long-standing hamstring <b>scar</b> <b>tissue</b> problem.|$|E
30|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to explore permeability of ethosomes encapsulated with 5 -florouracil (5 -FU) mediated by CO 2 fractional laser on hypertrophic <b>scar</b> <b>tissues.</b> Moreover, therapeutic and duration effect of CO 2 fractional laser combined with 5 -FU encapsulated ethosomes in rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model will be evaluated.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, {{a biopsy}} {{will have to}} be {{abandoned}} prematurely due to technical issues such as inaccessible or small kidneys, obscured kidneys, difficult to penetrate kidneys or observation of bleeding complication. Further, after the biopsy has been completed, microscopic examination of the tissue may reveal heavily <b>scarred</b> <b>tissue</b> prompting recommendation for re-biopsy to avoid sampling error.|$|R
40|$|A case of {{simultaneous}} {{correction of}} severe post-burn deformity with limited {{movement in the}} ankle joint, subluxation and contractures in the metatarsophalangeal joints in a 3 -year old child is presented. Excision of <b>scar</b> <b>tissues,</b> tendinous plasty, capsulotomy of involved joints were performed. To close the defect, a full-thickness skin graft was used. In two years, no signs of recurrence were observed...|$|R
5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve <b>scar</b> <b>tissue,</b> also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area.|$|E
5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of <b>scar</b> <b>tissue</b> that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in <b>scar</b> <b>tissue</b> residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{obturator}} foramen bypass {{has been described}} as an alternative procedure to solve complicated vascular problems in the groin. This extra-anatomical bypass has been used successfully in cases of infection, mycotic aneurysms, traumatic ulcer, irradiation ulcer, and excessively <b>scarred</b> <b>tissues</b> in the femoral region. We describe a patient who required bilateral {{obturator foramen}} bypass due to bilateral infected femoral pseudoaneurysm after axillo-bifemoral bypass...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} transfersomal gel carrying the antiscarring agent (5 -FU) to permeate hypertrophic scars in vivo and in vitro, scar permeation studies were performed after the agent was labeled with the fluorescent agent, rhodamine 6 GO. Laser confocal microscope was employed to dynamically observe the effects of transfersomal gel carrying 5 -FU at different time points. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was {{used to analyze the}} contents of the agent in the <b>scar</b> <b>tissues</b> at different hours after administration. Scar elevation index (SEI) was used to evaluate the changes of the ear scar models in rabbits. Compared with the PBS gel of 5 -FU, the transfersomal gel displayed greater permeation rate and depth, as well as a higher content retention of the agent in <b>scar</b> <b>tissues.</b> Local administrations of the agent for some certain periods effectively inhibited the hyperplasia of ear scars in rabbits. Transfersomes can be chosen as a potential transdermal drug delivery system...|$|R
5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (<b>scar</b> <b>tissue)</b> that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} issues {{that can occur}} with horses' legs that may not necessarily cause lameness. Stocking up {{is an issue that}} occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity. Fluid collects in the lower legs, producing swelling and often stiffness. Although it does not usually cause lameness or other problems, prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues. Older horses and horse with heavy muscling are more prone to this condition. A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the bursal sac of the elbow, causing inflammation and swelling. Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and <b>scar</b> <b>tissue,</b> called a capped elbow, or infections. Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down. Windpuffs, or swelling {{to the back of the}} fetlock caused by inflammation of the sheaths of the deep digital flexor tendon, appear most often in the rear legs. Soft and fluid-filled, the swelling may initially be accompanied by heat and pain, but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying lameness. Repeated injuries to the tendon sheath, often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces, can cause larger problems and lameness.|$|E
