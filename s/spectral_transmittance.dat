40|$|The canopy {{spectral}} invariants {{state that}} some simple algebraic combinations of leaf and canopy <b>spectral</b> <b>transmittances</b> and reflectances eliminate their dependencies on wavelength through the specification {{of a small}} set of canopy structure specific wavelength independent variables. This set includes the canopy interceptance, the recollision and escape probabilities. These variables specify an accurate relationship between the spectral response of a vegetation canopy to the incident solar radiation at the leaf and the canopy scale and allow for a simple and accurate parameterization for the partitioning of the incoming radiation into canopy transmission, reflection and absorption at any wavelength in the solar spectrum. This paper presents a solid theoretical basis for spectral invariant relationships reported in literature {{with an emphasis on}} their accuracies in describing the shortwave radiative properties of the three-dimensional vegetation canopies. The analysis of data on leaf and canopy <b>spectral</b> <b>transmittances</b> and reflectances collected during the international field campaign in Flakaliden, Sweden, June 25 – July 4, 2002 support the proposed theory. The results presented here is essential to both modeling and remote sensing communities. The canopy spectral invariants offer a simple and accurate parameterization for the shortwave radiation block in many global models of climate, hydrology, biogeochemestry, and ecology. In remote sensing applications, the information content of hyperspectral data can be fully exploited if the wavelength independent variables can be retrieved, for they can be more directly related to structural characteristics of the three dimensional vegetation canopy.

50|$|It {{is common}} for a gel {{manufacturer}} to publish the transmission coefficient or even the <b>spectral</b> <b>transmittance</b> curve in the swatch book and catalogs. A low transmittance gel will produce relatively little light on stage, but will cast a much more vivid color than a high transmission gel, because the colorfulness of a light source {{is directly related to}} narrowness of its spectral linewidth. Conversely, the flatter its curve becomes, the closer the gel is to a neutral density filter.|$|E
50|$|The {{readings}} {{by themselves}} are typically not as useful as their tristimulus values, {{which can be}} converted into chromaticity co-ordinates and manipulated through color space transformations. For this purpose, a spectrocolorimeter may be used. A spectrocolorimeter is simply a spectrophotometer that can estimate tristimulus values by numerical integration (of the color matching functions' inner product with the illuminant's spectral power distribution). One benefit of spectrocolorimeters over tristimulus colorimeters {{is that they do}} not have optical filters, which are subject to manufacturing variance, and have a fixed <b>spectral</b> <b>transmittance</b> curve—until they age. On the other hand, tristimulus colorimeters are purpose-built, cheaper, and easier to use.|$|E
50|$|The color filters filter {{the light}} by {{wavelength}} range, {{such that the}} separate filtered intensities include information about the color of light.For example, the Bayer filter (shown to the right) gives information about the intensity of light in red, green, and blue (RGB) wavelength regions. The raw image data captured by the image sensor is then converted to a full-color image (with intensities of all three primary colors represented at each pixel) by a demosaicing algorithm which is tailored {{for each type of}} color filter.The <b>spectral</b> <b>transmittance</b> of the CFA elements along with the demosaicing algorithm jointly determine the color rendition. The sensor's passband quantum efficiency and span of the CFA's spectral responses are typically wider than the visible spectrum, thus all visible colors can be distinguished. The responses of the filters do not generally correspond to the CIE color matching functions, so a color translation is required to convert the tristimulus values into a common, absolute color space.|$|E

40|$|The first {{successful}} {{deployment of the}} fully-operational ultraviolet rotating shadow-band spectroradiometer occurred during the May 2003 U. S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program's Aerosol Intensive Observation Period. The aerosol properties in the visible range were characterized using redundant measurements with several instruments to determine the column aerosol optical depth, the single scattering albedo, and the asymmetry parameter needed as input for radiative transfer calculations of the downwelling direct normal and diffuse horizontal solar irradiance in clear-sky conditions. The Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible (TUV) radiative transfer model developed by Madronich {{and his colleagues at}} the U. S. National Center for Atmospheric Research was used for the calculations of the spectral irradiance between 300 &ndash; 360 nm. Since there are few ultraviolet measurements of aerosol properties, most of the input aerosol data for the radiative transfer model are based on the assumption that UV input parameters can be extrapolated from the visible portion of the spectrum. Disagreements between available extraterrestrial spectra, which are discussed briefly, suggested that instead of comparing irradiances that measured and modeled <b>spectral</b> <b>transmittances</b> between 300 &ndash; 360 nm should be compared for the seven cases studied. These cases included low to moderate aerosol loads and low to high solar-zenith angles.

40|$|A {{new method}} to produce {{flattening}} <b>spectral</b> <b>transmittance</b> for a birefringent interleaver filter {{based on the}} interference of polarized light is presented. In previous publications, each birefringent crystal was required to be of equal thickness and only one group of crystal azimuth angles was obtained. In addition, {{the shape of the}} <b>spectral</b> <b>transmittance</b> was not sufficiently flat and the flatness width of the passband and stopband was not sufficiently wide. The proposed method has advantages over previously published methods. It is based on the Fourier transform, and the thickness of each crystal can be different. All numerical solutions can be obtained for crystal azimuth angles provided ripples are small in relation to the relatively wide passband and the stopband. Three birefringent crystals are used and all the azimuth angles of the crystals are obtained when ripples are limited to a uniform 0. 1 % in both the passband and stopband, with widths greater than 2 / 11 of the period. The influence of the change of azimuth angle and crystal thickness on the <b>spectral</b> <b>transmittance</b> of the system is discussed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} empirical {{and theoretical}} analyses of spectral hemispherical reflectances and transmittances of individual leaves {{and the entire}} canopy sampled at two sites representative of equatorial rainforests and temperate coniferous forests. The empirical analysis indicates that some simple algebraic combinations of leaf and canopy <b>spectral</b> <b>transmittances</b> and reflectances eliminate their dependencies on wavelength through the specification of two canopy-specific wavelength-independent variables. These variables and leaf optical properties govern the energy conservation in vegetation canopies at any given wavelength of the solar spectrum. The presented theoretical development indicates these canopy-specific wavelength-independent variables characterize {{the capacity of the}} canopy to intercept and transmit solar radiation under two extreme situations, namely, when individual leaves 1) are completely absorptive and 2) totally reflect and/or transmit the incident radiation. The interactions of photons with the canopy at red and near-infrared (IR) spectral bands approximate these extreme situations well. One can treat the vegetation canopy as a dynamical system and the canopy spectral interception and transmission as dynamical variables. The system has two independent states: canopies with totally absorbing and totally scattering leaves. Intermediate states are a superposition of these pure states. Such an interpretation provides powerful means to accurately specify changes in canopy structure both from ground-based measurements and remotely sensed data. This concept underlies the operational algorithm of global leaf area index (LAI), and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation developed for the moderate resolution imaging spectror [...] ...|$|R
