50|$|The {{ring line}} {{also has a}} history of {{supplementary}} services with other designations than F. At some times the variant service letters have been used to indicate which trains continued from Hellerup to Klampenborg. In other periods it has simply been because then-prevalent principles mandated that a single <b>service</b> <b>letter</b> such as F could not be used for more than exactly 3 trains an hour, so in parts of the day when more trains ran, extra services had to be invented.|$|E
50|$|With {{regard to}} the {{detachment}} of the washer, it is considered probable that the following factors contributed to this: Despite {{the fact that the}} nut was in a location difficult to access during the maintenance works, neither the manufacturer of the aircraft nor the company had paid sufficient attention to this when preparing the <b>service</b> <b>letter</b> and engineering order job card, respectively. Also, neither the maintenance operator nor the job supervisor reported the difficulty of the job to the one who had ordered the job.|$|E
50|$|Until 2007, {{separate}} service designations {{were used}} for trains that reinforced the basic service on the Køge radial in high-traffic periods. This was {{in part because they}} had their own stopping patterns, and in part due to the then-current doctrine that a <b>service</b> <b>letter</b> such as A must not be used for more than exactly 3 trains an hour. The first supplementary service was the rush-hour Ax which started running when {{the first phase of the}} Køge radial opened in 1972. It was upgraded to the daytime K service in 1992 and quickly renamed to A+ in 1993.|$|E

50|$|From 1972 to 1979, {{the service}} on the Taastrup branch was {{supplemented}} on weekdays by service E (q.v.). In 1979 a separate daytime reinforcement service Bb was created; it ran every 20 minutes with a 10-minute offset to service B such that the Tåstrup radial effectively had a 10-minute frequency. Under the timetable doctrine followed in those years, a <b>service</b> <b>letter</b> such as B {{could not be used}} for more than exactly 3 trains an hour, so a separate service designation was needed for these daytime supplements. They later changed their name to L and then to B+, and were finally folded into B with the 2007 timetable.|$|E

50|$|With {{regard to}} the cause of the {{detachment}} of the downstop assembly, it is considered highly probable that during the maintenance works for preventing the nut from loosening, which the company carried out on the downstop assembly about one and a half months prior to the accident based on the <b>service</b> <b>letter</b> from the manufacturer of the aircraft, the washer on the nut side of the assembly was omitted, following which the downstop on the nut side of the assembly fell off and then the downstop assembly eventually fell off the track. It is considered highly probable that a factor contributing to the detachment of the downstop assembly was the design of the downstop assembly, which was unable to prevent the assembly from falling off if the washer is not installed.|$|E

The intervention was conducted among postal <b>service</b> <b>letter</b> carriers in Denmark and was evaluated based on quantitative and qualitative data. Using interviews (N = 24) and observations, the programme theory of the intervention and to what extent the intervention had been implemented were assessed.

The results indicate that the intervention group had a significantly smaller increase in one dimension of job insecurity as compared to the comparison group.
