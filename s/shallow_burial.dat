40|$|The diagenetic {{history of}} Triassic {{sandstone}} from the Beacon Supergroup, Victoria Land, Antarctica, {{can be divided}} into three main phases of <b>shallow</b> <b>burial</b> diagenesis, contact diagenesis (temperatures of 200 - 300 oC), and post-contact diagenesis, on the basis of petrographic and geochemical analyses. <b>Shallow</b> <b>burial</b> diagenesis is characterised by minor compaction, K-feldspar alteration to illite, and quartz cementation. Contact diagenesis is related to emplacement of dolerite intrusions and basalt flows during Gondwana break-up at 180 Ma. This high-temperature diagenetic phase is dominated by zeolite cementation, even in sandstone poor in zeolite precursor materials. Elevated thermal conditions associated with the igneous intrusions are suggested by increased illite crystallinity, but strong evidence for contact metamorphism is missing. Post-contact diagenesis is signified by zeolite and Kfeldspar dissolution, and local quartz, calcite cementation and minor albite and K-feldspar precipitation.

30|$|Due to <b>shallower</b> {{depth of}} <b>burial</b> and younger age, the Gurpi and Pabdeh {{formations}} generally have lower thermal maturity than the Kazhdumi Formation and Ahmadi Member {{in the study}} area. All of the studied source rocks are immature in the central wells. The presence of the Qatar Arch and distribution of Hormoz Salt in the Persian Gulf region can be possible reasons for lower thermal maturity in the central parts. The Qatar Arch has deformed the sedimentary cover by {{an order of magnitude}} more than the diapiric structures. A basement high is thus inferred in the core of the Qatar Arch and it has separated the Persian Gulf into northwest and southeast parts (Konert et al. 2001). The presence of this paleohigh at {{the central part of the}} Persian Gulf caused different burial depths for the studied rock units in the region such that they have <b>shallower</b> <b>burial</b> depth around the Qatar Arch, while being more deeply buried in the surrounding areas (Alsharhan and Nairn 1997). Lower thermal maturity of the studied formations in the central part can be a result of this lower burial depth in this part of the study area (Fig.  4).|$|R

40|$|Early diagenetic {{dissolution}} of skeletal carbonate in environments from seafloor to <b>shallow</b> <b>burial</b> {{has the potential}} to skew the marine fossil record of aragonitic shells, particularly molluscs. Taphonomic windows leading to the preservation of labile skeletal components include relatively rare occurrences of early mineral replacement by silica (skeletal lagerstätten). Another, much more frequent process is event deposition where dissolution is halted by rapid burial of shells. Shell plasters form in basinal mud or low energy lagoonal environments during temporary dysoxic episodes, such as are caused by algal blooms. Preservation potential for aragonitic fossils may be enhanced by early cementation during <b>shallow</b> <b>burial</b> (hardgrounds) that protects the delicate dissolution moulds from destruction by bioturbation, or in high energy shoal environments where the drive for microbial dissolution is reduced. A data-based environmental model summarizes the main taphonomic zones, and illustrates significant taphonomic bias against aragonitic shells in lower energy settings of platform interiors and mid-outer ramps/shelves. The temporal distribution of various taphonomic windows shows the limited occurrence of silicified faunas, while {{the nature and extent of}} shell beds also change, but there is no obvious correlation with periods of 'calcite' and 'aragonite seas'...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{forms of}} hydrogen- 3, iodine- 129, carbon- 14, and krypton- 85 {{separated}} from fuel reprocessing streams {{and procedures for}} managing them were analyzed regarding compliance with regulations. Transportation of these wastes in certain DOT-specification packagings would be permissible, but some of these packagings may not be acceptable in some disposal situations. Transportation of gaseous krypton- 85 in a currently certified cylinder is possible, but a fuel reprocessor may wish to ship larger quantities per package. Disposal of tritium using a package designed by a DOE contractor and <b>shallow</b> land <b>burial,</b> {{in accord with the}} regulations of 10 CFR 61, seems practicable. Although 10 CFR 61 permits <b>shallow</b> land <b>burial</b> of iodine- 129, the concentration limit requires distribution in a volume that may seem impractical to commercial fuel reprocessors. The concentration limit of 10 CFR 61 for <b>shallow</b> land <b>burial</b> of carbon- 14 requires distribution in a lesser, although still large, volume. For both iodine- 129 and carbon- 14, management as high-level waste offers the advantage of smaller volumes. Similar advantages may be offered by greater confinement or non-near surface concepts for disposal. The concrete waste forms developed for these nuclides may not meet technical criteria being formulated for geologic disposal. The lack of accommodation of krypton- 85 at disposal facilities makes storage of the gaseous form at the fuel reprocessing plant, followed by dispersal after partial decay, seem attractive. Ocean disposal of iodine- 129 and carbon- 14 by the rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency-London Ocean Dumping Convention offers advantages over shallow land burial: higher allowed concentrations, resulting in smaller volumes and fewer packages. These rules, however, thwart ocean disposal of krypton- 85 since gaseous forms are banned, and for solid forms, concentration limits would require distribution of radioactivity in very large volumes...|$|R

The tubular degassing conduits are com-posed of zoned cements and have d 18 O and d 13 C isotope values similar to the injected sandstones, indicating that oil and gas seepage induced the precipitation of authigenic carbonate in the shallow subsurface. Oil inclusions in inter- and intra-crystal cement sites in both injected sandstones and degassing conduits indicate that oil seep-age was an ongoing feature at <b>shallow</b> <b>burial.</b> A proposed model involves oil and gas seepage and the formation of the degassing conduits, followed by a sand injection phase.

5000|$|A tomb {{had been}} {{discovered}} {{at the beginning of}} the 16th century, when the foundations were being laid for the four twisted columns of Gian Lorenzo Bernini's [...] "Confessio".

Between 1939 and 1949, the Vatican-led archaeological team overseen by Monsignor Ludwig Kaas, who had overall authority over the project, had uncovered a complex of pagan mausoleums under the foundations of St. Peter's Basilica (the so-called Vatican Necropolis), dating to the 2nd and 3rd centuries.

30|$|Gas shale with {{commercial}} production in North America has a burial depth {{mainly in the}} range of 1500 – 3500  m, and the burial depth for economically recoverable shale gas is generally limited to 4000 – 5000  m (EIA 2013), which is mainly based on the consideration of the technology and cost related to shale gas exploitation. In fact, shale with a deeper burial has a greater gas content and free gas proportion than shale with a <b>shallower</b> <b>burial</b> (Figs.  7, 8). The evaluation parameters for the North America shale do not include the shallower limit of the burial depth, and successful commercial exploitation has been achieved in some shallow shales (< 1000  m) (Curtis 2002), which is mainly attributed to their greater porosity with a high free gas content (Curtis 2002; Li et al. 2013 b). Porosity of the Lower Paleozoic shale in south China is significantly lower than that of the North American shale (Wang et al. 2013 a). To ensure a certain amount of gas storage capacity, especially free gas reserves, the Lower Paleozoic shale in south China needs a higher fluid pressure coefficient and/or a greater depth. Taking a gas content of 2.80  m 3 /t as the lower limit of shale with a commercial shale gas potential suggested by Halliburton (Wang et al. 2012 a), shale with a gas-filling porosity of 2.6  % should have a burial depth of about 1500  m to achieve this gas content under a pressure coefficient of 1.5 according to Fig.  7. When the pressure coefficient is 1.0, the corresponding depth is about 3000  m according to Fig.  8. Actually, except for the lower Silurian shale in the Sichuan Basin, the average gas-filling porosity of the other lower Paleozoic shales in the Upper Yangtze area rarely exceeds 2.6  % from the available data (Huang et al. 2012 b; Huang and Shen 2015; Yi and Zhao 2014; Yu et al. 2014), which means that shale should have a greater burial depth to meet this gas content. Therefore, burial depth has an important significance for the Lower Paleozoic shale gas exploration and development in south China. Within a definite maturity range (2.0  % < EqR o <  3.5  %), the gas-in-place and free gas content increases with increasing burial depth. To exploit shale gas with a greater depth will become a trend. For example, the core shale gas area in north Canada has reached 5000  m (Ross and Bustin 2007; 2008). The present paper does not set the deeper limit of burial, but suggests a <b>shallower</b> <b>burial</b> limit of 1500 and 3000  m for the uplifted/folded and faulted/folded areas, respectively.|$|R

The U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office is considered five options for management of the buried TRU waste. One option is to leave the waste in-place if the disposal can {{meet the requirements of}} Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 191, 'Environmental Radiation Protection Standard for Management and Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High-Level, and Transuranic Radioactive Wastes'. This paper describes analyses that assess the likelihood that TRU waste in <b>shallow</b> land <b>burial</b> can meet the 40 CFR 191 standards for a geologic repository. The simulated probability of the cumulative release exceeding 1 and 10 times the 40 CFR 191. 13 containment requirements is estimated to be 0. 009 and less than 0. 0001, respectively. The cumulative release is most sensitive to the number of groundwater withdrawal wells drilled through the disposal trench. The mean total effective dose equivalent for a member of the public is estimated to reach a maximum of 0. 014 milliSievert (mSv) at 10, 000 years, or approximately 10 percent of the 0. 15 mSv 40 CFR 191. 15 individual protection requirement. The dose is predominantly from inhalation of short-lived Rn- 222 progeny in air produced by low-level waste disposed in the same trench. The transuranic radionuclide released in greatest amounts, Pu- 239, contributes only 0. 4 percent of the dose. The member of public dose is most sensitive to the U- 234 inventory and the radon emanation coefficient.

40|$|ABSTRACT Basic and ultrabasic blocks within ophiolitic mélanges of the Cycladic Blueschist Unit in {{southern}} Evia provide a detailed insight into its ocean floor igneous and hydrothermal evolution, {{as well as}} the regional poly-metamorphism occurring during Alpine orogenesis. The upper structural levels (Mt. Ochi exposures) are dominated by metamorphosed wehrlites, gabbros and highly light rare earth element (LREE) -enriched pillow basalts, whereas the underlying Tsaki mélange consists of basic protoliths with much less fraction-ated REE patterns as well as mantle harzburgites. Most of the metabasites show Nb anomalies, indicative of derivation from a subduction-aVected mantle. The igneous bodies were juxtaposed and incorporated into the enclosing sedimentary sequences prior to high-pressure/low-temperature (HP/LT) metamorphism (M 1). Glaucophane, epidote, sodic clinopyroxene and high-Si phengite constitute the Eocene M 1 assem-blage, which is estimated to have formed at> 11 kbar and 400 – 450 °C.
