2500|$|After reigning {{almost twenty}} years, working {{at least ten}} hours a day, Christina had what some have {{interpreted}} as a nervous breakdown. She suffered with high blood pressure, complained about bad eyesight and pain in her neck. Grégoire François Du Rietz, since 1642 the court physician, was called when she suddenly collapsed in 1651. In February 1652 the French doctor Pierre Bourdelot arrived in Stockholm. Unlike most doctors of that time, he held no faith in blood-letting; instead, he ordered sufficient <b>sleep,</b> <b>warm</b> baths and healthy meals, as opposed to Christina's hitherto ascetic way of life. She was only twenty-five, and advising that she should take more pleasure in life, Bourdelot asked her to stop studying and working so hard and to remove the books from her apartments. For years, Christina knew by heart all the sonnets from the Ars Amatoria and was keen on the works by Martial and Petronius. The physician showed her the 16erotic sonnets of Pietro Aretino, which he kept secretly in his luggage. By subtle means Bourdelot undermined her principles. She now became an Epicurean. Her mother and de la Gardie were very much against the activities of Bourdelot and tried to convince her to change her attitude towards him; Bourdelot returned to France in 1653 [...] "laden in riches and curses".|$|E

50|$|Other {{theories}} are that REM <b>sleep</b> <b>warms</b> the brain, stimulates and stabilizes the neural circuits {{that have not}} been activated during waking, or creates internal stimulation to aid development of the CNS; while some argue that REM lacks any purpose, and simply results from random brain activation.|$|R
60|$|As the mad riot swept {{past him}} and out of doors, he signalled to the slaves, and the four tottering old men {{supported}} him on his feet as he met the returning revellers, upright, glass in hand, pledging them a toast to the short night when a man <b>sleeps</b> <b>warm.</b>|$|R

60|$|Thick {{and high}} grew {{the walls of}} the new house.

6000|$|They {{were in no}} hurry, {{and walked}} only fast enough to keep {{themselves}} warm. In two hours and a half {{they arrived at the}} main road and turned to the right. [...] "Now we will go another couple of miles, Paolo, and then look out for a sleeping place. An empty barn or stable or a stack of fodder is what we want.

60|$|March is a weary {{month for}} the wood folk. One who follows them then has it borne in upon him {{continually}} that life is a struggle,--a keen, hard, hunger-driven struggle to find enough to keep a-going and <b>sleep</b> <b>warm</b> till the tardy sun comes north again with his rich living. The fall abundance of stored food has all been eaten, except in out-of-the-way corners that one stumbles upon in a long day's wandering; the game also is wary and hard to find from being constantly hunted by eager enemies.|$|E

5000|$|Virtues {{like those}} of a Sewall will long embalm the memory of {{departed}} worth: and while genius without sensibility lives unbeloved, and science without philanthropy dies unregretted, the fatherless, the widow, and the poor, gather round his grave; and even the prisoner, and the appointed for death, exclaim,There <b>sleeps</b> our <b>warmest,</b> truest friend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It is told of Brutus, {{that when}} he fell on his sword after the battle of Philippi, he quoted a line of Euripides,--"O Virtue! I have {{followed}} thee through life, and I find thee at last but a shade." [...] I doubt not the hero is slandered by this report. The heroic soul does not sell its justice and its nobleness. It does not ask to dine nicely and to <b>sleep</b> <b>warm.</b> The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough. Poverty is its ornament. It does not need plenty, and can very well abide its loss.|$|E
60|$|Many {{and many}} a {{time during the}} {{campaign}} had Terence good reason for thinking with gratitude of Andrews' kindly thought. His greatcoat, which like those of all the officers of the regiment, had been made at Athlone, of good Irish frieze lined with flannel, would stand almost any amount of rain, {{but it was not}} long enough to protect his legs while lying down. But by rolling himself in the horse-cloth he was able to <b>sleep</b> <b>warm</b> and dry, when without it he would have been half-frozen, or soaked through with rain from above and moisture from the ground below. He found that the brigadier and his staff carried the same amount of baggage as other officers, the only difference being that the general had a tent for himself, his assistant-adjutant and quartermaster one between them, while a third was used as an office-tent in the day, and was occupied by the two aides-de-camp at night.|$|E

60|$|The moon climbed higher, {{away from}} the snowy, fading ridge, she became {{gradually}} herself. Between {{the roots of the}} olive tree was a rosy-tipped daisy just going to sleep. I gathered it and put it among the frail, moony little bunch of primroses, so that its <b>sleep</b> should <b>warm</b> the rest. Also I put in some little periwinkles, that were very blue, reminding me of the eyes of the old woman.|$|R

His most critically well-regarded projects were released on Capitol Records {{in the late}} 1950s - e.g. <b>Sleep</b> <b>Warm</b> (1959) and This Time I'm Swingin'! (1960). Nevertheless, the singer had no significant album chart success until he signed with Reprise Records in the early 1960s.|$|E

The time’s coming when we shan’t be able to fill our bellies in comfort while other folk go hungry or <b>sleep</b> in <b>warm</b> beds while others shiver in the cold; when we shan’t be able to kneel and thank God for blessings before our shining altars while men anywhere are kneeling in either physical or spiritual subjection. And God willing, we’ll live to see that day.|$|R
60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} Hector {{and his companions}} {{presented}} themselves at the palace. Seven hours' <b>sleep,</b> a <b>warm</b> bath, and the services of the barber, who curled the hair of the two young nobles and sprinkled them all with perfume, did much to restore them, though they were all somewhat stiff, and every bone seemed to ache. They were kept waiting for half an hour, {{at the end of}} which time the door of the antechamber was opened and their names were called. The queen, who was still a beautiful woman, was standing talking to a gentleman, in whose attire there were but few symbols that would betray to a stranger that he was an ecclesiastic of high rank.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>Warm</b> is {{an album}} {{recorded}} by Dean Martin for Capitol Records in three sessions between October 13, 1958 and October 15, 1958 with arrangements by Pete King and orchestra conducted by Frank Sinatra.

In 1968, the third and last Dot LP produced a now obscure eponymous single that would become arguably Moss's most enduring song: Just a Dream Ago, although the LP also included a worthy cover of <b>Sleep</b> Safe and <b>Warm,</b> the theme from the film Rosemary's Baby.|$|R

50|$|Between 1946 and 1983 Sinatra {{conducted}} seven {{albums and}} occasionally conducted live orchestras on stage. His first recordings {{on which he}} wielded the baton were instigated by producer Mitch Miller, who approached Columbia boss Maine Sachs to request that Sinatra conduct {{some of the work}} of Alec Wilder, later released as Frank Sinatra Conducts The Music Of Alec Wilder. In 1956 Sinatra recorded the first album in the Capitol Records tower, not as a vocalist, but as a conductor on the album Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color. In 1957 and 1959 he conducted albums for Peggy Lee — The Man I Love — and Dean Martin — <b>Sleep</b> <b>Warm</b> — the latter, charting inside Billboards Top 40. A lesser-known project for his own label, Reprise, entitled Frank Sinatra Conducts Music from Pictures and Plays remains relatively obscure, and it was 20 years before Sinatra conducted in a studio again, for Sylvia Syms on the album Syms by Sinatra, which featured the final arrangements of Don Costa. The following year Sinatra conducted for trumpeter Charles Turner on the album Whats New?.|$|E

50|$|A {{sleeping}} porch is a deck or balcony that is screened and furnished {{for sleeping}} in the warmer months. Sleeping porches can be on ground level or on a higher storey and in either the front or back of a home. The idea of a sleeping porch dates back nearly a hundred years when people would sleep on a screened-in porch to get the coolness of the night air during summer without being bothered by bugs. Before the advent of air conditioning, families often created sleeping areas on outdoor porches, where children would <b>sleep</b> during the <b>warmer</b> months.|$|R
5000|$|It need {{hardly be}} said, that {{the walls of}} my house are entirely free from fire-places. These all congregate in the middle - in the one grand central chimney, upon all four sides of which are hearths - two tiers of hearths - so that when, in the various chambers, my family and guests are warming {{themselves}} of a cold winter’s night, just before retiring, then, though {{at the time they}} may not be thinking so, all their faces mutually look towards each other, yea, all their feet point to one centre; and when they go to sleep in their beds, they all <b>sleep</b> round one <b>warm</b> chimney.|$|R

He was tall and pale-coloured, and carried those new-fashioned beads for counting of prayers. They were large brown nuts or seeds, and hanging from his girdle with his pen and inkhorn they clashed when he walked. His place was in the great fireplace. There was his table of accounts, and there he lay o' nights. He feared the hounds in the Hall that came nosing after bones or to <b>sleep</b> on the <b>warm</b> ashes, and would slash at them with his beads--like a woman. When De Aquila sat in Hall to do justice, take fines, or grant lands, Gilbert would so write it in the Manor-roll. But {{it was none of}} his work to feed our guests, or to let them depart without his lord's knowledge.|$|R

He said Nunez must have been specially created to learn and serve the wisdom, they had acquired, and that for all his mental incoherency and stumbling behaviour he must have courage, and do his best to learn, and at that {{all the people in the}} doorway murmured encouragingly. He said the night--for the blind call their day night--was now far gone, and it behoved every one to go back to sleep. He asked Nunez if he knew how to sleep, and Nunez said he did, but that before sleep he wanted food.|$|R
