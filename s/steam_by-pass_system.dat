40|$|It is {{well-known}} that Turbo codes are very useful in digital communications. However, {{due to the}} existence of interleaver/deinterleaver, there is no effective way available to test the correctness of the 'turbo' algorithms in practical use such as FPGA/DSP implementation, especially in very low bit error rate. In this paper, based on the extractable theoretical bounds for interleaver <b>by-passed</b> <b>systems,</b> a simple but effective testing method is proposed by separating the turbo coder into interleaver/ deinterleaver part and soft-in soft-out (SISO) -iterative decoding part.

40|$|The Phébus FP {{project is}} an {{international}} reactor safety project. Its main objective is to study the release, transport and retention of fission products in a severe accident of a light water reactor (LWR). The FPT 4 test was performed with a fuel debris bed geometry, to look at late phase core degradation and the releases of low volatile fission products and actinides. Post Test Analyses results indicate that releases of noble gases (Xe, Kr) and high-volatile fission products (Cs, I) were nearly complete and comparable to those obtained during Phébus tests performed with a fuel bundle geometry (FPT 1, FPT 2). Volatile fission products such as Mo, Te, Rb, Sb were released significantly as in previous tests. Ba integral release was greater than that observed during FPT 1. Release of Ru was comparable to that observed during FPT 1 and FPT 2. As in other Phébus tests, the Ru distribution suggests Ru volatilization followed by fast redeposition in the fuelled section. The similar release fraction for all lanthanides and fuel elements suggests the released fuel particles deposited onto the plenum surfaces. A blockage by molten material induced a <b>steam</b> <b>by-pass</b> which may {{explain some of the}} low releases. The revaporisation testing under different atmospheres (pure steam, H 2 /N 2 and steam /H 2) and up to 1000 °C was performed on samples from the first upper plenum.

40|$|In {{cogeneration}} {{and combined}} cycle plants, {{the presence of}} a by-pass stack has a great importance since it allows the modulation of heat-to-power generation to follow variable daily demand and thus the optimal management of the heat and power production. Hence, among the various aspects that have to be analysed in a plant design, the exhaust gas stack design can represent a critical aspect, in particular when a by-pass stack is present, since it may influence the entire system working condition. To properly take into account the large number of the different requirements (economic, structural, geometrical, acoustic, etc.) which enter in a stack design, a multidisciplinary analysis involving CAD/CFD/FEM integrated approaches can be adopted in order to obtain an optimally designed stack system.

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an autologous perfused rat hind limb preparation for the study of skeletal muscle contractile function. Methods Adult Wistar rats were surgically prepared using a <b>by-pass</b> <b>system</b> for pump-controlled arterial blood flow to, and venous return from the hind limb during periods of quiescence and twitch contraction of the gastrocnemius-plantaris-soleus muscle bundle. Results During rest, hind limb perfusion pressure (102 ± 5 mmHg) was not different to systemic arterial pressure (99 ± 4 mmHg). Hind limb pressure was responsive to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators (± 50 mmHg). The arterial PO 2 (100 ± 3 mmHg), O 2 saturation, and acid–base balance (pH: 7. 42 ± 0. 01) contributed to resting hind limb (a-v) O 2 difference (4. 8 ± 0. 5 mL/ 100 mL) and VO 2 (0. 31 ± 0. 03 μmol/g/min wet weight). Repetitive isometric twitch tension (1 Hz, 0. 05 ms, 10 minutes) was best maintained at a flow rate of 2 mL/min (VO 2 increased fivefold during muscle contraction) and efficiency of oxygen use increased from 0. 27 ± 0. 08 – 0. 52 ± 0. 07 N/μmol/min.

Information was obtained on coastal erosion/accretion areas, general sediment circulation pattern and littoral cell distribution. Human-made structures and natural headlands constituted important artificial limits dividing littoral in morphological cells. Ports and harbours were observed at Scoglitti, Punta Secca, Marina di Ragusa, Donnalucata and Pozzallo. Most of them worked as “transit” limits which interrupted predominant, eastward directed sedimentary transport, this way generating accretion in updrift (west) side of mentioned structures and erosion in downdrift (east) side. During the 1967 – 2008 period, about 62, 000 m 2 and 42, 000 m 2 of beach surface were respectively formed updrift of Scoglitti and Donnalucata ports. The construction of Pozzallo port {{gave rise to the}} formation of a “convergent” limit which favoured large accretion (94, 000 m 2) east of port structure.

Recent developments in thermoelectrics (TE) may soon make them a viable solution for such applications. This team has been exploring the potential of using TE modules in combination with variable conductance heat pipes for transferring the exhaust heat to the generator with very low thermal resistance and at a constant, prescribed temperature. This passive temperature control {{eliminates the need for}} <b>by-pass</b> <b>systems</b> in the event of temperature overshoots. The operating temperature of a generator should be as high as possible in order to maximize the Seebeck effect. However, currently available modules are temperature limited. Moreover, the higher the HP temperature the less the usable thermal power at the exhaust will be (heat can only be transferred to from a hotter to a colder body). The present work assesses both theoretically and experimentally the influence of the HP temperature in the electric output of a thermoelectric generator. A small diesel engine and a generator were tested and it was found that a high HP operating temperature is only limitative for performance in the cases where low exhaust temperature and low engine power are present. In those cases it is possible to estimate an optimal HP temperature in order to maximize power output. The combined use of Seebeck modules and heat pipes was found to be highly advantageous in various ways.

In this paper, the smaple was sieved into 8 fractions according to the particle size distirbution. The content of CaO and chloride in the bottom ash almost decreased with the increase of particle size of bottom ash, contrary to the SiO 2 content variation in the bottom ash. The Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 content were relatively stable in the bottom ash with different particle size. The chloride, which could cause serious corrosion in the cement kiln, in 8 portion of bottom ash were all higher than its allowable limit in raw material for cement production and clinker quality, the dosage of bottom ash used as alternative material for cement production must be stringently controled, and some proper treatment must be used to reduce the corrion caused by chloride. The heavy metals concentration in the bottom ash were relatively high, but met standard requirements for heavy metals concentration in raw meterial.

40|$|In {{nuclear power}} plants and {{accelerator}} driven system (ADS) for nuclear waste treatment, {{it is important to}} monitor the coolant flow rate in the reactor core and pipe-line. In such a strong irradiation, high pressure and temperature environment, no accurate local flow measurement technique is readily available. Electromagnetic (EM) flow meter is popular in low temperature application as it is a non-intrusive technology. However, additional voltage will be produced due to temperature, flow, pressure, the chemical properties of the liquid metal and surface condition of the steel walls. In addition, the non-definite wetting behavior of liquid lead-bismuth to the electrically conducting structure material can lead to incorrect readings even during one measurement day. As the temperature measurement technique is well developed for high temperature applications, one alternative flow rate measurement technique is proposed here based on correlation velocity measurement using temperature sensors. The impulse response function (IRF) will be used instead of the cross-correlation function in the time delay estimation. The IRF method shows a more accurate estimation of the transit time, which allows extremely low velocities (down to 2 cm/sec) to be detected. In this research work, 2 the faster thermal diffusion effect in low Prandtl number liquid metal will be considered for the better delay time estimation.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of biosensors {{in an industrial}} environment is only possible if they present a well adapted solution to an important analytical problem.

These biosensors have been connected via flow-injection analysis (FIA) devices and applied to batch cultures of hybridoma cells and also perfusion systems using recombinant BHK cells {{for the production of}} IL- 2. It has been shown that these biosensors allow direct feedback control of the concentrations of the main nutrients. Furthermore, the on-line determination of the biotechnological product (e. g. monoclonal antibodies, interleukin- 2) is a prerequisite for the development of reliable process control strategies. Novel amperometric immunosensors and automated immunocartridge systems allow the analysis of protein products in minutes (compared to hours with ELISA techniques). It has been clearly demonstrated that glucose, lactate, glutamate and high molecular weight product determinations with associated process control is possible. Renneberg et al., (1991), for example, showed that on-line control was possible for the process control of perfused bioreactor systems containing mammalian cell lines producing interleukin - 2. Glucose, lactate and glutamate were determined using enzyme sensors. Interluekin - 2 was detected using immunosensors. Figure 1 illustrates the experimental set-up of the flow injection analysis (F. I. A.) biosensor-bioreactor coupling and compares on-line and off-line data.

The tests were conducted by personnel from the Overhaul and Repair Department, Alameda Naval Air Station, from the Bureau of Naval Weapons Fleet Readiness Represent­ative, Pacific and from the USNPGS Department of Aeronautics. The power plant utilized for correlating purposes for a T- 56 -lOW turboprop engine, recently overhauled at NAS Alameda while the propeller was the Hamilton Standard model required for this engine. The test data reveal satisfactory correlation of the engine performance data with the Alameda test results. The discrepancies that do appear {{are the result of}} errors in the instrumentation system and do not present a major problem. All of the major facility systems function satisfactorily except the oil supply system and the chamber lighting fixtures. Engine starting and control systems were adequate although somewhat different from the designs utilized in the NAVWEPS specifica­tions for this engine. The engine support stand and thrust measuring assembly were found to be structurally sound and functioned satisfactorily. The propeller orifice assembly did not induce prohibitive vibrational stresses as was anticipated. However, the vibrational loads did cause the majority of the orifice retaining bolts to loosen during the test sequence. Three bolts were found beneath the test stand; these could have caused object damage to the engine. The major areas of discrepancy are the engine oil supply system and the test chamber lighting fixtures. The engine oil system as designed could not satisfy the requirements for the T- 56 series engine. It was necessary to re-route the oil <b>by-pass</b> <b>system,</b> to obtain a more precise control of the engine oil supply and pressure, and to provide a method to heat the oil for operation of the engine at high power set­tings. The system as temporarily modified, did function adequately during the test period. The lighting fixtures mounted on swivel joint bases oscillated vio­lently when operating the engine at Idle power. One fixture above the engine broke loose during this short period and was blown clear of the engine stand by the propeller air stream. All ceiling-mounted light fixtures were removed from the chamber before further engine operation. The acoustic survey revealed that the acoustic paneling in the in­ let and the exhaust passages functioned satisfactorily. However, the Sound Pressure Level reduction across the chamber front double-doors did not meet the specified limits. Corrective action is required to (1) provide adequate and safe lighting in the test chamber, (2) re-design and install an oil supply system compatible for operation with the T- 56 engine, and (3) provide positive locking devices on all bolted fixtures in the test chambers...|$|R

Models based on empirical data (ARISG) and improvements to previous codes (SPARC) have been proposed, respectively, for dry and wet aerosol retention, but, further development and validation remains, as was noted during the ARTIST international project and potential successors. New CFD models for particle-turbulence interactions have been developed based on random walk stochastic treatments and have shown promise in accurately describing particle deposition rates in complex geometries. Aerosol transport in containment concrete cracks is fairly well understood, with several models developed but validation was limited. Extension of such validation against prototypic data will be feasible through an ongoing joint experimental program in the CEA COLIMA facility under the 6 th Framework PLINIUS platform. Primary deposit revaporisation has been experimentally demonstrated on samples from the Phebus-FP project. Data review has pinpointed variables affecting the process, particularly temperature. Available models have been satisfactorily used to interpret separate-effect tests, but performing integral experiments, where revaporisation is likely combined with other processes, still pose a difficult challenge. Further experimental data as well as modelling efforts seem to be necessary to get a full understanding. Resuspension, {{sometimes referred to as}} mechanical remobilization, has been recently addressed in SARNET and although a set of models were already available in the literature (i. e., Rock'n Roll model, CESAR, ECART), further work is needed to extend current capabilities to multi-layer deposits and to produce simplified, but sufficiently accurate, models. A major remaining uncertainty is the particle-to-particle/wall adhesion and its dependence on microscale roughness. Data from the previous EU STORM project have been retrieved and further experiments designed for code validation are being used to benchmark the models. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. JRC.

30|$|There {{are high}} {{functioning}} and low functioning ballast water treatment systems on board ships. In this study, five systems were analysed {{so as to}} methodically examine the operational difficulties for ship crew members while giving important consideration to sustainable environment practices. Multi-criteria analysis, a questionnaire, survey and interviews were used as the research method so as to ascertain and corroborate existing problems on board ships, and {{the reliability of the}} systems was calculated. The co-insistency, maintenance and the efficiency of the systems, were shown as being the major problem as there are no systems for tracking ship ballast operations from land. The treatment system that used oxidants was, through multi criteria analysis, evaluated as being the best and was ranked first. However, the survey results showed that the ship’s crew had serious problems with this system which difficult to solve during the ship’s operations with cargo. The deoxygenation system was the most appropriate according to ballast water treatment criteria in the port or at sea. The treatment system which used electrolysis with oxidant was better in terms of efficacy and the treatment system electrolysis with ultra violet light was better in terms of the criterion environment pollution footprint. During further research, it was shown that 7  % of the surveyed crew members had major problems with operating ballast water treatment systems, including the system which was ranked first through multi criteria analysis. They <b>by-passed</b> these <b>systems</b> while continuing to ballast or de-ballast. It was calculated that of the total time needed for the ballast water treatment system operation, 9  % of this time was used for repairs or maintenance of the systems. Some examples are changing a used UV bulb, cleaning the filter or controlling the amount of oxidant which would be discharged into the sea. A conclusion was made and solution was suggested. The study results emphasised taking action in the interest of protecting the natural world, with particular attention being given to environmental protection to support human life.|$|R
40|$|This {{high-speed}} automotive {{diesel engine}} {{was designed to}} achieve the greatest possible reliability in opera-tion, low operating and maintenance costs and maximum versatility of component and auxiliary arrange-ments, based on long experience of large-scale manufacture of engines for commercial vehicles and the increases in power output and time between overhauls made possible by improvements in design, materials, manufacturing processes, fuels and lubricants. Elimination of the cylinder high-pressure joint was {{a radical departure from}} current practice and promised considerable advantages in cooling, reducing thermal stress and freeing restrictions in cylinder-head porting layout. Thus the potential for operating at the highest rating now in use and for future development was improved. This paper deals with the design aims, describes the engine and outlines the development work with single and multi-cylinder engines that has been undertaken to ensure that each commercial variant meets the re-quirements of its rating. Vertical and horizontal configurations are used in naturally aspirated and pressure-charged versions. For automotive work, using mechanical transmissions, the drooping characteristic of the normal turbocharged engines torque curve at low speed is a serious disadvantage. Measures taken to over-come this are described. These included variations in camshaft timing, automatic variable control of injection timing and boost pressure control of fuel injection quantity to avoid undesirable smoke in the exhaust emission in addition to the normal development work of ensuring the highest practicable standards of mechanical, volumetric and combustion efficiency. Other methods such as special turbocharger matchings, including the waste-gate <b>system</b> of turbine <b>by-pass,</b> the <b>system</b> of auxiliary hydraulic drive of the turbocharger at low engine speeds and, as alternative to turbocharging, pressure charging by an aerodynamic pulse-converter are discussed. At {{the other end of the}} scale, considerable attention has been paid to increasing the maximum engine output by turbocharging with intercooling which promises to increase naturally aspirated power by over 100 per cent, if in road vehicles the problem of the intercooler, airlair or airlwater, can be dealt with satisfactorily...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomena}} {{of loss of}} coolant accident have been investigated for long time and the result of experiment shows that the flow condition in the downcomer during the end-of-blowdown were highly multi-dimensional at full-scale. However, the downcomer nodalization of input deck for large break {{loss of coolant accident}} used in advanced power reactor 1400 analyses are made up with 1 -D model and improperly designed to describe realistic coolant phenomena during loss of coolant accident analysis. In this paper, the authors modified the nodalization of MARS code LBLOCA input deck and performed LBLOCA analysis with new input deck. From original LBLOCA input deck file, the nodalization of downcomer and junction connections with 4 cold legs and direct vessel injection lines are modified for reflecting the realistic cross-flow effect and real downcomer structure. The analysis results show that the peak cladding temperature of new input deck decreases more rapidly than previous result and that the drop of peak cladding temperature was advanced by application of momentum flux term in cross-flow. Additionally, the authors developed a new input deck with multi-dimensional downcomer model and ran MARS code with multi-dimensional input deck as well. By using the modified input deck, the Emergency core cooling <b>system</b> <b>by-pass</b> flow phenomena is better characterized and found to be consistent with both experimental report and regulatory guide...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{penalty for}} post‐combustion {{carbon dioxide capture}} from fossil‐fired power plants can be greatly reduced ‐ {{independently}} of the intrinsic heat of regeneration of the solvent used ‐ by effective thermodynamic integration with the power cycle. Yet expected changes in electricity generation mix and the current immaturity of post‐combustion capture technology are likely to make effective thermodynamic integration throughout the operating life of such plants a challenging objective to achieve because of a requirement for extensive part‐load operation and also for matching to future technology improvements. Most previous published studies have, however, focused on base‐load operation of the power cycle and the carbon dioxide capture plant and with the assumption of a fixed technology. For carbon dioxide capture‐ready plants {{the characteristics of the}} capture plant are also not known when the plant is designed. The plant must operate initially without capture at a similar efficiency to ‘standard’ plants to be competitive. Capture‐ready plants then also {{need to be able to}} be retrofitted with unknown improved solvents and to be capable of integration with a range of future solvents. This study shows that future upgradability for post‐combustion capture systems can be facilitated by appropriate steam turbine and steam cycle designs. In addition fossil‐fired power plants with postcombustion capture may need to be able to operate throughout their load range with the capture unit by‐passed, or with intermediate solvent storage to avoid the additional emissions occurring when the absorption column is <b>by‐passed.</b> <b>Steam</b> cycles with flexible steam turbines can be adequately designed to accommodate for part‐load operation with these novel operating conditions and with rapid ramp rates. Several approaches for effective capture‐ready pulverised coal and natural gas plants are also described. These achieve identical performance before retrofit to a conventional plant with the same steam conditions, but have the potential to perform well after capture retrofit with a wide range of solvents, at the expense of only a small efficiency penalty compared to hypothetical plants built with perfect foreknowledge of the solvent energy requirements. For existing plants that were not made capture‐ready, and provided sufficient space is available and other physical limits are not too constraining, ways to achieve effective thermodynamic integration are also discussed.

40|$|Human macrophages {{are one of}} {{the main}} targets for HIV- 1 infection, despite their {{moderately}} low surface expression levels of the main HIV- 1 receptor, CD 4. The site of HIV- 1 fusion can occur at the surface or following uptake through an endosomal pathway and it might be anticipated that the site would affect the progress of HIV- 1 through the cell to the nucleus. Previous pharmacological studies provide one line of evidence for an endosomal entry route which is dependent on Detergent Resistant Membranes (DRMs). However, these findings need confirmation using a genetic approach, as small molecules may have multiple non-specific effects. For this study, a novel genetic approach was developed to manipulate sub-cellular CD 4 distribution and investigate whether it determines the HIV- 1 entry pathway in macrophages. This was achieved by transducing human embryonic stem cells (hESC) with lentiviral vectors and differentiating these cells into homogeneous genetically modified macrophages. This cellular <b>system</b> <b>by-passes</b> the challenges posed by the refractoriness to direct genetic manipulation of heterogeneous primary macrophages. Firstly, as proof of principle, a short hairpin RNA targeting CD 4 was expressed in hESC-macrophages, resulting in knockdown of CD 4 and, as anticipated, strong inhibition of HIV- 1 infection. Secondly, expression of LCK in hESC-macrophages effectively tethered CD 4 at the cell surface, and sequestered HIV- 1 into an unproductive pathway, presumably through surface fusion, rather than progressing successfully to the nucleus. Thirdly, endogenous CD 4 was substituted with CD 4 mutants designed to be excluded from DRMs, which resulted in reduced successful HIV- 1 entry versus substituted control CD 4. The results support the model in which the productive entry pathway of HIV- 1 in macrophages occurs via fusion after a raft-dependent endocytic uptake pathway, and requires CD 4 localization to lipid rafts.

40|$|Through the {{application}} of several different methods of analysis it was showed definitely that a risk analysis conducted on an industrial machine, {{taking into account the}} human factor from the beginning, has a significant impact in the assignment of SIL to all Safety Integrity Function (SIF). The same phenomenon occurs in the verification and computation of the performance level for each device of the press. Comparing these methods and the results obtained through the development of a further case study carried out during the Spring at Trinity College of Dublin it was possible to define a useful logical model of analysis to describe and assess the risks related to human-interface and usable to verify and calculate the safety integrity level of the safety functions of the machine. This methodology is a combination between the Integrated Dynamic Decision Analysis (IDDA) and the Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP). The application of the Decision Analysis has been made possible through a careful reconstruction of the operating procedure regarding the use of the press applying an using an ad hoc Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) template. The system of the study was described by IDDA in a random sequence of events where the given values of probability derived from the THERP model for human error and from the method of calculation set out by the standard technique (EN IEC 62061) for dangerous failures of safety devices. This integrated approach has allowed to take into account human factors with greater detail and in a quantitative way describing where and why the operator can cheat or <b>by-pass</b> the safety <b>system,</b> unlike other methods of risk assessment where you could only identify where the man-machine interface should be analyzed in dept...|$|R
