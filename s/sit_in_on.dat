We usually have Big Jim Wright <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.|$|E
5|$|The MAUD Committee reports {{urged the}} {{co-operation}} with the United States should be {{continued in the}} research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once {{he returned to the}} United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.|$|E

25|$|Cuomo {{returned}} to Harvard but {{took a break}} to focus on songwriting. He gathered Boston-area musicians and rehearsed new material, including possible songs for the next Weezer album. The group had several different line-ups and played several shows at local clubs, including the band's first show at T.T. the Bear's on October 8, 1997. Future Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh was a constant of the group's evolving lineups. Wilson eventually flew to Boston to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> drums. The Boston songs were abandoned, but live recordings of the Boston shows are traded on the internet.|$|E
25|$|After Evita Perón's {{death on}} 26 July 1952, Borges {{received}} {{a visit from}} two policemen, who ordered him to put up two portraits of the ruling couple on the premises of SADE. Borges indignantly refused, calling it a ridiculous demand. The policemen replied that he would soon face the consequences. The Justicialist Party placed Borges under 24-hour surveillance and sent policemen to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> his lectures; in September they ordered SADE to be permanently closed down. Like much of the Argentine opposition to Perón, SADE had become marginalized due to persecution by the State, and very few active members remained.|$|E
25|$|Canned Heat {{was started}} within the {{community}} of blues collectors. Bob Hite had been trading blues records since his early teens and his house in Topanga Canyon was a meeting place for people interested in music. In 1965 some blues devotees there decided to form a jug band and started rehearsals. The initial configuration comprised Bob Hite as vocalist, Alan Wilson on bottleneck guitar, Mike Perlowin on lead guitar, Stu Brotman on bass and Keith Sawyer on drums. Perlowin and Sawyer dropped out within a few days, so guitarist Kenny Edwards (a friend of Wilson) stepped in to replace Perlowin, and Ron Holmes agreed to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> drums until they could find a permanent drummer.|$|E

500|$|The musicians {{returned}} to Studio A the following day, when they devoted {{almost the entire}} session to recording [...] "Like a Rolling Stone". Present on this occasion was Al Kooper, a young musician invited by Wilson to observe, but who wanted {{to play on the}} session. Kooper managed to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the session; despite never having played electric organ before, Kooper improvised an organ riff that, critics such as Greil Marcus and Mark Polizzotti have argued, is a crucial element of the recording. The fourth take was ultimately selected as the master, but Dylan and the band recorded eleven more takes.|$|E

He hung out at the Los Angeles City College, perusing records, books and old sheet music in its library.

500|$|During the {{recording}} of The Wall, Waters, Gilmour and Mason became increasingly dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution to the album. Gilmour said that Wright [...] "hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little" [...] and this was why he [...] "got the boot". According to Mason, [...] "Rick's contribution was to turn up and <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'." [...] Waters commented: [...] " [...] {{was not prepared to}} cooperate in making the record... it was agreed by everybody... either [...] can have a long battle or [...] can agree to... finish making the album, keep [...] full share... {{but at the end of}} it [...] leave quietly. Rick agreed." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1975, at age 22, Schuur {{auditioned for}} drummer/bandleader Ed Shaughnessy. Escorted by her twin brother, she went {{backstage}} {{to seek out}} Shaughnessy after he had finished a concert in Seattle with bandleader Doc Severinsen. Shaughnessy said, [...] "Doc's concert was over and this young blind girl comes in and sits down at the Fender Rhodes keyboard and starts singing the blues. Well, my hair stood on end!" [...] He hired her to be the vocalist in his orchestra, [...] "Energy Force". Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie heard her and, in 1979, invited her to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> a set at the Monterey Jazz Festival. According to Dave Gelly in his 2002 book, Stan Getz: Nobody Else But Me, Schuur's performance created [...] "a minor sensation".|$|E

500|$|Later, Kielbania heard jazz-trained flautist John Payne for {{the first}} time while sitting in on a jam session. He invited Payne to the club where he played with Morrison, hoping Morrison would invite him to join them. After {{allowing}} Payne to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> one performance, Morrison extended an invitation which Payne accepted. The trio of Payne, Kielbania, and Morrison continued performing for four months. [...] In the weeks they played at the Catacombs, they began to develop the template for Astral Weeks. It was around this time that Warner Bros. Records approached Morrison, hoping to sign him to their roster. Presumably their interest focused on his prior success with [...] "Brown-Eyed Girl", [...] not on Morrison's current acoustic work. Regardless, their interest allowed Morrison to return to the recording studio.|$|E
500|$|He {{originally}} did {{not want}} to make sports his career. On the day that Magic Johnson announced his HIV-positive status in 1991, the 11-year-old Gasol, who had heard the news in school, decided {{that he wanted to be}} a doctor and find a cure for AIDS. He enrolled in medical school at the University of Barcelona, but left as his basketball career at FC Barcelona advanced. He remains strongly interested in medicine. Gasol regularly visits Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, a standard stop for athletes making charitable visits in the L.A. area, but does not limit his business to visiting young patients. On one visit, he asked a group of doctors well-informed questions about their treatment of children with scoliosis. In April 2010, Gasol was scheduled to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> a spinal surgery, wearing surgical scrubs, with Dr. David Skaggs, the hospital's chief of orthopedic surgery.

Exposed to music at an early age, he studied classical flute with Walfrid Kujala, of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Butterfield was also athletic and was offered a track scholarship to Brown University. [...] However, a knee injury and a growing interest in blues music sent him in a different direction. He met guitarist and singer songwriter Nick Gravenites, who shared an interest in authentic blues music. [...] By the late 1950s, they were visiting blues clubs in Chicago, where musicians such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, and Otis Rush, encouraged them and occasionally let them <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> jam sessions. The pair were soon performing as Nick and Paul in college-area coffee houses.|$|E

500|$|West's musical {{career has}} been defined by {{frequent}} stylistic shifts and different musical approaches. Asked about his early musical inspirations in 2008, he named artists such as A Tribe Called Quest, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, George Michael, LL Cool J, Phil Collins and Madonna. Other music figures West has invoked as inspirations include Puff Daddy, David Bowie, Miles Davis and Gil-Scott Heron. West was formatively mentored by Chicago producer No I.D., who introduced him to hip hop production in the early 1990s, allowing a teenage West to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> recording sessions. Early in his career, West pioneered a style of production dubbed [...] "chipmunk soul" [...] which utilized pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul and R songs, along with his own drums and instrumentation. His first major release featuring his trademark soulful vocal sampling style was [...] "This Can't Be Life", a track from Jay-Z's [...] West has noted Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA as an influence on his style.|$|E
500|$|In September 2010, it was {{announced}} Weinberg would {{not be part of}} the show, now named Conan; Jimmy Vivino took over leadership of that band, with Wormworth replacing Weinberg full-time on drums.

[...] Weinberg subsequently acknowledged that [...] "we both wanted to go in different directions," [...] but both looked forward to Weinberg occasionally stopping by to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the new show. Weinberg said his health was better than ever but that the [...] "life-changing experience emotionally and spiritually" [...] of the surgery, a desire to remain in New Jersey with his family, and an interest in exploring new musical directions had all played a role in his departure from O'Brien.|$|E
