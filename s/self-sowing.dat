5|$|Modern cottage gardens include countless {{regional}} and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or native plants {{not seen in}} the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with their full fragrance and lush foliage, {{continue to be a}} cottage-garden mainstay — along with modern disease-resistant varieties that retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also common, as are the <b>self-sowing</b> annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens.|$|E
6000|$|If {{there had}} been in the Christian idea the mysterious <b>self-sowing</b> quality so {{constantly}} claimed for it, how came it that in the Eastern part of the Empire it was as powerless for spiritual or moral regeneration as it was for political health and vitality, while in the Western part it became the organ of the most important of all the past transformations of the civilised world? Is not the difference to be explained by the difference in the surrounding medium, and what is the effect of such an explanation upon the supernatural claims of the Christian idea? Does such an explanation reduce that idea to the rank of one of the historic forces, which arise and operate and expand themselves in accordance with strictly natural conditions? The Christianity of the East was probably as degraded a form of belief, as lowering for human character, and as mischievous to social wellbeing, as has ever been held by civilised peoples. Yet the East, strangely enough, was the great home and nursery of all that is most distinctive in the constituent ideas of the Christian faith. Why, in meditating on Christianity, are we to shut our eyes to the depravation that overtook it when placed amid unfavourable social conditions, and to confine our gaze to the brighter qualities which it developed in the healthier atmosphere of the West? ...|$|E
50|$|In {{temperate}} climates, {{the plant}} is <b>self-sowing,</b> but the seeds are not viable after long storage, and germination rates are low after a year.|$|E
50|$|Like many foxgloves, {{this plant}} is often grown in gardens, where it readily <b>self-sows</b> and can become weedy.|$|R
5000|$|Isotoma axillaris Lindl., Rock Isotome, a short lived {{species from}} eastern Australia. It is {{poisonous}} to humans. It readily <b>self-sows</b> in a greenhouse environment.|$|R
50|$|The seed-like {{fruit is}} narrow with a pappus of several pointed scales (giving {{rise to the}} common name 'Spanish Needles' for P. arida). These plants <b>self-sow</b> freely.|$|R
50|$|Several {{species are}} grown as {{ornamental}} plants in gardens. Nigella damascena has been grown in English cottage gardens since Elizabethan times, commonly called love-in-a-mist. Nigella hispanica is a taller species with larger blue flowers, red stamens, and grey leaves. Nigella seeds are <b>self-sowing</b> if the seed pods {{are left to}} mature.|$|E
50|$|Freesia laxa is {{sufficiently}} hardy to be grown outdoors {{in all but}} the coldest parts of the British Isles. It requires a light soil and a sunny position. In colder areas, the corms can be lifted and dried off during the winter. It can be propagated by dividing groups of corms or by seed. It can be somewhat invasive through <b>self-sowing</b> when grown in favourable conditions.|$|E
50|$|Cosmos bipinnatus is {{considered}} a half-hardy annual, although plants may reappear via <b>self-sowing</b> for several years. The plant height varies from 2 - 4 ft. The cultivated varieties appear in shades of pink and purple as well as white. Its foliage is finely cut into threadlike segments. When flowering, the plant can become top heavy. This problem is alleviated when grown in groups, as the bipinnate leaves interlock, and the colony supports itself.|$|E
50|$|Sisyrinchium bellum prefers some {{moisture}} and good drainage, but will tolerate summer dryness. It can be propagated by seed, and it <b>self-sows.</b> It {{can also be}} propagated by division of its rhizomes, and the flower stems can be rooted. It is moderately hardy and will tolerate temperatures down to 20 F.|$|R
50|$|Has {{a lovely}} {{fragrance}} {{in the evening}} to night. Most varieties bloom late-afternoon to evening. Seedlings do best when gradually introduced to outdoor environment {{over the course of}} a week. Plants tend to <b>self-sow.</b> (Color may be the original or occasionally several colors on one plant).Deadhead spent flower stalks for best blooming results.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} {{particularly}} suited to garden planting and landscaping purposes. As an ornamental plant, it is hardy to about -5 C, succeeding outdoors in the milder areas of Britain where it thrives and often <b>self-sows</b> in Cornish and Scottish west coast gardens. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|R
50|$|This {{species of}} Cosmos is {{considered}} a half-hardy annual, although plants may re-appear via <b>self-sowing</b> for several years. Its foliage is opposite and pinnately divided. The plant height varies from 1-7 feet (30-210 cm). The original and its cultivars appear in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It is especially popular in Korea and Japan, where it is often seen in mass plantings along roadsides, following an initiative pursued by the Korean-Japanese botanist Woo Jang-choon.|$|E

50|$|D. superbus is {{a popular}} garden plant and several cultivars and hybrids have been selected, with flower colour varying from white to red or purple, usually with a green centre. It thrives in {{ordinary}} to dry soil in full sun; partial shade is preferred in hot climates. It is <b>self-sowing</b> and can be propagated by seed, by division of the roots, layering of the stems or cuttings from growing shoots. Deadheading (removing spent blossoms so that seed heads can not form) extends the blooming period. The flowers sit atop stems approximately 25-45 cm tall, while the gray-green linear leaves form a mat {{at the base of}} the plant 20-30 cm wide. Because D. superbus is low to the ground, those who want to enjoy its fragrance find planting it in groups desirable.|$|E
5000|$|Large {{numbers of}} hybrids are {{available}} for the garden, since the European A. vulgaris was hybridized with other European and North American varieties. Aquilegia species are very interfertile, and will <b>self-sow.</b> Some varieties are short-lived so are better treated as biennials. The following hybrid cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: ...|$|R
5000|$|Althaea rosea is {{variously}} {{described as}} a biennial (having a two-year life cycle), as an annual, or as a short-lived perennial. It frequently <b>self-sows,</b> which may create a perception that the plants are perennial. The plant may flower during its first year when sown early. [...] It will grow {{in a wide range}} of soils, and can easily reach a height of about 8 ft.|$|R
50|$|What {{is usually}} sold at most every {{conventional}} nursery or garden center is the similar sweetautumn clematis, Clematis terniflora, from Japan {{that is much}} more rampant growing, that bears heavier clouds of white flowers with a stronger fragrance, that has simple leaves not compound with 3 leaflets, that as one plant <b>self-sows</b> around a lot, and becomes an invasive plant when escaping cultivation in North America.|$|R
50|$|Culver's root is {{cultivated}} as {{a garden}} flower in the Eastern and Central United States around its native range. Most native plant nurseries commonly sell this easy and adaptable perennial. Even some conventional nurseries sell this plant, {{though it is}} not common yet in American landscapes and gardens. It grows in full sun to part shade and most any well-drained soil. It is easy to dig up, divide, and reset like a good number of standard perennials if they get too large or crowded. It stays as an upright clump and does not spread far. Plants usually stay upright and don't fall over much and don't need staking; however, it is possible for an older clump to do so and it can be pruned down in late May or dug up, divided, and reset to avoid such. This plant does do some <b>self-sowing</b> with its tiny seed. The Lurie Garden in downtown Chicago, Illinois, uses the cultivar of 'Diane' because it is more compact growing.|$|E
40|$|Cliff {{sides are}} extreme habitats, often {{sheltering}} {{a rich and}} unique flora. One example is the dioecious herb Borderea chouardii (Dioscoreaceae), which is a Tertiary, tropical relict, occurring only on two adjacent vertical cliffs in the world. We studied its reproductive biology, which in some aspects is extreme, especially the unusual double mutualistic role of ants as both pollinators and dispersers. We made a 2 -year pollination census and four years of seed-dispersal experiments, recording flower visitors and dispersal rates. Fruit and seed set, <b>self-sowing</b> of seeds, seedling recruitment, and fate of seedlings from seeds sowed by different agents were scored {{over a period of}} 17 years. The ants Lasius grandis and L. cinereus were the main pollinators, whereas another ant Pheidole pallidula dispersed seeds. Thus ants functioned as double mutualists. Two thirds of all new seedlings came from self-sown seeds, and 1 / 3 was dispersed by ants, which gathered the seeds with their oil-rich elaiosome. Gravity played a minor role to dispersal. Both ant dispersal and <b>self-sowing</b> resulted in the same survival rate of seedlings. A double mutualism is a risky reproductive strategy, but B. chouardii buffers that by an unusual long-term demographic stability (some individuals exceed 300 years in lifespan) and its presence in a climatically very stable habitat, inaccessible to large herbivores. Such a combination of traits and habitat properties may explain the persistence of this relict species...|$|E
40|$|The first {{exotic species}} of Juglandaceae family at Peter the Great Botanic Garden of the Komarov Botanical Institute RAS in Saint-Petersburg was Juglans regia - {{mentioned}} at M. M. Terechovskij ‘s Catalogue in 1796. Twenty five taxa from 4 genera {{have been tested}} since then: Carya - 6, Juglans - 14, Platycarya - 1, Pterocarya - 4. There are 14 taxa from 3 genera in modern collection: Carya - 2, Juglans - 9, Pterocarya - 3. All species besides Carya cordiformis and Juglans nigra produce fruits. Four species of Juglans (J. ailanthifolia, J. cinerea, J. cordiformis, J. mandshurica) and its hybrids produce <b>self-sowing.</b> There are 2 species, Juglans ailanthifolia and Pterocarya pterocarpa, which are included into the Red Data Book of Russian Federation (2008). They need In situ and Ex situ conservation and may be recommended for Saint-Petersburg’s city planting. There are considerable prospects for both repeated introduction (Carya illinoensis) and primary introduction (Juglans sigillata) ...|$|E
50|$|Some of the Lupins {{created by}} Russell were named after {{his friends and}} neighbours. These include the 'Mrs Micklethwaite', for the {{employer}} who originally inspired his work, and the 'Mrs Noel Terry' named after Kathleen Terry of the Terry's chocolate-manufacturing family. At one time there were 152 named varieties but {{in the years after}} Russell's death many of these were either lost to Cucumber mosaic virus or allowed to <b>self-sow</b> enabling them to revert to their original colours.|$|R
5000|$|Native North American coreopsis can {{be found}} in two {{habitats}} In the wild they {{can be found}} growing along roadsides and open fields throughout the Eastern United States and Canada. In this environment the plant will <b>self-sow.</b> They can grow also in a garden as a border plant or in a container. Here the plant prefers well-drained soil. Remove spent flowers so that the plant does not become weedy. Using the USDA Hardiness Zones, will identify what soil and climate is preferred for different cultivars or species.|$|R
50|$|Some species {{commonly}} {{escape from}} the garden. B. davidii in particular is a great coloniser of dry open ground; in urban areas in the United Kingdom, it often <b>self-sows</b> on waste ground or old masonry, where it grows into a dense thicket, and is listed as an invasive species in many areas. It is frequently seen beside railway lines, on derelict factory sites and, {{in the aftermath of}} World War II, on urban bomb sites. This earned it the popular nickname of 'the bombsite plant' among the war-time generation.|$|R
40|$|Cucurbit crops host a {{range of}} serious sap-sucking insect pests, {{including}} silverleaf whitefly (SLW) and aphids, which potentially represent considerable risk to the Australian horticulture industry. These pests are extremely polyphagous with a wide host range. Chemical control is made difficult due to resistance and pollution, and other side-effects are associated with insecticide use. Consequently, there is much interest in maximising the role of biological control {{in the management of}} these sap-sucking insect pests. This study aimed to evaluate companion cropping alongside cucurbit crops in a tropical setting as a means to increase the populations of beneficial insects and spiders so as to control the major sap-sucking insect pests. The Population of beneficial and harmful insects, with a focus on SLW and aphids, and other invertebrates were sampled weekly oil four different crops which could be used for habitat manipulation: Goodbug Mix (GBM; a proprietary seed Mixture including <b>self-sowing</b> annual and perennial herbaceous flower species); lablab (Lablab purpureus L. Sweet); lucerne (Medicago sativa L.); and niger (Guizotia abyssinica (L. f.) Cass.). Lablab hosted the highest numbers of beneficial insects (larvae and adults of lacewing (Mallada signata (Schneider)), ladybird beetles (Coccinella transversalis Fabricius) and spiders) while GBM hosted the highest numbers of European bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) and spiders. Lucerne and niger showed little promise in hosting beneficial insects, but lucerne hosted significantly more spiders (double the numbers) than niger. Lucerne hosted significantly more of the harmful insect species of aphids (Aphis gossypii (Glover)) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer)) and heliothis (Heliothis armigera Hubner). Niger hosted significantly more vegetable weevils (Listroderes difficillis (Germar)) than the other three species. Therefore, lablab and GBM appear to be viable options to grow within cucurbits or as field boundary crops to attract and increase beneficial insects and spiders for the control of sap-sucking insect pests. Use of these bio-control strategies affords the opportunity to minimise pesticide usage and the risks associated with pollution...|$|E
500|$|Popular {{flowers in}} the {{traditional}} cottage garden included florist's flowers which were grown by enthusiasts—such as violets, pinks, and primroses—and those grown with a more practical purpose. For example, the calendula, grown today almost entirely for its bright orange flowers, was primarily valued for eating, for adding color to butter and cheese, for adding smoothness to soups and stews, and {{for all kinds of}} healing salves and preparations. Like many old cottage garden annuals and herbs, it freely <b>self-sowed,</b> making it easier to grow and share. Other popular cottage garden annuals included violets, pansies, stocks, and mignonette.|$|R
50|$|It is sold by a {{good number}} of native plant {{nurseries}} for prairie or native meadow restoration or for gardens and landscapes. Some large conventional nurseries also sell it for gardens and landscapes. It does best with full sun and well-drained soil. Slightly acidic to slightly alkaline soil reaction (pH) is best. It can die from root rot if the soil stays wet or moist for too long. Once planted it is best left undisturbed and never dug up and reset as with many perennials because it develops a large taproot and other thick, fleshy roots. It often <b>self-sows</b> a little to a good amount in gardens.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant is}} used in gardens for the aesthetically {{pleasing}} and fragrant flowers which smell like lilac. A good number of both native and conventional nurseries sell some, yet it is still an uncommon plant in most American gardens and landscapes. 'Venusta' {{is the most common}} cultivar that bears a good bright rose-pink color. Its flowers are a good source of food for pollinating insects. It grows in full sun or part-shade and needs moist to draining wet soil; it suffers from drought. It sends up its sort of maple-like foliage early in spring. It spreads by rhizomes, underground stems, so it becomes a spreading clump that eventually becomes a mass. It is easy to dig up and reset like many perennials when it gets too big and crowded or spreads to much. It does <b>self-sow</b> some to a lot in gardens. If it starts to look poorly from drought, one can easily prune it down and it will grow back some to look better.|$|R
