5000|$|Due to the narrowness of the alleyway, {{the fire}} spread quickly to {{adjoining}} buildings, first affecting those {{to the east}} of Fishmarket Close and later spreading along the roofs of the Royal Mile through embers carried by a southwesterly breeze. By midnight, four tenements were ablaze as the fire advanced towards the Cowgate. The Old Assembly Hall at the centre of the fire (which had given its name to the close) was destroyed during the night. Around midday on Tuesday, 16 November, the spire on the Tron Kirk caught fire and molten lead began to pour from its roof. Although firemen succeeded in reaching the roof of the church, the fierceness of the blaze forced them back.At 10pm on Tuesday evening a <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreak</b> occurred in buildings on the corner of High Street and Parliament Close (renamed Parliament Square after the subsequent rebuilding of the affected area). This blaze started {{on the top floor of}} an eleven-story building overlooking the Cowgate. This led to claims of divine intervention and punishment from God, as well as deliberate fire-raising. It was more likely the result of a still smouldering ember. This second phase of the fire began to consume the buildings on the east side of Parliament Close. Efforts focused on saving the adjacent Parliament Hall and Law Courts, and stopping the fire leaping to St Giles Cathedral. A young David Octavius Hill made watercolour sketches during this second phase, viewing the fire from the west. By 5am on Wednesday 19 November, the fire was described as [...] "grand and terrific". The building housing the Edinburgh Courant collapsed and the fire continued to spread down Conn's Close towards the Cowgate. Due mainly to a downpour of rain, the conflagration was brought under control by Wednesday evening, although small outbreaks continued and final smouldering did not cease until Friday, 21 November. Over the following days, engineers from the castle and navy were employed to pull down the highly unsafe remnants of buildings left precariously balanced along the closes.|$|E

40|$|In many cities, human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) - 1 seroprevalence among drug injectors stabilizes at 30 – 70 % for many years without <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> that increase seroprevalence by 15 % or more. The authors considered how HIV- 1 incidence can remain moderate at seroprevalence levels that would give maximum incidence. Previously suggested answers include behavioral risk reduction and network saturation within high-risk subgroups. Among 767 drug injectors studied in 1991 – 1993, {{during a period of}} stable high seroprevalence in New York City, risk behaviors remained common, and networks were far from saturated. The authors suggest a different network-based mechanism: in stable high-prevalence situations, the relatively small sizes of subnetworks of linked seronegatives (within larger networks containing both infected and uninfected persons) may limit infectious outbreaks. Any primary infection outbreak would probably be limited to members of connected subcomponents of seronegatives, and the largest such subcomponent in the study contained only 18 members (of 415 seronegatives). Research and mathematical modeling should study conditions that may affect the size and stability of subcomponents of seronegatives. Finally, if the existence of small, connected components of seronegatives prevents <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> this protection may weaken, and vulnerability to new outbreaks increase, if HIV- 1 seroprevalence falls.

RESULTS: The outbreaks had a median of 13. 5 confirmed cases, and mean proportion of 0. 195 secondary cases.

Secondary case rates differed statistically significantly between modes of secondary and primary transmission and median age categories (all p < 0. 001), but not between countries (p = 0. 23). Statistically significantly higher rates of secondary transmission were found in outbreaks with a median age < 6 years and those with secondary transmission via person to person spread in nurseries. No statistically significant interactions were found between country, mode of transmission and age category.

40|$|Background Pesticide {{application}} {{is the dominant}} control method for arthropod pests in broad-acre arable systems. In Australia, organophosphate pesticides are often applied either prophylactically, or reactively, including at higher concentrations, to control crop establishment pests such as false wireworms and earth mite species. Organophosphates are reported to be disruptive to beneficial species, such as natural enemies, but {{this has not been}} widely assessed in Australian systems. Neither has the risk that <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> may occur if the natural enemy community composition or function is altered. Methods We examine the abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrate communities in an arable field over successive seasons under rotation; barley, two years of wheat, then canola. Two organophosphates (chlorpyrifos and methidathion) were initially applied at recommended rates. After no discernible impact on target pest species, the rate for chlorpyrifos was doubled to elicit a definitive response to a level used at establishment when seedling damage is observed. Invertebrates were sampled using pitfalls and refuge traps throughout the experiments. We applied measures of community diversity, principal response curves and multiple generalised linear modelling techniques to understand the changes in pest and natural enemy communities. Results There was large variability due to seasonality and crop type. Nevertheless, both pest (e. g., mites and aphids) and natural enemy (e. g., predatory beetles) invertebrate communities were significantly affected by application of organophosphates. When the rate of chlorpyrifos was increased there was a {{reduction in the number of}} beetles that predate on slug populations. Slugs displayed opposite trends to many of the other target pests, and actually increased in numbers under the higher rates of chlorpyrifos in comparison to the other treatments. Slug numbers in the final rotation of canola resulted in significant yield loss regardless of pesticide application. Discussion Organophosphates are a cost-effective tool to control emergent pests in broad-acre arable systems in Australia. We found risks associated with prophylactic application in fields under rotation between different crop types and significant changes to the community of pests and natural enemy. Disrupting key predators reduced effective suppression of other pests, such as slugs, and may lead to <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> when rotating with susceptible crops such as canola. Such non-target impacts are rarely documented when studies focus on single-species, rather than community assessments. This study represents a single demonstration of how pesticide application can lead to <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> and reinforces the need for studies that include a longer temporal component to understand this process further...|$|R
40|$|With {{a growing}} number of reports showing <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> of spider mites {{following}} systemic applications of imidacloprid, a study was designed to test the indirect effects of this insecticide on natural enemies of spider mites. We exposed two predators, Chrysoperla rufilabris and Stethorus punctillum, to mites that were reared on boxwoods and elms treated with imidacloprid and examined prey consumption, predator mobility and mortality. Mites reared on treated foliage were extremely toxic to predators, eliciting sharp reductions in feeding, locomotion, and longevity. These findings document that non-target pests feeding on plants treated with imidacloprid cause lethal and sublethal responses in natural enemies. We discuss implications on the compatibility of imidacloprid with IPM practices and infer impacts on generalist and specialist natural enemies...|$|R
40|$|Imidacloprid is {{a widely}} used {{neonicotinoid}} insecticide with high efficacy and long residual activity, and it is frequently applied to manage insect pests in urban landscapes. Recent reports of <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> of spider mites after imidacloprid applications have prompted research endeavors to explain {{the driving force of}} the abrupt increases in abundance of mites. In this research, I documented outbreaks of spider mites in field and greenhouse experiments, and explored the three main mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the outbreaks: elimination of natural enemies, direct stimulation of spider mite fecundity and changes in plant quality, specifically, changes in defense pathways. To this end, I examined if the outbreaks occur in field and greenhouse experiments, and tested if imidacloprid applications disrupted communities of beneficial insects and caused increased reproductive performance of spider mites in two woody ornamental systems, elm trees and boxwood shrubs. Additionally, I used a model organism, tomato plants, to address the hypothesis of altered plant defenses in plants treated with imidacloprid. I found overwhelming evidence that outbreaks of spider mites occur consistently following applications of imidacloprid in landscape and greenhouse experiments. Moreover, surveys of arthropods on elms and boxwoods showed no evidence of disruption of a key predator of spider mites that could explain the outbreaks. Importantly, I found a plant-mediated effect of imidacloprid on fecundity of spider mites, while {{there was no evidence that}} the insecticide applied directly to the mites exerted the same effect on their reproductive performance. Lastly, two genes involved in jasmonic and salicylic acid showed a differential expression in tomatoes treated with imidacloprid, indicating that it affected plants' defense pathways in ways that could render plants more suitable for spider mites. This research demonstrated that changes in quality of plants brought about by imidacloprid seem to be the driving mechanism of <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> of spider mites...|$|R

Principal Findings: The strain transmission properties of blood transfusion associated vCJD infection show remarkable similarities to the strain of vCJD associated with transmission from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Conclusions: Although it has been hypothesized that adaptation of the BSE agent through secondary passage in humans may result in a greater risk of onward transmission due to an increased virulence of the agent for humans, our data presented here in two murine models suggest no significant alterations to transmission efficiency of the agent followin...|$|E

40|$|Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) is a {{major threat}} to the poultry {{industry}} worldwide. In developing countries backyard poultry production is often an important livelihood activity for women who use the additional income for unexpected household expenses. The disease can therefore have significant social impacts. To evaluate different options governments and public health authorities could employ to reduce the negative effects of HPAI outbreaks, it is necessary to have a means for simulating outbreaks of the disease. Models can aggregate the available information about the disease dynamics for conducting such simulations. The underlying assumption of the model we propose is that the fastest way for HPAI to spread is through transport of infected material or chickens. Undoubtedly, other infection routes, like direct transmission between neighbouring villages or disease spread by migrating birds, {{play a role in the}} disease dynamics, too, but these are likely to be slower than transport of infectious material through trade. The speed of transport depends on the topography of the landscape: transport will be faster along roads and slower off roads. In the model, the landscape is divided into quadratic areas termed grid cells. Grid cells contain information about the poultry population. Each grid cell is assigned a travel friction, which is the time it takes to cross the grid cell with the appropriate means of travel, i. e. by truck on roads and on foot off-road. The travel friction is computed from data on road type, vegetation, slope and other landscape features. The model calculates which area can be reached within 12 hours travel time for each grid cell. Data of past outbreaks of HPAI in Nigeria were used to validate the model. The data were also used to calculate the expected number of <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> resulting from an infected farm during the period the farm is infective.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} biological disturbances on a tropical coral reef is a population outbreak of the fecund, corallivorous crown-of-thorns sea star, Acanthaster planci. Although the factors that trigger an initial outbreak may vary, successive outbreaks within and across regions are assumed to spread via the planktonic larvae released from a primary outbreak. This <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreak</b> hypothesis is predominantly based on the high dispersal potential of A. planci and the assertion that outbreak populations (a rogue subset of the larger population) are genetically more similar to each other than they are to low-density non-outbreak populations. Here we use molecular techniques to evaluate the spatial scale at which A. planci outbreaks can propagate via larval dispersal in the central Pacific Ocean by inferring the location and severity of gene flow restrictions from the analysis of mtDNA control region sequence (656 specimens, 17 non-outbreak and six outbreak locations, six archipelagos, and three regions). Substantial regional, archipelagic, and subarchipelagic-scale genetic structuring of A. planci populations indicate that larvae rarely realize their dispersal potential and outbreaks in the central Pacific do not spread across the expanses of open ocean. On a finer scale, genetic partitioning was detected within two of three islands with multiple sampling sites. The finest spatial structure was detected at Pearl & Hermes Atoll, between the lagoon and forereef habitats (< 10 km). Despite using a genetic marker capable of revealing subtle partitioning, we found no evidence that outbreaks were a rogue genetic subset of a greater population. Overall, outbreaks that occur at similar times across population partitions are genetically independent and likely due to nutrient inputs and similar climatic and ecological conditions that conspire to fuel plankton blooms...|$|E

40|$|Detection of {{classical}} swine fever virus (CSFV) {{can be achieved by}} a range of assays of which the most commonly used are: immunohistochemical and virus culture techniques. New developments have enabled the detection of viral proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and the detection of the viral genome by RT- PCR. So far, laboratory findings show that the latter assays may supplement or replace the conventional techniques in the near future. The detection of serum antibody against structural and non-structural proteins of CSFV has been improved by developments in recombinant DNA techniques and has lead to a range of ELISAs. Although the characteristics of these ELISAs are excellent, positive results still need to be confirmed in the virus neutralization test. The available amount of sequence data enables diagnosticians to type strains of CSFV as different by comparing several parts of the genome. In some cases, this can provide conclusive evidence if a primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreak</b> has been detected. Increased efforts focused on the retrieval of relevant data on the introduction of CSFV in a pig holding and the spread of CSFV in- and between pig holding(s) has generated more insight into the epizootiology of the disease. A successful control and eradication programme for {{classical swine fever}} (CSF) can consist of zoosanitary measures and/or vaccination. The latter can compromise the export of live pigs and pig products considerably unless marker vaccines have been used. Several studies were performed to determine the efficacy of an E 2 subunit vaccine and live recombinant vaccine candidates. Firstly, we determined the 95 % protective dose of an E 2 subunit vaccine at 32 μg E 2 per dosage after a single application. Further studies with a single administration of the subunit vaccine showed that: the vaccine was stable for a prolonged period after production, was able to reduce horizontal and vertical transmission of CSFV among vaccinated pigs, and provided protection for at least 6 months. An Erns antibody discriminatory assay was developed for use in combination with the subunit vaccine. Evaluation of the E(rns) ELISA showed that the sensitivity of the assay was lower than but that the specificity was equal to that of existing antibody assays. Two live recombinant marker vaccines were evaluated for the induction of clinical protection and reduction of transmission of CSFV shortly after vaccination.

In this study, we show that the evidence for the nutrient enrichment causation hypothesis is strongly based on a large number of recent studies in the GBR.

40|$|The {{demand for}} locally sourced hops from Northeastern microbreweries began the recent {{resurgence}} in local hop production. The farming community has increased acreage and improved {{the quality of}} hops grown and processed in the Northeast region {{over the past five}} years. There was a sharp {{increase in the number of}} Northeast hop producers from six in 2009 to over 175 in 2014. Hop growers in the Northeast are new to the crop and have limited experience with pest identification and management. This dissertation encompasses three research projects that were conducted over the 2012 - 2014 growing seasons. These projects were the first critical steps taken to develop arthropod integrated pest management (IPM) tactics for Northeastern hop growers. First, the arthropod community in seven Vermont hop yards was evaluated. The objectives of Chapter 2 are to 1) present current hop pest biology and management strategies, 2) report the phenology of arthropod pests observed over three growing seasons, 3) report abundance and peak date for each pest, and 4) document natural enemy abundance in Vermont hop yards. The survey indicates that in cool, wet seasons hop aphid (Phorodon humuli Schrank) is expected to be a pest of concern. Two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) is expected to be a pest of concern in hot, dry conditions. Potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae Harris) is an unpredictable pest of special concern for first year hop plants. When hop aphid or potato leafhopper are sprayed for with broad-spectrum insecticide, two-spotted spider mite <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreak</b> can be expected. Second, the abundance of major arthropod pests and their natural enemy groups were evaluated under drive row flowering cover crop treatments. The objectives of this study were to 1) measure the effect of cover crops on natural enemy group abundance, 2) measure the effect of cover crops on the three major Northeastern hop pests, and 3) measure the effect of cover crop presence on hop yield and quality. Natural enemy groups and pests were positively correlated yet cover crop treatments had no significant effect on natural enemy abundance. Red clover cover crop treatments served as a trap crop for potato leafhopper. No significant difference in hop yield or quality was observed between flowering cover crop treatments. Finally, potato leafhopper is a documented but understudied regional pest of hops. The objectives of this study were to 1) measure the physiological response of eight hop cultivars to adult potato leafhopper feeding and 2) measure hop leaf recovery from potato leafhopper injury. Gas exchange (net photosynthesis and transpiration) and chlorophyll content were measured to quantify injury by adult potato leafhopper to first year hop leaves in field and greenhouse studies. Cultivars did not vary significantly in their physiological response to potato leafhopper feeding. Injury significantly reduced gas exchange measures in the field (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and greenhouse (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and when leafhoppers were removed, gas exchange was restored...|$|E
40|$|Occasional {{population}} {{outbreaks of}} the crown-of-thorns sea star, Acanthaster planci, {{are a major}} threat to coral reefs across the Indo-Pacific. The presumed association between the serial nature of these outbreaks and the long larval dispersal phase makes it important to estimate larval dispersal; many studies have examined the population genetic structure of A. planci for this purpose using different genetic markers. However, only a few have focused on reef-scale as well as archipelago-scale genetic structure and none has used a combination of different genetic markers with different effective population sizes. In our study, we used both mtDNA and microsatellite loci to examine A. planci population genetic structure at multiple spatial scales (from < 2 km to almost 300 km) within and among four islands of the Society Archipelago, French Polynesia. Our analysis detected no significant genetic structure based on mtDNA (global FST = &# 8722; 0. 007, P = 0. 997) and low levels of genetic structure using microsatellite loci (global FST = 0. 006, P = 0. 005). We found no significant isolation by distance patterns within the study area for either genetic marker. The overall genetically homogenized pattern found in both the mitochondrial and nuclear loci of A. planci in the Society Archipelago underscores the significant role of larval dispersal that may cause <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> as well as possible recent colonization in this area...|$|R

After providing exact and required information from questionnaires, the volunteers were randomly selected and 150 questionnaires were distributed between the two groups. 250 questionnaires (inventories) were statistically analyzed after collecting and monitoring the questionnaires. This study was performed by the technique of, correlation and analyzed by the use of descriptive and inferential statistical methods (K-square test). The results showed that: 1. The level of primary amenorrhea outbreak in athletes was meaningfully more than non-athletes (p 0. 05). 3. The level of <b>secondary</b> amenorrhea <b>outbreak</b> in non-athletes was observed more than athletes but the difference wasn’t meaningful between the two groups (p> 0. 05). 4.

From the contacts between infected herds and the serological findings shortly before depopulation, we estimated the week of virus introduction {{and the length of}} the period over which the herd emitted virus for each CSFV-infected herd. From these data, we estimated the infection-rate parameter β (the average number of herds infected by one infectious herd during one week) and the herd reproduction ratio, Rh (the average total number of <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> caused by one infectious herd, i. e. in its entire infectious period), using a SIR-model for different sets of CSF control measures. When Rh > 1, an epidemic continues to grow. On the other hand, when Rh 1. Consequently, the number of outbreaks continued to grow. After a number of additional measures were implemented, the value of Rh was reduced to 0. 5 and the epidemic came to an end. These measures included pre-emptive slaughter of herds that had been in contact with infected herds or were located near an infected herd, increased hygienic procedures, replacement of transports of pigs for welfare reasons by killing of young piglets and a breeding ban, and regional screening for CSF-infected herds by local veterinary practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A sudden {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} scrapie in Italy in 1997 was subsequently linked to the use of a potentially infected vaccine against contagious agalactia. The relative risk for the exposed farms ranged between 6 and 40. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the long-term impact of exposure to the potentially scrapie-contaminated vaccine on the Italian classical scrapie epidemic. We carried out a retrospective cohort study, fitting mixed-effects Poisson regression models, dividing national geographic areas into exposure categories on the basis of the vaccine circulation levels. We took into account the sensitivity of the surveillance system applied in the different areas. The population attributable fraction (PAF) was used to assess the impact on the total population of farms associated with the effect of circulation of the vaccine. The provinces where the vaccine was more often sold were noted to have a higher level of disease when compared to those provinces where the vaccine was sold less often (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 2. 7; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 1 - 6. 5). The population attributable fraction was high (68. 4 %). Standardization techniques allowed to account for the potential of geographical variability in the sensitivity of the Italian surveillance system. Although the number of the directly exposed farms was limited, an important long-term impact of the vaccine circulation could be quantified in terms of <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> likely due to the exchange of animals from directly exposed flocks. </p...|$|R

In particular, pest resistance build-up and <b>secondary</b> pest <b>outbreaks</b> have caused concern regarding the sustainability of this benefit. This paper analyses the effects and impact dynamics of Bt cotton adoption in China. Using six unique waves of panel data collected between 1999 and 2007, we show {{that the benefits of}} Bt cotton continue 10 years after it has been commercialised, albeit with evidence of a decline in the benefit since the early adoption period. Importantly, we also show that the benefit has been shared by both Bt and non-Bt cotton adopters...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cryptococcus neoformans is an obligate aerobic {{pathogenic}} yeast causing lung infection typically fol-lowed by {{spread to}} the central nervous system. During pathogenesis, it relies on well-established virulence factors. This review focuses on the emerging role of cryptococcal adaptation to hypoxia in pathogenesis. Methods and Results: We examined the MedLine database {{for information on the}} cryptococcal hypoxia response. While several recent papers describe components of two presumable hypoxia-sensing pathways including description of their target genes, a link of this system to the hypoxic tuning of proliferation is still missing. In addition, an inter-pretation of this knowledge in respect to the general picture of microbial pathogenesis is lacking. Conclusions: There seems to be a striking parallel between biofilm formation in bacteria, which results in chronic dormant infection with the potential for acute outbreaks, and the dormant state of primary infection followed by <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> in C. neoformans. We propose a hypothesis that cryptococcal response to hypoxia might be the driving force for developing a state of dormant infection which is characterized by slowed proliferation and extensive changes in transcriptome and phenotype. This state enables C. neoformans to survive in host and possibly develop life-threatening acute outbreaks later. Hence, conventional well-aerated planktonic culture is not a good in vitro model for studying the pathogenesis of infection and we advocate the development of a more adequate model. Our further conclusion is that the ability of the immune system and antifungal agents to cope with hypoxia-adapted cells is crucial for the successful eradication of cryptococcal infection...|$|R

We assessed the acceptability of alternative reduced-risk strategies by comparing their costs to those of pest management programs currently in use among San Joaquin County walnut growers. To do this, we analyzed data from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation’s legally mandated Pesticide Use Reports on actual pesticide applications for 3 years, from 2002 to 2004. While many factors other than cost influence growers’ pest management choices, we found that alternative strategies can be cost-competitive with conventional approaches, depending on the pest pressure and savings due to reductions in <b>secondary</b> pest <b>outbreaks...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) epidemic in Brazil is mainly {{driven by the}} subtype B pandemic lineage (BPANDEMIC), while Caribbean non-pandemic subtype B clades (BCAR) seem to account for a very low fraction of HIV-infections in this country. The molecular characteristics of the HIV- 1 subtype B strains disseminated in the Northern and Northeastern Brazilian regions, however, have not been explored so far. In this study, we estimate the prevalence of the HIV- 1 BPANDEMIC and BCAR clades across different Brazilian regions and we reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of dissemination of the major Brazilian BCAR clades. A total of 2, 682 HIV- 1 subtype B pol sequences collected from 21 different Brazilian states from the five country regions between 1998 and 2013 were analyzed. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses revealed that the BCAR strains reached 16 out 21 Brazilian states here analyzed. The BCAR clades comprise a low fraction (< 10 %) of subtype B infections in most Brazilian states analyzed, with exception of Roraima (41 %), Amazonas (14 %) and Maranhão (14 %). Bayesian phylogeographic analyses indicate that BCAR strains originally from the Hispaniola and Trinidad and Tobago were introduced at multiple times into different states from all Brazilian regions {{and a few of}} those strains, probably introduced into Roraima, Maranhão and São Paulo between the late 1970 s and the early 1980 s, established <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> in the Brazilian population. These results support that the HIV- 1 subtype B epidemics in some Brazilian states from the Northern and Northeastern regions display a unique molecular pattern characterized by the high prevalence of BCAR lineages, which probably reflects a strong epidemiological link with the HIV- 1 epidemics in the Caribbean region...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe HIV- 1 CRF 02 _AG clade is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} HIV variant in West and West-Central Africa and its detection outside Africa is increasingly common. Little is known, however, about the number and phylodynamics of major CRF 02 _AG lineages circulating worldwide. To this end, a total of 3170 HIV- 1 CRF 02 _AG-like pol sequences isolated around the world, {{over a period of}} 25 years (1989 to 2013), were analyzed using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian coalescent-based methods. Our results suggest that most of the current CRF 02 _AG diversity comes from the dissemination of a few founder strains out of Central Africa into West Africa and Cameroon between the late 1960 s and the middle 1980 s. The CRF 02 _AG strain introduced into West Africa established a large regional epidemic with low phylogeographic structure. This strain was also successfully disseminated out of the West African region and originated at least three large <b>secondary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> in Cameroon at around the late 1970 s, in the former Soviet Union (FSU) countries at around the late 1990 s, and in Bulgaria/Germany at around the early 2000 s. The CRF 02 _AG African lineages introduced into Cameroon remained mostly restricted to this country and its neighbors. Demographic reconstructions indicate that major CRF 02 _AG clades circulating in Africa exhibited a decline in growth rate since the middle 1980 s/ 1990 s, whereas CRF 02 _AG clades in Europe and the FSU countries continue to grow exponentially until the middle to late 2000 s. Substantial differences in the median estimated growth rate of the same CRF 02 _AG clade circulating in different regions (0. 63 – 2. 00 year− 1), and of different CRF 02 _AG clades circulating in the same country (0. 41 – 0. 75 year− 1) were observed. Thus, the cause of the epidemic outcome of the different HIV- 1 CRF 02 _AG lineages is probably multifactorial...|$|R
