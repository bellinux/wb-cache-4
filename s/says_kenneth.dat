40|$|Autonomy is the {{cornerstone}} of medical ethics, the guiding, and by far the most significant value to have influenced the evolution of contemporary medical law (Mason and Laurie, 2010). Given this status, the concept of autonomy is starting to attract (slowly, but ever more potently) the criticism that it is being deployed by academics and judges alike as something given, self-evident even. Autonomy’s function and meaning seem to be clear to everyone, and the caricature of an atomistic, rights-bearing patient tends to be accepted with no questions asked. In the pursuit of empowering patients and dimin-ishing the power of doctors, autonomy, <b>says</b> <b>Kenneth</b> Veitch (2007), has become a rheto-rical device, the very obviousness of its meaning rendering detailed inquiry superfluous. Against this backdrop, Charles Foster’s book provides a welcome addition to the litera-ture by confronting some of these premises in the context of English medical law. Choosing Life, Choosing Death is not about challenging the caricature of the atomistic, right-bearing patient itself – ‘everyone who is anyone knows what autonomy means, and it means the straightforward libertarianism of John Stuart Mill, Peter Singer and Julian Savulescu ’ (p. 3).

Before leaving for Paris, his friend Philip warns Bertha that Kenneth may not like the hurly-burly that {{she is trying to}} impose on him. However, they do get married. Philip comes back {{sometime}} later; Bertha has become very successful, whilst Kenneth has stopped writing. Philip is then to go to China for work; Kenneth is sad to hear from Harrison that Olympia is not the quiet town that it used to be, and muses that China must be quiet. Later, as Philip is {{on his way back to}} New York from Canton, he reads a letter from Harrison <b>saying</b> <b>Kenneth</b> has disappeared.

Her grudge is soon forgotten, however, when Rodney publishes the pictures he took of Izzy and posts them on flyers {{all over the}} school, making Izzy a laughingstock. She tries to talk to Izzy that night, but he ignores her, forcing her to give up. His father goes to his room the following day to leave the prize he had received {{when he won the}} Golden Gloves, and finds a pair of Rodney's flyers in the trash can. He immediately confronts Izzy about it, and Karin, despite her brother's objections, tells their father that he had joined Mary's team. She is ordered to her room, and Kenneth asks Izzy why he didn't tell him. Izzy angrily admits that his father was obsessed with boxing, that it was all that they talked about since his mother died, and that he no longer liked the sport, and only did it for him. He finishes by <b>saying</b> that <b>Kenneth</b> had no right to take his life away because he no longer had one, visibly shaking him. Izzy apologizes, and his father quietly accepts the apology before making an excuse to leave.|$|R
500|$|After {{learning}} Jenna's {{scheme to}} con Carvel, <b>Kenneth</b> <b>says</b> {{that it is}} wrong and illegal, and says that if Cookie Puss knew about this [...] "he'd tear us apart with his fangs." [...] This is a reference to Cookie Puss, an ice cream cake character created by Carvel in the 1970s. A television commentator opined that the Carvel storyline here referenced the 1973 caper film The Sting that starred Paul Newman and Robert Redford, as two professional grifters, who decide to con a mob boss, played by Robert Shaw. In addition, after ordering the cakes with mistakes on them at a Carvel location, Grammer touches his nose as a sign to Jenna and Kenneth, who are outside, that he has ordered them, a similar gesture that Newman did in the film.|$|R

Ellen exclaims, [...] "It was Cathy!" [...] and Dr. <b>Kenneth</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "No, I don't know who it was", and tells them that he was then thrown from his horse. As he drew closer, he found Heathcliff lying in the snow. The woman had disappeared {{and there was no}} sign of her, and only Heathcliff's footprints appeared in the snow, not hers.

500|$|Kenneth {{revealing}} that {{his real name}} is [...] "Dick Whitman" [...] is {{a reference to the}} main character Don Draper of Mad Men (played by Jon Hamm, who had a recurring role on 30 Rock earlier in the season). [...] "Earn this", spoken by Kenneth as Jenna has poisoned him again, references the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan when actor Tom Hanks says the same words to actor Matt Damon's title character. When she is told that Kenneth has gone into a severe allergic shock and needs to have his hands cut off, Jenna apologizes to him for what she has done, telling him [...] "I'm just a girl sitting in front of a boy she poisoned so this other guy would go to town on her", which Jenna misquotes from actress Julia Roberts' character from the romantic comedy Notting Hill (1999). After Kenneth drinks his strawberry water, as he risked his life so that Jenna can meet the paramedic again, Jenna <b>says</b> to <b>Kenneth</b> [...] "You magnificent sonofabitch!", a line quoted by actor George C. Scott in the American biographical war film Patton (1970).

[...] to which Lithgow replies [...] "I guess someone's been watching The World According to Garp", a movie that also starred Lithgow. <b>Kenneth</b> <b>says</b> that he saw a birthday party celebrated by prisoners on the television drama Oz.

While Kenneth is paranoid and believes that [...] "secret agents" [...] are tracking his every move, Darius gains his trust as she participates {{in a series of}} training exercises in the woods around his house and begins to develop feelings for him. She tells Kenneth about the death of her mother when she was young and that her mission is to prevent it. <b>Kenneth</b> <b>says</b> his mission is to go back to 2001 and prevent the death of his old girlfriend Belinda, who was killed when someone drove a car into her house.|$|R

2500|$|Many {{witnesses}} {{found it}} difficult to lie effectively when the Court already had enough circumstantial evidence to use in probing their answers. Others may have decided that the best course was to answer honestly or with relatively honest answers that minimized their involvement. The Court's notes <b>say</b> that <b>Kenneth</b> Day [...] "admits he is probably a little tainted. Mind poisoned." [...] Ernest Roberts claimed he was [...] "led astray" [...] by Cyril Wilcox and that Kenneth Day, too, had been [...] "led into it by Wilcox–but not of his own free will." [...] Joseph Lumbard described parties where men danced together and others dressed in women's clothes. The Court noted: [...] "some kissing witnessed." [...] Asked why he did not leave such a party, he allowed that he [...] "stayed because he was interested." [...] He had not masturbated for 6 years. Nathaniel Wolff detailed mutual masturbation with Keith Smerage, but claimed to have ended such behavior. [...] "He was fighting hard and felt that he had overcome the habit. Says he is 90% OK." [...] Keith Smerage in turn said he had not masturbated in 9 months and in college [...] "had not slept with men in the unnatural sense." [...] Later the Court recorded that he said he had [...] "'fooled' around with the homosexual business" [...] once or twice at Harvard. Stanley Gilkey defended reading Havelock Ellis: [...] "I think a man should know everything." [...] Assistant Professor of Philosophy Donald Clark [...] "denied any connection with homosexualism, and he denied talking about it except to help some students to cure themselves."
