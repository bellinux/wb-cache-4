5|$|Following the {{periodic}} trend, oganesson {{would be expected}} to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s2 electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p3/2 level.|$|E
5|$|The ethnic Chinese {{population}} in Indonesia grew {{by an average}} of 4.3 percent annually between 1920 and 1930. It then slowed owing to the effects of the Great Depression and many areas experienced a net emigration. Falling growth rates were also attributed to a <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the number of Chinese immigrants admitted into Indonesia since the 1950s. The population is relatively old according to the 2000 census, having the lowest percentage of population under 14 years old nationwide and the second-highest percentage of population over 65. Their population pyramid had a narrow base with a rapid increase until the 15–19 age group, indicating a rapid decline in total fertility rates. This was evidenced by a decline in the absolute number of births since 1980. In Jakarta and West Java the population peak occurred in the 20–24 age group, indicating that the decline in fertility rates began as early as 1975. The upper portion of the pyramid exhibited a smooth decline with increasing population age. It is estimated that 60.7 percent of the Chinese Indonesian {{population in}} 2000 constitute the generation which experienced political and social pressures under the New Order government. With an average life expectancy of 75 years, those who spent their formative years prior to this regime will completely disappear by 2032.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was {{embedded within a}} large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures {{of no more than}} 77°F (25°C), the organization of the system deteriorated with a <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation. This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18hours about 80miles (125km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.|$|E

40|$|One-year-old Metasequoia glyptostroboides {{seedlings}} {{were exposed}} to non-filtered ambient air (NF) and elevated ozone (E-O- 3, NF+ 60 ppb) in open-top chambers for two years. E-O- 3 accelerated leaf senescence, as indicated by <b>significant</b> <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> photosynthetic pigment contents with the elongation of O- 3 exposure. E-O- 3 significantly affected gas exchange and carboxylation, inducing reductions in light-saturated photosynthesis (A(sat)), the maximum activity of Rubisco (V-c,V-max) and the maximum electron transport rate (J(max)). Chl a/b, V-c,V-max/J(max) and stomatal limitation (l) were not affected. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) was significantly decreased by E-O- 3 in the first year, but remained unchanged in the second year. It can be inferred that the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> A(sat) by E-O- 3 was mainly attributed to the changes in non-stomatal factors. After two years' exposure, E-O- 3 caused <b>significant</b> <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> canopy photosynthesis and leaf mass per area, and {{a significant increase in}} the number of branches, but induced slight, not <b>significant</b> <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> growth and biomass. Therefore, it can be concluded that the carbon accumulation of the species M. glyptostroboides could be negatively affected after long-term exposure to high O- 3 concentration.
