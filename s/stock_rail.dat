25|$|The 315th {{continued}} to give close support to ground forces {{until the fall}} of Rome in June 1944. The group converted to Republic P-47 Thunderbolts in July and supported the assault on southern France in August by dive-bombing gun positions, bridges, and radar facilities, and by patrolling the combat zone. The unit attacked such targets as motor transport, rolling <b>stock,</b> <b>rail</b> lines, troops, bridges, gun emplacements, and supply depots after the invasion, giving tactical support to Allied forces advancing through France. The unit aided {{the reduction of the}} Colmar Pocket in January and February 1945, and supported Seventh Army's drive through the Siegfried defenses in March.

2500|$|In September 1962, Ultronic Systems Corp. {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with Standard and Poor's. [...] Under the terms of this agreement, Ultronics computed the S 500 Stock Composite Index, the 425 Stock Industrial Index, the 50 Stock Utility Index, and the 25 <b>Stock</b> <b>Rail</b> Index. Throughout the market day these statistics were furnished to Standard & Poor's. [...] In addition, Ultronics also computed and reported the 94 S sub-indexes.|$|E
50|$|Older {{turnouts}} use {{the same}} rail section, shaved down, for both <b>stock</b> <b>rail</b> and switch blade. Newer tangential turnouts use a stubbier rail section for the switch blade.|$|E

50|$|For {{turnouts}} (BrE: points), {{the tips}} of the switch blades have to be planed down to fit snugly against the fixed or <b>stock</b> <b>rail.</b> The left-hand diagram shows this: on the left is the dotted outline of the rail, with the part remaining after planing-shown shown by a solid line in red. On the right is shown how the two rails fit together when the turnout is closed. The resulting thin pieces of steel are weak, and so old-style turnouts used to make a relatively sudden and sharp angle against the <b>stock</b> <b>rail.</b> With a sudden change in direction, trains were given a jolt and had to proceed slowly.|$|E
50|$|Short term interdiction {{missions}} {{were directed}} against rolling <b>stock,</b> <b>rail</b> tracks, marshalling yeards, bridges and enemy convoys. In this the Squadron achieved remarkable success. It conducted photo recon missions against enemy radar positions, deep inside enemy territory.|$|E
50|$|The moving {{blades of}} a set of points can be {{connected}} to the stock rails by looser than normal fishplates. This is called a heeled switch. Alternatively, the blade and <b>stock</b> <b>rail</b> can be a one piece heel-less switch, with a flexible thinned section to create the moving heel.|$|E
50|$|Mühlhäuser is a {{manufacturer}} of railbound and trackless tunnel construction equipment, such as narrow gauge rolling <b>stock,</b> <b>rails,</b> and switches; conveyor belts, concrete, and grouting and formwork equipment; and off-road service vehicles on rubber wheels.|$|R
50|$|In addition, PTR also {{produces}} several models of carbine that feature a 16-inch heavy target barrel. These {{are available with}} standard hardware as found on the PTR-91F, and include configurations of different <b>stocks,</b> <b>rails,</b> and barrels. A popular model is the PTR-91 KPF, which has an A3-type fully collapsible paratrooper stock.|$|R

5000|$|To {{clip and}} scotch {{a set of}} railway points (Amer. a switch) uses two pieces of {{equipment}} to temporarily lock a set of points into a particular position. [...] The point clip clamps {{the end of a}} moving rail (the switch rail) of a set of points to its associated <b>stock</b> <b>rail,</b> and the scotch is a timber wedge used to ensure that the other moving rail is kept away from its associated <b>stock</b> <b>rail.</b> In this way the points are fixed in either the 'normal' or 'reverse' positions and cannot be moved by the usual setting mechanisms. For infrequently used points, this guards against mechanical failure of the points leaving them in a condition to derail trains. The 'clip and scotch' method {{can also be used to}} positively deny access to the turnout or mainline.|$|E
50|$|In North America {{the term}} Spike and Wedge {{is used as}} instead of a clip, a rail spike is driven through a hole set in the metal base plate that is located flush up against the switch rail, holding it in place against the <b>stock</b> <b>rail.</b> The block of wood set in the open gap {{is known as the}} wedge and is {{functionally}} equivalent to a scotch.|$|E

50|$|The {{right-hand}} diagram shows a how a tangential turnout is made. A lower, more squat {{profile rail}} {{is used to}} make the switch blades. On the left is the profile of this squat switch rail. The centre diagram shows how the switch rail has to be planed, and on the right it is shown fitting against the <b>stock</b> <b>rail.</b> Note that a thicker base is used to raise the tops level with each other.|$|E
5000|$|Early S&C {{allowed only}} a very slow speed on the {{subsidiary}} route (the [...] "turnout"), so geometrical design was not too important. Many older s&c units had a loose joint at the heel so that the switch rail could turn to close to the <b>stock</b> <b>rail</b> or open from it. When the switch rail was closed, a reasonable alignment was secured; when it was open, no wheel could run on it so it did not matter.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, {{the service}} from Constitución to Mar del Plata would remain active {{as it will}} be {{operated}} by the National Government. Likewise, a report by [...] "Auditoría General de la Nación" [...] (General Auditing Office of Argentina) revealed that rolling <b>stock,</b> <b>rail</b> tracks and signal systems were severely deteriorated {{due to the lack}} of maintenance. As of June 2016, the operation of services by Ferrobaires cost $ 1,200 million per year, with incomes for only 60 million.|$|E

50|$|The switch {{consists}} of the pair of linked tapering rails, known as points (switch rails or point blades), lying between the diverging outer <b>rails</b> (the <b>stock</b> <b>rails).</b> These points can be moved laterally into one of two positions to direct a train coming from the point blades toward the straight path or the diverging path. A train moving from the narrow end toward the point blades (i.e. it will be directed {{to one of the}} two paths depending on the position of the points) is said to be executing a facing-point movement.|$|R
50|$|Stock yards were erected {{alongside}} the railway station in 1929 to assist farmers in moving <b>stock</b> by <b>rail</b> {{and to encourage}} further production of sheep and other stock in the area.|$|R
50|$|Production {{of diesel}} {{locomotives}} started in 1948. From the early 1960s the product range diversified into rolling <b>stock</b> (<b>rail</b> and tram) components. In 1977, the production profile expanded into construction equipment and its name was changed into Fabryka Maszyn Budowlanych i Lokomotyw BUMAR-FABLOK (Factory of Building Machinery and Locomotives BUMAR-FABLOK). The factory {{was taken over}} by Zjednoczenie Przemyslu Maszyn Budowlanych BUMAR (BUMAR Association of Building Machinery Industry) in Warsaw. Production included excavators with bucket capacity of 1.2 cubic metre, cranes with 25-28 ton lifting capacity, self-propelled road cranes, and hydraulic telescopic jibs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{guard rail}} (check rail) {{is a short}} piece of rail placed {{alongside}} the main (<b>stock)</b> <b>rail</b> opposite the frog. These exist {{to ensure that the}} wheels follow the appropriate flangeway through the frog and that the train does not derail. Generally, there are two of these for each frog, one by each outer rail. Guard rails are not required with a [...] "self-guarding cast manganese" [...] frog, as the raised parts of the casting serve the same purpose. These frogs are for low-speed use and are common in rail yards.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of the derailment, Norfolk Southern train 703 {{approached}} the spring switch at the west end of the Boyd Siding and was given a signal restriction. The crew of 703 stopped in the siding and examined the spring switch at the east end of the siding, noting a 1/4-inch gap was present between the switch point and the <b>stock</b> <b>rail.</b> The crew manually operated the switch several times and noted that the switch still had a small 1/8-inch gap. The 703 engineer radioed Norfolk Southern dispatch to report the issue. Train 703 then proceeded through the switch without incident.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tangential}} {{switch rail}} has less steel planed away, and the mid {{part of the}} switch [...] "scallops" [...] into the web of the <b>stock</b> <b>rail</b> for greater strength. The higher baseplate also supports the switch rail better. This makes a stronger switch which can be curved, reducing the jolt to the train and allowing higher speeds. However tangential turnouts still lack a smooth transition where the switch blade contacts the main rail, so {{there is still some}} jolt as the train passes over, though it is a much smaller jolt than with the old-style turnouts.|$|E
50|$|The 315th {{continued}} to give close support to ground forces {{until the fall}} of Rome in June 1944. The group converted to Republic P-47 Thunderbolts in July and supported the assault on southern France in August by dive-bombing gun positions, bridges, and radar facilities, and by patrolling the combat zone. The unit attacked such targets as motor transport, rolling <b>stock,</b> <b>rail</b> lines, troops, bridges, gun emplacements, and supply depots after the invasion, giving tactical support to Allied forces advancing through France.
