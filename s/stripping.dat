5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by <b>stripping</b> (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). <b>Stripping</b> removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger <b>stripping,</b> or plucking, or with a <b>stripping</b> knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. What this means is that Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch <b>stripping</b> is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch <b>stripping,</b> one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth <b>stripping</b> action.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Strip</b> {{casting process}} is {{possible}} to shorten for producing <b>strip.</b> <b>Strip</b> is produced from molten metal continuously and directly by <b>strip</b> casting process. Melt drag process {{is one of the}} single roll <b>strip</b> casting process. Melt drag process is simpler than general twin roll <b>strip</b> casting process. One of defect of cast <b>strip</b> is surface conditions, for example surface roughness. Cast <b>strip</b> surface roughness is larger than hot rolled <b>strip.</b> Large <b>strip</b> surface roughness is negative effect for cold rolling after <b>strip</b> casting or hot rolling. The aim of this study is improvement of cast <b>strip</b> surface roughness by melt drag process. We suggested vertical melt drag process. And investigations were operated such us producing conditions of Al-Si alloy <b>strip,</b> surface roughness of cast <b>strip</b> and microstructures...|$|R

5|$|Granger and Gregory {{argued that}} the large incisors were used for defence or for {{loosening}} shrubs by moving the neck downwards, thereby acting as picks and levers. Tapirs use their proboscis to wrap around branches while <b>stripping</b> off bark with the front teeth; this ability would have been helpful to Paraceratherium. Some Russian authors suggested that the tusks were probably used for breaking twigs, <b>stripping</b> bark and bending high branches and that, because species from the early Oligocene had larger tusks than later ones, they probably had a more bark than leaf based diet. Since the species involved are now {{known to have been}} contemporaneous, and that the differences in tusks are perhaps sexually dimorphic, the latter idea is not accepted today. Herds of Paraceratherium may have migrated while continuously foraging from tall trees, which smaller mammals could not reach. Osborn suggested that its mode of foraging would have been {{similar to that of the}} high-browsing giraffe and okapi, rather than to modern rhinoceroses, whose heads are carried close to the ground.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 2010, Juventus {{considered}} challenging the <b>stripping</b> of their scudetti from 2005 and 2006, {{dependent on the}} results of trials connected to the 2006 scandal. Subsequent investigations found in 2011 that Juventus' relegation in 2006 was without merit. When former general manager Luciano Moggi's conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was thrown out by an appeals court in 2015, the club sued the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for €443million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost scudetti in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|By 1954, the Comics Code Authority {{had been}} {{established}} in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) {{was responsible for the}} rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, <b>stripping</b> Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.|$|E

For example, {{reversal of}} a <b>strip</b> ABCDE will result in <b>strip</b> EDCBA which represents triangles EDC, DBC, CBA).|$|R
50|$|Full-page <b>strips</b> were {{eventually}} replaced by <b>strips</b> half that size. <b>Strips</b> such as The Phantom and Terry and the Pirates began appearing in a format of two <b>strips</b> to a page in full-size newspapers, {{such as the}} New Orleans Times Picayune, or with one <b>strip</b> on a tabloid page, as in the Chicago Sun-Times. When Sunday <b>strips</b> {{began to appear in}} more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to allow for rearranged, cropped or dropped panels. During World War II, because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday <b>strips</b> began to shrink. After the war, <b>strips</b> continued to get smaller and smaller because of increased paper and printing costs. The last full-page comic <b>strip</b> was the Prince Valiant <b>strip</b> for 11 April 1971.|$|R
5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to raise her draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely <b>stripping</b> all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E
5|$|Elcor was {{a mining}} location, {{built by the}} mining company to house the workers for its mines. People were allowed to own their homes, but the land on which the houses stood belonged to the mining company. After the Corsica mine closed in 1954, Pickands Mather and Company ordered the {{residents}} to vacate the property {{so that it could}} reclaim the land; by 1956, Elcor was completely abandoned. The desolate property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers and bankruptcies. In 1993 the Inland Steel Company began <b>stripping</b> the overburden from Elcor's former location for what is now the Minorca mine.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the Leviathan {{joined the}} {{similarly}} named Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland, <b>stripping</b> the Behemoth of its titles as tallest ride in Canada and fastest ride in Canada.

50|$|Colour <b>strips</b> {{as used in}} The Mail On Sunday {{were added}} from book 36 during 1984.

50|$|Newspaper comic <b>strips</b> {{come in two}} {{different}} types: daily <b>strips</b> and Sunday <b>strips.</b> Most newspaper comic <b>strips</b> are syndicated; a syndicate hires people to write and draw a <b>strip</b> and then distributes it to many newspapers for a fee. A few newspaper <b>strips</b> are exclusive to one newspaper. For example, the Pogo comic <b>strip</b> by Walt Kelly originally appeared only in the New York Star in 1948 and was not picked up for syndication until the following year.|$|R
50|$|Other {{analogous}} <b>strips</b> can {{be obtained}} by similarly joining <b>strips</b> with two or more half-twists in them instead of one. For example, a <b>strip</b> with three half-twists, when divided lengthwise, becomes a twisted <b>strip</b> tied in a trefoil knot. (If this knot is unravelled, the <b>strip</b> has eight half-twists.) A <b>strip</b> with N half-twists, when bisected, becomes a <b>strip</b> with N + 1 full twists. Giving it extra twists and reconnecting the ends produces figures called paradromic rings.|$|R
5|$|In April 2010, {{after months}} of {{political}} pressure, the government passed the 18th Amendment, which reduced the President to a ceremonial figurehead by <b>stripping</b> {{the office of the}} power to dissolve Parliament, to dismiss the Prime Minister, and to appoint military chiefs. The amendment also lifted the restriction of two terms as Prime Minister, which enabled Zardari's foremost political rival, Nawaz Sharif, to seek a third term. The amendment was passed with virtually unanimous support in Parliament and Zardari himself espoused the legislation because of political pressure. After the 18th Amendment, Zardari's main power derived from his position as leader of the PPP, which controls the largest bloc in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In June 1966, the now-purged {{parliament}} passed 24 resolutions {{including the}} banning of Marxism-Leninism, ratifying the Supersemar, and <b>stripping</b> Sukarno of his title of President for Life.

5|$|Lenin never {{witnessed}} {{this violence}} or {{participated in it}} first-hand, and publicly distanced himself from it. His published articles and speeches rarely called for executions, but he regularly did so in his coded telegrams and confidential notes. Many Bolsheviks expressed disapproval of the Cheka's mass executions and feared the organisation's apparent unaccountability. The Party tried to restrain its activities in February 1919, <b>stripping</b> it of its powers of tribunal and execution in those areas not under official martial law, but the Cheka continued as before in swathes of the country. By 1920, the Cheka had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other state apparatus.|$|E
