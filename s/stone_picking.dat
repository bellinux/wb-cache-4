25|$|Hockey is {{the major}} sport for girls in the Michaelmas term and became a major sport after {{the opening of the}} (then) new pitches behind the maths block. While the pitches were {{completed}} for September 1966, the autumn term was devoted to <b>stone</b> <b>picking</b> parties, and the hockey season started in January 1967. Hockey had been played previously on the Chudleigh rugby and cricket pitches. Now modern Hockey for girls (in Michelmas Term) is played on 'Astro' Pitches. They are situated by the esteemed Chapel Building (Chapel Astro) and Fayrer House (Crosby Astro).|$|E
50|$|The Bone Collector - In {{the first}} round, a team member is {{suspended}} on a swing {{in the air}} while two others are pulling them into place. The suspended adventurer must use a grabber to pick up bones set inside a large stone and throw them into a bucket. Each bone placed in the bucket scores a point, but if one is dropped, then {{it is out of}} play. The team that collects the most bones in 10 minutes wins. In the second round, a member is attached to a bungee and must climb on ropes upside-down towards the <b>stone,</b> <b>picking</b> up bones and putting them in the holes. If a bone if dropped, it is out of play. The team that has the most bones in the holes after 10 minutes wins.|$|E
40|$|Wessex Archaeology was {{commissioned}} by Mr. C. Burrows, of Damen Associates Ltd. to undertake an archaeological watching brief during construction at Nunton Farm, Nunton, Wiltshire. The watching brief was required {{as a condition of}} the planning permission granted by Wiltshire Council {{for the construction of a}} dirty water lagoon. Two negative lynchets, former probable prehistoric field boundaries, were identified, which indicated the site lies within an extensive, former chequer-board field system that is known from the area. Similar features have been plotted from aerial photographs but have not previously been traced across the area of the site. The field system is likely to relate to Iron Age and Romano-British settlement activity that is known from the area. A chalk quarry pit was located within one of the negative lynchets, suggesting that they were directly related and possibly contemporary. The quarry pit, indicative of an episode of small scale chalk extraction, possibly for building work or track repairs, was backfilled with material that indicates an initial period of weathering and stabilisation followed by activity associated with Romano-British arable farming with associated field clearance (<b>stone</b> <b>picking)</b> debris that contained Romano-British tile and pottery. The sequence was concluded by a change of land use to pasture, suggested by a developed possibly post-Roman/medieval turf line, and final reversion to arable agriculture, itself preceded by levelling of banks around the quarry...|$|E

Looking at the photo, Sergeant Masters realises that the image is identical to Tim Hardacre, a person to whom she had recently spoken at Clarinda's pub. They find that James Cook has convictions for grievous bodily harm but it is then confirmed that he is currently in prison.

40|$|SUMMARY. A {{metallic}} mass brought o the Western Australian Museum {{from the}} Wongan Hills district N. W. of Perth {{has been identified}} as an iron meteorite of unique type. It has graphite inclusions about I mm across distributed throughout the metal giving a 'raisin bread ' appearance. Its nickel content (6 " 65 %) is comparable with that of coarse octahedrites but the kamacite grain structure is anomalous. Its gallium, germanium, and nickel contents place it close to, but outside, Wasson's chemical group IIb. Taenite is absent and troilite is rare. Neumann bands in the kamacite are distorted and the kamacite has flowed around large schreibersite inclusions. The latter have an exceptionally low nickel content (7 " 0 %) and probably formed at an unusually high temperature. The kamacite contains more phosphorus than normal iron meteorites, and small schreibersite grains in the kamacite are relatively nickel-poor (22 ~). The unusual structure of this iron is thought to be due to {{one or more of the}} factors high carbon, high phosphorus, and relatively rapid cooling. Details of thefind. Mrs. M. Bennett of Wongan Hills, Western Australia, reported a 'football-sized ' piece of iron recovered some years ago during <b>stone</b> <b>picking</b> in fields at Redfields Farm, 30 ~ 43 ' S. I I 6 ~ 30 ' E., about I I km E. of Gabalong. Fig. I is a sketch map of the area...|$|E

The Six Sacred <b>Stones</b> <b>picks</b> up eighteen months later - 20 August 2007 - on Easter Island, the geographical opposite of the Great Pyramid, when seven men use a second Capstone to nullify the power of the Tartarus sunspot and remove Australia's invincibility.|$|R

50|$|Once the Rolling <b>Stones</b> <b>picked</b> Stefan Sagmeister {{to be the}} album's art director, Jagger {{told him}} to seek {{inspiration}} from Babylonian art exhibited at the British Museum. Sagmeister was most impressed by a Lamassu sculpture, featuring a lion with a human head and beard, and commissioned artist Kevin Murphy to paint a similar Assyrian lion in an attack stance. The first million units of Bridges to Babylon were encased in a special manufactured filigree slipcase, that gave {{the impression that the}} lion was embedded into the design. The desert background of the cover was extended throughout the booklet, featuring ruins that were the basis for the Bridges to Babylon Tour stage design.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the results of}} a study on the tool marks originated during the excavation of eight hypogeal prehistoric graves of Sardinia dating back between the first stages of IV millennium BC and the end of III millennium BC.

The results allowed to identify the morpho-metric characters of the tool marks and the typological features of the <b>stone</b> <b>picks</b> used in the excavation of the graves during the different phases of Sardinian prehistory. The morphological and dimensional variability of the tool marks across time, can be considered as an useful tool to track the technological evolution of the picks used for the excavation of the neolithic and eneolithic hypogeal tombs of Sardinia...|$|R

5000|$|The Hypogeum {{has been}} {{designated}} a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Hypogeum is a large complex of rooms hewn out of the limestone about 11 m below the surface.

The Hypogeum is made up of three levels, which are superimposed upon each other. The upper level resembles the earlier rock-cut tombs found elsewhere on the Islands. The middle level, hewn out during the temple period (3800 - 2500 B.C.) is made up of numerous chambers. Many statuettes, amulets, figurines and vases were recovered here. The most famous figurine is that of the so-called Sleeping Lady, a reclining figurine, perhaps meant as a representation of eternal sleep. It is on display at the National Museum of Archaeology, Valletta ...|$|R
