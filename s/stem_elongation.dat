5|$|Flower {{development}} {{begins when}} the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem {{capable of producing}} <b>stem</b> <b>elongation</b> and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs {{at the end of}} the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.|$|E
25|$|An {{external}} stimulus {{is required}} in order to trigger the differentiation of the meristem into a flower meristem. This stimulus will activate mitotic cell division in the meristem, particularly on its sides where new primordia are formed. This same stimulus will also cause the meristem to follow a developmental pattern that will lead to the growth of floral meristems as opposed to vegetative meristems. The main difference between these two types of meristem, apart from the obvious disparity between the objective organ, is the verticillate (or whorled) phyllotaxis, that is, the absence of <b>stem</b> <b>elongation</b> among the successive whorls or verticils of the primordium. These verticils follow an acropetal development, giving rise to sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Another difference from vegetative axillary meristems is that the floral meristem is «determined», which means that, once differentiated, its cells will no longer divide.|$|E

500|$|Cytokinins are a {{class of}} plant hormones named for their control of cell {{division}} or cytokinesis. The natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn, Zea mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine. Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts. The gibberelins, such as Gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl CoA via the mevalonate pathway. They {{are involved in the}} promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling <b>stem</b> <b>elongation</b> and the control of flowering. Abscisic acid (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine. It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission, and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops.|$|E

30|$|The {{short term}} results for {{vegetative}} growth indices like <b>stem</b> and leaf <b>elongation</b> {{are in line}} with the results obtained from a short-term greenhouse experiment by Hagen and Spomer (1989). Their study on soil temperature and phytohormonal effects on cushion growth of S. acaulis showed that both <b>stem</b> and leaf <b>elongation</b> increased significantly with one month laboratory treatment of higher root temperatures and decreased with higher abscisic acid concentrations. We found that S. acaulis exhibits considerable phenotypic plasticity in vegetative characters, is highly responsive to changes in its physical environment, and can react quickly to induced changes. The ability to respond quickly to environmental changes can be very beneficial in sub-arctic and arctic areas where harsh conditions are the rule rather than the exception. Thus, when experiencing a warmer than average growing season, S. acaulis has the ability to respond by increasing the photosynthetic area and consequently to benefit further from the favorable conditions.|$|R

Deep flooding enhanced <b>stem</b> <b>elongations</b> at all salinity levels but increased stem biomass only at 5 ppt. Deep flooding increased both leaf production and leaf fall; leaf biomass increased at 5 ppt, but decreased at 15 and 25 ppt. Biomass ratios of root/shoot (R/S) of deep flooding treatments were significantly lower than those of shallow flooding treatments. Under deep flooding, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities did not show significant change between 5 and 15 ppt, but increased at 25 ppt. With increasing salinity level, peroxidase (POD) activities increased, and the difference between shallow and deep flooding was enhanced. Malonaldehyde (MDA) content significantly decreased at 25 ppt with 40 cm flooding, but was not affected by other treatments. These results demonstrated that the growth and physiological responses of K. candel seedlings under deep flooding conditions varied with salinity level; growth was enhanced at low salinity level but inhibited at high salinity level. It is therefore probable that K. candel will shift from downstream to upstream, where the influence of fresher river water resources will ameliorate the effects of increased salinities that accompany deeper tidal flooding in these mangrove ecosystems...|$|R

30|$|Shaver and Kummerow (1992) {{suggested}} that nutrient availability {{is often a}} limiting factor for tundra plant growth, which is partly supported by our results as S. acaulis was shown to be more responsive to nutrient enhancement than warming. In contrast to our study, Hagen and Spomer’s (1989) study {{was carried out in}} a laboratory environment for a period of 30  days, at soil temperatures between 11.5 °C to 25 °C, and constant air temperatures as high as 21 - 25 °C throughout the experimental period, neither of which can be regarded as normal Arctic or high alpine conditions. Unsurprisingly, while our study showed the same positive short-term reactions in <b>stem</b> and leaf <b>elongation,</b> there are important differences resulting from the different experiment designs. We found that <b>stem</b> and leaf <b>elongation</b> can also be limited by air temperature and nutrient level, and not by soil temperature alone. Since air temperature is more variable than than soil temperature and may thus warm more quickly as a consequence of climate change (Gehrig-Fasel et al. 2008), these results contribute to better understanding of possible consequences of climate change. However, leaf width seems to be more conservative to changes in environmental conditions; this might be due to constraints to rapid changes in morphology.|$|R

LMA shows the highest value in 34 years old stands. SNM has the highest value in two years old needles.

Analyses of overt mutant phenotypes have established the importance of phytochromes A and B (phyA and phyB) in this developmental process, but kinetic information that would augment emerging molecular models of phytochrome signal transduction is absent. We have addressed this deficiency by genetically dissecting phytochrome-response kinetics, after having solved the technical issues that previously limited growth studies of small Arabidopsis seedlings. We show here, with resolution {{on the order of}} minutes, that phyA initiated hypocotyl growth inhibition upon the onset of continuous red light. This primary contribution of phyA began to decrease after 3 hr of irradiation, the same time at which immunochemically detectable phyA disappeared and an exclusively phyB-dependent phase of inhibition began. The sequential and coordinated actions of phyA and phyB in red light were not observed in far-red light, which inhibited growth persistently through an exclusively phyA-mediated pathway...|$|R

Altering the dimensions of nanotubular-shaped titanium oxide surface structures independently allowed either augmented human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) adhesion or a specific differentiation of hMSCs into osteoblasts by using only the geometric cues, absent of osteogenic inducing media. hMSC behavior in response to defined nanotube sizes revealed a very dramatic change in hMSC behavior in a relatively narrow range of nanotube dimensions. Small (≈ 30 -nm diameter) nanotubes promoted adhesion without noticeable differentiation, whereas larger (≈ 70 - to 100 -nm diameter) nanotubes elicited a dramatic <b>stem</b> cell <b>elongation</b> (≈ 10 -fold increased), which induced cytoskeletal stress and selective differentiation into osteoblast-like cells, offering a promising nanotechnology-based route for uniqueorthopedics-related hMSC treatments...|$|R

30|$|The major {{consequence}} of submergence is {{a reduction in}} photosynthesis and respiration. This is mitigated to some extent by thin gas films that form {{on the surface of}} submerged leaves, providing a microenvironment for efficient exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen (Pedersen et al. 2009). However, complete submergence dramatically reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches roots via aerenchyma, limiting root development. Thus, an inevitable impact of submergence is a reduction in photosynthate and ATP production, limiting energy available for shoot and root growth. Despite this constraint, submergence intolerant cultivars typically accelerate the rate of <b>stem</b> and leaf <b>elongation</b> relative to non-submerged plants, which resembles the pronounced and effective internodal elongation of partially submerged deepwater rice. If the flood is deep, then elongating leaves may fail to reach the air–water interface before energy reserves are exhausted.|$|R

High-stringency genomic Southern analysis further revealed that Cel 16 and KOR are most likely orthologous genes performing a similar function in both species. Northern blot and GUS analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis containing a fusion between a 2. 0 kb Cel 16 promoter fragment and the GUS reporter gene showed that Cel 16 was expressed at a low level in the primary raceme, the young lateral <b>stems,</b> the <b>elongation</b> zone of the primary root and the older root base.
