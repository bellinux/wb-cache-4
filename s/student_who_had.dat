There are three groups in this study. The first group took the family life education program taught with the innovative method, the second group took the family life education program taught with the traditional method,a nd the third group did not take a family life education program. Students in all three groups were administered a pretest questionnaire in October, 1975 and a posttest questionnaire in May, 1976. Tests of significance were applied {{to all of the}} following hypotheses: Degree of change in the proportion of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> report <b>having</b> positive relationships with their parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the family life education program than for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not taken the family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students seeking help with their personal problems from their parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the family life education program than for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not taken the family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students reporting a high level of assertiveness with their parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the family life education program than for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not taken the family life education program.

Degree of change in the proportion of students with a nontraditional attitude toward marriage and woman’s role will be greater for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the family life education program than for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not taken the family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students {{with a high level of}} self-esteem will be greater for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the family life education program than for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not taken the family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> report <b>having</b> positive relationships with their parents, teachers, friend and siblings will be greater for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the innovatively taught family life education program than for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students seeking help with their personal problems from parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the innovatively taught family life education program than for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students reporting a high level of assertiveness with parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the innovatively taught family life education program than for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students with a nontraditional attitude toward marriage and woman’s role will be greater for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the innovatively taught family life education program than for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students with a high level of self-esteem will be greater for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the innovatively taught family life education program than for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken the traditionally taught family life education program. Analysis of the pretest data showed that there were no significant differences among the three groups on age, sex, religion, father’s education, father’s occupation, participation in class, birth position, grade average, relationships with others, help-seeking behaviour, level of assertiveness, the proportion having career goals or attitude toward marriage and woman’s role. The control group had a significantly higher level of self-esteem at pretest. At posttest, this significant difference had disappeared. We also found that there had been a significant increase in the proportion of comparison group respondents who felt that trial marriages was acceptable for others. The experimental group, at posttest, showed a significant increase in help-seeking behaviour with siblings. There were also two significant findings which were in the opposite direction to that hypothesized. The control group showed a significantly less traditional attitude toward marriage and woman’s role on two counts; there was a significant increase in the number of control group respondents who were undecided about having children, and there was a significant increase in the percentage <b>who</b> <b>had</b> a positive attitude toward trial marriage for themselves. Only one of the hypotheses predicting greater effectiveness for the innovative teaching method was supported; that <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> taken the innovatively taught family life education program would be more likely to seek help from siblings with their personal problems. The traditionally taught family life educationa program proved significantly more effective in increasing the proportion of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> found trial marriage acceptable for others. These findings give tentative support ot the proposition that the family life education program at Sir John A.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} determine: (1) which model {{produces}} better learning achievement TGT, TAI, or direct learning model, (2) {{to find out}} which one has the better learning achievement between students with high creativity, moderate or low creativity, (3) to determine which one gives better learning achievement between cooperative learning model TGT, TAI or Direct for each student creativity, (4) {{to find out which}} one gives the better learning achievement among <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> high creativity, moderate creativity or lower creativity in each of the learning model. This study was a quasi-experimental study with a 3 x 3 factorial design. The sampling technique was done by stratified cluster random sampling. The instrument used for data collection was a questionnaire and math achievement tests. The instrument has been tested by some experts before it is used to conduct trials. Hypothesis testing used two- way Anava with unbalanced cells. Before the Anava test, research data are tested first by test analysis requirements that were test for normality and homogeneity test. The results of two- way Anava analysis show: (1) learning model of TGT and TAI produce better learning achievement, compared to the direct instructional model, while the learning model of TAI and TGT has no difference; (2) <b>Students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> high creativity and moderate creativity have a better learning achievement than the <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> low creativity, the <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> high creativity have better learning achievement than the <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> moderate creativity; (3) <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> creativity of high, moderate or low have on the model TGT learning and TAI have better learning achievement compared to the direct instructional model, while the learning model TGT produce the same learning achievement as TAI learning model; (4) cooperative learning model TGT, TAI and Direct give better result for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> high and moderate creativity than <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> low creativity, as well as the <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> high creativity provide a better learning achievement than moderate creativity...|$|R
