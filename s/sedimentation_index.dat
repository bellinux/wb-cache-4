40|$|The {{objective}} of the present research was an analysis of elementary grain quality properties of selected winter wheat varieties, dependently on tillage systems (conventional, reduced – ploughless and direct sowing) and stubble height. It was carried out during 2009 - 2010 in Agricultural Experimental Station belonging to Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation, localized in Jelcz-Laskowice, on a good rye complex. Crop residue was minced into chopped straw and equally spreaded on field with high stubble as well as short stubble. Grain samples were subjected laboratory analysis to evaluate: wet gluten content, falling number, <b>sedimentation</b> <b>index,</b> total protein content, weight of hectolitre and seed grading. Reduced tillage systems only slightly influenced the grain quality of the examined wheat varieties. <b>Sedimentation</b> <b>index</b> was lower only under direct sowing regime than at objects with conventional and reduced tillage. Conventional tillage favours higher falling number of the tested cultivars in comparison with reduced tillage methods. The examined cultivars were distinguished by comparable grain quality parameters under both high and short stubble. High temperature and balanced rainfall during vegetation season contributed low total protein content, gluten and <b>sedimentation</b> <b>index</b> in grain of the tested varieties.

Three varieties of hardened-yam flour were incorporated in wheat flour in proportions of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 %[*](w/w). Samples were evaluated for protein content, Zeleny <b>sedimentation</b> <b>index,</b> Hagberg falling number, functional properties (WAC, WSI, and OAC), and some rheological properties including dough rupture pressure (P), extensibility (L), stability (P/L), and deformation energy (W). Results showed that trifoliate hardened-yam flours {{do not have}} acceptable baking properties as pictured by the low Zeleny <b>sedimentation</b> <b>index</b> and the low Hagberg falling number. Protein quality (Zeleny index, 31) of wheat flour helped to compensate gluten deficit of yam flours, but the amylasic activity determined by the Hagberg falling number could not be adjusted, {{which resulted in a}} loss of extensibility (L) of the paste at 10 % substitution. Multivariate analysis of experimental data regrouped wheat flour and all wheat/hardened-yam treated with kanwa composite flours in one homogeneous cluster. Although wheat/hardened-yam treated with kanwa composite flours had physicochemical and functional properties similar to wheat, the inadequate diastasic activity makes them inappropriate for bread making, marking the strongest influence of that parameter...|$|E

The objective of wheat breeding programs {{is to improve the}} quality of germplasm bank in order to be able to develop wheat with suitable gluten strength and extensibility for bread making. The aim of this study was to evaluate 16 wheat genotypes by correlating both glutenin subunits of high and low molecular weight and gliadin subunits with the physicochemical characteristics of the grain. Protein content, sedimentation volume, <b>sedimentation</b> <b>index,</b> and falling number values were analyzed after the grains were milled. Hectoliter weight and mass of 1000 seeds were also determined. The glutenin and gliadin subunits were separated using polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The data were evaluated using variance analysis, Pearson's correlation, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis. The IPR 85, IPR Catuara TM, T 091015, and T 091069 genotypes stood out from the others, which indicate their possibly superior grain quality with higher sedimentation volume, higher <b>sedimentation</b> <b>index,</b> and higher mass of 1000 seeds; these genotypes possessed the subunits 1 (Glu-A 1), 5 + 10 (Glu-D 1), c (Glu-A 3), and b (Glu-B 3), with exception of T 091069 genotype that possessed the g allele instead of b in the Glu-B 3...|$|E

40|$|The {{erythrocyte}} {{sedimentation rate}} (ESR) is a nonspecific but simple and inexpensive test that was introduced into medical practice in 1897. Although it is commonly utilized in the diagnosis and follow-up of various clinical conditions, ESR has several limitations including the required 60 min settling time for the test. Herein we introduce a novel use for a commercially available computerized tube viscometer that allows the accurate prediction of human Westergren ESR rates {{in as little as}} 4 min. Owing to an initial pressure gradient, blood moves between two vertical tubes through a horizontal small-bore tube and the top of the red blood cell (RBC) column in each vertical tube is monitored continuously with an accuracy of 0. 083 mm. Using data from the final minute of a blood viscosity measurement, a <b>sedimentation</b> <b>index</b> (SI) was calculated and correlated with results from the conventional Westergren ESR test. To date, samples from 119 human subjects have been studied and our results indicate a strong correlation between SI and ESR values (R 2 = 0. 92). In addition, we found a close association between SI and RBC aggregation indices as determined by an automated RBC aggregometer (R 2 = 0. 71). Determining SI on human blood is rapid, requires no special training and has minimal biohazard risk, thus allowing physicians to rapidly screen for individuals with elevated ESR and to monitor therapeutic responses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Postprandial hyperlipidemia and {{hyperglycemia}} {{have been}} related to cardiovascular events. Among different underlying mechanisms platelet activation seems to be responsible too. No comparable data between various tests in normo- vs. hyperlipidemics before and at different time intervals are available after a fat meal. We aimed to compare 9 of them within the same patients at several time points in postprandial hyperlipidemia. Results For some tests baseline values between the groups were significantly different (TXB 2, platelet sensitivity, sedimentation and WU-test). However, hyperlipidemia revealed a variable influence on the tests examined. Some of the available tests apparently sensitive to show platelet activation reflect the increase in triglycerides (TG), such as the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>index.</b> ADP-induced platelet aggregatory activity in count adjusted washed isolated platelet samples during postprandial hyperlipidemia indicates mildly enhanced platelet activity, but {{does not seem to}} induce significant changes in aggregation. In patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 400 mg/dl fasting) changes in platelet function are more pronounced due to delayed decay and may last up to 16 hours paralleling TG reaching the prevalue. The overwhelming majority of platelet function tests do not significantly respond to postprandial hyperlipidemia. The correlation between the tests applied is poor. For standardization purpose, platelet aggregation tests, aimed to examine proaggregatory capacity in atherosclerosis, should only be performed at the same time of the day after a fasting period[*]>[*] 6 hours. The great variation in preanalytical work-up on comparison of various tests, large number of platelet tests available and their respective potential value are discussed. Conclusions At present, the suspicion that platelet function is significantly activated in the postprandial period cannot be supported by any of the tests used. The information provided is valuable to know for which test and group of patients a fasting period of which duration is recommendable. </p...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the world, several {{millions}} of small ponds exist for water supply, irrigation, flood control or to control water quality downstream. The reduced flow velocity in these ponds causes sedimentation of transported particles. For most ponds {{this is a}} negative impact as their retention capacity decreases due to sedimentation processes. Sediment volumes in small ponds {{can be used to}} reconstruct sediment yield values and to study the spatial variation in sediment yield over large areas. Especially in developing countries, this technique can be very helpful in establishing large data sets on sediment delivery as there are often no resources for expensive monitoring programmes. However, when such studies are undertaken, one has {{to take into account the}} efficiency of the pond in trapping sediments. This trap efficiency is dependent on the characteristics of the inflowing sediment and the retention time of the water in the pond, which in turn are controlled by pond geometry and runoff characteristics. Because trap efficiency is one of the most important properties of a pond or reservoir, it has been studied for quite some time. This article provides an overview of the different methods available to estimate the trap efficiency of reservoirs and ponds. The first set of methods are empirical models that predict trap efficiency, mostly of normally ponded large reservoirs using data on a mid to long-term basis. These models relate trap efficiency to a capacity/watershed ratio, a capacity/annual inflow ratio or a <b>sedimentation</b> <b>index.</b> Today, these models are the most widely used models to predict trap efficiency, even for reservoirs or ponds that have totally different characteristics from the reservoirs used in these models. For small ponds, these models seem to be less appropriate. They also cannot be used for predicting trap efficiency for a single event. To overcome these restrictions, different theoretical models have been developed based on sedimentation principles. These can be very simple, such as the overflow rate method, but also very complex when runoff and sediment are routed through a pond with incremental time-steps. The theoretical-based models are probably more capable of predicting trap efficiency for small ponds with varying geometric characteristics, and some of them also provide data on effluent sediment concentrations and quality. However, when reconstructing sediment yield values using sedimentation rates over a period of a few months to a few year (the mid-term basis), one needs a trap efficiency value for the whole period, not for one single event. At present only limited research has been done on establishing mid-term trap efficiency models based on theoretical principles. This is probably the most important gap in trap efficiency research. status: publishe...|$|E

But today, the cost and energy demand for production of microalgae using current the best available technologies is still too high for bulk biomass production. The introduction of a flocculation pre-concentration can be an interesting improvement to existing harvesting processes and reduce significantly overall production costs.

By targeting our tephra analysis at the To-a (AD 915) horizon, we determined an absolute timing for the E 4 deposits. The increased content of volcanic glass above the E 4 deposits (Fig.  7) suggests a tephra fall after the E 4 <b>sedimentation.</b> The refractive <b>index</b> of volcanic glass shards above the E 4 deposits ranged from 1.504 to 1.511 (mode: 1.507 – 1.508), which includes the To-a tephra range (Machida and Arai 2003; Ishimura et al. 2014). Similarly, the chemical compositions of volcanic glass shards were consistent with previously reported To-a compositions (Aoki and Machida 2006; Ishimura et al. 2014). From these data, we inferred that the To-a tephra fell between the E 4 and E 3 deposits, and we assigned the E 4 deposits to the 869 Jogan tsunami. This identification based on radiocarbon dating and tephra provides significant information on the size and source of the 869 Jogan tsunami and earthquake, indicating that this tsunami reached the middle part of the Sanriku Coast and its inundation area was possibly {{as large as the}} 2011 event. Since the Jogan tsunami is not reported in historical records around Koyadori and insufficient information is available for regionally and chronologically identifying the tsunami deposits along the Sanriku Coast, this finding requires confirmation in paleographical and geological researches.|$|R
40|$|The {{worst enemy}} of {{sustainable}} use of reservoirs is sedimentation. Often the main silting {{process is the}} result of settling down of suspended sediments. In shallow reservoirs the flow pattern and the sediment deposition processes are strongly influenced by the reservoir geometry. The trap efficiency of a shallow reservoir depends on the characteristics of the inflowing sediments and the retention time of the water in the reservoir, which in turn are controlled by the reservoir geometry. With the purpose of controlling the sedimentation in shallow reservoirs, the effects of the geometry on flow pattern and deposition processes were investigated with systematic physical experiments and numerical simulations. This allowed identifying ideal off-stream reservoir geometries, which can minimize or maximize the settlement of suspended sediments. The objective was also to gain deeper insight into the physical processes of sedimentation in shallow reservoirs governed by suspended sediments. The systematic experimental investigations were carried out in a 6 m long, and 4 m wide and 0. 3 m deep shallow basin. The influence of the shallow reservoir geometry was studied for the first time by varying the width, the length, and the expansion angle of the basin in the experiments for clear water and with suspended sediment. In total 11 different reservoirs geometries and 4 water depths were analyzed. During the tests several parameters were measured, as 2 D surface velocities, 3 D velocity profiles, thickness of deposited sediments, and sediment concentration at the inflow and outflow. Crushed walnut shells with a median grain size, d 50, of 50 µm, and a density of 1500 kg/m 3 were used to simulate the suspended sediments. After having reached a stable flow pattern with the clear water, velocity measurements were performed. In a second phase, the evolution of the flow and deposition patterns under suspended sediment inflow were investigated. Tests were carried out with durations from 1. 5 hours up to 18 hours, in order to follow the morphological evolution. In order to investigate the efficiency of flushing, flushing operations at normal water level as well as with drawdown were examined after the sedimentation tests. Numerical simulations of the laboratory basin were performed and compared with experimental results. The purpose was to assess the sensitivity of the results on different flow and sediment parameters and different turbulence closure schemes. The experimental investigation of the flow and sediment behavior in axi-symmetric geometries with different shapes provides further information on the evolution of the flow pattern and the sediment deposition. Beside the expansion ratio and form ratio of the basin the flow regime was classified by the geometry shape factor SK and inlet Froude number Frin. The geometry shape factor, defined as a function of wetted perimeter, total reservoir surface area, aspect ratio and expansion density ratio, was used to compare and analyze the experimental results obtained from the different investigated basin geometries. The clear water experiments investigations revealed under what geometrical conditions the flow changes from symmetrical to asymmetrical behavior. The length of the basin has a strong influence on the change of the flow field. The water depth also significantly affects on the type of jet and vortex structure forming in the basin. On the other, hand the sediment deposition pattern was strongly influenced by the jet type and the flow behavior changed with increasing deposits. The prediction of sediment deposition is linked to the prediction of flow behavior. Furthermore it is very sensitive to the basin geometry and the boundary conditions of inflow and outflow. Some tests were performed until the sediment released at the outlet was equal to the sediments entering at inlet into the basin that means a quasi equilibrium was reached. Flushing at normal water level allows only a relatively small part of the deposited sediment to be evacuated. As expected, drawdown flushing is much more effective and a significant amount of sediment deposits could be flushed out of the basin. Regarding the flow pattern in shallow basins empirical relationships for the estimation of the reattachment length of gyres and the normalized residence time {{as a function of the}} geometry shape factor, SK, were established. Also empirical equations for the prediction of the jet flow type and velocity magnitude depending on the basin geometry could be formed. Finally empirical equations for the prediction of <b>sedimentation</b> <b>index,</b> silting ratio, trap efficiency and relative deposition thickness, as well as normalized residence time and flushing efficiency could be found. The numerical simulations revealed that the observed asymmetry in flow and deposition patterns can be explained by the sensitivity of the flow regarding geometry and boundary conditions. The influence of the length and width of the basin on the flow pattern can be predicted in good agreement with experiments by these simulations. Some recommendations are given for the design procedure of a new shallow reservoir in view of minimizing the sedimentation due to suspended sediment. The deposited sediment volume can be efficiently minimized by an optimal designed reservoir geometry...|$|E
40|$|In the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman marl {{forms the}} primary {{sediment}} cover, {{particularly on the}} Iranian side. A detailed quantitative description of the sediment components > 63 µ has been attempted {{in order to establish}} the regional distribution of the most important constituents as well as the criteria governing marl sedimentation in general. During the course of the analysis, the sand fraction from about 160 bottom-surface samples was split into 5 phi° fractions and 500 to 800 grains were counted in each individual fraction. The grains were cataloged in up to 40 grain type catagories. The gravel fraction was counted separately and the values calculated as weight percent. Basic for understanding the mode of formation of the marl sediment is the "rule" of independent availability of component groups. It states that the sedimentation of different component groups takes place independently, and that variation in the quantity of one component is independent of {{the presence or absence of}} other components. This means, for example, that different grain size spectrums are not necessarily developed through transport sorting. In the Persian Gulf they are more likely the result of differences in the amount of clay-rich fine sediment brought in to the restricted mouth areas of the Iranian rivers. These local increases in clayey sediment dilute the autochthonous, for the most part carbonate, coarse fraction. This also explains the frequent facies changes from carbonate to clayey marl. The main constituent groups of the coarse fraction are faecal pellets and lumps, the non carbonate mineral components, the Pleistocene relict sediment, the benthonic biogene components and the plankton. Faecal pellets and lumps are formed through grain size transformation of fine sediment. Higher percentages of these components can be correlated to large amounts of fine sediment and organic C. No discernable change takes place in carbonate minerals as a result of digestion and faecal pellet formation. The non-carbonate sand components originate from several unrelated sources and can be distinguished by their different grain size spectrum; as well as by other characteristics. The Iranian rivers supply the greatest amounts (well sorted fine sand). Their quantitative variations can be used to trace fine sediment transport directions. Similar mineral maxima in the sediment of the Gulf of Oman mark the path of the Persian Gulf outflow water. Far out from the coast, the basin bottoms in places contain abundant relict minerals (poorly sorted medium sand) and localized areas of reworked salt dome material (medium sand to gravel). Wind transport produces only a minimal "background value" of mineral components (very fine sand). Biogenic and non-biogenic relict sediments can be placed in separate component groups with the help of several petrographic criteria. Part of the relict sediment (well sorted fine sand) is allochthonous and was derived from the terrigenous sediment of river mouths. The main part (coarse, poorly sorted sediment), however, was derived from the late Pleistocene and forms a quasi-autochthonous cover over wide areas which receive little recent sedimentation. Bioturbation results in a mixing of the relict sediment with the overlying younger sediment. Resulting vertical sediment displacement of more than 2. 5 m has been observed. This vertical mixing of relict sediment is also partially responsible for the present day grain size anomalies (coarse sediment in deep water) found in the Persian Gulf. The mainly aragonitic components forming the relict sediment show a finely subdivided facies pattern reflecting the paleogeography of carbonate tidal flats dating from the post Pleistocene transgression. Standstill periods are reflected at 110 - 125 m (shelf break), 64 - 61 m and 53 - 41 m (e. g. coare grained quartz and oolite concentrations), and at 25 - 30 m. Comparing these depths to similar occurrences on other shelf regions (e. g. Timor Sea) leads to the conclusion that at this time minimal tectonic activity was taking place in the Persian Gulf. The Pleistocene climate, as evidenced by the absence of Iranian river sediment, was probably drier than the present day Persian Gulf climate. Foremost among the benthonic biogene components are the foraminifera and mollusks. When a ratio is set up between the two, it can be seen that each group is very sensitive to bottom type, i. e., the production of benthonic mollusca increases when a stable (hard) bottom is present whereas the foraminifera favour a soft bottom. In this way, regardless of the grain size, areas with high and low rates of recent sedimentation can be sharply defined. The almost complete absence of mollusks in water deeper than 200 to 300 m gives a rough sedimentologic water depth indicator. The sum of the benthonic foraminifera and mollusca was used as a relative constant reference value for the investigation of many other sediment components. The ratio between arenaceous foraminifera and those with carbonate shells shows a direct relationship to the amount of coarse grained material in the sediment as the frequence of arenaceous foraminifera depends heavily on the availability of sand grains. The nearness of "open" coasts (Iranian river mouths) is directly reflected in the high percentage of plant remains, and indirectly by the increased numbers of ostracods and vertebrates. Plant fragments do not reach their ultimate point of deposition in a free swimming state, but are transported along with the remainder of the terrigenous fine sediment. The echinoderms (mainly echinoids in the West Basin and ophiuroids in the Central Basin) attain their maximum development at the greatest depth reached by the action of the largest waves. This depth varies, depending on the exposure of the slope to the waves, between 12 to 14 and 30 to 35 m. Corals and bryozoans have proved to be good indicators of stable unchanging bottom conditions. Although bryozoans and alcyonarian spiculae are independent of water depth, scleractinians thrive only above 25 to 30 m. The beginning of recent reef growth (restricted by low winter temperatures) was seen only in one single area - on a shoal under 16 m of water. The coarse plankton fraction was studied primarily through the use of a plankton-benthos ratio. The increase in planktonic foraminifera with increasing water depth is here heavily masked by the "Adjacent sea effect" of the Persian Gulf: for the most part the foraminifera have drifted in from the Gulf of Oman. In contrast, the planktonic mollusks are able to colonize the entire Persian Gulf water body. Their amount in the plankton-benthos ratio always increases with water depth and thereby gives a reliable picture of local water depth variations. This holds true to a depth of around 400 m (corresponding to 80 - 90 % plankton). This water depth effect can be removed by graphical analysis, allowing the percentage of planktonic mollusks per total sample to be used as a reference base for relative sedimentation rate (<b>sedimentation</b> <b>index).</b> These values vary between 1 and > 1000 and thereby agree well with all the other lines of evidence. The "pteropod ooze" facies is then markedly dependent on the sedimentation rate and can theoretically develop at any depth greater than 65 m (proven at 80 m). It should certainly no longer be thought of as "deep sea" sediment. Based on the component distribution diagrams, grain size and carbonate content, the sediments of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman can be grouped into 5 provisional facies divisions (Chapt. 19). Particularly noteworthy among these are first, the fine grained clayey marl facies occupying the 9 narrow outflow areas of rivers, and second, the coarse grained, high-carbonate marl facies rich in relict sediment which covers wide sediment-poor areas of the basin bottoms. Sediment transport is for the most part restricted to grain sizes < 150 µ and in shallow water is largely coast-parallel due to wave action at times supplemented by tidal currents. Below the wave base gravity transport prevails. The only current capable of moving sediment is the Persian Gulf outflow water in the Gulf of Oman...|$|E

The Sudanese cultivars (Elneelain, Debaira, and Wadi Elneel) were compared with an Australian bread wheat cultivar. Baking test, farinograph characteristics, sedimentation value, gluten and gluten index were determined in wheat flours of 68 % extraction rate. Wadi Elneel cultivar showed a better breadmaking quality than Elneelain and Debaira. Samples of whole wheat flours from the three Sudanese wheat cultivars and the Australian wheat were fractionated by a modified Osborne fractionation procedure into five solubility fractions: (i) the water-soluble albumins, (ii) the salt-soluble globulins, (iii) the aqueous alcohol-soluble gliadins, (iv) the acetic acid-soluble glutenins, and (v) the residue-glutenin fraction. The residue glutenin, calculated on flour basis, showed significant positive correlations (P≤ 0. 05) with total protein, wet gluten, dry gluten, <b>sedimentation</b> value, gluten <b>index</b> and specific loaf volume. The residue glutenin, on total protein basis, showed significant positive correlations (P≤ 0. 05) with total protein, gluten index and specific loaf volume.

The residue glutenin was found to be a fundamental factor determining breadmaking quality of wheat. The gluten indices of the Sudanese wheat cultivars were high, indicating good breadmaking quality, but according to other results of this study, the Sudanese wheat cultivars are of poor quality.

40|$|The Atlantic South-eastern margin is {{influenced}} by the presence of broad upwelling cells associated with the Benguela Current System. Sedimentary records of cores taken from 35 °S to 10 °S between 1000 to 4000 m depth show extraordinarily high organic carbon (OM) contents for this deep and oxygenated environment. Thus this margin is different from classically known models of preservation in deep setting by the bottom water anoxia or redepositional processes Temporal variability of organic carbon observed along this margin from the north of Walvis ridge to South Africa, shows an enrichment in total organic carbon (TOC) during the Last Glacial Maximum (20 kyrs) with respect to Holocene Climatic Optimum(8 kyrs). It is the same for biogenic silica, mainly related to diatoms input, which follows the same climatic logic. Carbonate contents are negatively correlated with TOC and biogenic silica. The Lüderitz upwelling cell is presently the most productive area of the Benguela Current System, during at least 280 kyrs, and abundant OM accumulates on the adjacent slope sediments even at great water depth. Results indicate that OM is more oxidized at 3606 m water depth than on the upper slope sediments (1029 m) although petroleum quality of OM throughout the deep-water core remains surprisingly high for hemipelagic deep-sea sediments (HI = 200 to 400 mg HC/g TOC). The petroleum quality of OM accumulated on the upper slope is consistently high: HI average 450 mg HC/g TOC. Organic sedimentation in front of Lüderitz is modellised with the software DIONISOS (IFP), in the aim of developping a 3 D stratigraphic model and predicting petroleum quality and quantity of organic matter along the margin. The first step in modelling the deep organic matter sedimentation is to decipher between the main controlling factors the key parameters to be introduce in the model DIONISOS. This imply to define simple laws for productivity, degradation, advection of sediment, etc. Rock Eval parameters shows that organic sedimentation along the margin can be considered as an important source-rock <b>sedimentation.</b> Source-Rock Potential <b>Index</b> (SPI) calculations are in agreement with a maximum of a potential hydrocarbon formation in front of Lüderitz, from shallow depth (500 m), to deeper depth (2000 m).

The blends for bread production to be analysed were prepared by mixing wheat flour with an addition of oat, buckwheat, lentil and chickpea wholegrain flour in different portions (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 %). The experiment showed that the addition of natural additives worsened the protein complex of the blends used in bread production (worsening also qualitative parameters known as product volume). The loaves prepared with an addition of buckwheat, oat, lentil and chickpea were evaluated to be of a lesser quality from a technological viewpoint when compared with pure wheat loaves. The lower content of gluten forming proteins and the generally changed protein composition of blends due to additives caused a lower percentage of wet gluten content, its lower extensibility and swelling capacity. The <b>sedimentation</b> value (Zeleny <b>index)</b> decreased proportionally {{with the increase of}} addition until the level was unsatisfactory for raw material intended for bakery purposes. The N content in experimental loaves was higher than in the reference loaves and it increased according to the selected additive and its portion in the blend (more with the addition of lentil and chickpea, less in case of buckwheat and oat) which is considered as positive from a nutritional point of view. But from the technological point of view the additives did not show any positive influence and caused a lower loaf bread volume. The most significant decrease of the loaf bread volume was found with the addition of 50 % of buckwheat (- 45. 6 %). Better results were obtained with a lower portion of the additive: loaf with an addition of 30 % of chickpea (volume decreased by 12. 8 %) > loaf with an addition of 30 % of lentil (volume decreased by 8. 7 %) > loaf with an addition of 10 % of oat (volume decreased by 14. 3 %) > loaf with an addition of 10 % of buckwheat (volume decreased by 22. 7 %).
