Flat sawn wood (especially oak) will often display a prominent wavy grain (sometimes called a cathedral-window pattern) caused by the <b>saw</b> <b>cutting</b> at a tangent to a growth ring; since in quartersawn wood the saw cuts across the growth rings, the visible grain is much straighter; it is this evenness of the grain that gives quartersawn wood its greater stability.|$|E

Sample 72275, 103, a chip taken from eastend piece 72275, 27, is rich in gray polymict breccia. The <b>saw</b> <b>cuttings</b> were derived from the entire rock, but they are probably strongly biased toward the friable feldspathic matrix material that has been preferentially disaggregated. The spectra of both samples show two prominent absorption bands arising from Fe 2 (+) in pyroxene. The depths of these bands are large enough to preclude the presence of much glass or opaque material in the samples. From the spectral properties alone, {{it is clear that}} the samples are not soil breccias nor vitric breccias, as, of course, has been verified by petrography.

50|$|Men were {{generally}} partially sedated with chloroform or alcohol before surgeries.

Infection was {{the most common cause of}} death of injured soldiers. Infection occurred for a variety of reasons. Surgeons would typically go from surgery to surgery without cleaning their equipment or their hands. Surgeons would use sponges that they only rinsed in water on multiple patients. These practices caused bacteria to spread from patient to patient, from all surgical surfaces, and from the environment, which caused infections in many.|$|E

The train ran him over and severed his left hand and foot. He later recalled regaining consciousness and seeing the rear of the train receding down the track and then realizing it had run over his body. “A piece of very thin flesh was holding my leg to the rest of my body. Blood was gushing out,” he recalled. “I needed to stop the bleeding. When I tried to work on my leg, I realized that three of my fingers on my left hand had been sheared off.” He underwent a four and a half hour operation without anesthetic. “The doctors were thinking whether they should let me die or if it was worth it to operate,” he later explained. “My mom was pleading and crying, so they decided to operate....On the operating table I could feel everything that was being done to my body. I was screaming {{at the top of my}} lungs....I felt the <b>saw</b> <b>cutting</b> into the bone of my leg, and the scalpel through my flesh. Every time I passed out from the pain the surgeon would slap my face to keep me awake. The whole hospital heard my screams....The simplest thing to do was cut off everything. They didn't try to save my remaining two fingers, they just cut off my hand.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{essential}} work of fracture {{approach has}} been employed to analyse the effect of notch sharpening on the fracture toughness of a semicrystalline multiphase ethylene-propylene block copolymer. Double edge notched tension specimens were sharpened using different techniques: femtolaser ablation, razor blade sliding at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures, <b>saw</b> <b>cutting,</b> plastically deformed <b>saw</b> <b>cutting,</b> and scalpel sliding. The notch sharpening techniques provide notches of different quality in relation to both the notch tip radius and the plastic deformation {{in front of the}} crack tip. The best quality notches were produced by the femtolaser ablation technique, which provides very sharp notches without plastic deformation ahead of the crack tip. The effects of the non-collinearity of the notches and tilted specimens on the testing machine grips were also analysed. The shape of the registered stress–displacement curves shows differences, but only in the range comprised between the displacements corresponding to the maximum stress and the onset of crack initiation. A larger crack tip radius and/or larger extent of plastic deformation in front of the notch root leads to larger values of the displacement at the onset of crack initiation, resulting in higher values for the specific essential work of fracture. Yet on the other hand, the values of the slope of the essential work of fracture plot remain unchanged. A lower value for the specific essential work of fracture was obtained for the specimens sharpened using the femtolaser ablation technique. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E
