5|$|Arnhem {{restored}} much of Model's self-confidence, {{which had}} been <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> experience of Normandy. From September to December, he fought another Allied thrust to a standstill, this time by Omar Bradley's U.S. 12th Army Group into the Hürtgen Forest and Aachen. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of his units than at Arnhem, he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, slowing the Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties and taking {{full advantage of the}} fortifications of the Westwall, known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line.|$|E
5|$|At the Dutch Grand Prix, Rindt {{eventually}} {{used the}} new Lotus 72, better sorted after alterations had been made. He set pole {{position in the}} final practice session, {{almost a quarter of}} a second ahead of his closest challenger, Stewart. Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, {{but it was not a}} joyful occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before, died in a fiery crash. Rindt was heavily <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the {{remainder}} of the series was under threat. Jardine was <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> events and by the hostile reactions to his team. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted Nawab of Pataudi, about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting the captain and his tactics. Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the unsportsmanlike accusation.|$|E

5|$|Belisarius {{returned}} to Constantinople with the Vandals' royal treasure and the captive Gelimer {{to enjoy a}} triumph, while Africa was formally restored to imperial rule as the praetorian prefecture of Africa. Imperial control scarcely reached beyond the old Vandal kingdom, however, and the Moorish tribes of the interior proved unwilling to accept imperial rule and soon rose up in rebellion. The new province was <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wars with the Moors and military rebellions, {{and it was not}} until 548 that peace was restored and Roman government firmly established.|$|E
5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|In that time, the Christian {{faith was}} <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{contrast}} between Miaphysites and Chalcedonians. These were two opposing christological positions; the Chalcedonians claimed that Christ had {{both human and}} divine natures, while the Miaphysites claimed he had only one single united nature. The Council of Chalcedon, convoked by Emperor Marcian in 451, had ruled out Miaphysitism, {{with the support of}} the pope in the West and many bishops in the East. However, the Miaphysite position was still strong: the two Miaphysite Patriarchs Timothy Aelurus of Alexandria and Peter the Fuller of Antioch were deposed.|$|E

5|$|Like the SPARTAN-IIs, the SPARTAN-III {{candidates}} undergo radical cybernetic {{and biological}} enhancements and are outfitted with special armor {{to increase their}} abilities. The first SPARTAN-III company proves highly successful, but is wiped out when ordered to destroy a Covenant orbital shipyard in 2537. <b>Shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> massacre of his troops, Kurt improves the training regimen for his next batch of SPARTAN-III recruits, but they too are all killed in action so Kurt, {{in an effort to}} reduce casualties, institutes illegal biological modifications on the third company of SPARTANs. While conducting a training exercise near Zone 67, UNSC personnel find themselves under attack by alien robotic drones.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{eventually}} {{turns up}} drunk {{at a local}} bar, his faith <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> death. He is taken into custody. The agents doubt his ability, but {{he is able to}} convince Mulder that he knows the latter has lost a sister—Samantha—at a young age. Mulder has been seeing visions of Samantha, and continues to see them. At Samuel's bail hearing, the courtroom fills with a swarm of locusts, which Samuel claims is a sign of God's wrath against him.|$|E
5|$|Seattle in {{this period}} {{attracted}} widespread attention as home to these many companies, but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993, {{as well as through}} the worldwide popularity of grunge, a sound that had developed in Seattle's independent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention—hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999—garnered visibility, but not in the way its sponsors desired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself. The city was further <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mardi Gras Riots in 2001, and then literally shaken the following day by the Nisqually earthquake.|$|E

5|$|Such {{witnesses}} {{are those who}} cannot hear an idle intemperate expression, but they must immediately run to the magistrate to inform; or perhaps wrangling in their cups over night, {{when they were not}} able to speak or apprehend three words of common sense, will pretend to remember everything the next morning, and think themselves very properly qualified to be accusers of their brethren. God be thanked, the throne of our King is too firmly settled to be <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> folly and rashness of every sottish companion.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Woodruff's {{clinical}} transplant program was recognised and enhanced by {{funding from the}} Nuffield Foundation to construct and open the Nuffield Transplant Surgery Unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. In 1970 an outbreak of hepatitis B struck the transplant unit, resulting {{in the death of}} several patients and four of Woodruff's employees due to fulminant hepatic failure. Woodruff was deeply <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loss and the unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop a contingency plan to avoid such a disaster in future. The unit then resumed operations.|$|E
5|$|While at school, Fender {{spent his}} summers with his {{grandparents}} in Brighton, which qualified {{him to play}} County Cricket for Sussex. When he left school in 1910, he attracted {{the interest of the}} club and, after success in both local cricket and second-team matches, he made his first-class debut on 21 July as an amateur in Sussex's County Championship match against Nottinghamshire. He played one other game that season, against Worcestershire, where he was <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pace of two opposing bowlers. In the two games, Fender scored 19 runs and took one wicket.|$|E

5|$|William Brereton. The {{walls were}} {{repaired}} and the motte was cleaned out. During 1643 {{part of the}} royal army of Ireland landed at Chester. On 13 December 1643 Captain Thomas Sandford and eight soldiers from that army crept into Beeston at night (possibly aided by treachery) and surprised the castle governor, Captain Thomas Steele, who was so <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> event that he surrendered on the promise {{that he would be}} allowed to march out of the castle with honours. Steele was tried and shot for his failure to hold the castle.|$|E
5|$|During June, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Miller's squadron would be deployed to Burma {{to fight against}} Japan. In the meantime, the airmen continued to practice their flying, Miller earning Reeves' ire by making unauthorised leisure flights. Later, {{he was ordered to}} fly tour flights over Germany. Not wanting to do so, Miller lodged bogus reports saying that the Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, Reeves ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire in mid-flight. With one functional engine and no navigator to assist him, Miller came back to the air base and bellylanded. The fuselage and one of the wings was broken off and the plane became engulfed in flames. Miller escaped physical injury, but was <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> accident. Again Miller escaped disciplinary action, and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E
5|$|General von Toll {{initially}} {{planned to}} order his infantry {{to start the}} assault at 16:00, but Paskevich through his aides ordered him to postpone the attack until 16:45. Eventually around 5:00 von Kreutz's corps advanced towards Forts 21 and 22 in two columns. Russian horse artillery reached a position 200 paces from Fort 22 and started shelling the defenders at close range. Already <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire of the Grand Battery, the Poles abandoned the fort and retreated before the surprised Russian infantry approached. It was a rare example of artillery capturing a fortified position {{without the help of}} other forces. Meanwhile, the fighting for the nearby Fort 22 was heavy. In the end its garrison fell almost to the last man.|$|E

5000|$|A {{music video}} was {{released}} onto YouTube on 28 February 2014. It {{was directed by}} JLW and Oliver Hadlee Pearch and features the large dance ensemble featured on the band's debut album performing a choreographed routine in a large warehouse caused to <b>shake</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> track, and follows {{the theme of the}} first two videos [...] "Platoon" [...] and [...] "The Heat".|$|R
500|$|Years later, when Andrew Jackson was {{corresponding}} with Edward Livingston {{he wrote}} [...] "Present {{me in the}} most respectful terms to your aged sister [...] Says to her, if I ever should be within one hundred miles of her dwelling I will visit and have the high honor of <b>shaking</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand the revered relict of the patriotic Genrl.

5|$|Shelby's {{confidence}} in the federal government's war planning was <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> disastrous Battle of Frenchtown in which a number of Kentucky soldiers died. He vowed to personally act to aid the war effort should the opportunity arise, and was authorized by the legislature to do so. In March 1813, Harrison requested another 1,200 Kentuckians to join him at Fort Meigs. Shelby dispatched the requested number, among whom was his oldest son James, under General Green Clay. The reinforcements arrived to find Fort Meigs under siege by a combined force of British and Indians. Clay's force was able to stop the siege, but {{a large number of}} them were captured and massacred by Indians. Initial reports put James Shelby among the dead, but he was later discovered to have been captured and released in a prisoner exchange.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Russia, {{while at}} the time {{publicly}} supporting Polish and Lithuanian independence, sponsored communist agitators working against {{the government of the}} Second Polish Republic, and considered that its eastern borders should approximate those of the defunct Congress Poland. Poles and Lithuanians, on the other hand, inspired by memories of the greatness of the erstwhile Grand Duchy of Lithuania, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, saw their borders as lying much farther east. The leader of the Polish forces, Józef Piłsudski, discerned an opportunity for regaining territories that were once the part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and since then were part of the Prussian Empire, <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1917 Revolution and the ongoing Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Słowacki {{was not a}} {{very popular}} figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, <b>shaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E
