5|$|However, {{there is}} no {{conclusive}} evidence for a fifteenth-century order. A French commentator writing in 1558 described {{the use of the}} crowned thistle and the cross of <b>St</b> <b>Andrew</b> on Scottish coins and war banners, and added that there was no Scottish order of knighthood. Similarly, John Lesley writing around 1578, refers to the three foreign orders of chivalry carved on the gate of James V's Linlithgow Palace with his ornaments of <b>St</b> <b>Andrew,</b> proper to this nation. Some Scottish order of chivalry may have existed during the sixteenth century, possibly founded by James V and called the Order of <b>St.</b> <b>Andrew,</b> but lapsed {{by the end of that}} century.|$|E

5|$|On 30 June 2011, Edinburgh Council {{voted to}} {{continue}} the line between Edinburgh Airport and <b>St</b> <b>Andrew</b> Square. Costs rose to an estimated £770m, leaving the council with a shortfall of more than £200m. The option to scrap the project was considered, but rejected. On 25 August 2011, the council voted to cut the line to run between the airport and Haymarket, reducing the expected cost to £715m. A week later, after the Scottish Government threatened to withhold £72 million of funding, the council reversed its decision, restoring the terminus at <b>St</b> <b>Andrew</b> Square. On 29 November 2011 {{it was announced that}} the eastern terminus would be at York Place instead of <b>St</b> <b>Andrew</b> Square; the intention had been to build the tracks to a reversing point at York Place (without a stop for passengers). Extending passenger services from <b>St</b> <b>Andrew</b> Square to York Place would enable Broughton Street, Picardy Place and the surrounding area to be better served at comparatively little additional cost.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sts</b> <b>Andrew</b> and Bartholomew Church The {{church is}} {{primarily}} 12th and 13th century, with later remodelling, but the origins are pure Saxon. Much {{of the north}} wall is built of striking Saxon herringbone stonework. The interior features {{one of the earliest}} known examples of a royal coat of arms (featuring a lion and a dragon) over the south chapel; this dates from the reign of Edward VI or, possibly, Elizabeth I. The church is Grade I listed.|$|R
50|$|Initiated in Romanesque style, it {{was later}} remade. It has a sturdy bell tower with single and double mullioned windows. The {{interior}} is on a nave, and houses fragments of 14th-century frescoes (St. Anthony and one Female Saint). Other painting works include a Virgin Enthonred with Child between <b>Sts.</b> <b>Andrew</b> and John the Baptist (16th century), the Resurrection of Christ between Sts. Anthony of Padua, Mary Magdalene, Catherine of Alexandria and Jesm by Francesco Curradi, and two panels with a Nativity between Sts. Lucy and Jerome and Massacre of the Innocents.|$|R

5|$|In 596, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine, prior of {{the monastery}} of <b>St.</b> <b>Andrew</b> in Rome, to England as a missionary, and in 597, a group of nearly forty monks, led by Augustine, landed on the Isle of Thanet in Kent. According to Bede, Æthelberht was {{sufficiently}} distrustful of the newcomers to insist on meeting them under the open sky, {{to prevent them from}} performing sorcery. The monks impressed Æthelberht, but he was not converted immediately. He agreed to allow the mission to settle in Canterbury and permitted them to preach.|$|E
5|$|In architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was {{foremost}} {{in studying the}} remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer Vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building {{the dome of the}} Florence Cathedral. Another building demonstrating this style is the church of <b>St.</b> <b>Andrew</b> in Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, combining the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and Maderno.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the present}} house {{was built in the}} early 14th century by Sir John de Clevedon. There is {{speculation}} that it may lie on the site of a Roman building, based on excavations to the south of the house in 1961/62. The house incorporates remnants of a 13th-century building which lie at an angle {{to the rest of the}} house. It was situated nearly two miles inland from the parish church of <b>St</b> <b>Andrew,</b> which stands on the coast.|$|E
5|$|Only {{three more}} public acts are known. In 980, Dunstan joined Ælfhere of Mercia in the solemn {{translation}} of the relics of King Edward, soon {{to be regarded as}} a saint, from their grave at Wareham to a shrine at Shaftesbury Abbey. In 984, in obedience to a vision of <b>St</b> <b>Andrew,</b> he persuaded King Æthelred to appoint Ælfheah as Bishop of Winchester in succession to Æthelwold. In 986, Dunstan induced the king, by a donation of 100 pounds of silver, to stop his persecution of the See of Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Skopje Fortress was rebuilt {{several times}} before it was {{destroyed}} by the 1963 earthquake. Since then, it has been restored to its medieval appearance. It is the only medieval monument in Skopje, but several churches located around the city illustrate the Vardar architectural school which flourished around 1300. Among these churches are the ones around Matka Canyon (St Nicholas, <b>St</b> <b>Andrew</b> and Matka churches). The church of St. Panteleimon in Gorno Nerezi dates from the 12th century. Its expressive frescoes anticipate the Italian primitives.|$|E

5|$|The Church of <b>St</b> <b>Andrew</b> {{dates from}} the 14thcentury. It was {{restored}} in 1873 by William Butterfield.

5|$|Of Salford's six Grade I listed buildings, {{three are}} churches. St Augustine's Church, in Pendlebury, {{was built in}} 1874 by George Frederick Bodley. The Church of St Mary the Virgin, in Eccles, was {{originally}} built in the 13th century but was expanded in the 15th. A church {{has been on the}} site since at least the Norman period. St Mark's Church, in Worsley, was built in 1846 by George Gilbert Scott. The six Grade II* listed churches are the Church of <b>St</b> <b>Andrew</b> in Eccles, the Cathedral Church of St John, the Church of St Luke in Pendleton, Monton Unitarian Church in Monton, the Church of St Philip in Salford, and the United Reformed Church.|$|E
5|$|St Philip's Cathedral was {{upgraded}} {{from church}} status when the Anglican Diocese of Birmingham {{was created in}} 1905. There are two other cathedrals: St Chad's, seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Dormition of the Mother of God and <b>St</b> <b>Andrew.</b> The Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Midlands is also based at Birmingham, with a cathedral under construction. The original parish church of Birmingham, St Martin in the Bull Ring, is Grade II* listed.

5000|$|In rare cases, {{the rights}} to a wrestler's ring name may be owned by a company {{with little or no}} {{connection}} to professional wrestling, such as Marvel Comics' ownership of the name Hulk Hogan until early 2003, which was due to Hogan being advertised as The Incredible Hulk Hogan early on in his career, while Marvel owned the trademark for their comic book character The Incredible Hulk. Sometimes a wrestler will buy {{the rights to}} their own ring name; for example, Steve Borden owns the rights to the ring name <b>Sting.</b> <b>Andrew</b> Martin, formerly known as Test, took this one step further and legally changed his name to Andrew [...] "Test" [...] Martin.
