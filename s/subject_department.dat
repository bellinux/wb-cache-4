40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study {{exploring}} teacher learning of subject content knowledge (SCK) and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in four <b>subject</b> <b>departments</b> of secondary schools in England. The research design employed interview and observation. This paper focuses on characterising the cultures of the <b>subject</b> <b>departments</b> from the participants' own perspectives, examining the key factors influencing the formation of these cultures and how they facilitated or constrained the learning of SCK and PCK. Analysis of the data was done using constant comparative analysis. Findings show {{that three of the}} <b>subject</b> <b>departments</b> could be described as having more collaborative cultures whilst one was more individualistic. The findings also show that the key influencing factors were the nature and status of the subject, leadership of the department and the presence of a shared physical space, a team room. The paper ends by considering some of the implications for teacher learning in the workplace particularly at a time, in the English context, where the government's reforms are moving towards more school-based initial teacher education and continuing professional development. © 2013 Copyright Teacher Development...|$|R

40|$|Research {{on school}} {{improvement}} tends {{to assume that}} school improvement is a school-wide process.

40|$|Student {{teachers}} in England, mainly on one-year courses, spend {{the majority of}} their time in schools. Secondary schools are primarily organised around <b>subject</b> <b>departments,</b> and these subgroups within schools {{have been shown to be}} significant for student outcomes and teachers’ experiences. However, research on school <b>subject</b> <b>departments</b> themselves is relatively limited, and developing better understandings of school <b>subject</b> <b>departments</b> is important for Initial Teacher Education and educational research more broadly. This paper draws on an ethnographic study of three secondary school geography departments to analyse student teachers’ positionalities as knowers within departments. Opportunities for professional discussions within departments are limited, and are often dominated by immediate practical concerns. A social realist concept of knower-knowledge structures is used to explore the kinds of knowers accepted as legitimate in these departments. A dichotomous view of teachers as knowers was found, being positioned as knowing or not-knowing particular areas of subject knowledge. This binary view is argued to be related to the language of the Teachers’ Standards in England. Suggestions are made for improving student teachers’ positions as knowers within departments by planning opportunities to contribute their expertise, and for developing more expansive discourses around subject knowledge to enable all to maximise opportunities to learn from the rich mines of expertise held across ITE partnerships...|$|R

5000|$|Columbia Pictures {{launched}} its short <b>subject</b> <b>department</b> in 1934 and Andy Clyde {{was one of}} the first comedy stars signed by producer Jules White. Unlike many of the Columbia short-subject comedians who indulged in broad facial and physical gestures, Clyde was subtler and more economical: his comic timing was so good that he could merely lift an eyebrow, shudder slightly, or mutter [...] "My, my, my" [...] for humorous effect. His work for Columbia was prolific enough that, from the mid-1940s, the studio was able to produce lower-budgeted remakes, editing older scenes into the new ones. You Were Never Uglier (1944), for example, was remade with the same principals in 1953 as Hooked and Rooked. Clyde was such an audience favorite that he continued to star in Columbia shorts through 1956. He outlasted every comedian on the Columbia payroll except The Three Stooges.|$|E

A much-loved resident of Hollywood Hills, he was famously sociable, chatting with neighbors at the Beachwood Village Laundry and giving pocket money to local children. His charming storybook house became a popular stop-off for neighbors on their way to and from the Beachwood Market because he would invariably invite them in for a drink.|$|E

Generally there is a friendliness apt for its purpose, enhanced by the restrained use of primary colour on columns, balustrades and doors.

The research was framed by a conceptual framework informed by the work of Goffman on ‘performance’ and ‘front’.

Such performances were considered to be inconsistent with the coursework ideals and principles within the teacher education programme but in step with the general ethos of most PE department offices. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
