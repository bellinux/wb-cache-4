5|$|Shorter, {{black-and-white}} daily <b>strips</b> {{began to}} appear early in the 20th century, and became established in newspapers after the success in 1907 of Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff. In Britain, the Amalgamated Press established a popular style of a sequence of images with text beneath them, including Illustrated Chips and Comic Cuts. Humour <b>strips</b> predominated at first, and in the 1920s and 1930s <b>strips</b> with continuing stories in genres such as adventure and drama also became popular.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s {{specifically}} gay publications have also included comic <b>strips,</b> in which LGBT themes are ubiquitous.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Strip</b> {{casting process}} is {{possible}} to shorten for producing <b>strip.</b> <b>Strip</b> is produced from molten metal continuously and directly by <b>strip</b> casting process. Melt drag process {{is one of the}} single roll <b>strip</b> casting process. Melt drag process is simpler than general twin roll <b>strip</b> casting process. One of defect of cast <b>strip</b> is surface conditions, for example surface roughness. Cast <b>strip</b> surface roughness is larger than hot rolled <b>strip.</b> Large <b>strip</b> surface roughness is negative effect for cold rolling after <b>strip</b> casting or hot rolling. The aim of this study is improvement of cast <b>strip</b> surface roughness by melt drag process. We suggested vertical melt drag process. And investigations were operated such us producing conditions of Al-Si alloy <b>strip,</b> surface roughness of cast <b>strip</b> and microstructures...|$|R

5|$|Comic <b>strips</b> {{have also}} dealt in subtext and innuendo, their wide {{distribution}} in newspapers limiting their inclusion of controversial material. The first openly gay characters appeared in prominent <b>strips</b> {{in the late}} 1970s; representation of LGBT issues in these titles causes vociferous reaction, both praise and condemnation, to the present day. Comic <b>strips</b> aimed at LGBT audiences are also syndicated in gay- and lesbian-targeted magazines and comics have been created to educate people about LGBT-related issues and to influence real-world politics, with their format and distribution allowing them to transmit messages more subtle, complex, and positive than typical education material. Portrayal of LGBT themes in comics is recognized by several notable awards, including the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards and GLAAD Media Awards for outstanding comic book and comic strip.|$|E
5|$|Goofus and Gallant <b>strips</b> {{have been}} used for {{research}} purposes. A 2006 study gauging the development of ideas of respect and disrespect among American children used <b>strips</b> from the comic as stimuli to which the subjects could provide qualitative responses regarding why they believed Goofus's or Gallant's actions were respectful or disrespectful. A 2012 study used the <b>strips</b> to prompt autistic and allistic children to identify whether the depicted child (either Goofus or Gallant) was behaving badly while researchers used an fMRI to measure the neural networks used in reaching their conclusions.|$|E

5|$|Québécois cartoonists would {{propose a}} number of <b>strips</b> {{to compete with the}} American <b>strips</b> that {{dominated}} the Sundays and dailies. The native Québec presence on those pages would become more dominant after 1940, however, with the introduction of the War Exchange Conservation Act, which restricted the import of foreign <b>strips.</b> Albert Chartier created the comical character Onésime in 1943, a strip that would have the longest run of any in Québec. After World War II, during the Great Darkness, comics publication became dominated with religious comics, most of which were imported from the US. Native Québec comics did flourish for a brief period between 1955 and 1960, however, but were soon replaced again with American content, while also facing competition from the new Franco-Belgian publications, which appeared in full-colour, and by the mid-1960s had put the local Catholic publications out of business.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{influence}} coefficient method, {{the effect of}} entry <b>strip</b> crown on the shape of hot rolled <b>strip</b> was analyzed using the software of roll elastic deformation simulation. According to the practical condition of a domestic hot rolled <b>strip</b> plant, the unit <b>strip</b> crown change from the first stand to the last stand was calculated when the entry crown of hot <b>strip</b> varies. The calculated result shows that the entry <b>strip</b> crown does not significantly affect the target <b>strip</b> crown at the exit of the last finishing stand in respect to a fixed <b>strip</b> shape control reference (such as bending force). The calculation was analyzed, and the research is helpful in modeling <b>strip</b> shape setup and shape control...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the effect of entry <b>strip</b> thickness, entry <b>strip</b> crown and {{intermediate}} roll shifting on <b>strip</b> profile and rolling force distribution, a three dimension finite element model of rolls-strip in UCM mill was established and employed.

40|$|By our {{employer}} Camatec Industriteknik AB have we {{been given}} the assignment {{to continue with the}} previous work “Design of <b>strip</b> feeder”. Our goal with this work is {{to come up with a}} design basis for a <b>strip</b> feeder. Functionally a <b>strip</b> feeder consists of two rollers which with the aid of the friction between the <b>strip</b> and the coating on the roller create a <b>strip</b> force that pulls the <b>strip</b> through the working progress. Demands on this project: • 10 – 600 mm in <b>strip</b> width and 0, 1 - 1 mm in <b>strip</b> thickness. • Minimum 30 m/min in production speed. • A maximum <b>strip</b> force on 30 - 40 kN. • The cost of the <b>strip</b> feeder’s components is to be considered of economy and quality. The need of a <b>strip</b> feeder occurs when the coil doesn’t manage to feed or pull the <b>strip</b> before or after a working process. The <b>strip</b> can otherwise be exposed by a permanent yield deformation or a change in the <b>strip</b> material if it’s pulled trough the working process only by the on – and of-coils. In these processes can also high friction occur which can give trouble with the feeding speed of the <b>strip</b> if not the coils are complemented by a <b>strip</b> feeder. Out of the feasibility study we concluded to continue with a smaller S-feeder with pressure. The pressure is achieved by two hydraulic cylinders and a leveler on the upper frame. For proceeding design of the <b>strip</b> feeder so will it be designed for 1, 5 against the highest possible <b>strip</b> force that have been calculated during the feasibility study. Also bearings, hydraulic cylinders, motor and gearbox have been designed for these force reactions. With the coating material Slitan 96 Shore A on the rollers the theoretical <b>strip</b> force be 50400 N during a pressure of 64915 N if the <b>strip</b> feeder is used as an S-feeder with pressure. If it’s necessary to use a simple <b>strip</b> feeder the theoretical <b>strip</b> force will be 12900 N during a pressure of 64915 N. The <b>strip</b> force will be limited by the coating materials capabilities when a big pressure will risk the <b>strip</b> to be baked in to the polyurethane and the coating will be damage by the stresses that occur by a bigger pressure...|$|R

5|$|Commercially viable natural {{deposits}} of graphite occur {{in many parts}} of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into <b>strips</b> before encasing the <b>strips</b> in wood.
