5|$|American {{football}} {{evolved from}} the sports of association football (soccer) and rugby football. Rugby football, like American football, is a sport where two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can be kicked {{through a set of}} goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to <b>score</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{three types}} of {{scrimmage}} kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can <b>score</b> <b>points.</b> The place kick is the standard method used to <b>score</b> <b>points,</b> because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E
50|$|With Suzuki also <b>scoring</b> <b>points</b> at the British and Spanish Grands Prix, and Éric Bernard <b>scoring</b> <b>points</b> at Monaco, Britain and Hungary, {{the team}} ended {{the year with}} 11 points {{achieving}} sixth place in the Constructors' Championship.|$|R

5|$|Education {{during the}} college's early history {{was based on}} St Ignatius' Ratio Studiorum, with {{emphasis}} upon theology, classics and science, all of which still feature prominently in the curriculum. The educational practice, observed at the College of St Omer, of dividing a class into Romans and Carthaginians continued long after the migration to Stonyhurst but is not employed today; each pupil would be pitched against an opponent {{with the task of}} picking up on the other's mistakes in an attempt to <b>score</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{then went}} on to <b>score</b> <b>points</b> in five of the next six races on his way to moving into the top 10 in the World Drivers' Championship, the run of results {{interrupted}} only by an engine failure in Monaco. One of his best races came in Austria where despite starting from the pitlane and suffering a drive-through penalty he set the race's third fastest lap, behind only the Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello, finishing in 7th place.|$|E
5|$|In the ride's {{narrative}} of events preceding those that occur during the ride, King Adelsten entered {{the mountain to}} fight a dragon called Ormaar. During the battle, the king lost his crown. Stansein, one of the king's servants, guides riders through the mountain to find and retrieve the crown. Throughout the ride, riders can <b>score</b> <b>points</b> by hitting objects on the screen with their light guns. At the end, the highest scores are placed in the 'Wonder Mountain's Guardian Hall of Fame'.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} {{games in the}} series, Warriors of Rock challenges one to four local or online players to use special instrument controllers based on guitar, bass, drums, and vocals to simulate the playing of rock music, matching notes as they scroll on-screen with specific actions of the controller to <b>score</b> <b>points</b> and successfully complete songs that are available on-disc, through imports of other Guitar Hero games, or purchasable as downloadable content. Players are awarded star ratings based on their performance; in Warriors of Rock, the typical limit of five stars can easily be surpassed through gameplay-changing powers possessed by the eight in-game characters when they are used. Players can opt to play songs on one of six difficulty levels, from Beginner to Expert (Expert+ on drums), that alter the number of notes and scrolling speed.|$|E
5|$|Each season {{normally}} {{consists of}} 12 to 16 rallies driven on surfaces ranging from gravel and tarmac to snow and ice. Points from these events are calculated towards the drivers' and manufacturers' world championships. The driver's championship and manufacturer's championship are separate championships, but {{are based on}} the same point system. In the current points system, points are awarded {{at the end of each}} rally to the top ten WRC (overall), junior and production car drivers that qualify as follows: 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1. Despite how many drivers are in one team, constructors can only nominate two drivers to <b>score</b> <b>points</b> for the team as well as scoring for themselves.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player missions, The World Is Not Enough features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} different game types, ranging from the traditional deathmatch to objective-based games such as capture the flag or king of the hill. Other game types include Last Agent Standing, where players begin the game with a finite number of lives and must survive until the opposing players exhaust their lives, and Uplink, in which players must find and touch uplink units scattered in key locations of the map to <b>score</b> <b>points.</b> Multiplayer games can be played on 14 different maps and can also include bots. Bots' appearance and amount of health can be changed to match player preference.|$|E

50|$|Márquez {{made his}} world {{championship}} début as a wildcard at the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix. In difficult weather conditions, Márquez <b>scored</b> <b>points</b> with a twelfth-place finish. He also made wildcard appearances at Estoril and Catalunya, <b>scoring</b> <b>points</b> on both occasions, with fifteenth and sixth respectively. After the mid-season break, Márquez {{moved into the}} series full-time from the Indianapolis Grand Prix onwards with Ambrogio Racing, replacing Simone Grotzkyj. He <b>scored</b> <b>points</b> {{in four of the}} remaining eight races, and ultimately finished the season in twentieth place in the riders' championship.|$|R
50|$|The goal of {{defensive}} {{strategy is to}} prevent the opposing offense from gaining yards and <b>scoring</b> <b>points,</b> either by preventing the offense from advancing the ball beyond {{the line of scrimmage}} or by the defense taking the ball away from the offense (referred to as a turnover) and <b>scoring</b> <b>points</b> themselves.|$|R
5|$|Konami, who had {{distributed}} the original Q*bert to Japanese arcades in 1983, produced {{a game with}} the title Q*bert for MSX computers in 1986, released in Japan and Europe. However, the main character is a little dragon, and the mechanics are based on Q*bert's Qubes. The player once again turns around colored cubes by jumping from cube to cube, {{trying to reach the}} displayed target pattern. Contrary to Mylstar's arcade game, each of the 50 stages has a different pattern of cubes, in addition to the known rule extensions in later stages. The game also features a competitive 2-player mode, where each side is assigned a different pattern, and the players can <b>score</b> <b>points</b> either by completing their pattern first, or by pushing the other off the board.|$|E
5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to <b>score</b> <b>points.</b> The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
5|$|The Differential Ability Scales Second Edition (DAS–II) was {{developed}} by Colin D. Elliott and published in 2007 by Psychological Corporation. The DAS-II is a test battery given individually to children, normed for children from ages two years and six months through seventeen years and eleven months. It was normed on 3,480 noninstitutionalized, English-speaking children in that age range. The DAS-II yields a General Conceptual Ability (GCA) score scaled like an IQ score with the median standard score set at 100 and 15 standard <b>score</b> <b>points</b> for each standard deviation up or down from the median. The lowest possible GCA score on DAS–II is 44, and the highest is 175.|$|E

5|$|The Rugby World Cup final is {{the last}} match of the competition. The winning team is {{declared}} world champion and receives the Webb Ellis Cup. If the score is a draw after 80 minutes of regular play, an additional 20-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If the score remains tied, an additional 10 minutes of sudden-death extra time are played, with {{the first team to}} <b>score</b> <b>points</b> immediately declared the winner. If no team is able to break the tie during extra time, the winner is ultimately decided by a penalty shootout. Two of the eight finals contested have gone to extra time: South Africa's victory against New Zealand in the 1995 final, and England's triumph against Australia in the 2003 final.|$|E
5|$|The backfield of Albert Hill, Everett Strupper, Joe Guyon, and Judy Harlan led the Golden Tornado, and {{all four}} rushed {{for more than}} 100 yards in a 48–0 victory over Tulane. During the regular season Georgia Tech {{defeated}} strong opponents by large margins, and its 41–0 victory over eastern Penn shocked many; Davidson, with Buck Flowers (a future Tech star), was defeated 32–10. Tech's 83–0 victory over Vanderbilt is the worst loss in Vanderbilt history, and its 63–0 defeat of Washington & Lee was the worst loss in W history at the time. Tech finished the season by defeating Auburn 68–7, clinching the conference title. Davidson and Auburn were the only teams to <b>score</b> <b>points</b> against Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|The race result {{meant that}} Michael Schumacher still {{retained}} his {{lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, ahead of Coulthard. Race winner Ralf Schumacher, on 41 points, moved into the third place and Barrichello's second-place resulted in him being relegated to fourth. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to <b>score</b> <b>points,</b> resulted in Ferrari extending their lead to be fifty-eight points in front. Williams retained third on 56 points, but were ten points closer to McLaren, with five races of the season remaining. This was the final Formula One event {{to be held at}} the high-speed configuration of the Hockenheimring circuit; the circuit was shortened by 1.5 miles and the new layout was used starting from the 2002 season.|$|E

5|$|The third {{multiplayer}} mode is the Combat Simulator, involving {{up to four}} human {{players and}} eight computer-controlled players. Again, a split-screen is used if more than one human is playing. If three or four humans play, the screen is divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary. Players enter the game unarmed and {{with a certain amount}} of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players <b>score</b> <b>points</b> by killing their respective enemies, to objective-based games, such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a gametype where players <b>score</b> <b>points</b> by hacking a computer system using a data uplink. Aspects of each game can be customised, including the chosen map, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually. In a team game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in GoldenEye 007s multiplayer mode, such as free weapons selection and placement of shields.|$|E
5|$|Competitive video gamers and referees {{stress the}} game's {{high level of}} {{difficulty}} compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience {{and the ability to}} accurately time Mario's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a <b>score.</b> <b>Points</b> are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built in DIP switches. One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap or off the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} developed by Reflections Interactive {{and published by}} Psygnosis. Based on the sport of demolition derby, the game tasks the player with racing and destroying cars to <b>score</b> <b>points.</b> The developers implemented simulated physics to make the results of collisions easier to predict, and they kept the game's tracks small {{to increase the number}} of wrecks. Versions of Destruction Derby were released for MS-DOS, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. A Nintendo 64 version, Destruction Derby 64, was released in 1999 by Looking Glass Studios and THQ. Critics found Destruction Derby enjoyable and they praised its graphics and car damage system, but the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn releases received mixed reviews. It doesn't work fully on all PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 models due to game save file issues. The game started the Destruction Derby franchise, beginning with its 1996 sequel, Destruction Derby 2.|$|E
