Higher (p< 0. 05) superoxide dismutase activity and total reducing ability were maintained in VSP-MOMAP beef than in HOMAP beef. Lipid oxidation (2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) was significantly (p< 0. 05) retarded in MOMAP, VSP-MOMAP, and VSP-HOMAP beef compared with HOMAP beef. Production of nonheme iron content was lower (p< 0. 05) in VSP-MOMAP beef than in HOMAP beef.

Meat color was described by reflectance measurements and by reading the color coordinates L* (lightness), a* (redness), b* (yellowness), C* (chroma) and h (hue angle) in the CIE-LAB system. All packaged beef was regarded as unacceptable when reflectance differences values at 630 and 580 nm i. e., due to oxymyoglobin (MbO$ sb 2) $ were $ sim$ 30 - 35. Based on these standards, aerobic packaging of beef in polyvinylchloride (PVC) film had a shelf-life of $ sim$ 5 d and 1 d at 4 and 12 $ sp circ$C respectively. Beef packaged in both low gas-moisture barrier films resulted in black discoloration after only 2 d at 4 $ sp circ$C due to increased moisture loss.

40|$|The Vacuum Lug Closure system, or VLC, {{is found}} on many widely {{available}} {{products such as}} jam, sauces and pickles. The closure has many useful advantages over other closure systems, and it is popular with both manufacturers and consumers. However, there are large groups ofpeople that have great difficulty opening products packaged in jars with vacuum lug caps. The goal of this project is to understand both {{the way in which}} consumers interact with the closure, and also how the closure system works. The torque that users can apply to ajar lid was measured using a torque sensor embedded in a modified jar. This was then compared to a calcula ed torque derived from grip measurements. This second type oftest can be used to predict openability for any kind of closure by utilising simple and quick tests and mathematically adapting strength test data. By eliminating the need to perform more extensive tests, costs are kept to a minimum whilst ensuring that the results are still relevant to the problem. The results from both tests were compared with the measured forces required to open examples ofconsumer packaging found on sale. The results from both tests agree reasonably well, but more data is required regarding the interaction between human <b>skin</b> and <b>packaging</b> materials. However the current required opening torques were found to be far too high for many users. It is suggested that a limit of 1 Nm torque should be used for future packaging designs to allow over 97...|$|R
40|$|Project CPR/ 88 / 054 was {{successful}} in strengthening China's quality development and assurance system for wood-based panels, through the realization of its stated objectives. However, {{the achievements of the}} project would be further consolidated and strengthened through the implementation of the following recommendations. While the Chinese Research Institute of Wood Industry CRIWI has been revising/formulating newer standards and codes for end- products, {{more needs to be done}} to cover such areas as input standards, on-line specifications for process control, codes/specifications for wood dyes and pigments, product packaging codes, etc. Development/revision of two specific types of standards are of immediate importance. These relate primarily to standards/specifications of raw materials entering the production lines, particularly to significant machine down-time due to improper feed-stock, and, secondly, to revision of building codes to encourage expanded usage of wood-based panels products. The project identified four regional substations and formulated draft regulations for the introduction of a regional network of quality testing and monitoring stations for wood-based panels. The actual implementation of the system has, however, yet to come into force. Since the rationale for the introduction of the regional network is of a fundamental nature, its early implementation cannot be overstressed. The proposed regional stations should be delegated increasing responsibilities for both quality monitoring and extensions services and research. The frequency of independent inspection of producing units could be expanded to internationally acceptable standards by making the regional centres responsible for such activities. In addition, the current product certification system could be upgraded by making use of the regional stations. Thus, the early establishment of the regional stations and delegation of authority to these centres would serve to bring about further quality improvements on a national scale. Further work should be done at CRIWI to continue the development of wet-formed wood-plastic composites to consistently reproduce a high-quality panel over a range of wood-plastic compositions. Further testing could be done to determine the limits to which wood-plastic composites can be post-formed after pressing. These composites have very good potential for being used on the interior panels of automobiles and for other non-structural applications, such as safety guards for machinery, door <b>skins,</b> <b>packaging</b> and shipping. In addition work should focus on determining which compatabilizers would improve the bond strength between wood-fibre and plastic. Additional laboratory equipment would help facilitate research in this area, including (i) a laboratory-scale wet-process forming line, (ii) additional dies to test the formability of the composites, and (iii) test equipment to determine physical properties of composite panels. Computer-based technology needs to be significantly upgraded in CRIWI and other forestry institutions, to strengthen research activities and informatics. Computer-based in-process quality control in operating mills also requires significant upgrading to enable real-time analysis during successive production stages. The latter is important for both productivity and profitability of mills. There are certain areas that require strengthening: a module-based developmental plan could be designed and implemented over a period of time. To do this, however, China would need international assistance in the form of additional external consultants, more fellowships (one fellowship was provided under this project), equipment and hands-on training. While extension services aimed at dissemination of research technologies, user-related information and technical advisory assistance were developed under the current project, inculcation of the fundamentals of value engineering will go a long way in expanding the use of wood-based panels, and recycled products in diverse areas. In essence, this implies advisory services to users in the application of the correct material (and not necessarily material of the highest specifications) for the desired job. Such activities would reduce costs as well as serve to demonstrate the varied uses of panel products. In this context, the training workshop and related activities envisaged under the current project are crucial and need to be implemented at the earliest...|$|R
40|$|Patch-based transdermal drug {{delivery}} offers a convenient way to administer drugs without the drawbacks of standard hypodermic injections relating to {{issues such as}} patient acceptability and injection safety. However, conventional transdermal {{drug delivery}} is limited to therapeutics where the drug can diffuse across the skin barrier. By using miniaturized needles, a pathway into the human body can be established which allow transport of macromolecular drugs such as insulins or vaccines. These microneedles only penetrate the outermost skin layers, superficial enough not to reach the nerve receptors of the lower skin. Thus, microneedle insertions are perceived as painless. The thesis presents {{research in the field}} of microneedle-based drug delivery with the specific aim of investigating a microneedle-based transdermal patch concept. To enable controllable drug infusion and still maintain an unobtrusive and easy-to-use, patch-like design, the system includes a small active dispenser mechanism. The dispenser is based on a novel thermal actuator consisting of highly expandable microspheres. When actuated, the microspheres expand into a liquid reservoir and, subsequently, dispense stored liquid through outlet holes. The microneedles are fabricated in monocrystalline silicon by Deep Reactive Ion Etching. The needles are organized in arrays situated on a chip. To allow active delivery, the microneedles are hollow with the needle bore-opening located {{on the side of the}} needle. This way, the needle can have a sharp and well-defined needle tip. A sharp needle is a further requirement to achieve microneedle insertion into skin by hand. The thesis presents fabrication and evaluation of both the microneedle structure and the transdermal patch as such. Issues such as penetration reliability, liquid delivery into the <b>skin</b> and microneedle <b>packaging</b> are discussed. The microneedle patch was also tested and studied in vivo for insulin delivery. Results show that intradermal administration with microneedles give rise to similar insulin concentration as standard subcutaneous delivery with the same dose rate. QC 2010062...|$|R
40|$|Inherently, most MEMS {{devices are}} {{fabricated}} on rigid substrates. However, {{for a wide variety}} of applications, it has long been desirable that sensors, actuators, or circuits can be fabricated on flexible substrates so as to be mounted on nonplanar surfaces or even on flexible objects such as a human body. A novel flexible skin technology, which is compatible with MEMS and ICs processes, was developed in the Caltech Micromachining Lab for the distributed fluidic sensing. With this technology, a flexible shear-stress sensor skin was fabricated and successfully implemented on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The flow separation detection along the leading edge of UAV was demonstrated in both wind tunnel and the real flight test. The complete UAV sensing/computing/controlling system, including microsensors, microelectronics, and microactuators, was also demonstrated in wind tunnel and ready for the flight test. This technology was further explored by making an underwater shear-stress sensor skin for applications such as flow pattern measurement of radio controlled submarines, and the study of the safety and arming mechanisms of next generation smart torpedoes. Underwater shear-stress sensor was developed, addressing the challenges of minimization of the pressure crosstalk and waterproof coating. A selective Parylene deposition method was investigated as well to achieve high shear-stress sensitivity and excellent waterproof simultaneously. With the <b>skin</b> structure, the <b>packaging</b> was significantly simplified and improved. Additionally, MEMS-IC integration is highly desirable since this integration promises to bring very important benefits such as operational improvement, packaging simplification, and cost reduction. For the first time, an IC-integrated flexible shearstress sensor skin, which has bias and signal conditioning circuitry on-chip, was developed by using post-CMOS MEMS processes. The fluidic sensing on a semicylindrical surface with the IC-integrated shearstress sensor skin was demonstrated in the wind tunnel. In addition to distributed fluidic sensing, the MEMS skin technology, with the demonstrated capability to be integrated with ICs, can enable many other important applications in biomedicine, wearable microsystems, RF systems, and robotics...|$|R
40|$|In {{the poultry}} industry, further {{processed}} meat products {{have the highest}} share in the market, and {{because there is a}} growing demand of food products with enriched amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, the objectives of this research were to assess lipid oxidation development and quality characteristics of chicken meat as affected by dietary fat and vitamin E levels. Broilers were fed during six weeks with diets containing animal/vegetable, lard, palm kernel, soybean, conjugated linoleic acid, flaxseed, or menhaden oil. Each lipid diet was supplemented with either a control (33 or 42 mg/kg) or a supranutritional level (200 - 400 or 200 mg/kg) of vitamin E. Breast and thigh meat, or <b>skin,</b> were processed, <b>packaged,</b> and refrigerated as raw meat, cooked patties, or cooked sous vide meat. The results showed that the chicken meat fatty acid composition reflected those from the dietary fats. In the meat or skin there was a higher lipid oxidation susceptibility as the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids increased, shown as malonaldehyde values, particularly in the treatments with low supplemented level of vitamin E (P< 0. 05). The relative lipid oxidative stability of the meat decreased in consecutive order from raw, cooked sous vide, and cooked meat patties. Sous vide cooked meat developed lipid oxidation at a slow rate and showed not to be affected by nonheme iron values. Dietary fat and vitamin E level affected breast meat lightness (L* color space) values (P< 0. 05), but not muscle pH, Allo-Kramer shear force, or water holding capacity. In conclusion, the increment in the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids increases the susceptibility to lipid oxidation in the meat. Supranutritional supplementation levels of vitamin E are more effective at inhibiting the lipid oxidation development in chicken meat than some current levels used by the poultry industry. Neither dietary fat nor vitamin E level seems to affect the development of pale, soft, and exudative meat condition in chicken meat...|$|R
