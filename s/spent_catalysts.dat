The physico-chemical characteristics of Unclarified Oil (UCO) and the properties of Equilibrium catalyst [E-cat] from the commercial Fluidized bed Catalytic Cracking (FCC) unit were studied. <b>Spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> was blended with the regenerated equilibrium catalyst from commercial unit in different proportions.

The effect of 10 %, 30 % and 50 % (wt) of E-cat and <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> and carbon to oil ratio (C/O) was studied using MAT unit with UCO. The yield pattern was compared for various catalyst combination of Ecat + <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> at constant conversion 91. With <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> in the blend the light gas (LG) yield decreases, with increase in C/O ratio. There is no significant change in bottoms (residue) yield, while there is a decrease in the diesel when C/O ratio is increased from 4. 0 to 6. 0. There is a significant increase in propylene yield when C/O ratio increases.

40|$|Nickel {{containing}} catalysts or nickel catalyst {{are well}} known in process industries. In Malaysia, there are about 500 metric ton of nickel catalysts being imported every year. They have been used many reactions such as hydrogenation reaction, alkylation reactions, hydroalkylation reactions and cracking reactions. The initial composition of nickel catalyst depends on reaction involved for example catalysts for hydroalkylation reaction containing other metals such as tungsten beside nickel itself. Initially, these catalysts perform at high activity but by time they become less active and reach {{at a point where}} they are no more effective to be used in a commercial process. Considerable research has been carried out on developing the process for regenerating the <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> since nickel is expensive to be discarded and more over, the safe disposal of waste nickel requires consideration of environmental hazard. However, the regenerating process of a nickel <b>catalyst</b> from <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> is tedious, time consuming, and careful attention on detailed procedures. Therefore, there is a continuous afford needed to developing methods of recovering nickel from <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> that provides inexpensive recovery of nickel in a usable form. Several methods have been described in literature regarding recovering nickel not only from <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> but also from other solid an liquid wastes such as using electrowinning, fluidized bed an burning processes.

This culture was initially grown in the 9 K- medium (absence of 9 g/L Fe(II)) where ferrous sulphate (FeSO 4) was replaced by pyrite, and then applied in this bioleaching study. Bacterial action on pyrite catalysed the formation of ferric ion (Fe+ 3), proton (H+) and sulphate ions (SO 4 - 2) in the solution which leached metals (Ni, Mo and V) from the <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst.</b> Experiments were conducted by varying the reaction time, amount of <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> and pyrite, and temperature. After 7 days with 30 g/L of <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> and 50 g/L of pyrite, the leaching of Ni, V and Mo into the solution was 85, 92 and 26 %, respectively. With increasing <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> loading, the extent of metal dissolution was decreased, {{probably due to the}} precipitation of Fe+ 3 as a residue.

Specimens of relatively higher replacement levels exhibit higher rates of deterioration in spite of their superior mechanical strength behavior caused by pozzolanic reaction.

40|$|Hydrotreating, hydrocracking, {{and fluid}} {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC) catalysts are important components of petroleum refining processes. Hydrotreating and hydrocracking catalysts are used to improve the yield of high-quality light oil fractions from heavier crude oil and petroleum feedstocks containing high levels of impurities. FCC catalysts improve the yield of higher octane gasoline from crude oil. Residuum hydrotreating and cracking catalysts are susceptible to irreversible deactivation caused by adsorption of sulfur and by metals impurities, such as vanadium and nickel. The gradual buildup of these impurities in a hydrotreating catalyst eventually plugs the pores and deactivates it. Nickel and vanadium adversely affect the behavior of cracking catalysts, reducing product yield and quality. Replacing deactivated catalysts represents a significant cost in petroleum refining. Equally important are the costs and potential liabilities associated with treating and disposing <b>spent</b> <b>catalysts.</b> For example, recent US Environmental Protection Agency rulings have listed spent hydrotreating and hydrorefining catalysts as hazardous wastes. FCC catalysts, though more easily disposed of as road-base or as filler in asphalt and cement, are still an economic concern {{mainly because of the}} large volumes of <b>spent</b> <b>catalysts</b> generated. New processes are being considered to increase the useful life of catalysts or for meeting more stringent disposal requirements for <b>spent</b> <b>catalysts</b> containing metals. This report discusses a collaborative effort between Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Phillips Petroleum, Inc., to identify promising chemical processes for removing metals adhered to spent hydrodesulfurization (HDS, a type of hydrotreating catalyst) and FCC catalysts.

The FCC catalyst was a rare-earth exchanged Y zeolite in a silica-alumina matrix. X-ray fluorescence analyses showed that the rare earths used in preparing the catalysts were a mixture of lanthanum and cerium. Antimony found in the spent catalyst was added during operation of the FCC unit as a way to suppress the adverse effects of deposited nickel. The fresh HDS samples consisted of sulfided nickel and molybdenum on an alumina support.
