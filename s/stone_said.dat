5|$|After Mr. Garrison gets a nose job, {{his face}} {{resembles that of}} David Hasselhoff, the actor and singer {{best known for the}} series Knight Rider and Baywatch. Mr. Garrison refers disparagingly to the 1997 science fiction drama film Contact. Parker and <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> they {{went out of their way}} to include the {{reference}} due to their own strong distaste for the film.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> {{that he and}} Parker {{were open}} to making a sequel, {{depending}} on the reception for The Stick of Truth. A sequel, South Park: The Fractured but Whole, was announced in June 2015. The game was developed by Ubisoft San Francisco, replacing Obsidian Entertainment, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. The sequel was released worldwide on October 17, 2017 to generally positive reviews.

5|$|Parker and Stone {{were very}} happy with the episode, but {{received}} feedback from fans {{that it was one of}} the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant. Many fans also did not like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had nothing to do with the plot of the episode, which Parker and <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> was supposed to be the joke.|$|E
5|$|Set in a {{separate}} continuity to any other Fire Emblem title, The Sacred Stones takes place on the continent of Magvel, which is divided into five ancient nations, each with a magical <b>stone</b> <b>said</b> {{to be linked to}} the imprisonment of an ancient demon. When the nation of Grado begins invading the other nations and destroying the stones, protagonists Eirika and Ephraim of the royal family of Renais set out to gain allies from the other nations and halt Grado's conquest. The gameplay is similar to previous Fire Emblem games, focusing on turn-based, tactical movement of units across a grid-based battlefield. Core features of the game include permanent death for characters defeated in battle and support conversations that grant advantages to certain units in battle.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews and}} several commentators have {{described it as}} a classic South Park episode. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was viewed by about 2.2 million households during its original broadcast, which at the time was roughly eight times Comedy Central's average viewership. Parker and <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> they were unhappy with the turkey subplot, which they wrote only because they felt obligated to include a B story. Sally Struthers was reportedly deeply offended by her portrayal in the episode. In addition to Starvin' Marvin, who became a popular minor character, the episode introduced regular characters Kyle's father Gerald Broflovski and Kenny's family members Stuart, Carol and Kevin McCormick.|$|E

25|$|In The Trial of Socrates (1988), I. F. <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> that Socrates {{wanted to}} be sentenced to death, {{in order to justify}} his philosophic {{opposition}} to the Athenian democracy of that time, and because, as a man, he saw that old age would be an unpleasant time for him.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, {{the rivalry}} was renewed in another playoff series. In Game 1, Montreal's PK Subban slashed Ottawa's Mark Stone—breaking his wrist—and Subban was later {{kicked out of}} the game. Senators' coach Dave Cameron called the slash vicious and said that Subban deserves a suspension. Ottawa's Clarke MacArthur called it a {{lumberjack}} slash and Mark <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> that he was being targeted all game. Meanwhile, Michel Therrien said that Subban did not deserve to be ejected and should have only gotten a minor penalty. Montreal won that game 4–3. Both Game 2 and Game 3 were decided in overtime, which were both won by Montreal. Riding a 3–0 lead in the series, Montreal saw Ottawa win the next two games, before closing the series in Game 6 with a 2–0 win in Ottawa.|$|E

50|$|No clear {{alternative}} exists {{except to}} work off the debt. The quirky Flower and Stone have a pile of 10,000 heavy <b>stones,</b> <b>said</b> to be from a 15th-century castle originally.

25|$|In 1982, Stone leased sound stages M and L at the Paramount Pictures studio lot, {{for film}} sound recordings. Veteran film scoring {{engineer}} Dan Wallin assisted Stone in the redesign of the studios and {{the selection of}} equipment, including Solid State Logic (SSL) consoles and Hidley studio monitors based on JBL components. Soundtracks that the Record Plant tracked and mixed there include ones forFlashdance, , Annie, 48 Hrs., and An Officer and a Gentleman. Wallin and Stone gave recording industry talks at the Paramount's Scoring Studio M in September 1982, describing how the recording business should expand into motion pictures to counteract flagging profit margins. <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> that, {{in order to be}} recognized by the film worker unions, he formed a separate business entity called Record Plant Scoring, and hired a separate crew of union engineers.|$|E
25|$|Captain Lord {{had gone}} to the {{chartroom}} at 11:00p.m. to spend the night; however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10a.m. that the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted to know if they were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> {{that he did not know}} and that the rockets were all white. Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50a.m. and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15a.m., Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.|$|E
25|$|March 2013, Sky News {{journalist}} Mark Stone and {{his camera}} operator were detained in Tiananmen Square live on British television, {{in what he}} described as a surreal but telling episode about reporting in China. Viewers saw Stone being directed into a police van live from Beijing. The square is a popular tourist site near the regime's nerve centre and the scene of 1989 democracy protests that were crushed by the Chinese authorities. A police officer was filmed asking the Sky team to switch off their camera, saying they were now inside the Forbidden City and did not have permission to film there. While they had permission to film in the square, <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> police told him the team were not displaying their passes correctly, and noted he was not carrying his passport as required. China's foreign ministry insists that press censorship does not exist in the country, but journalists report the constant threat of interference from government officials.|$|E

At the time, American television commentator Dwight <b>Stones</b> <b>said</b> [...] "That is a decision she will think about the rest of her life." ...|$|R
500|$|Although {{the joke}} {{originally}} stemmed from Evel Knievel and not Kanye West, Parker and <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> they realized West {{would probably be}} extremely humorless about the joke and not understand it, so they decided the episode should revolve mostly around him. After {{coming up with the}} idea, Parker and Stone waited a long time before they finally wrote the script because, <b>Stone</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It just seemed too dumb. Are we really going to do a whole episode about this?" [...] <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> the jokes about Carlos Mencia were [...] "just a complete afterthought" [...] that came about during the writing process. During one scene in [...] "Fishsticks", Cartman steals credit from Jimmy for a joke he did not write. This was inspired by people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business who were present for discussions the duo had, then later claimed credit for the idea even though they {{had nothing to do with}} it. <b>Stone</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "They truly believe they did it. That's the really sinister part. It's not where they're trying to steal part of the glory. ... They actually fully believe that they came up with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Lanois {{noted that}} the song had a very [...] "Canadian sound" [...] {{that was like a}} tribute to the Band, calling it the [...] "Simcoe sound".

The song makes {{prominent}} use of organ and piano.|$|E

500|$|<b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> he {{felt the}} episode {{solidified}} major characteristics embodied by the Chef character, particularly {{the fact that he}} is one of the only adults in South Park who always understands the truth of any given situation and believes the children almost all of the time. <b>Stone</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's like the parents are all nuts that live in the town. The boys are kind of the most sane and Chef is really the only one in town who believes the kids when they say (something) is happening, when the kids are actually right and it's the town that's crazy." [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was also the first episode in which Liane Cartman, Eric Cartman's mother, was portrayed as a promiscuous woman who was previously a crack whore and is willing to engage in pornographic sex for money; during the episode, she is mentioned and actually featured on the cover of [...] "Crack Whore Magazine", much to Cartman's shock and dismay.|$|E
500|$|Years {{after its}} release, <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> {{of the film}} that it [...] "was the {{beginning}} of a new era for me in terms of film making because it's not just about a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. It's also about the way we look at our recent history... It shifts from black and white to color, and then back again, and views people from offbeat angles." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Margaritaville" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on March 25, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt <b>Stone</b> <b>said</b> they had long planned to do an episode about the global recession, and they argued over whether to start the season with an episode about the economy, or [...] "The Ring," [...] an episode mocking the Jonas Brothers, a boy band which had recently grown in popularity. Stone argued the season premiere should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. During an interview {{a few weeks before the}} episode aired, <b>Stone</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "That's one of those big things we want to get right. We'll be talking about what kind of social commentary we want to make and do it right." ...|$|E
