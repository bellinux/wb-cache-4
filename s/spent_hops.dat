40|$|Fining {{agents are}} used in the {{clarification}} of beers; they help to reduce the time required to sediment suspended yeast cells and ensure the clarity and colloidal stability of beer. Following an adventitious observation during dry-hopping experiments, we identified a fining activity associated with Saaz hops. Extracts of hop cones were subsequently shown to have the capacity to flocculate yeast and result in their sedimentation. This activity has since been identified in extracts of many different hop varieties and, significantly in <b>spent</b> <b>hops,</b> the co-product resulting from commercial extraction of hops with either CO 2 or ethanol. Here we illustrate the activity of the novel finings extracted from <b>spent</b> <b>hops</b> following CO 2 extraction of Galena hops.

The hop extracts were also effective in reducing 90 ° haze in beers under conditions designed to mimic both cask ale (12 [*]°C) and lager (4 [*]°C) type applications. The compounds responsible for the fining activity appear to be large (30 – 100 [*]kDa, or more) polyphenols.

RESULTS: Pigs fed GSGME or SH showed an improved gain:feed ratio in comparison to the control group (P < 0. 10 for GSGME, P < 0. 05 for SH). Villus height:crypt depth ratio in duodenum and jejunum as well as apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients were unchanged in the groups receiving GSGME or SH in comparison to the control group. However, the groups receiving GSGME or SH revealed an increased faecal pH value, lower levels of volatile fatty acids and lower counts of Streptococcus spp. and Clostridium Cluster XIVa in the faecal microbiota (P < 0. 05).

The estrogenic activity decreased in the order H. lupulus > G. uralensis > G. inflata > G. glabra. Liquiritigenin was found to be the principle phytoestrogen of the licorice extracts; however, it exhibited lower estrogenic effects compared to 8 -prenylnaringenin in functional assays. Isoliquiritigenin, the precursor chalcone of liquiritigenin, demonstrated significant estrogenic activities while xanthohumol, a metabolic precursor of 8 -prenylnaringenin, was not estrogenic. Liquiritigenin showed ERβ selectivity in competitive binding assay and isoliquiritigenin was equipotent for ER subtypes. The estrogenic activity of isoliquiritigenin could be the result of its cyclization to liquiritigenin under physiological conditions. 8 -Prenylnaringenin had nanomolar estrogenic potency without ER selectivity while xanthohumol did not bind ERs. These data demonstrated that Glycyrrhiza species with different contents of liquiritigenin have various levels of estrogenic activities, suggesting the importance of precise labeling of botanical supplements. Although hops shows strong estrogenic properties via ERα, licorice might have different estrogenic activities due to its ERβ selectivity, partial estrogen agonist activity, and non-enzymatic conversion of isoliquiritigenin to liquiritigenin...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from September 22, 2016 - March 22, 2017 Hop aroma in beer {{is related to the}} unique compositional chemistry of the hops used in the brewing process. While the range of these compositions is quite diverse and primarily dependent on hop cultivar¹, other studies have also shown that cultivation, seasonality, harvesting², processing³⁴, and storage practices⁵⁶ contribute to differences in hop composition. However, {{it should be noted that}} the aroma and composition of fresh and processed hops⁷ is different than the subsequent finished beer. This irreconcilable difference that exists between hops and the finished product has been a confounding variable for brewing scientists, in large part due to the complexity and diversity of the compounds that are transferred from hops to beer, but also due to an incomplete understanding of the interactions between these compounds and the aromas they elicit. Of the many compounds found in hops, those belonging to the class known as monoterpene alcohols have consistently been useful indicators of changes in hop aroma due to different brewing practices. Notable differences exist between American and European hops in terms of the types of flavor they contribute to beer. Brewers tend to describe the former as contributing citrusy, fruity and in some instances floral aromas to beer, while the latter are often described as contributing herbal, tobacco, woody, and spicy notes. Single-hop brewing trials were carried out using either American hops (Cascade, Chinook, Centennial, Citra, or Simcoe) or European hops (East Kent Goldings, Hallertau Mittlefrueh HHA or Saaz) to identify hop-derived volatiles that contribute to American hop aroma in beer. The eight resultant beers were evaluated using both sensory and instrumental analyses. The sensory analysis identified Centennial as having the highest piney and green hop aromas, while Citra and Simcoe were characterized as being very fruity, citrusy, and tropical (especially Citra). The Hallertau Mittlefrueh (HHA) beers were similar to the East Kent Goldings, and these two were more floral and rose-like than the Saaz sample with more melon character than the American cultivars. Volatile analysis of the beer samples was performed using a stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) of the beer samples followed by quantification by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In general, the beers brewed with the American hop varieties were higher in aroma and in monoterpene alcohols. In addition to hop oil-derived aroma, previous studies have demonstrated that non-volatile hop-derived precursors, specifically glycosides, survive the boil process and can be hydrolyzed to release volatile aglycones capable of contributing to aroma. To investigate this, twelve single hopped pilot scale beers were brewed using pellet, supercritical extract, and spent hop fractions of Citra, Simcoe, Centennial, or Cascade cultivars in order to investigate the contribution of these different hop fractions to the aroma of kettle hopped beers. The spent hop treatments produced beers that had noticeable, albeit low, hop aroma which suggest that the water-soluble components left behind in the <b>spent</b> <b>hops</b> may contribute to hop aroma. The intensity and nature of the hop aroma in the Spent treatments was hop variety. However, contributions of water soluble components from <b>spent</b> <b>hops</b> to hop aroma in beer was very subtle, especially compared to the pellet and extract treatments. Aqueous extracts of the spent material from pilot scale supercritical CO₂ fluid extraction (SFE) of hop pellets were treated to investigate the impact of different hydrolysis treatments and on the aroma and volatile profile. Aroma profiles were evaluated using descriptive analysis by a trained panel. Volatiles arising from hydrolysis treatments of aqueous extracts of the spent materials were measured using SBSE and GC-MS. The intensity and nature of the hop aroma was treatment specific. Acidic hydrolysis of water soluble extracts produced the most intense Overall and Pine aroma. Differences in the aroma intensities due to the hydrolysis from the addition of different enzyme preparations were present but subtle. Aromas liberated by ale yeast produced different profiles than the lager yeast. All treatments showed increases in aglycone content and changes in aroma profile when treated with hydrolytic enzymes preparations. However, fundamental studies that examine the extraction of glycosides during brewing and their subsequent hydrolysis by yeast have not been fully investigated. Furthermore, extraction of other hop-derived compounds into beer show a strong dependency on the hop cultivar being used and the point at which it is added. Therefore, the extent of glycoside extraction due to hopping regime, cultivar, and their hydrolysis due to yeast β-glucosidase activity was investigated. The glycoside concentration of worts made with three different hopping regimes and three cultivars was measured. Additionally, β-glucosidase activities for 80 different yeast strains and their effect on aglycone concentration in wort was determined. Glycoside content was measured by the difference in volatile aglycone concentrations between samples treated with purified β-glucosidase and untreated samples. Aglycone concentration was measured by SPME GC-MS. Results showed that yeast have a wide range of abilities to hydrolyze glycosides with a maximum hydrolysis occurring after three days of fermentation regardless of yeast activity. Although it was shown that yeast are capable of glycoside hydrolysis, glycoside concentrations in wort are low and have small contributions to hop aroma. These results help explain the extent to which different brewing yeasts and hopping regimes contribute to hoppy beer aroma through the hydrolysis of non-volatile hop-derived compounds. Finally, in order to investigate the effect of hopping regime on the monoterpene alcohol content and sensory attributes of beer, 6 single hop beers were made using different hop additions and evaluated by sensory and instrumental analysis. Beers were brewed while varying two factors: hop cultivar (Simcoe and HHA) and timing of hop addition (60 min. boil, 25 min. whirlpool, or 48 -hour dryhopping). Additionally, the impact of yeast strain on treatment was investigated. Each treatment was compared to an unhopped control using SBSE GC-MS and descriptive sensory analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis were used to described the between relationships between instrumental and sensory results. Whirlpool additions produced beers with the highest concentrations of geraniol, linalool, and β-citronellol; beers brewed with highly aromatic Simcoe hops produced more intense and individually distinct aromas for each hopping regime compared to the HHA hopped beers. Conversely, beers brewed with HHA hops showed less intense aromas with less distinction between hopping regimes, except for the dry-hopped treatment, which was characterized by a more floral type aroma than the other HHA. This research shows that despite the popularity of dry-hopping as an aroma hopping method, whirlpool additions can also produce intensely aromatic beers...|$|E

Exposure to hip hop music videos and viewing of hip hop related television programming was not significantly (p >. 05) related to the internal or external attributes desired for long-term romantic relationships. For short-term sexual relationships, no significant (p >. 05) relationship was found for either hip hop television viewing and internal attributes or hip hop television viewing and external attributes; also for short-term sexual relationships, there was no significant (p >. 05) relationship between hip hop video exposure and external attributes, but there was a significant (p <. 05) relationship between hip hop music video exposure and internal attributes.

60|$|One {{morning he}} {{received}} a long letter from Thorpe Athelny. He was taking his holiday in the theatrical way, {{in which there was}} much sound sense, which characterised him. He had done the same thing for ten years. He took his whole family to a hop-field in Kent, not far from Mrs. Athelny's home, and they <b>spent</b> three weeks <b>hopping.</b> It kept them in the open air, earned them money, much to Mrs. Athelny's satisfaction, and renewed their contact with mother earth. It was upon this that Athelny laid stress. The sojourn in the fields gave them a new strength; it was like a magic ceremony, by which they renewed their youth and the power of their limbs and the sweetness of the spirit: Philip had heard him say many fantastic, rhetorical, and picturesque things on the subject. Now Athelny invited him to come over for a day, he had certain meditations on Shakespeare and the musical glasses which he desired to impart, and the children were clamouring for a sight of Uncle Philip. Philip read the letter again in the afternoon when he was sitting with Mildred on the beach. He thought of Mrs. Athelny, cheerful mother of many children, with her kindly hospitality and her good humour; of Sally, grave for her years, with funny little maternal ways and an air of authority, with her long plait of fair hair and her broad forehead; and then in a bunch of all the others, merry, boisterous, healthy, and handsome. His heart went out to them. There was one quality which they had that he did not remember to have noticed in people before, and that was goodness. It had not occurred to him till now, but it was evidently the beauty of their goodness which attracted him. In theory he did not believe in it: if morality were no more than a matter of convenience good and evil had no meaning. He did not like to be illogical, but here was simple goodness, natural and without effort, and he thought it beautiful. Meditating, he slowly tore the letter into little pieces; he did not see how he could go without Mildred, and {{he did not want to}} go with her.|$|R
