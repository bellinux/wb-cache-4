5000|$|Triangular warning LEDs {{at the top}} {{and bottom}} of the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> <b>scale,</b> to {{indicate}} over- or under-exposure.|$|E
5000|$|A {{vertical}} <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> <b>scale</b> with LEDs {{to indicate}} both the user selected and camera suggested shutter speed (in 'M' mode) {{and the value}} selected ('P' and 'A' modes) by the camera's metering system.|$|E
5000|$|... 1982: Ricoh XR-S (Japan): first solar powered SLR. Was a Ricoh XR-7 (Japan) {{aperture}} priority AE 35 mm SLR of 1981 modified with two silicon photovoltaic {{cells in the}} sides of the pentaprism housing that charged a unique 3 volt 2G13R [...] "5-year" [...] rechargeable silver oxide battery. This battery could be replaced with two regular 1.5 volt S76 (SR44) silver oxide batteries. The XR-7 and XR-S also had unusual viewfinder LCD showing meter pseudo-needle pointing along an analogue <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> <b>scale</b> to indicate light meter recommended settings, mimicking a traditional galvanometer needle.|$|E
5000|$|A {{compromise}} {{for expensive}} rangefinder or SLR or {{twin lens reflex}} cameras was to offer a selenium meter as optional device that could be coupled to the camera's <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> controls. The <b>scale</b> of these instruments show not an exposure value but an aperture value to be set [...] "uncoupled" [...] Examples of Leica and Tessina are shown in the photographs ...|$|R
50|$|These two {{photographs}} are taken under same situation except for camera <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> In above situation, slow <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> makes image more clear and bright because the low <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> takes more light than high <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> However, the high <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> often {{is necessary for}} moving object.|$|R
5000|$|P Program AE (auto-exposure) mode. Exposure is set by {{calculating the}} correct <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> for the given lighting, film {{sensitivity}} and currently-selected aperture. If the calculated <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{is higher than}} the maximum available (1/250th of a second) the aperture is closed to expose with an achievable <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> value. If the calculated <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is lower than the [...] "camera shake" [...] <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> (default 1/30 of a second, but variable from 1/4 to 1/60) the aperture is opened to expose with that <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
50|$|In manual mode, {{the camera}} is {{completely}} mechanical in operation, and only requires batteries for the light metering information system. In aperture priority mode, the batteries continued to power the meter, but are also utilized for shutter timing and the exposure control electronics. The FM3A's metering information system consisted of a match-needle system using two needles pointing along a vertical <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> <b>scale</b> {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40% centerweighted silicon photodiode light meter versus the actual camera settings. This system can be traced back to the Nikkormat EL (Nikomat EL in Japan) of 1972. The viewfinder also has Nikon's fully interchangeable bright focus screen with various options for focus.|$|E
50|$|The FE2 is a {{battery-powered}} (two S76 or A76, or one 1/3N) electro-mechanically controlled manual-focus SLR with {{manual exposure}} control or aperture-priority auto-exposure.It has a match-needle exposure control system using two needles pointing along a vertical <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> <b>scale</b> {{on the left}} side of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40 percent center-weighted light meter versus the actual camera settings.This system can be traced back to the Nikkormat EL (in the USA/Canada; Nikomat EL, rest of the world) of 1972 and continued until 2006 with the Nikon FM3A.The viewfinder also has an interchangeable Type K2 focusing screen with Nikon's standard 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm micro-prism collar focusing aids plus 12 mm etched circle indicating the area of the meter center-weighting.|$|E
50|$|The {{batteries}} also powered the ME F's {{exposure control}} system. This system lit LEDs alongside a vertical <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> <b>scale</b> {{on the left}} side of the viewfinder. In aperture priority mode, a steadily lit LED indicated the shutter speed automatically set by the electronic microprocessor in response to the light reaching the built-in, open aperture, through-the-lens (TTL), centre-weighted gallium arsenide phosphide photodiode (GPD) light meter and the set lens aperture. The LEDs for the speeds between 1/2000th and 1/60th second were green, while those for 1/30th to 4 seconds were yellow to warn of possible picture blur at the slower speeds. A steadily lit red OVER or UNDER LED came on if the scene was out of the meter's exposure range.|$|E
5000|$|Motion blur due {{to subject}} {{movement}} {{can usually be}} prevented by using a faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> The exact <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{will depend on the}} speed at which the subject is moving. For example, a very fast <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> will be needed to [...] "freeze" [...] the rotors of a helicopter, whereas a slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> will be sufficient to freeze a runner.|$|R
50|$|Above two {{photographs}} are taken under same situation except for camera shutter speed.In case of moving object, the low <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is not proper {{to capture the}} object. It needs faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> to capture it. <b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> has pros and cons.For capturing a moving object, photographers must use a high <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> However, the image can be very dark. Low <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> must be used when capturing a clear image or object under the harsh condition, {{but it is hard}} to capture the moving objects.|$|R
5000|$|In manual mode, {{recommended}} <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{is indicated}} by LEDs. The chosen <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is shown in a separate window.|$|R
5000|$|The FE is a manual-focus SLR with manual {{exposure}} control or aperture-priority autoexposure, and electromechanical components. As such, the FE requires batteries (two S76 or A76, or LR44 or SR44, or one 1/3N) to power its electronically controlled shutter. The batteries also power the FE's [...] "match-needle" [...] exposure control system. This {{consists of two}} needles pointing along a vertical <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> <b>scale</b> {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder. In manual mode, a black needle points out the shutter speed recommended by the built-in, open aperture, through-the-lens (TTL), silicon photodiode (SPD) light meter, with 60/40 percent centerweighting, while a translucent green needle shows the actual camera-set shutter speed. The photographer adjusts the shutter speed and/or the lens aperture f-stop until the needles align.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon EM {{formed the}} base of the new line. It was the {{smallest}} and cheapest SLR ever made by Nippon Kogaku. It was a battery-powered (two S76 or A76, or one 1/3N) electromechanically controlled manual focus SLR. The EM featured a lightweight and compact hybrid copper aluminum alloy body and fiberglass reinforced polycarbonate plastic top and bottom covers, plus aperture priority semiautomatic exposure control governed by a built-in 60/40 percent centerweighted, silicon photodiode light meter. A left side viewfinder galvanometer needle pointer indicated the exposure on a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> <b>scale.</b> The viewfinder also had Nikonâ€™s standard 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm microprism collar focusing aids, but the focus screen was fixed. The viewfinder is dimmer than those in the semi-professional Nikons since the expensive prisms of the latter were not used. The camera is also fitted with a low-light exposure warning {{in the form of an}} audible 'beep'.|$|E
5000|$|A Aperture {{priority}} AE mode. Exposure is set by {{calculating the}} correct <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> or the given lighting, film sensitivity and currently-selected aperture. If that <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{is not available}} the photo is taken with the closest available <b>shutter</b> <b>speed,</b> but the aperture value is not varied.|$|R
5000|$|Tv (<b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> priority): The camera {{lets the}} user set the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and {{automatically}} sets the aperture for correct exposure.|$|R
50|$|The Konica Hexar RF meters for {{exposure}} either by aperture priority auto-exposure (with AE lock and +/-2EV exposure compensation) or in metered-manual mode. Aperture priority is selected by setting the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial {{to either the}} AE or AE lock position. Manual exposure is set by selecting a specific <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> on the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial (there is a central interlock button to prevent accidentally moving the dial from the AE modes to a manually selected <b>shutter</b> <b>speed).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{duration}} of an exposure {{is referred to}} as <b>shutter</b> <b>speed,</b> often even in cameras that do not have a physical shutter, and is typically measured in fractions of a second. It is quite possible to have exposures from one up to several seconds, usually for still-life subjects, and for night scenes exposure times can be several hours. However, longer <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> blur motion, and shorter <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> freeze motion. Therefore, moving subjects require fast <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{ability of}} the {{photographer}} to take images without noticeable blurring by camera movement is an important parameter {{in the choice of}} the slowest possible <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> for a handheld camera. The rough guide used by most 35 mm photographers is that the slowest <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> that can be used easily without much blur due to camera shake is the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> numerically closest to the lens focal length. For example, for handheld use of a 35 mm camera with a 50 mm normal lens, the closest <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is 1/60 s (closest to [...] "50"), while for a 200 mm lens it is recommended not to choose <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> below 1/200th of a second. This rule can be augmented with knowledge of the intended application for the photograph, an image intended for significant enlargement and closeup viewing would require faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> to avoid obvious blur. Through practice and special techniques such as bracing the camera, arms, or body to minimize camera movement, using a monopod or a tripod, slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> can be used without blur. If a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is too slow for hand holding, a camera support, usually a tripod, must be used. Image stabilization on digital cameras or lenses can often permit the use of <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> 3-4 stops slower (exposures 8-16 times longer).|$|R
50|$|When using most Zorki cameras, the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{should only}} be set after the shutter has been cocked. Setting the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> before the <b>shutter</b> is cocked can {{permanently}} damage the camera. This especially affects all Zorki cameras with slow <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> under 1/30 of a second, in particular the Zorki-3 and Zorki-4.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> do not factor into {{guide number}} {{calculations}} and, {{for the most}} part, {{have no effect on}} electronic flash exposures. See Effect of <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds,</b> below.|$|R
50|$|In manual mode, a green M LED came on. The OVER or UNDER LED would blink to {{indicate}} the exposure adjustment recommended by the meter, while a steadily lit LED showed the actual camera set <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> The photographer would adjust the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and/or the lens aperture f-stop until the OVER or UNDER LED went out. Unlike most other SLRs of the era, the ME F used two push buttons to increase or decrease <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> instead of the traditional dial and this LED scale is the only display of the set <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> What {{appeared to be a}} <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial on autoexposure M-series SLRs was actually the exposure mode dial: AUTO meant aperture priority and M was for manual.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to its effect on exposure, the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> changes the way movement appears in photographs. Very short <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> {{can be used to}} freeze fast-moving subjects, for example at sporting events. Very long <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> are used to intentionally blur a moving subject for effect. Short exposure times are sometimes called [...] "fast", and long exposure times [...] "slow".|$|R
5000|$|... 1983: Pentax Super A (Japan; called Super Program in USA): first SLR with {{external}} LCD data display. With push buttons for <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> selection {{instead of a}} <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial, the Super Program used an LCD to show set <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> As computerized SLR features multiplied, large external LCD panels became normal on virtually all 35 mm SLRs by the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|In 'M' (Manual Exposure Control) mode, {{the user}} selects both {{aperture}} and <b>shutter</b> <b>speed,</b> and the metering system provides a suggested <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> (indicated in the viewfinder) for the selected aperture.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is {{critical}} to catching motion, thus sports photography is often done in shutter priority mode or manual. A frequent goal is to capture an instant with minimal blur, in which case a minimal <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is desired, but in other cases a slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is used so that blur shows to capture the motion, not simply the instant. A particular technique is panning, where the camera uses an intermediate <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and pans with the subject, yielding a relatively sharp subject and a background blurred {{in the direction of}} motion, yielding a sense of speed - compare speed lines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> are not {{a factor}} in the {{calculation}} of guide numbers. For most modern cameras (those with focal-plane <b>shutters),</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> has no effect on flash exposures. See Shutter (photography) for more.|$|R
5000|$|Focal plane cloth <b>shutter,</b> with <b>speed</b> B,1/30,1/2,1/4,1/8,1/15,1/60,1/125,1/250 and 1/500 sec. Change <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{only after}} <b>shutter</b> cocked ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is {{the length}} of time when the film or digital sensor inside the camera is exposed to light. Object and image can be shown {{differently}} by <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> Below are the examples.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> {{range from}} 30 seconds to 1/8000 {{of a second}} in all {{exposure}} modes. A non-timed bulb speed is available. Flash X-sync is available up to a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> of 1/250 of a second.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{one might}} wish to {{photograph}} a waterfall at a slow <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> to create a deliberate motion-blur effect. The photographer might determine that to obtain the desired effect, a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> of ten seconds was needed. On a very bright day, there might be so much light that even at minimal film speed and a minimal aperture, the ten-second <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> would let in too much light, and the photo would be overexposed. In this situation, applying an appropriate neutral-density filter {{is the equivalent of}} stopping down one or more additional stops, allowing the slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and the desired motion-blur effect.|$|R
50|$|The rings {{controlling}} the effective lens diameter (from f/2.8 to f/22) and the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> are mechanically linked so that once one combination has been matched to the ambient lighting conditions, a faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> can be selected {{and a larger}} effective lens diameter will automatically be set when possible. For instance, one might start with a setting of f/11 and 1/250 second, but decide that the moving target demanded the higher <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> of 1/500. Simply setting that <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> without changing the effective lens aperture would result in an underexposure, but the Ricoh 500 will automatically change the aperture setting to f/8.|$|R
50|$|Faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> are {{achieved}} by the second curtain closing before the first one has fully opened; {{this results in a}} vertical slit that travels horizontally across the film. Faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> simply require a narrower slit, as the speed of travel of the shutter curtains is not normally varied. Using this technique, modern SLR cameras are capable of <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to 1/2000, 1/4000 or even 1/8000 of a second.|$|R
50|$|The EVF {{live view}} mode also allows {{a preview of}} the actual {{exposure}} in manual mode. The user can adjust <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and aperture in manual mode and see the actual effect on the recorded exposure in the EVF. In addition to the usual depth of field preview, the GH1 allows a unique <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> effect preview, giving the user a fairly accurate preview of the finished image blurring when using a slow <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because leaf {{shutters}} synchronized electronic flash at all <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> {{especially at}} fast <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> of [...] {{of a second}} or faster, cameras using leaf shutters were more desirable to studio photographers who used sophisticated studio electronic flash systems.|$|R
50|$|The FT used a metal-bladed, {{vertical}} travel, {{focal plane}} <b>shutter</b> with a <b>speed</b> range of 1 to 1/1000 second plus Bulb and flash X-sync of 1/125th second. The Nikkormat F-series had a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> ring concentric with the lens mount, unlike Nippon Kogaku's other manual focus SLRs {{with a top}} mounted <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial.|$|R
