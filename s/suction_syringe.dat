40|$|Background: Suction blister {{epidermal}} grafting (SBEG) is {{a simple}} and effective way of surgical repigmentation in vitiligo. The major problem faced is the time taken {{for the formation of}} blisters. Temperature at the suction site is one of the factors affecting the blister formation time. Aims and Objectives: To reduce the blister formation time in SBEG by increasing the surface temperature to 44 °C. Materials and Methods: This is a left-right comparison study. Total seven patients with lip vitiligo involving both the angles of lips were enrolled. <b>Suction</b> <b>syringes</b> were applied on both the thighs of all the patients. On the right thigh, blisters were raised as per the procedure standardised by Gupta et al. On the left thigh, similar procedure was used, but a hair dryer was used additionally to increase the surface temperature of the skin to 44 °C. The time taken for the formation of well-formed, dome-shaped, unilocular blister was noted. Results: The mean time taken for the formation of blister on the right thigh was 121. 1 ± 6. 2 min and on the left thigh was 69. 6 ± 5. 4 min. All the seven patients were started on PUVASOL after SBEG. There was complete repigmentation of the grafted sites in all the patients after 2 months. Conclusion: Hair dryer is easily available, affordable and simple to use and the time saved during the procedure is quite significant...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Seroma formation, {{a common}} {{postoperative}} complication in reconstructive cases, {{can lead to}} capsular contracture and increased office visits and expenses. The authors present a safe, novel technique for ensuring the thorough removal of serous fluid in the outpatient setting. By relying on access with an angiocatheter, potential injury to permanent implants is minimized. The use of low continuous wall suction obviates the need of manual <b>suction</b> via multiple <b>syringes</b> and offers a rapid and thorough evacuation {{of all types of}} seromas...|$|R
40|$|The device {{consists}} of a three way check valve connected to the <b>syringe,</b> compression and <b>suction.</b> The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the effect of using various syringes on the fluid behavior. Theoretical analysis is carried out to study the influence of syringe diameter, valve geometry, and fluid viscosity to obtain the maximum flow rate. This work summarizes the results of the CFD analyses. In compression, the three-dimensional simulations indicate a flow turning when the syringe diameter is big. On the other hand, it is shown for small syringe diameter using low viscous fluid, the flow pattern is complex with multiple vortex structure. In <b>suction,</b> the <b>syringe</b> diameter has no effect on the pressure distribution. Future work includes improving the CFD analysis methodology. Unsteady is recommended. This study is crucial in drug delivery. Also, more studies will focus on non-Newtonian drugs...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} biopsy {{instruments}} are in use. The Novak curette {{is a thin}} metallic tube with a side opening at the tip; <b>suction</b> with attached <b>syringe</b> {{can be applied to}} help to remove tissue.The Pipelle is a more flexible plastic tube with a side opening at the tip. A smaller tube (internal piston) inside the Pipelle is withdrawn to create suction. Meanwhile, the pipelle is rotated and moved outwards from the fundus to the internal os to collect small pieces of endometrial tissue.|$|R

Instead of using two separate closed suction drainage system we modified our method by using a 3 way cannula which could accept 2 draining tubes to be connected to one 50 cc <b>syringe</b> with negative <b>suction</b> pressure...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{electric}} cigarette exposure on lung tissue of mice were studied. The experiments using completely randomized design (CRD) with 3 treatments, i. e. treatment of electric cigarette with strawberry flavour, tobacco flavour, and control treatment {{that was not}} exposed by cigarette smoke. Eight male mice were used for each group. Exposure treatment was done every day for 2 consecutive weeks with dosage 20 times <b>suction</b> using <b>syringe</b> of 60 mL. After receiving treatment for 2 weeks, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The lungs were isolated and prepared histologically using paraffin method and then stained with by haematoxylin and eosin (HE). The results showed that, smoke treatment mice lose weight significantly (p 0. 05) [...] In summary short period exposure to electric cigarette smoke tends affect lung damage in anatomy, but statistically has no effect of {{the damage to the}} lung tissue...|$|R
500|$|A spermiating male {{indicates}} successful {{production of}} mature spermatozoa {{which results in}} the release of large volumes of milt {{over the course of}} three to four days. Milt is collected by inserting a short plastic tube with syringe attached into the urogenital opening of the male and applying light <b>suction</b> with the <b>syringe</b> to draw the milt. The collected milt is diluted in water just prior to adding it to the eggs and the combination is gently stirred for about a minute to achieve fertilization. Fertilized eggs are adhesive and demersal, therefore if incubation is to take place in a flow-through hatching jar, the eggs must be treated to prevent clumping. [...] Incubation usually takes anywhere from five to twelve days.|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Gastric {{residual}} volume (GRV) is a clinical assessment to evaluate gastric emptying and enteral feeding tolerance. Factors {{such as the}} tube size, tube material, tube port configuration, placement of the tube in the gastric fluid, the amount of fluid and person completing the assessment may influence the accuracy of {{residual volume}} assessment. Little {{attention has been paid}} to assessing the accuracy of GRV measurement when the actual volume being aspirated is known, and no studies have compared the accuracy in obtaining RV using the three different techniques reported in the literature that are used to obtain aspirate in practice (<b>syringe,</b> <b>suction,</b> and gravity drainage). This in vitro study evaluated three different methods for aspirating feeding formula through two different tube sizes (10 Fr [small] and 18 Fr [large]), tube materials (polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane), using four levels of nursing experience (student, novice, experienced and expert) blinded to the five fixed fluid volumes of feeding formula in a simulated stomach, to determine if the RV can be accurately obtained. The study design consisted of a 3 x 2 x 2 x 4 x 5 completely randomized factorial ANOVA (with a total of 240 cells) and 479 RV assessments were made by the four nurse participants. All three methods (<b>syringe,</b> <b>suction</b> and gravity) used to aspirate RV did not perform substantially well in aspirating fluid, and on average, the methods were able to aspirate about 50 % of the volume available. The <b>syringe</b> and <b>suction</b> techniques were comparable and produced higher proportions of RVs, although the interrater reliability of RV assessment was better with the syringe method. The gravity technique generally performed poorly. Overall, the polyvinyl chloride material and smaller tubes were associated with higher RV assessments. RV assessment is a variable assessment and the three methods did not perform well in this in vitro study. These findings should be further explored and confirmed using larger samples. This knowledge will be important in establishing the best technique for assessing RV to maximize EN delivery in practice and will contribute to future research to test strategies to optimize EN intake in critically ill patients...|$|R
40|$|Although thicker needles {{theoretically}} {{allow more}} tissue to be collected, their decreased flexibility can cause mechanical {{damage to the}} endoscope, technical failure, and sample blood contamination. The effects of needle gauge on diagnostic outcomes of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) of pancreatic mass lesions remain unknown. This study compared procurement rates of histologic cores obtained from EUS-FNB of pancreatic masses using 25 - and 22 -gauge core biopsy needles. From March 2014 to July 2014, 66 patients with solid pancreatic mass underwent EUS-FNB with both 25 - and 22 -gauge core biopsy needles. Among them, 10 patients were excluded and thus 56 patients were eligible for the analyses. Needle sequences were randomly assigned, and two passes were made with each needle, consisting of 10 uniform to-and-fro movements on each pass with 10 mL <b>syringe</b> <b>suction.</b> A pathologist blinded to needle sequence evaluated specimens {{for the presence of}} histologic core. The mean patient age was 65. 8 ± 9. 5 years (range, 44 - 89 years); 35 patients (62. 5 %) were men. The mean pancreatic mass size was 35. 3 ± 17. 1 mm (range 14 - 122. 3 mm). Twenty-eight patients (50 %) had tumors at the pancreas head or uncinate process. There {{were no significant differences in}} procurement rates of histologic cores between 25 -gauge (49 / 56, 87. 5 %) and 22 -gauge (46 / 56, 82. 1 %, P = 0. 581) needles or diagnostic accuracy using only histologic cores (98 % and 95 %). There were no technical failures or procedure-related adverse events. The 25 -gauge core biopsy needle could offer acceptable and comparable outcomes regarding diagnostic performance including histologic core procurement rates compared to the 22 -gauge core biopsy needle, although the differences were not statistically significant.

40|$|For routine EUS-guided {{sampling}} of solid masses and lymph nodes (LNs) ESGE recommends 25 G or 22 G needles (high quality evidence, strong recommendation); fine needle aspiration (FNA) and fine needle biopsy (FNB) needles are equally recommended (high quality evidence, strong recommendation). When the primary aim of sampling is {{to obtain a}} core tissue specimen, ESGE suggests using 19 G FNA or FNB needles or 22 G FNB needles (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). ESGE recommends using 10 -mL <b>syringe</b> <b>suction</b> for EUS-guided {{sampling of}} solid masses and LNs with 25 G or 22 G FNA needles (high quality evidence, strong recommendation) {{and other types of}} needles (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). ESGE suggests neutralizing residual negative pressure in the needle before withdrawing the needle from the target lesion (moderate quality evidence, weak recommendation). ESGE does not recommend for or against using the needle stylet for EUS-guided sampling of solid masses and LNs with FNA needles (high quality evidence, strong recommendation) and suggests using the needle stylet for EUS-guided sampling with FNB needles (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). ESGE suggests fanning the needle throughout the lesion when sampling solid masses and LNs (moderate quality evidence, weak recommendation). ESGE equally recommends EUS-guided sampling with or without on-site cytologic evaluation (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation). When on-site cytologic evaluation is unavailable, ESGE suggests performance of three to four needle passes with an FNA needle or two to three passes with an FNB needle (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). For diagnostic sampling of pancreatic cystic lesions without a solid component, ESGE suggests emptying the cyst with a single pass of a 22 G or 19 G needle (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). For pancreatic cystic lesions with a solid component, ESGE suggests sampling of the solid component using the same technique {{as in the case of}} other solid lesions (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). ESGE does not recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for EUS-guided sampling of solid masses or LNs (low quality evidence, strong recommendation), and suggests antibiotic prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones or beta-lactam antibiotics for EUS-guided sampling of cystic lesions (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). ESGE suggests that evaluation of tissue obtained by EUS-guided sampling should include histologic preparations (e.  g., cell blocks and/or formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue fragments) and should not be limited to smear cytology (low quality evidence, weak recommendation...|$|R
