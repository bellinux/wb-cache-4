25|$|Critical to {{behavior}} analytic interventions {{is the concept}} of a systematic behavioral case formulation with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core. This approach should apply a behavior analytic theory of change (see Behavioral change theories). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a <b>sequential</b> <b>analysis</b> (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain) and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue that behavior analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior. Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the problem behaviors as well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Refactoring is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} technique to improve the structure of object-oriented software. Nevertheless, existing tool support remains restricted to automatically applying refactoring transformations. Deciding what to refactor and which refactoring to apply still remains a difficult manual process, due to the many dependencies and interrelationships between relevant refactorings. In this paper, we represent refactorings as graph transformations, and we propose the techniques of critical pair <b>analysis</b> and <b>sequential</b> dependency <b>analysis</b> to detect the implicit dependencies between refactorings. The results of this analysis can help the developer to make an informed decision of which refactoring is most suitable in a given context and why. We report on several experiments we {{carried out in the}} AGG graph transformation tool to support our claims.

The model is built using <b>sequential</b> pattern <b>analysis</b> and uses the algorithm SPAM. We consider an ideal career corresponding to a student which has taken each examination just after the end of the corresponding course, without delays. The frequent patterns identified by the <b>sequential</b> pattern <b>analysis</b> are then compared with the career of the ideal student. The most interesting patterns are then used to refine the analysis by using clustering techniques. Finally, we apply this methodology to a real case study and interprete the results. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{simultaneous}} pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) population analysis using an Iterative Two-Stage Bayesian (ITSB) algorithm was developed. The method was evaluated using clinical data and Monte Carlo simulations. Data from a clinical study with rocuronium in nine anesthetized patients and data generated by Monte Carlo simulation using {{a similar study}} design were analysed by <b>sequential</b> PK-PD <b>analysis,</b> PD analysis with nonparametric PK data and simultaneous PK-PD analysis. Both PK and PD data sets were 'rich' {{with respect to the}} number of measurements per individual. The accuracy and precision of the estimated population parameters were evaluated by comparing their mean error (ME) and root mean squared error (RMSE), respectively. The influence of PD model misspecification on the results was also investigated. The simultaneous PK-PD analysis resulted in slightly more precise population parameter estimates than the <b>sequential</b> PK-PD <b>analysis</b> and the nonparametric PK method. In the presence of PD model misspecification, however, simultaneous analysis resulted in poor PK parameter estimates, while <b>sequential</b> PK-PD <b>analysis</b> performed well. In conclusion, ITSB is a valuable technique for PK-PD population analysis of rich data sets. The sequential PK-PD method is better suited for the analysis of rich data than the simultaneous analysis.

40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{development}} of a <b>sequential</b> injection/stripping <b>analysis</b> method for the determination of trace Pb(II) at injection–moulded electrochemical fluidic cells. Conducting carbon fibre–loaded polystyrene electrodes were integrated within the plastic cells. The flow-through cells were incorporated into a home-made <b>sequential</b> injection <b>analysis</b> (SIA) manifold. Different experimental parameters for the detection of Pb(II) were investigated including the type and concentration of the supporting electrolyte, the conditions of the stripping step, the volume of the sample, the flow rate and the accumulation potential. The LOD for Pb(II) was 0. 53 μg L− 1, the within-cell % relative standard deviation (n= 8) was 3. 1 % and the between-cell % relative standard deviation (n= 5) was 8. 9 % for 25 μg L− 1 Pb(II). The cells were applied to the determination of Pb(II) in tapwater and a phosphate fertilizer sample...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY-An {{indirect}} radioimmunoassay {{was developed}} for the <b>sequential</b> adsorption <b>analysis</b> of rabbit antibodies raised against rat neuroectodermal cells. The quantitative relationship between primary 'adsorbed rabbit antitumor antibodies and secondary adsorbed goat antibodies to rabbit IgG was explored by paired radioiodine analysis. In the final indirect method, the amount of unlabeled rabbit antibody removed by cultured monolayers of cells at each step in a sequence of cells could be determined from an equation relating the unlabeled amount to values of bound 1251 -labeled goat antirabbit IgG. To obtain the total quantity of rabbit antibody in a particular 'antiserum reagent, a <b>sequential</b> adsorption <b>analysis</b> was done with suc-cessive steps of homologous cells. To obtain the amount of antibody that was cross-reactive for other cell lines, we included those lines in the first several steps of the sequence. Th...|$|R
