Previous research indicates loess-derived soils are thin or absent on the ridge top and thin and poorly developed on adjacent slopes due to severe, EuroAmerican agriculture-induced erosion and are not suitable for community gardens. The purpose of our research is to determine if lower slope and valley settings are appropriate for community gardens, based on: public accessibility, access to sunlight, well water availability, and appropriate soil fertility. Two soil profiles in toeslope and two in valley positions were described using Natural Resource Conservation Service methods. The other criteria were assessed using ESRI ArcGIS software (hillshade and slope aspect tools) and LIDAR data. Soil profiles observed formed in sandy bedrock and glacial outwash-derived alluvium (valley) and slopewash (toeslope) overlain by silt (redeposited loess eroded from above).

The investigated plant communities are associated with Arenosols that developed from eolian sands and are exposed to high groundwater levels. The presence of fossil Histosol {{at a depth of}} 75 cm in the Vu-Bp stand, which lies below the current groundwater level, is the factor that sets both stands apart. The fossil soil strongly differs from Arenosol in terms of its chemical composition. A high abundance of nutrients in bioavailable forms in the soil {{is one of the reasons}} for natural renewal of downy birch in the stand, which presence in turn affects the turnover of elements and the properties of Arenosol. The results of our studies confirm the existence of strong feedback between the soil and plant communities. Soils under the mixed pine-birch Vu-Bp stand are characterized by smaller stocks of organic matter and total organic carbon (TOC) contained in the ectohumus as compared to the soils under the pure pine En-P stand. The opposite is found in the humic horizon. Additionally, in the Vu-Bp stand we observed greater accumulation of total nitrogen (TN) in ectohumus, which is reflected in lower TOC:TN ratios. The contents of TN and TOC:TN ratios in humic horizons were similar in both stands. The soils under En-P were more strongly acidified, especially in O-horizons. Mineral horizons in both stands were characterized by a very small sorptive capacity, which increased in ectohumus and fossil soil. Significant differences between the stands were observed in the ionic composition of sorptive complexes. The soils under Vu-Bp stand were more strongly saturated with basic cations, predominantly calcium. In soil <b>solums</b> of both stands, we observed a deficit of bioavailable potassium and magnesium, which was partially compensated by significant amounts of these components in ectohumus and fossil soil in the Vu-Bp stand. Despite a strongly acidic pH, molar Ca:Al ratios suggest that there are no phytotoxic effects due to free aluminium in ectohumus, while they are unlikely in mineral horizons.

40|$|Selective {{sequential}} extraction {{techniques that}} partition soil selenium (Se) into different particulate-bound fractions {{have been developed}} to provide information regarding the geochemical and soil processes controlling Se transformation, dynamics and bioavailability within the soil environment. However, none of these earlier extraction techniques considered the fraction of Se bound to metal-organic complexes, a very physicochemically reactive soil component. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the distribution of particulate-bound Se fractions (including Se bound to metal-organic complexes) within selected soil profiles developed on undifferentiated glacial till parent material in the major soil zones of Saskatchewan and currently used in agricultural production; and (2) relate the occurrence and distribution of the particulatebound Se fractions to a Se bioavailability index (SBI). Concentrations of total Se and the SBI in the soil profiles studied ranged from 0. 263 to 1. 295 mg kg- 1 soil and 0. 006 to 0. 047 mg kg- 1 soil, respectively. Total soil Se was partitioned into seven particulate-bound fractions: water soluble, exchangeable, carbonate-bound, metal-organic complex-bound, amorphous mineral colloid-bound, organic-bound and residual. The percent recovery of total Se ranged from 86. 8 to 112. 2 %, with an average value of 96. 8 %. The water soluble, exchangeable, carbonatebound, and amorphous mineral colloid-bound Se fractions accounted for 1. 0 to 3. 9 %, 0. 3 to 4. 4 %, 3. 0 to 4. 6 %, and 0. 5 to 4. 0 % of the total soil Se, respectively. The metalorganic complex-bound, organic-bound and residual Se fractions accounted for 7. 4 to 37. 5 %, 6. 8 to 20. 7 %, and 44. 2 to 77. 4 % of total soil Se, respectively. Thus, the results indicated that metal-organic complex-bound Se accounted for a significant proportion of total soil Se. Further, the results have provided the first information pertaining to the distribution of particulate-bound Se fractions in Canadian soils. Water soluble, metal-organic complex-bound and organic-bound Se fractions were significantly correlated with the SBI; thus, any of these three Se fractions could potentially contribute to bioavailable Se. Because water soluble Se accounted for a small proportion of total soil Se and was much less than the SBI {{in the vast majority of}} the soil horizons of the <b>solums,</b> the results suggest that metal-organic complex-bound Se could play a relatively significant role in contributing to bioavailable Se...|$|R

S. and ·its influence on the production of maize are discussed. Morphologic characteristics, typically associated with soils are grey matrix colours, soft plinthite, yellow brown apedal B-horizons and E-horizons. Observations in piezometers, installed at various localities in the research area, suggest that the free water accumulates on paleo-surfaces. The paleo-surfaces, covered by <b>solums</b> derived from aeolian sand, consists of gleyed clayey paleosols or the weathering products of underlying rocks. The free water is phreatic and its presence over long periods can be inferred from the morphology of the soil. High concentrations of cations and anions in the free water reach the root zones and influence the nutrition of plants. The height of capillary rise to the rootzone for different flood densities was calculated to evaluate the influence of fluctuating water tables on the supply of water to plants. The maximum height of capillary rise in clay, calcrete, hard plinthite and sand was measured. A · technique was developed for this purpose. Various implements used by farmers in the area for tillage of sandy soils, were evaluated. A threetine ripper gave the best results. Experiments to evaluate the influence of water content and various implements on the compaction of soils were used to set guidelines for tillage-practices in the area investigated. Collapse settlement took place with saturation, causing consolidation which eliminate the positive effect of tillage; In oedometer tests, the internal resistance against compaction exceeded matrix potential at void ratios of 0, 71 and less. The pore diameter, where the internal resistance against compression equals matrix potential, was calculated experimentally as 0, 0327 mm. Extremely high water tables are unfavourable for the cultivation of maize. Water tables that reach the roots, through capillary action, but fluctuates deeper than the depth of tillage, will supply water to plants during dry periods, without resulting in harmful anaerobic conditions. Soils with water tables fluctuating within this reach during the growth season, could be advantageous for the cultivation of maize. Soil in which water tables are too deep for capillary water to reach the root zone, may regarded be as high risk soils. Doctora...|$|R

This paper presents {{some general}} points relative to trace metals (especially lead) in « natural » soils. These are agricultural or forested soils {{which have not}} been buried by archaeological material and the morphology of which, inherited from the action of soil forming processes, has not been totally erased by anthropogenic reworking. Are briefly mentioned and illustrated: the definition of “natural pedogeochemical concentrations” and “usual agricultural contents”; statistical data for more than 10000 ploughed surface horizons nation-wide and 260 soil pits studied in the Nord-Pas de Calais region; the low mobility of lead in soils (with the noticeable exception of Podzosols); the fluxes of atmospheric fallout and their high variability in space and time; two techniques used in order to detect anthropogenic contaminations and assess their levels: relative topsoil enhancement (RTE) and “vertical comparison”. The RTE is the mere ratio of the total lead concentration in the surface layer (0 - 15 cm) divided by the concentration found {{at a depth of}} 30 - 45 cm. A value > 4 may indicate strong contamination by human activities. Unfortunately, this ratio is highly depending on the pedological nature of the semi-deep horizon and must be cautiously handled. It seems better to resort to the “vertical comparison” which is a simple and inexpensive approach. The latter consists in interpreting the distribution of total lead contents with depth, for 4 - 5 or 6 superposed horizons. A high lead content in the topsoil contrasting with low values at depth is rather an evidence of pollution. On the contrary, a high concentration in the topsoil keeping steady or going increasing with depth is rather the indication of a natural geochemical anomaly...|$|R
40|$|In {{thinking}} about fidelity {{and change in}} constitutional interpretation, many have framed the basic choice as being between originalism and living constitutionalism. Consider, for example, Jack M. Balkin’s Living Originalism, Robert W. Bennett and Lawrence B. <b>Solum’s</b> Constitutional Originalism: A Debate, and John O. McGinnis and Michael B. Rappaport’s Originalism and the Good Constitution. I shall argue for the superiority of what Ronald Dworkin called “moral readings of the Constitution” and what what Sotirios A. Barber and I have called a “philosophic approach” to constitutional interpretation. By “moral reading” and “philosophic approach,” I refer to conceptions of the Constitution as embodying abstract moral and political principles – not codifying concrete historical rules or practices – and of interpretation of those principles as requiring normative judgments about how they are best understood – not merely historical research to discover relatively specific original meanings. I shall argue that Dworkin’s and my conceptions of fidelity and change are superior to those of originalism in its many varieties. For our moral readings enable us to see what originalisms (besides Balkin’s) obscure or deny: {{that one of the}} main purposes of the Constitution is to exhort us to change in order to honor our aspirational principles and affirmatively to pursue good things like the ends proclaimed in the Preamble. Thus, the aspiration to fidelity requires rather than forbids change. But it does so in the name of honoring our commitments and building out our framework of constitutional self-government with coherence, integrity, and responsibility, rather than in the name of “updating” a “living” constitution. It aims for something better than preventing “rot,” as Scalia famously put it. I shall attempt to make good on these claims by arguing that moral readings help us better understand the Constitution as both a framework for change and a charter of aspirations to which we owe fidelity. They enable us to see how the multiple modalities of argument in constitutional interpretation (including original public meaning and precedent), rather than preventing change, are sites in which we argue about, and sources through which we justify, change: in particular, how best to realize and thus to be faithful to our constitutional aspirations. Or, as Dworkin put it, how to interpret the Constitution so as to make it the best it can be. In sum, my topic is fidelity without originalism and change without living constitutionalism. I also ponder the reasons for the grip of originalism in our constitutional culture as contrasted with its rejection elsewhere. I shall suggest that the reasons commonly offered in fact demonstrate the grip of the aspiration to fidelity, not the grip of originalism itself. And I shall contend that those reasons in fact show the need for a moral reading or philosophic approach that conceives fidelity as redeeming the promise of our constitutional commitments, not an authoritarian originalist conception of fidelity as following the relatively specific original meaning (or original expected applications) of the Constitution...|$|R

Variety stated that the film was [...] "a superbly mounted, convincingly told adventure thriller. Action scenes, such as the helicopter attack, are excitingly staged, and the suspense never lets up. As the rugged Tom, Helge Jordal is very good." [...] However, the magazine criticized the title.|$|E

The early material referring to the Celtic tonsure emphasises its distinctiveness from the Roman alternative and invariably connects its use to the Celtic dating of Easter. Those preferring the Roman tonsure considered the Celtic custom extremely unorthodox, and associated it with the form of tonsure worn by the heresiarch Simon Magus. This association appears in a 672 letter from Saint Aldhelm to King Geraint of Dumnonia, but it may have been circulating since the Synod of Whitby. The tonsure is also mentioned in a passage, probably of the 7th century but attributed wrongly to Gildas: [...] "Britones toti mundo contrarii, moribus Romanis inimici, non <b>solum</b> in missa sed in tonsura etiam" [...] ("Britons are contrary to the whole world, enemies of Roman customs, not only in the Mass but also in regard to the tonsure").|$|E
