5|$|There were an {{estimated}} 106,000 <b>Scientists</b> <b>in</b> the United States in 1990 (427 per million), according to Rodney Stark.

5|$|Christian Science went on {{to become}} the {{fastest-growing}} American religion in the early 20th century. The federal religious census recorded 85,717 Christian <b>Scientists</b> <b>in</b> 1906; 30 years later it was 268,915. In 1890 there were seven Christian Science churches in the United States, a figure that had risen to 1,104 by 1910. Churches began to appear in other countries too: 58 in England, 38 in Canada and 28 elsewhere by 1910.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with these}} {{proposals}} to examine nuclear {{power as a}} possible response to climate change, anti-nuclear campaigners and <b>scientists</b> <b>in</b> Australia emphasised claims that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that uranium mining itself could become {{a significant source of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Anti-nuclear campaigns were given added impetus by public concern about the sites for possible reactors: fears exploited by anti-nuclear power political parties in the lead-up to a national election in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by <b>scientists</b> <b>in</b> the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rise}} of {{classical}} genetics, many biologists—including {{a new wave of}} physical <b>scientists</b> <b>in</b> biology—pursued the question of the gene and its physical nature. Warren Weaver—head of the science division of the Rockefeller Foundation—issued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term molecular biology for this approach in 1938; many of the significant biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E

5|$|In 1670, Gabriel Mouton, a French abbot and astronomer, {{published}} the book Observationes diametrorum solis et lunae apparentium {{in which he}} proposed a decimal system of measurement of length for use by <b>scientists</b> <b>in</b> international communication, {{to be based on}} the dimensions of the Earth. The milliare would be defined as a minute of arc along a meridian and would be divided into 10 centuria, the centuria into 10 decuria and so on, successive units being the virga, virgula, decima, centesima, and the millesima. Mouton used Riccioli's estimate that one degree of arc was 321,185 Bolognese feet, and his own experiments showed that a pendulum of length one virgula would beat 3959.2 times in half an hour. Current pendulum theory shows that such a pendulum would have had an equivalent length of 205.6mm – using today's knowledge of the size of the earth, the virgula would have been approximately 185.2mm. He believed that with this information <b>scientists</b> <b>in</b> a foreign country would be able to construct a copy of the virgula for their own use.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 72 {{percent of}} Christian <b>Scientists</b> <b>in</b> the United States were female, against 49 {{percent of the}} population. The church was {{attractive}} to women because it offered professional opportunities when {{it was difficult for}} women to find work outside the home. As Christian Scientists they could become practitioners after just 12 lessons. Of the 14 practitioners listed in the first edition of the Christian Science Journal, 12 were women.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, <b>scientists</b> <b>in</b> Australia {{successfully}} implanted a Poitou donkey embryo {{created by}} artificial insemination {{in the womb}} of a Standardbred mare. Worries that joint problems might prevent a healthy pregnancy in the foal's biological mother led to the initiative. The resultant foal became one of three Poitou donkeys in Australia. The procedure was unusual because {{it is often difficult}} for members of one Equus species to accept implanted embryos from another species in the same genus.|$|E

5|$|One {{danger of}} {{attempting}} to consume hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms, especially for novice mushroom hunters, {{is the possibility of}} misidentification with toxic species. In one noted case, an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous Cortinarius rubellus for P.semilanceata. As a result, he suffered end-stage renal failure, and required a kidney transplant. In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. A polymerase chain reaction-based test to specifically identity P.semilanceata was reported by Polish <b>scientists</b> <b>in</b> 2007.|$|E
