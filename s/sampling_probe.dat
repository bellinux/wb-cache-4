These criteria address the capability of the <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> to extract a sample that is representative of the effluent stream. The tests conducted by PNNL during July 2010 on the HFEF system are described in this report. The <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> location is approximately 20 feet {{from the base of the}} stack. The stack base is in the second floor of the HFEF, and has a building ventilation stream (limited potential radioactive effluent) as well as a process stream (potential radioactive effluent, but HEPA-filtered) that feeds into it. The tests conducted on the duct indicate that the process stream is insufficiently mixed with the building ventilation stream. As a result, the air <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> location does not meet the criteria of the N 13. 1 - 1999 standard. The series of tests consists of various measurements taken over a grid of points in the duct cross section at the proposed sampling-probe location. The results of the test series on the HFEF exhaust duct as it relates to the criteria from ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999 are desribed in this report. Based on these tests, the location of the air <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> does not meet the requirements of the ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999 standard, and modifications must be made to either the HVAC system or the air <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> for compliance.

Graphite <b>sample</b> <b>probes</b> {{in the form}} of a cup and a rod (with or without undercut) were used. Molybdenum rods were also used for comparison. A dark central channel is created in the plasma when a <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> is inserted. The diameter of the central channel correlates with the diameter of the <b>sample</b> <b>probe.</b> In addition, the plasma excitation conditions were monitored using repetitive laser sampling to introduce a steady flow of Zn or Fe particles into the ICP.

The temperature and electron number density of the plasma decreased when a <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> was inserted. The degree of changes in the plasma conditions depends on the diameter of the <b>sample</b> <b>probes,</b> regardless of the form and material of the probe.

25|$|How {{the sample}} and matrix is {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well. The dried drop method is the simplest of deposition methods. The matrix and sample solution are mixed together and then a small drop of the mixture is placed on the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> surface and allowed to dry, thus crystallizing. The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of the sample followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing the sample directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. The sample solution is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating the sample into the top layer of matrix as the sample solution evaporates. An addition concern when depositing the sample {{on the surface of the}} probe is the solubility of the sample in the matrix. If the sample is insoluble in the matrix, additional methods must be employed. A method used in this case involves mechanical grinding and mixing of solid sample and solid matrix crystals.

40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been recently received {{on the impact of}} aircraft-produced aerosols upon the global climate. Sampling particles directly from jet engines has been performed by different research groups in the U. S. and Europe. However, a large variation has been observed among published data on the conversion efficiency and emission indexes of jet engines. The variation results surely from the differences in test engine types, engine operation conditions, and environmental conditions. The other factor that could result in the observed variation is the performance of sampling probes used. Unfortunately, it is often neglected in the jet engine community. Particle losses during the sampling, transport, and dilution processes are often not discussed/considered in literatures. To address this issue, we evaluated the performance of one <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> by challenging it with monodisperse particles. A significant performance difference was observed on the <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> evaluated under different temperature conditions. Thermophoretic effect, nonisokinetic sampling and turbulence loss contribute to the loss of particles in sampling probes.

40|$|The {{appearance}} time of an analyte {{relative to}} {{the timing of the}} <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> insertion is an important factor that determines the integrated intensity and precision of direct sample insertion inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. The ICP background drops significantly with the insertion of a <b>sample</b> <b>probe.</b> Matrix effects can be severe if the the analyte appearance times are shifted {{relative to the}} background drop. In this study, matrix effects of NaCl on the temporal emission profiles and integrated emission intensities of Zn I and Zn II were shown to relate to the appearance time of the analyte. The peak maxima of the temporal profiles of Zn I and Zn II emissions were displaced by about 0. 2 s in an aqueous matrix, but the maxima coincided in NaCl matrices. In addition, integrated emission intensities of the more difficult to excite Zn II species increased with an earlier appearance time. The changes in peak profiles and relative intensities are due to redistribution in the proportion of Zn atoms and Zn ions in the vaporized Zn population. The effects of the appearance time of Zn were further demonstrated using different <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> insertion speeds to change the appearance time of the analyte relative to the background drop. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|The {{concentration}} of {{salt in the}} sample is a factor {{that needs to be}} considered when preparing a MALDI sample as well. Salts can aid a MALDI spectra by preventing aggregation or precipitation while stabilizing the sample. However, interfering signals can be observed due to side reactions of the matrix with the sample, such {{as in the case of}} the matrix interacting with alkali metal ions which can impair the analysis of the spectra. Typically the amount of salt in the matrix only becomes a problem in very high concentrations, such as 1 molar. The problem of having too high a {{concentration of}} salt in the sample can be solved by first running the solution through liquid chromatography to help purify the sample, but this method is time consuming and results in the loss of some of the sample to be analyzed. Another method is focused on purification once the sample solution is deposited onto the <b>sample</b> <b>probe.</b> Many <b>sample</b> <b>probes</b> can be designed to have a membrane on the surface that can selectively bind the sample in question to the probe surface. The surface can then be rinsed off to remove all unnecessary salts or background molecules. The matrix of appropriate salt concentration can then be deposited directly onto the <b>sample</b> on the <b>probe</b> surface and crystallized there. Despite these negative effects of salt concentration, a separate desalting step is usually not necessary in the case of proteins, because the selection of appropriate buffer salts prevents the occurrence of this problem.How the sample and matrix is deposited on the surface of the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well.

40|$|Tests were {{performed}} to assess the suitability of {{the location of the}} air <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> on the 296 -S- 21 stack according to the criteria of ANSI N 13. 1 - 1999, Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory conducted most tests on a 3. 67 : 1 scale model of the stack. CH 2 MHill also performed some limited confirmatory tests on the actual stack. The tests assessed the capability of the air-monitoring probe to extract a sample representative of the effluent stream. The tests were conducted for the practical combinations of operating fans and addressed: (1) Angular Flow [...] The purpose is to determine whether the velocity vector is aligned with the sampling nozzle. The average yaw angle relative to the nozzle axis should not be more than 20. The measured values ranged from 5 to 11 degrees on the scale model and 10 to 12 degrees on the actual stack. (2) Uniform Air Velocity [...] The gas momentum across the stack cross section where the sample is extracted should be well mixed or uniform. The uniformity is expressed as the variability of the measurements about the mean, the coefficient of variance (COV). The lower the COV value, the more uniform the velocity. The acceptance criterion is that the COV of the air velocity must be ? 20 % across the center two-thirds of the area of the stack. At the location simulating the <b>sampling</b> <b>probe,</b> the measured values ranged form 4 to 11 %, which are within the criterion. To confirm the validity of the scale model results, air velocity uniformity measurements were made both on the actual stack and on the scale model at the test ports 1. 5 stack diameters upstream of the <b>sampling</b> <b>probe.</b> The results ranged from 6 to 8 % COV on the actual stack and 10 to 13 % COV on the scale model. The average difference for the eight runs was 4. 8 % COV, which is within the validation criterion. The fact that the scale model results were slightly higher than the actual stack suggests that the other test results on the scale model are conservative relative to the actual stack. (3) Uniform Concentration of Tracer Gases [...] A uniform contaminant concentration in the sampling plane enables the extraction of samples that represent the true concentration. This was first tested using a tracer gas to represent gaseous effluents. The fan is a good mixer, so injecting the tracer downstream of the fans provides worst-case results. The acceptance criteria are that (1) the COV of the measured tracer gas concentration is ? 20 % across the center two-thirds of the sampling plane and (2) at no point in the sampling plane does the concentration vary from the mean by > 30 %. The results on the scale model at the point simulating the <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> ranged from 0. 3 to 6 %COV, and the maximum single point deviation from the mean was - 10 %. (4) Uniform Concentration of Tracer Particles [...] Uniformity in contaminant concentration at the <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> was further demonstrated using tracer particles large enough to exhibit inertial effects. Particles of 10 -?m aerodynamic diameter were used. The acceptance criterion is that the COV of particle concentration is ? 20 % across the center two-thirds of the sampling plane. The scale model results ranged form 2 to 9 %. Based on these tests, the location of the air <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> on the 296 -S- 21 stack meets the requirements of the ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999 standard...|$|E

40|$|Insertion of a <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> {{into the}} {{inductively coupled plasma}} (ICP) for direct sample {{insertion}} (DSI) could change the plasma excitation conditions. In this study, a novel setup is proposed for {{the investigation of the}} probe effects. A hollow graphite tube was used as a stand-in for the DSI <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> to exert probe effects on the plasma. Laser-ablated testing elements (Fe, Zn and Mg) were introduced separately into the central channel of the plasma via the hollow graphite tube for measurement of plasma excitation temperature and electron number density. A relatively low Ar carrier gas flow rate (0. 42 L min- 1) was used to minimize perturbation to the plasma due to the gas flow. The study shows that the extent of reduction in plasma excitation temperature and electron number density increases with probe insertion position at all observation heights. In addition, the probe effects strongly depend on the relative distance of the observation position to the tip of the probe. The probe effects are the strongest near the tip of the probe and reduce at observation positions further away from the tip. Signal-to-background ratios (SBR) of the testing elements also depend strongly on the probe insertion position and the relative distance of the observation position to the tip of the probe. The SBR peaks at 5 - 10 mm above the tip of the <b>sample</b> <b>probe.</b> The vertical profile of SBR depends on analyte diffusion in the plasma and the plasma excitation conditions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
