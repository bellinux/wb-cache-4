25|$|Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann {{developed}} the patch clamp {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s. This discovery {{made it possible to}} record the currents of <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> channel molecules for the first time, which improved understanding of the involvement of channels in fundamental cell processes such as action potentials and nerve activity. Neher and Sakmann received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1991 for this work.|$|E
25|$|Such a test as {{described}} by R. Plaga would mean that energy transfer is possible between parallel worlds. This does not violate the fundamental principles of physics because these require energy conservation only for the whole universe {{and not for the}} single parallel branches. Neither the excitation of the <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> (which is a degree of freedom of the proposed system) leads to decoherence, something which is proven by Welcher Weg detectors which can excite atoms without momentum transfer (which causes the loss of coherence).|$|E
25|$|In the inside-out method, a {{patch of}} the {{membrane}} {{is attached to the}} patch pipette, detached {{from the rest of the}} cell, and the cytosolic surface of the membrane is exposed to the external media, or bath. One advantage of this method is that the experimenter has access to the intracellular surface of the membrane via the bath and can change the chemical composition of what the surface of the membrane is exposed to. This is useful when an experimenter wishes to manipulate the environment at the intracellular surface of <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> channels. For example, channels that are activated by intracellular ligands can then be studied through a range of ligand concentrations.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a scanning probe instrument which integrates ion beams with the imaging and alignment {{function of a}} piezo-resistive scanning probe in high vacuum. The beam passes through several apertures and is finally collimated by {{a hole in the}} cantilever of the scanning probe. The ion beam spot size is limited {{by the size of the}} last aperture. Highly charged ions are used to show hits of <b>single</b> <b>ions</b> in resist, and we discuss the issues for implantation of <b>single</b> <b>ions...</b>|$|R
50|$|Nuclear fusion using ion {{clusters}} can impact {{far more}} atoms than <b>single</b> <b>ions</b> in one hit. This concept is called cluster ion fusion (CIF). Lithium deuteride (LiD) {{is a potential}} starter material for generating the ions.|$|R

Instead, a mean activity coefficient, [...] is defined. For example, with the electrolyte NaCl ...|$|R
500|$|Electrical {{measurements}} are a straightforward way to characterize an important {{function of a}} bilayer: its ability to segregate and prevent the flow of ions in solution. By applying a voltage across the bilayer and measuring the resulting current, {{the resistance of the}} bilayer is determined. This resistance is typically quite high (108 Ohm-cm2 or more) [...] since the hydrophobic core is impermeable to charged species. The presence of even a few nanometer-scale holes results in a dramatic increase in current. The sensitivity of this system is such that even the activity of <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> channels can be resolved.|$|E
2500|$|While glass {{micropipette}} electrodes {{measure the}} sum of the currents passing through many ion channels, studying the electrical properties of a <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> channel became possible in the 1970s with the development of the patch clamp by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann. [...] For this they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1991. Patch-clamping verified that ionic channels have discrete states of conductance, such as open, closed and inactivated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{course of}} the action {{potential}} is determined by two coupled effects. First, voltage-sensitive ion channels open and close in response {{to changes in the}} membrane voltage Vm. This changes the membrane's permeability to those ions. [...] Second, according to the Goldman equation, this change in permeability changes in the equilibrium potential Em, and, thus, the membrane voltage Vm. [...] Thus, the membrane potential affects the permeability, which then further affects the membrane potential. This sets up the possibility for positive feedback, which is {{a key part of the}} rising phase of the action potential. A complicating factor is that a <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> channel may have multiple internal [...] "gates" [...] that respond to changes in Vm in opposite ways, or at different rates. [...] For example, although raising Vm [...] opens most gates in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel, it also closes the channel's [...] "inactivation gate", albeit more slowly. Hence, when Vm is raised suddenly, the sodium channels open initially, but then close due to the slower inactivation.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of single atoms in solids, with both optical and nuclear spin access is of particularly interest with applications ranging from nanoscale sensing to quantum computation. Here, we study the optical and spin properties of <b>single</b> praseodymium <b>ions</b> in an yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) crystal at cryogenic temperature. The single nuclear spin of <b>single</b> praseodymium <b>ions</b> is detected through a background-free optical upconverting readout technique. <b>Single</b> <b>ions</b> show stable photoluminescence (PLE) with spectrally resolved hyperfine splitting of the praseodymium ground state. Based on this measurement, optical Rabi and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements are performed {{to study the}} spin coherence properties. Our results reveal that the spin coherence time of single praseodymium nuclear spins {{is limited by the}} strong spin-phonon coupling at experimental temperature. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|A <b>single</b> laser-cooled indium <b>ion</b> is a {{promising}} candidate for an ultimate resolution optical time or frequency standard. It {{can be shown}} that <b>single</b> <b>ions</b> from group IIIA of the periodic table (indium, thallium, etc.) can have extremely small systematic errors. In addition to being free from Doppler, transit-time and collisional shifts, these ions are also quite insensitive to perturbations from ambient magnetic and electric fields (mainly due {{to the use of}} a J= 0 - 0 transition for spectroscopy). Of all group IIIA ions, indium seems to be the most practical, since it is heavy enough to have a tolerable intercombination cooling transition rate and (unlike thallium) has transitions which are easily accessible with frequency multiplied continuous-wave lasers. A <b>single</b> indium <b>ion</b> standard has a potential inaccuracy of one part in 10 (exp 18) for integration times of 10 (exp 6) seconds. We have made substantial progress during the grant period in constructing a frequency standard based upon a <b>single</b> indium <b>ion.</b> At the beginning of the grant period, <b>single</b> indium <b>ions</b> were being successfully trapped, but the lasers and optical systems were inadequate to achieve the desired goal. We have considerably improved the stability of the dye laser used to cool the ions and locked it to a molecular resonance line, making it possible to observe stable cooling-line fluorescence from a <b>single</b> indium <b>ion</b> for reasonable periods of time, as required by the demands of precision spectroscopy. We have substantially improved the single-ion fluorescence signal with significant benefits for the detection efficiency of forbidden transitions using the 'shelving' technique. Finally, we have constructed a compact, efficient UV 'clock' laser and observed 'clock' transitions in <b>single</b> indium <b>ions</b> using this laser system. We will elaborate on these accomplishments...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a novel single-photon source using a <b>single</b> calcium <b>ion</b> trapped between the end facets of two optical fibers. The optical fibers act as {{photonic}} channels, and in addition their metallic jackets provide a trapping electric field for the ion. Our system successfully combines a stable single-atom emitter with fiber optics, demonstrating remarkable compactness and scalability. In consequence, it is very well suited for use in quantum networks, where <b>single</b> <b>ions</b> interface with <b>single</b> photons traveling through optical fibers. We have demonstrated the non-classical character of the photons generated by this efficient source in continuous as well as pulsed mode...|$|R
6000|$|... 826. i. A <b>single</b> <b>ion,</b> i.e. one not in {{combination}} with another, will have no tendency to pass to either of the electrodes, and will be perfectly indifferent to the passing current, unless it be itself a compound of more elementary ions, and so subject to actual decomposition. Upon this fact is founded much of the proof adduced in favour of the new theory of electro-chemical decomposition, which I put forth in a former series of these Researches (518. &c.).|$|E
50|$|The {{prevailing}} {{view that}} <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> activity coefficients are unmeasurable independently, {{or perhaps even}} physically meaningless, {{has its roots in}} the work of Guggenheim in the late 1920s. However, chemists have never been able to give up the idea of <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> activities, and by implication <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> activity coefficients. For example, pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity. If the prevailing view on the physical meaning and measurability of <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> activities is correct then defining pH as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity places the quantity squarely in the unmeasurable category. Recognizing this logical difficulty, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) states that the activity-based definition of pH is a notional definition only. Despite the prevailing negative view on the measurability of <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> coefficients, the concept of <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> activities continues to be discussed in the literature, and at least one author presents a definition of <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> activity in terms of purely thermodynamic quantities and proposes a method of measuring <b>single</b> <b>ion</b> activity coefficients based on purely thermodynamic processes.|$|E
