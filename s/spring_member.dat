40|$|Fracture-lining {{minerals}} from {{drill core}} in the Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>Member</b> of the Paintbrush Tuff and the tuff of Calico Hills from water well J- 13 were studied {{to identify the}} differences between these minerals and those seen in drill core USW G- 4. In USW G- 4 the static water level (SWL) occurs below the tuff of Calico Hills, but in J- 13 the water table is fairly high in the Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>Member.</b> There are some significant differences in fracture minerals between these two holes. In USW G- 4 mordenite is a common fracture-lining mineral in the Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>Member,</b> increasing in abundance with depth. Euhedral heulandite > 0. 1 mm in length occurs in fractures for about 20 m above the lower vitrophyre. In J- 13, where the same stratigraphic intervals are below the water table, mordenite is uncommon and euhedral heulandite is not seen. The most abundant fracture coating in the Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>Member</b> in J- 13 is drusy quartz, which is totally absent in this interval in USW G- 4. Though similar in appearance, the coatings in the vitrophyre have different mineralogy in the two holes. In USW G- 4 the coatings are extremely fine grained heulandite and smectite. In J- 13 the coatings are fine-grained heulandite, chabazite, and alkali feldspar. Chabazite has not been identified from any other hole in the Yucca Mountain area. Fractures in the tuff of Calico Hills have similar coatings in core from both holes. In J- 13, as in USW G- 4, the tuff matrix of the Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>Member</b> is welded and devitrified {{and that of the}} tuff of Calico Hills is zeolitic. 11 refs., 10 figs., 5 tabs...|$|E

Permeability measurements made on samples of the Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>Member</b> of the Paintbrush Tuff at room-temperature and in a temperature gradient show that the initially high (3 - 65 {mu}da) permeabilities are little affected by heating to at least 150 {sup 0 }C. These permeability relationships are favvorable for the disposal of nuclear waste in this stuff in an unsaturated zone at the Nevada Test Site.

40|$|The Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>Member</b> of the Paintbrush Tuff and the Lithic-rich tuff and two Tertiary {{volcanic}} {{units that}} occur in cores from drill holes UE 25 a- 1 and USW-G 1 at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Recently they have been suggested as possibly suitable for the permanent storage of high-level radioactive waste. Earlier petrologic characterization of these units is augmented here. The Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>Member</b> (approximately 350 m thick) has two compound cooling units. The upper, thinner unit is densely welded to vitrophyric. The lower unit ranges from nonwelded to vitrophyric, and its nonwelded base is extensively zeolitized to clinoptilolite and mordenite. Heulandite occurs as fracture fill in the overlying vitrophyric part, but zeolites are absent above that vitrophyre. Here primary devitrification plus vapor-phase crystallization dominate the mineralogy. Vapor-phase effects are especially prominent between the two vitrophyres in both cores and include numerous large lithophysal cavities throughout most of this moderately to densely welded tuff. The Lithic-rich tuff extends from 1203 to 1506 m in the USW-G 1 drill core. It is nonwelded to partly welded but is well indurated due to pervasive intergrowths of authigenic minerals. These phases are analcime, albite, alkali feldspar, sericite, chlorite and quartz. The transition from analcime to secondary albite corresponds to Iijima`s zeolite Zone IV boundary, and this boundary appears in USW-G 1 at 1326 m. However, analcime remains as a prominent phase {{through most of the}} Lithic-rich tuff. Further work is necessary to assess the suitability of either of these horizons for a waste repository. In the Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>Member,</b> both mechanical and hydrologic properties of thick lithophysal zone must be studied, as well as the complete sequence of fracture fill. For both units, zeolite and clay mineral stabilities need to be investigated...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{previously}} completed vertical outcrop sampling transacts are summarized {{with respect to}} planning downhole sampling. The summary includes statistical descriptions and descriptions of the spatial variability of the sampled parameters. Descriptions are made on each individual transect, each thermal/mechanical unit and each previously defined geohydrologic unit. Correlations between parameters indicate that saturated hydraulic conductivity is not globally correlated to porosity. The correlation between porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity is both spatially and lithologically dependent. Currently, {{there are not enough}} saturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity data to define relationships between these properties and porosity on a unit by unit basis. Also, the Prow Pass member of the Crater Flat Tuff and stratigraphically lower units have gone essentially unsampled in these outcrop transacts. The vertical correlation length for hydrologic properties is not constant across the area of the transacts. The average sample spacing within the transacts ranges from 1. 25 to 2. 1 meters. It appears that, {{with the exception of the}} Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>member</b> units, a comparable sample spacing will give adequate results in the downhole sampling campaign even with the nonstationarity of the vertical correlation. The properties within the thermal/mechanical units and geohydrologic units of the Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>member</b> appear to have a spatial correlation range less than or equal to the current sample spacing within these units. For the downhole sampling, a sample spacing of less than 1. 0 meters may be necessary within these units...|$|E
