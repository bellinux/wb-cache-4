40|$|Converging {{evidence}} suggests that bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with white matter (WM) abnormalities. Meta-analyses of voxel based morphometry (VBM) data is commonly performed using published coordinates, however this method is limited since it ignores non-significant data. Obtaining statistical maps from studies (T-maps) as well as raw MRI datasets increases accuracy and allows for a comprehensive analysis of clinical variables. We obtained coordinate data (5 -studies), T-Maps (12 -studies, including unpublished data) and raw MRI datasets (5 -studies) and analysed the 24 studies using <b>Seed-based</b> <b>d</b> <b>Mapping</b> (<b>SDM).</b> A VBM analysis was conducted to verify the results in an independent sample. The meta-analysis revealed decreased WM volume in the posterior corpus callosum extending to WM in the posterior cingulate cortex. This region was significantly reduced in volume in BD patients in the independent dataset (p= 0. 003) {{but there was no}} association with clinical variables. We identified a robust WM volume abnormality in BD patients that may represent a trait marker of the disease and used a novel methodology to validate the findings. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Background Converging {{evidence}} {{demonstrates the}} important role of the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin (OT) in human behaviour and cognition. Intranasal OT administration has been shown to improve several aspects of social communication, such as the theory of mind performance and gaze to the eye region, and reduce anxiety and related negative cognitive appraisals. While this early research has demonstrated the potential for intranasal OT to treat psychiatric illnesses characterized by social impairments, the neurobiological mechanisms are not well known. Researchers have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural correlates of OT response; however, results have been variable and moderating factors are poorly understood. The aim of this meta-analysis is to synthesize data examining the impact of intranasal OT administration on neural activity. Methods/design Studies that report fMRI data after intranasal OT administration will be identified. PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases will be searched as well as the citation lists of retrieved articles. Eligible articles written in English from 2005 onwards will be included in the meta-analysis, and corresponding authors of these papers will be invited to contribute t-maps. Data will be collected from eligible studies for synthesis using <b>Seed-based</b> <b>d</b> <b>Mapping</b> (<b>SDM)</b> or Multi-Level Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA), depending on the number of usable t-maps received. Additionally, publication bias and risk of bias will be assessed. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will be the first pre-registered synthesis of data to identify the neural correlates of OT nasal spray response. The identification of brain regions underlying OT’s observed effects will help guide future research and better identify treatment targets.

Aims: To identify transdiagnostic biomarkers of reduced WM by meta-analysis of findings across multiple EDs. MethodWeb of Science was searched systematically for studies of whole brain analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) in adults with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder compared with a healthy control (HC) group. Peak MNI coordinates were extracted from 37 studies of voxel-based analysis (892 HC and 962 with ED) and meta-analyzed using <b>seed-based</b> <b>d</b> <b>Mapping</b> (<b>SDM)</b> Version 4. 31. Separate meta-analyses were also conducted for each disorder. ResultsIn the transdiagnostic meta-analysis, reduced FA was identified in ED studies compared to HCs in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, forceps minor, uncinate fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, superior corona radiata, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, and cerebellum. Disorder-specific meta-analyses revealed the OCD group had the most similarities in reduced FA to other EDs, with every cluster of reduced FA overlapping {{with at least one}} other diagnosis. The PTSD group was the most distinct, with no clusters of reduced FA overlapping with any other diagnosis. The BD group were the only disorder to show increased FA in any region, and showed a more bilateral pattern of WM changes, compared to the other groups which tended to demonstrate a left lateralized pattern of FA reductions. ConclusionsDistinct diagnostic categories of ED show commonalities in WM tracts with reduced FA when compared to HC, which links brain networks involved in cognitive and affective processing.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Previous {{studies of}} voxel-based morphometry (VBM) {{have found that}} {{patients}} with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) exhibit gray matter alterations, but these findings are inconsistent and have not been quantitatively reviewed. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to conduct a quantitative meta-analysis of VBM studies of patients with T 2 DM. Materials and Methods: The <b>seed-based</b> <b>d</b> <b>mapping</b> method was applied to quantitatively estimate the regional gray matter abnormalities in T 2 DM patients. We also used meta-regression to explore the effects of some demographics and clinical characteristics. Results: Seven studies, with 8 datasets comprising 530 participants with T 2 DM and 549 non-T 2 DM controls, were included. The pooled and subgroup meta-analyses found that T 2 DM patients showed robustly reduced gray matter in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, medial superior frontal gyrus, insula, median cingulate cortex, precuneus cortex and the left lentiform nucleus extending into the parahippocampus. The meta-regression also found that the percentage of female patients with T 2 DM was negatively associated with gray matter in the right superior temporal gyrus and illness duration was negatively associated with gray matter in the right middle temporal gyrus. Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicates that T 2 DM patients have significantly and robustly reduced gray matter mainly in the cortical-striatal-limbic networks, which are associated with human cognition. Thereby implicating this finding in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in T 2 DM patients...|$|R
40|$|Importance: Disrupted reward processing, mainly {{driven by}} striatal dysfunction, {{is a key}} {{characteristic}} of addictive behaviors. However, {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) studies have reported conflicting results, with both hypoactivations and hyperactivations during anticipation and outcome notification of monetary rewards in addiction. Objective: To determine the nature and direction of reward-processing disruptions during anticipation and outcome notification of monetary rewards in individuals with addiction using image-based meta-analyses of fMRI studies. Data Sources:  Relevant publications were identified searching PubMed (inclusion until March 2015) using the following terms: reward, fMRI, substance use, cocaine, cannabis, opiates, alcohol, nicotine, smokers, gambling, gamblers, gaming, and gamers. Authors of included articles were contacted to obtain statistical fMRI maps. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria: reward task involving monetary reward anticipation and/or outcome; participants showing addictive behaviors; and healthy control group. Exclusion criteria: participants aged younger than 18 years; recreational substance use or gambling; participants at risk for addictive behaviors; and studies using the same patient data as other included studies. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Study procedures were conducted in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Using <b>Seed-based</b> <b>d</b> <b>Mapping</b> software, meta-analyses were performed using random-effect nonparametric statistics with group whole brain T-maps from individual studies as input. Analyses were performed across all addictions and for substance and gambling addictions separately. Main Outcomes and Measures: Group differences (individuals with addiction vs control individuals) in reward-related brain activation during reward anticipation and outcome using fMRI (planned before data collection). Results: Twenty-five studies were included in the meta-analysis, representing 643 individuals with addictive behaviors and 609 healthy control individuals. During reward anticipation, individuals with substance and gambling addictions showed decreased striatal activation compared with healthy control individuals. During reward outcome, individuals with substance addiction showed increased activation in the ventral striatum, whereas individuals with gambling addiction showed decreased activation in the dorsal striatum compared with healthy control individuals. Conclusions and Relevance: Striatal hypoactivation in individuals with addiction during reward anticipation and in individuals with gambling addiction during reward outcome is in line with the reward-deficiency theory of addiction. However, the combination of hypoactivation during reward anticipation and hyperactivation during reward outcome in the striatum of individuals with substance addiction may be explained using learning-deficit theory...|$|R

Further, in determining these multidirectional z-SDM and xy-SDM profiles, background noise reduction and automatic peak identification algorithms are adapted to attain increased accuracy and is shown to be particularly effective in cases where crystal structure is present but poorly resolved.

Secondly, generate the Spherical Depth <b>Map</b> (<b>SDM)</b> of face shape which is normalized roughly to a similar pose. Finally, accurately localize the nose tip using multiresolution SDM by a coarse-to-fine method.
